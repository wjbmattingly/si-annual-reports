GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The United States National Museum had its origin in the act of
Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the
latter, and provided that—

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their recep-
tion, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may
be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when-
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the
museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise,
the Regents shal! cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged.

The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund
amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that
the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 1846 probably not
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer-
ica had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of
Congress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a build-
ing and for the care of the collections which would be turned over
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The
Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate
with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Govern-
ment collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Con-
eress began to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose.
So inadequate, however, were the sums voted that for many years the
slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure
the maintenance of what was then justly called the ‘Smithsonian
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a
considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property of
the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the offi-
cials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense.

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Insti-
tution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but
‘aluable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who
was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute and a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London. .

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired
by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring
Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Goy-
ernment collections retained in Washington. . Another important serv-
ice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has
said, in the direction of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the
establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the
United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which
came practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material
directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held
there until 1883.

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and
through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F.
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850.
The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish-
ment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations
were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other
branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson’s Bay Com-
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by
these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the
extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other
bureaus of the Government.

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in
January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important
functions:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution,
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to ail departments of
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science,
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn-
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge. @

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day.

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab-
lished, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the pro-
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be
derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880:

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history,
archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National
Museum.

Although the name ‘* National Museum” was sometimes used in the
earlier reportsof the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any
of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition
of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the
people of the United States the existence of national collections at

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting
museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of col-
lege or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period: After

persons and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early eree

new and separate building, devoted entirely to museum
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the
fundamental act. under the authority of the Regents of the Smithso-
nian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio
the keeper—a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform
policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes,
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific bureaus at Wash-
ington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and

tion of a

‘aring for the national collections.

The scope of the National Museum as defined by law comprises
practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for, making pur-
chases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character
of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations,
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology and
archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. A fair beginning has been
made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial arts
and American history, and scarcely more is required to place these
two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater
part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which
must sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government.

The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, com-
prising the bulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of
scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to
which students are freely admitted; the other, selected with regard to
their general educational yalue and public interest, and accompanied
by descriptive labels, being displayed in glass-covered cases in the
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as
opportunity offers. Paper's descriptive of the collections, both tech-
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the
extent of three or more volumes yearly, and, finally, the Museum
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

subjects with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned, the
correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its heaviest
tasks.

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Dr. Goode,
may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur-
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research.
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except
as a foundation for scientific description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the
‘‘National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’? to 1876. During this period the Museum became
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col-
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable,
made to serve an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research,
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three
ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

In the same connection, Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects
of the Museum in the following concise manner:

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD.

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal
and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institu-
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi-
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small
appropriation in recent years has permitted of some purchases to
supply desiderata.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized
as follows:

|. The explorations und
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con-
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments,
and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward
the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.

9, The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from
1838 to 1842, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine

carried on more or less directly under the

waters.

2 The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and
consular service abroad.

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U.S. Army; and the activi-
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army
stationed in remote regions.

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. 5. Fish
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches
of the Government.

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi-
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia in 1876, the International Fisheries Exhibitions at Berlin
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at
the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World’s
Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the
collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign goy-
ernments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of
numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and
America.

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi-
viduals.

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building,
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was
about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the new
building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

accessions received from Philadelphia and from other sources, the
number had grown to 1,471,000. At the close of the year covered by
this report the total number of recorded specimens was 5,654,864.

While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec-
tions, when it is considered that by 1885 all of the space in both build-
ings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci-
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe
structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great
intrinsic and scientific value to fill an additional building as large as
that now occupied by the main collections.

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH.

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete
in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, is given to all
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor-
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited
every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction,
coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign
countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions
having the means of providing for its safe-keeping, when required in
the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection
with their own collections.

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most impera-
tive duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National Museum,
its members find comparatively little time during office hours for
advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for such
work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identify
and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance with the
latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff does pro-
duce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the collec-
tions, which together constitute an important contribution to scientific
literature.

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con-
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose
results the Museum shares.
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the
Geological Survey, the Fish C ommission, the Department of Agricul-
ture. and other branches of the Government to the custody of the
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car-
ried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased.

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of
the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate
in the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi-
tions. in connection with which special researches may be carried on,
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new aa

valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it
occurred in nature. Dy bas

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM.

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly:
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the
general uilte The principal difficulty incident to the proper instal-
lation of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit,
the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory
development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in
this respect gi0w worse instead of better through the increased crowd-
ing of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in
the methods of display, in the character of individual and group
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional
progress has been made.

Two years ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for
public use were then for the first time permanently open, aioe none
were above addition or improyement, while in some the arrangement
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work-
rooms.

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of
Doctor Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better
understanding of the public needs. He labored earnestly and con-
sclentiously to make this a museum for as well as of the people, and
the plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of
his making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11

maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the
interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of
nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his sur-
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some
definite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Doctor Goode’s
labors in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to
the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official
connection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quar-
ter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums
of Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities
for observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died,
none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy
of being followed.

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col-
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have
already been given away.

Scarcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi-
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one
another so closely and have required such extensive preparations as
to interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one,
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washing-
ton, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum
metheds known to the people of the United States and stimulating
the growth of museums in many quarters.

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the
publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way, as
belonging to its educational side, being the medium through which
the nature and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual
Report, first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report
in 1884, and now in its twentieth volume, consists, besides the admin-
istrative part, mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of
the collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively
technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the
larger and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings
twenty-four complete volumes have been issued, and of the Bulletins
fifty-two numbers.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

AN ADDITIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.

For over two decades a few paragraphs in this report have been
annually devoted to an account of the crowded and unsafe condition
of the national collections, and the consequent impossibility of further
complying with the law for their proper classification, arrangement, and
eare. Fortunately these conditions are soon to be remedied through
the erection of an additional building, having a capacity far exceeding
that of the existing structures combined, with exhibition halls to the
extent of nearly 5 acres, and facilities for all kinds of museum work.

In the last report it was announced that Congress had authorized
the preparation of plans for this new building, which was to be con-
structed of brick and terra cotta at a limit of cost of $1,500,000, and
to occupy a site on the north side of the Mall opposite the Smith-
sonian Institution. Such a building, though large enough to relieve
the immediate demands for additional space, would provide very
inadequately for the growth of the collections, and the material named
for the fronts was not considered entirely suitable for a structure of
the character proposed. Nearly a year was occupied in examining
into the requirements of the collections and in studying the principal
features of other museums. During the winter of 1902-3, a series
of tentative plans was prepared, and accompanied by a supplementary
report by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was submitted
to a special committee consisting of the Congressional Regents, ** to
represent to Congress the pressing needs of additional room for the
proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum.”
On January 23, 1903, the same papers were transmitted to Congress
and printed as Document 314 of the House of Representatives.

The plans provided for a large rectangular building, four stories
high including the basement, which was to be in all essential features
the equivalent of a story, well lighted and entirely serviceable for
museum purposes. The cost of the whole building, constructed of
brick and terra cotta, was estimated at $3,000,000, but one-half of the
structure, in symmetrical form, could be built for $1,500,000, thus
meeting the requirements of the act of 1902. The special committee
of the Regents above mentioned adopted the report of the Secretary,
though urging the larger building, in the following resolution:

That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress Plan
B for a new National Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount men-
tioned; but, in the judgment of the committee, the larger plan, A, is believed to be
the one which should be adopted, and we therefore ask that Congress shall make

the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan.

Hearings followed before the Committees on Appropriations of
both the House and Senate, and a plea was made for the use of granite
instead of brick and terra cotta. The House took no action, but a bill
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

for the erection of the entire building in granite, at a limiting cost of
$3,500,000, was adopted by the Senate, and the measure in this shape
was finally agreed to in conference between the committees of the two
Houses. The bill as passed, being an item in the sundry civil act for
1904, was as fellows:

Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts, for
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on the north side of the Mall, between
Ninth and Twelfth streets, northwest, substantially in accordance with the Plan A,
prepared and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and
two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Said building complete, including
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three mil-
lion five hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is
hereby authorized to be entered into subject to appropriations to be made by Con-
gress. The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress, who shall make the contracts herein
authorized and disburse all appropriations made for the work, and shall receive as
full compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually
in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held on March 12, 1903, a
committee to represent the Board in connection with the work of con-
struction was designated by resolution as follows:

That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and the chair-
man of the executive committee, be authorized to represent the Board of Regents so
far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the con-

struction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in
the act making an appropriation for that purpose.

Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, of Washington, who made the ten-
tative plans, were selected as architects and before the close of the
fiscal year their part of the work was well under way. It is expected
that about four or five years will be required for the construction of
the building.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The Congressional appropriations for the maintenance of the National
Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, amounted to
$281,400, a decrease of $8,000 as compared with the previous year, the
changes being as follows: The bill for 1902 contained three specific
appropriations, one of $5,000 for the construction of two galleries, one
of $5,000 for electrical installation, and one of $12,500 for new boilers,
while the appropriations for 1903 comprised a new item of $7,000 for
preparing and printing the Contributions from the U. 5. National
Herbarium, heretofore published by the Department of Agriculture,
$5,000 for the preparation of plans for an additional Museum building,
and an increase of $2,500 in the appropriation for furniture and
fixtures.

The following tables show the expenditures during the year 1902-3
under each item of the appropriations for the past two years:

BUILDINGS.

At its last session, ending March 4, 1903, Congress authorized, in
the sundry civil act for 1903-4, the construction of an additional fire-
proof building of granite for the National Museum, at a cost not to
exceed $3,500,000, and appropriated $250,000 for the requirements of
the first year. The preparation of the final plans was begun near
the close of the fiscal year, and the work will be pushed as rapidly as
possible.

The roofs on the several sections of the Museum building have con-
tinued to give trouble, as new leaks develop during every heavy rain
and snow storm. This is more especially the case with the slate coy-
erings over the main halls, but the tin roofs are also in bad condition
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a larg

and both demand constant attention and repair, at some expense.
Before many years a new roof will become absolutely necessary, but
in the meantime it is proposed, should the regular appropriations suf-
fice for the purpose, to gradually replace the slate coverings with bet-
ter material, as only in this manner can the more pressing difficulties
be even temporarily overcome.

The leaks which have occurred through many years, and the fre-
quent repairs to walls and ceilings, had so defaced the interior of the
greater part of the Museum building as to render it unsightly in the
extreme. At the beginning of the fiscal year it was decided to remedy
these conditions so far as possible by painting those parts of the build-
ing which required it, in accordance with a simple but artistic scheme
of color. The rotunda and main halls were first completed, and next
three of the courts, leaving only one of the latter to be done during
the current year. The ranges do not call for any changes in this
respect at present. With this improvement the building has now
been placed in a far more presentable condition than ever before.

Another improvement in the Museum building has been the arrange-
ment of inner screen doors at the eastern or freight entrance, so as to
close off from the public or exhibition halls the vestibule in which
packages are received. Some of the rooms over this same entrance,
used by the Division of Plants, have also been modified and enlarged.

The archeological hall in the Smithsonian building has been closed
to the public during nearly the entire year. In September, 1902, so
many large pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling that its condition was
declared unsafe, and though all of the loose plaster was subsequently
removed, yet the appearance of the hall does not justify its reopening
at present. It is expected, however, to make such temporary repairs
before the close of another year as will permit of its being again made
accessible.

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The number of accessions or separate lots of material received dur-
ing the year was 1,648, being 234 more than in 1902. They comprised
about 236,580 specimens of all kinds, bringing the total number of
specimens in the several departments of the Museum up to about
5,654,864. There were also received for identification 886 lots of speci-
mens, the most of which were returned to the senders with the infor-
mation requested.

The most constant and important sources of material are the national
surveys and explorations, whose collections are, by law, transferred
to the custody of the Museum as soon as the necessary studies upon
them have been completed. The bureaus which figure most promi-
nently in this work are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission,
the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Insects and Plants of the

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology of
the Smithsonian Institution, though valuable contributions are occa-
sionally obtained from other branches of the Government service, and
officers of the Army and Navy stationed in the new possessions have,
in their individual capacity, been rendering much assistance. A very
large share of the additions to the collections is, however, received
from private individuals and establishments through donation and
exchange, and the exhibition series derives many of its attractive
features from loans or deposits. Field collecting by members of. the
Museum staff is almost prohibited by the lack of funds, and the acqui-
sition of specimens by purchase is seriously restricted because of the
small amount appropriated for that purpose.

A complete list of the accessions for the year is given in Appendix
Il, and the important ones are described in the reports of the head
curators. Only some of the more noteworthy ones will, therefore, be
referred to in this connection.

The total number of specimens added in the Department of Anthro-
pology was 24,319, of which 16,181 specimens belonged in the Division
of Prehistoric Archeology, 4,547 in Ethnology, and 1,502 each in
History and the Graphic Arts. One of the most valuable acquisitions
consisted of material recently collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in
Sumatra and the Straits Settlements, and illustrated the native arts
and industries of a region but poorly represented in American museums.
The many objects, numbering over 1,500, secured in the Philippine
Islands by the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposi-
tion, have been turned over to the Museum by the Government Board.
This collection is of especial interest in that it furnishes much author-
itative information regarding the life and customs of the natives of
the largest of our new possessions. Dr. Frank Russell, formerly of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, secured important material from
the Pima Indians of southern Arizona, which, together with many
ethnological objects from other sources, have been transferred by the
Bureau to the custody of the Museum. Several collections made by
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United States Navy, illustrating the arts
of the Chilcat and other Alaskan tribes, have also been acquired.

An extremely noteworthy collection deposited in the Museum by
Mr. 5. 5. Howland, of Washington, D. C., consists of objects repre-
senting Buddhist religious art, such as bronze and wooden images of
Buddha and Buddhist saints, shrines, temple lamps, and sacred writ-
ings on palm leaves, and also of several oriental manuscripts in
Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Miss Eliza R. Scidmore, of
Washington, also deposited a number of examples of Buddhist and
Hindu religious art. Twenty-eight Jewish ceremonial objects from
North Africa were obtained from Mr. Kphraim Deinard, of Kearney,
New Jersey, one of the most interesting pieces being an ark of carved
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

wood, containing a parchment scroll of the Pentateuch. The Egyp-
tian exploration fund has presented some valuable Greco-Egyptian
papyri.

Among the accessions in the Division of Prehistoric Archeology
were a collection of implements and other objects obtained by Mr.
W. H. Holmes from near Kimmswick, Missouri, with the assistance
of Mr. Gerard Fowke, who also transmitted a number of hammer-
stones, flint nodules, and other objects from ancient quarries near
Carter, Kentucky, and a series of implements and specimens of ore,
which had been mined for use as paint, from aboriginal mines at
Leslie, Missouri, collected by Mr. Holmes. About 3,000 specimens of
stone implements, gathered by the late Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing,
including spearheads, arrowpoints, harpoons, and tools of various
kinds, and a very important collection made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
in Porto Rico and Santo Domingo were received from the Bureau of
American Ethnology. The material from Santo Domingo comprises
many types new to the Museum, while that from Porto Rico contains
several stone rings or collars, sculptured pillow stones, the remains of
human skeletons, and various other objects.

A collection of stone implements of various types, pottery, bowls,
vases, etc., chiefly from the Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo region,
was obtained from Mr. E. O. Matthews, of Parral, Mexico, and many
objects illustrative of the stone age in Uruguay were received in
exchange from the Museo Nacional at Montevideo, through the cour-
tesy of Seftor Luis A. de Herrera, secretary of the Uruguayan lega-
tion at Washington. Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of London, England,
presented a series of paleolithic quartzite implements selected from a
collection made by him in the Lateritic deposits near Madras, India.

A series of models of United States war vessels, including gunboats,
monitors, protected cruisers, and rams, deposited in the Museum by
the Navy Department, forms a very attractive exhibit, being of espe-
cial interest to the public. The War Department has also deposited a
large number of models of heavy seacoast cannon, mountain howitzers,
and other types of ordnance formerly used by the Army, and examples
of small arms.

Many relics of General and Mrs. U. S. Grant, of great intrinsic as
well as historic value, have been presented to the Museum by their
children, through Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Grant, U. S. Army.
They include clothing worn by General Grant during the civil war,
commissions to different ranks in the Army, a cabinet present to Mrs.
Grant by the Empress of Japan, said to be one thousand years old
and valued at $20,000; several Japanese vases presented by the
Emperor of Japan, a lady’s toilet set in gold from the King and Queen
of Siam, and numerous other objects.

Eight hundred and thirty-seven gold, silver, and copper coins were
donated to the Museum by Mr. E, M, Chapman, of New York City.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Casts of the Neanderthal and Prague ancient crania were purchased
for the newly established Division of Physical Anthropology, which
has also secured five valuable head-hunter’s skulls from New Guinea,
and a large series of crania and parts of human skeletons from the
Army Medical Museum, the U. S. Fish Commission, and other sources.

The Department of Biology received about 110,000 specimens, of
which approximately one-third were botanical. In zoology the Division
of Insects led with 37,684 specimens, followed by marine invertebrates
with 12,471 specimens, mammals with 7,485 specimens, mollusks with
6,332 specimens, and birds with 3,800 specimens.

The zoological specimens contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott con-
sisted of a large number of deer, squirrels, porcupines, and a new
ape, collected in Sumatra and on the adjacent islands, and in the Riou
Linga Archipelago, south of Singapore. Many of the species are new
to science. The donations made by Doctor Abbott, as the result of his
recent extensive explorations in the East Indies, now comprise about
9.500 mammals and nearly 4,000 birds, besides several thousand speci-
mens in other branches of natural history.

Large collections of bird skins and eggs, fishes, corals, mollusks,
crustaceans, and other marine invertebrates, obtained during the
expedition of the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer A/batross to the
Hawaiian Islands and to Samoa, have been transmitted to the Museum
and will be referred to more in detail in the next report. They
include interesting series of the birds of the Laysan Islands.

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a quantity of mammals
from the Yellowstone National Park and from Fort Snelling, Minne-
sota, and the Hon. B. S. Rairden, United States consul at Batavia,
two undescribed species of Zragulus from Jaya. An important collec-
tion of bats was obtained from Mr. William Foster, of Sapucay,
Paraguay; and one of bats and rodents from Mr. T. Tsuchida, of
Misaki, Japan. <A valuable skeleton of the porpoise, /’seudorca
crassidens, from the Hawaiian Islands, the first reported from that
region, was contributed by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, of the Leland Stan-
ford Junior University.

Several rare birds of paradise and other valuable specimens, includ-
ing a pair of flightless cormorants, from the Galapagos Islands, were
received from Mr. A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England, and a Javan
jungle fowl, a black-winged peacock, and other birds from Mr. Homer
Davenport, Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Bishop Museum, of
Honolulu, presented about 40 bird skins, including several species not
previously represented in the Museum collection, and 295 interesting
specimens from Chiriqui, Costa Rica, including a number of cotypes,
and 52 bird skins from Honduras were obtained from Mr. Outram
Bangs, of Boston, partly as a gift and partly in exchange. The most

Eighteen snakes from the island of Cyprus were purchased from
Giacomo Cecconi, of Florence, Italy, and 29 snakes from Jamaica and
Michigan were donated by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College,
Michigan.

The accessions to the collection of fishes were numerous and impor-
tant. Dr. O. P. Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University,
donated 42 types of Hawaiian fishes, constituting a second installment

of a series of types the first of which were transmitted in 1901. A
valuable collection of types and cotypes of Japanese fishes was received
from Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the same university. A large
salmon, weighing about 50 pounds, taken at Cascapedia, Canada, was
presented by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia. A deep-sea
pelican fish, captured at a depth of between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms,
during the survey for the Pacific cable, was transmitted by the officers
of the U. 8. 8S. Wero, and a large conger eel was received from Mr.
Louis Mowbray, of Bermuda, through the New York Aquarium.

Besides the mollusks obtained by the Fish Commission expedition to

donations during the past year, transmitting a series of plants from
the West Indies and Central America.

The collections in the Department of Geology were increased by
about 102,000 specimens, of which 97,000 were fossil invertebrates.
As in past years, the principal accessions were from the U. S.
Geological Survey. Among the more important ones were a series of
minerals, rocks, and ores, constituting a portion of the exhibit made
by the Survey at the expositions recently held in Buffalo and Charles-
ton, and a collection of rocks from Arizona, California, Idaho, Colo-
rado, Oregon, and Washington. An interesting lot of tourmalinitic
quartz from Little Pipestone district, Montana, of which some of the
specimens are covered on one side with parallel layers of amethysts of
different hues, accompanied the former.

A valuable series of massive and cut polished stalactites and stalag-
mites from the Copper Queen mine was presented by Mr. James
Douglas, of Bisbee, Arizona. Interesting examples of volcanic bombs
and lavas from Cinder Buttes, Idaho, were received from Prof. I. C.

A small piece of the only known specimen of footeite was donated
by Mr. Warren M. Foote, of Philadelphia, and many very desirable
minerals, some of which were not previously represented in the
Museum collection, were obtained from different sources.

The largest and most valuable addition to the Division of Strati-
graphic Paleontology was the second installment of the E. O. Ulrich
collection of Paleozoic bryozoans, comprising about 75,000 specimens
and 2,500 microscopic slides. The collection as a whole is the most
extensive of its kind in existence and contains many unique specimens.
About 14,000 corals, crinoids, mollusks, and other fossil invertebrates
from the Mississippi Valley Paleozoic were received from Dr. Carl
Rominger, of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of these have been figured
and described in the reports of the Geological Survey of Michigan.
The Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonic
vertebrate and invertebrate fossils is also entitled to special notice.
It was brought together by Mr. Sherwood, and includes many choice
slabs filled with large brachiopods and mollusks, besides about 38,000

EXPLORATIONS.

Fewer explorations than usual were carried on last year directly by
the Museum, owing to insufficient means for that purpose. Field work
under the Bureau of American Ethnology, which yielded interesting
collections of objects, since deposited in the Museum, as before men-
tioned, was conducted by Mr. William H. Holmes, Mr. Gerard Fowke,
and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. Mr. Holmes visited the aboriginal hema-
tite mines at Leslie, Missouri, and Doctor Fewkes an ancient quarry
in Carter County, Kentucky, while Doctor Fewkes also spent consider-
able time in Santo Domingo and Porto Rico.

The important explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott in Sumatra
and the adjoining islands, as well as on the mainland of the Straits
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Settlements, have already been referred to under the heading of
‘© \ dditions to the Collections.” These explorations, which are carried
on entirely at the expense of Doctor Abbott, have now been in prog-

ress for several years, and through his onerocitn the National Museum
has been the fortunate recipient of the very large and extremely valu-
able collections that he has made.

In the spring of 1903 Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Mr. William
Palmer and Mr. J. W. Scollick, all of the Museum staff, visited one of
the stations of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the coast of
Newfoundland in the interest of the St. Louis Exposition for the pur-
pose of securing as complete a representation as possible of a large
sulphur-bottom whale. He was entirely successful, returning with a
perfect skeleton of a specimen measuring about 78 feet long, and with
molds of the exterior, from which a cast of the entire animal will be
made. These specimens at the close of the exposition will be exhib-
ited in the Museum.

Through the courtesy of the Geographical Society of Baltimore, the
Museum was enabled to send Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley with
an expedition to the Bahama Islands, where they were to make collec-
tion of the fishes and land animals of that region. The party was still
absent at the close of the year.

Dr. H. G. Dyar, with Mr. Rolla P. Currie, of the National Museum,
and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, accom-
panied an expedition to British Columbia under the auspices of the
Carnegie Institution, and it is expected that they will bring back a
large and important collection of insects.

Mr. S. Ward Loper, of the U. S. Geological Survey, made for the
Museum an interesting collection of Triassic plants in Connecticut and
Massachusetts, and through arrangements with the Director of the
Survey, Hon. Charles D. Walcott, Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the
Museum staff, spent several weeks in Virginia and Georgia with
the special view of determining the geological horizons ofthe southern
part of the Appalachians. Incidental to this study he collected many
fossils. Several weeks were spent by Mr. R. S. Bassler in Ohio,
Indiana, and Kentucky collecting invertebrate fossils. A small collec-
tion of natural history specimens, obtained about Franz Josef Land
by the Baldwin-Ziegler expedition of 1902 to the Polar regions, was
presented to the Mieseara by Mr. William Ziegler. It is hoped that
the second expedition, now in progress under he same auspices, will

result in additional accessions from that little-known region.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS.

The number of specimens furnished to specialists outside of the
Museum for study was 12,529, almost twice as many as during the
previous year, while the sets of duplicates distributed to educational
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27

establishments in this country, together with those used in making
exchanges with individuals and institutions both at home and abroad,
comprised 33,228 specimens. The educational series consisted of
marine invertebrates, fishes, and geological material illustrating the
results of rock weathering and soil formation.

The following table shows the number of lots of specimens of all
kinds sent to each State and foreign country:

RESEARCHES.

Under the act of Congress founding the Smithsonian Institution the
Museum staff is charged with the classification and arrangement as well
as with the care and preservation of the national collections, and
although many of the accessions have been previously worked up, the
greater number reach the Museum unstudied and unnamed.

In selecting the assistants in every grade, therefore, it has been
necessary from the beginning to consider their qualifications with
reference to expert knowledge of the groups of specimens to be placed
under their charge, and in this manner a very effective though small
staff of paid scientific workers has been assembled. The greater part
of the time of these assistants has, naturally, to be given to the routine
duties attendant upon the receipt, assorting, labeling, cataloguing, and
disposition of the collection as received, but by working outside the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

official hours, a characteristic of every zealous man of science, they
are to be credited every year with important progress in classification
and in other studies. Besides the paid assistants, however, there are
nearly as many volunteer or honorary members of the scientific staff,
filling positions for which the appropriations are insufficient to make
provision, and from these also extensive results in the elaboration of
collections are obtained. But notwithstanding these facts the Museum
depends to a large extent, for the study of its collections, on the
cooperation of scientific men belonging to other institutions, their
work being done gratuitously, and frequent calls are made upon its
resources to aid in researches conducted under other auspices.

In the Department of Anthropology, Prof. O. T. Mason, the Acting
Head Curator, was mainly occupied in completing his revised paper
on aboriginal basketry which is to appear as an appendix to the
Annual Report for 1902. Dr. A. Hrdlicka, Assistant Curator of
Physical Anthropology, made a study of the Lansing skeleton, includ-
ing an examination of other material. A description of the Parsee
creed and ceremonials represented in the collections of the Museum
was prepared by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz and published in the American
Anthropologist. Dr. Cyrus Adler and Dr. Casanowicz continued their
work on a bibliography of Assyriology.

Among the investigators from other places who were given facilities
for making studies on anthropological subjects were M. Pittier, head
of the National Museum of Costa Rica; Dr. Carl von den Steinen, of
Berlin; Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe, director of the Royal Museum of Sweden
at Stockholm; Prof. Hartmann, of Stockholm; Dr. A. B. Hunter of
Raleigh, N. C.; Dr. E. A. Bogue, of New York City; and Dr. Walde-
mar Bogoras, of the American Museum of Natural History. Doctor
Bogoras’s visit was made in the interest of his explorations among the
tribes of northeastern Siberia and for the purpose of ascertaining
whether any material of Siberian origin was contained in the extensive
Eskimo collection of this Museum.

In the Department of Biology Mr. G. 8S. Miller, jr., Assistant Cura-
tor of Mammals, gave special attention to the working up of Doctor
Abbott’s collections of East Indian mammals, in which he has already
discovered 17 new species of mouse deer (genus Zragulus), 16 new
species belonging to other orders, and one new genus (Lenothrix).
In the Museum collection of American bats, he has found 20 unde-
scribed species, diagnoses of which have been published in the pro-
ceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He has
also prepared notes on a number of species of bats and rodents. Dr.
EK. A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, made a study of the ocelots, the results of
which were printed in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr..
has completed a list of the tvpe specimens of mammals, exclusive of
cetaceans, in the collections of the Museum, which number 469 species
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and subspecies. Photographs of the types are still to be prepared.
Doctor Lyon has also pursued investigations on the osteology of the
rabbits, and has published two brief notes on other mammals. The
head curator of biology, Dr. Frederick W. True, completed an enten-
sive and important monograph on the North American and European
species of whalebone whales, his manuscript being submitted for pub-
lication toward the close of the year. He also prepared papers on
Doctor Philippi’s species of Chilean porpoises, on a killer whale
stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of Prodelphinus
obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the common porpoise
of the genus 7urséops, and on the occurence of the pollack whale,
Balaenoptera borealis, in American waters.

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s manual of North and
Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and 22 plates,
was issued during the year. It deals with the families of Tanagers,
Troupials, Honey Creepers and Wood Warblers (Tanagride, Icteridee,
Coerebidee and Mniotiltide), comprising 77 genera and 433 species
and subspecies. The preparation of the third volume, covering 15
families, is well advanced, about 400 pages being now in type. A
paper by Dr. Charles W. Richmond on the birds collected by Doctor
Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss, in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has
been published, and Doctor Richmond has also spent much time in
working up the Abbott collection of birds from the west coast of
Sumatra, and a collection from the South Pacific. He has likewise
made considerable progress with the card catalogue of the genera and
species of birds. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation of
material for a volume on the life-histories of North American birds
with special reference to their nests and eggs, supplemental to the
unfinished work of the late Major C. E. Bendire, U. S. Army.

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger completed his report on the reptiles of
Porto Rico and has been engaged in the investigation of the reptile
fauna of Eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on Holbrook’s
salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona,
were published by the Museum during the year.

In connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks
of Florida, Dr. W. H. Dall prepared reviews of the recent species of
Veneridx, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartide. Mr. Bartsch con-
tinued his studies on the Pyramidellidee, which were nearly finished at
the close of the year.

Dr. W. H. Ashmead continued his work upon the classification of
the Chaleid-flies, which is now in course of printing by the Carnegie
Museum, and published several papers on the wasps of the groups
Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea. He had also in course
of preparation monographs on the North American Braconide and the
Japanese Hymenoptera, and a catalogue of North American Hyme-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

noptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied in identifying and arrang-
ing the Diptera and completed a revision of the genera of the family
Empidide. A paper by him descriptive of 4 new genera and 94 new
species of North American diptera was printed in the Proceedings.
Mr. Nathan Banks published 16 papers on spiders and other entomo-
logical subjects. A paper on dragon-flies and one on ant-lions, by
Mr. Rolla P. Currie, were published by the Entomological Society of
Washington. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of North
American Neuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant-lions.
Mr. August Busck published two papers on the codling-moth and one
on a new species of the family Yponomentide, and also a revision of
the American moths of the family Gelechiidee. The Museum Proceed-
ings for the year contained a paper by Dr. H. G. Dyar on the larvee
of moths from Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John G.
Smith’s monograph of the moths of the family Noctuide.

The researches by Dr. J. E. Benedict included a revision of the
genus Lepidopa, descriptions of new Galatheide, Albuneide, and
Dromide, and studies upon the Anomuran crabs collected in Japanese
and Hawaiian waters by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross, and
upon several interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun continued
work on a monograph of the fresh-water crabs based on the collec-
tions of the U. 8S. National Museum, the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle,
Paris, the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University,
and other institutions. She also prepared five short papers on
crustaceans which were printed during the year.

Miss Harriet Richardson completed reports on the Isopod crustace-
ans collected in Hawaii and Japan by the Fish Commission steamer
Albatross, and in Japan by the U.S. 8. Palos in 1881, and by Dr.
D. 8. Jordan and J. O. Snyder in 1900, and also on some cymothoids
collected by Dr. C. H. Gilbert on the west coast of Central America,
and on the American Epicaridea in the U. 5. National Museum.

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of the helminthological collections,
made an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among
the people of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the
attacks of an undescribed species of hook-worm, Uneinaria americana,
and carried on inquiries regarding the frequency of the occurrence of
parasites inmen. He published twelve papers during the year relat-
ing to parasitology, three of these having been prepared conjointly
with Dr. Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; and also the
first three parts of an index-catalogue of medical and veterinary
zoology, with Doctor Hassall as coauthor.

In the Division of Plants, an unusual amount of routine work, espe-
cially in connection with the rearrangement of the collections, pre-
vented the accomplishment of much scientific research. A third
section of Dr. J. N. Rose’s studies of Mexican and Central American
plants. and a paper by the same author in conjunction with Mr.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

W. B. Hemsley on the genus /uléania were printed. Doctor Rose also
continued work on the Crassulacese of North America conjointly with
Doctor Britton, and completed a preliminary paper relating to that
group of plants. Mr. C. L. Pollard contributed a number of notes
to the Plant World, and described two new violets from the United
States. With Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell he also published descriptions
of four new plants from New Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued
his studies on the Museum ccllection of ferns, and Mr. Edward S.
Steele completed a monograph on a section of the genus Laciniarca.

Access to the collections in biology were accorded during the year
to a considerable number of visiting naturalists. The meetings of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society
of American Naturalists, and other affiliated societies during convoca-
tion week brought together in Washington many prominent investi-
gators, and itis their time was limited, some of them took advantage
of the opportunity to examine specimens in the line of their specialty.
The committee on nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union
during its meeting from April 16 to 18 made extensive use of the
bird collection in determining the status of North American species.
Among individual ornithologists to whom the same privilege was
given were Prof. W. W. Cooke, Mr. E. W. Nelson, Mr. H. C. Ober-
holser, and Mr. W. H. Osgood, of the Department of Agriculture;
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston; Dr. J. Dwight, jr., of New York City;
and Mrs. Florence Merriam Bailey, of Washington.

Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was here for
some time studying the Old World chameleons, which he proposes to
monograph. Among students of entomology who conducted work
at the Museum were Dr. W. J. Holland, Director of the Carnegie
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. John B. Smith, of Rutgers
College, New Brunswick, New Jersey; Dr. James A. G. Rehn and Mr.
J. Chester Bradley, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Mr. H. H. Ballou,
of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany.

Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, Washington, continued
his studies upon crayfishes and other fresh-water crustaceans, and
completed descriptions of the species collected by himself at Mam-
moth Cave, Kentucky, and Nickajack Cave, Tennessee, and by Dr.
C. H. Eigenmann in Cuba. Prof. G. I. Hamaker, of Trinity College,
Durham, North Carolina, examined the specimens of Cerianthus; Miss
Katherine J. Bush, of the Peabody Museum of Yale University, cer-
tain type specimens of Annelids, and Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, certain species of Amphipod crustaceans.

The principal visiting botanists have been Dr. N. L. Britton, Direc-
tor of the New York Botanical Garden; Dr. L. M. Underoom of
Columbia University, New York City; Mr. Theodor Holm, of Breer

land, District of Columbia: and Dr. E. L. Greene, of ae Catholic
University, Washington.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

The herbarium has also been constantly utilized by the botanists of
the Department of Agriculture.

A large amount of material from the Department of Biology was
lent to specialists for study or sent to them for working up in the
interest of the National Museum. The Biological Survey of the
Department of Agriculture had the use of many specimens of mam-
mals, and specimens of the same group were sent out of the city as
follows:

To Mr. James A. G. Rehn, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, 41 specimens of several groups for use in his report on
terrestrial vertebrates collected in portions of southern New Mexico
and western Texas, besides 14 specimens of Vyctinomus,; to Mr. D. G.
Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, 35 specimens for use in con-
nection with his work on the mammals of Middle America; to Dr.
J. A. Allen, of the American Museum of Natural History, 108 speci-
mens for-use in connection with his study of the mammals of eastern
Siberia; to Mr. J. L. Bonhote, of the British Museum of Natural
History, who is making a study of the Malayan fauna, 18 skins and
skulls of J/us; to Dr. John M. Ingersoll, of Cleveland, Ohio, who is
working upon the comparative anatomy of the ithmoid region of the
mamma ‘ian skull, 16 specimens of skulls; to Dr. Harris H. Wilder, of
Smith Col.ege, for use in embryological studies, specimens of the
embryo of Janis javanica, to Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, sta-
tioned at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, 9 specimens of mammals from the
Philippine region; and to Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of
Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, specimens of Vycticebus.

The Division of Birds furnished 13 specimens of Parws hudsonicus,
and 68 specimens, mainly of Ofocor/s, to Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of

monographic work; and a large number of Lower Siluric graptolites
from New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts, to Dr. John M. Clarke,
State paleontologist of New York.

PROGRESS IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The overcrowded condition of the public halls which began a num-
of years ago precludes any extensive additions to the exhibition series,
and this must continue until the completion of the new building
recently authorized by Congress. Small objects can be given a place
here and there, but any considerable changes are rendered possible
only through the withdrawal and transfer to storage of collections
already on display. During the past year the principal progress made
in this connection has had reference to improvements in the methods
and details of installation.

In the Department of Anthropology temporary accommodations
have been furnished on the gallery of the north-west court for the
important ethnological collections from the Philippine Islands dis-
played at the Pan-American Exposition. The entire Eskimo collection
has been gone over, and the large series of specimens secured by the
Museum-Gates expedition has been arranged in the storage-cases of
the Pueblo court. The labeling of the historical collections has been
completed, and new case labels have been prepared for the Divisions
of Historic and Prehistoric Archeology and for the section of historic
religious ceremonials. The cases containing the manuscripts and vari-
ous editions of the Bible were repainted, and the collections rearranged
to facilitate their examination by visitors.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ot

The work of completing the exhibition series in several of the divi-
sions of the Department of Biology, and of improving their appearance
by changes in methods of installation, has been vigorously pushed.
Progress in this regard was most noticeable in the halls devoted to
mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and fishes. About 200 case
labels have been added to the exhibits of mammals, birds, reptiles,
batrachians, insects, and the lower invertebrates, and a series of case
labels for the collection of comparative anatomy has been completed.

The interiors of the wall-cases, in the galleries of the south hall
containing Old World mammals, have been repainted in a color simi-
lar to that used in the corresponding cases on the main floor, and this
change has resulted in displaying the specimens to much better
advantage. <A similar change has also been made in regard to the
floor cases in the gallery containing small mammals. Three new
cases have been constructed against the south wall of this hall. One
contains the North American weasels and related forms; the two
others, the smaller South American mammals. The cases on the
main floor of the south hall have been furnished with new fittings, so
that they are now uniform in design and color. The labeling of the
American small mammals has been greatly improved, while the labels
for the Old World series have been revised and very largely replaced
with new ones. -

Considerable improvement has been made in the appearance of the
exhibition of marine invertebrates, which occupies the west hall in the
Smithsonian building. The interior of all the wall-cases has been
repainted in black, as furnishing a better background for the corals
and sponges than the maroon formerly employed. The display of
insects in the next adjoining hall or corridor has been enlarged by
extensive additions to the systematic series of North American insects,
which it is hoped to complete during the coming year.

The wall cases in the south-east range of the Museum building have
been reconstructed, and the systematic collection of casts of North
American fishes has been rearranged and installed to much better
advantage than formerly. A number of casts of large and striking
species have been repaired and repainted. The labeling of the casts
of reptiles and batrachians exhibited in floor cases in the same range
has also been largely revised.

The bird groups displayed in the main hall of the Smithsonian
building, sixteen in number, have been partly renovated, and one of
them, consisting of three fine specimens of the Argus pheasant, pre-
sented to the Museum some years age by Dr. W. L. Abbott, has been
entirely remounted, making it the most striking feature of the room.

Many important changes have been made in the halls containing the
geological collections. The exhibit of geographic ores in the south-
west court has been carefully overhauled, the cases being thoroughly
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

cleaned and the specimens rearranged. The nonmetallic minerals,
exhibited in the gallery of the same court, have been similarly worked
over. The cases in the west-south range containing the stratigraphic
and historical collections have been reconstructed and the specimens
rearranged. The collection of fossil plants has been partially rear-
ranged, and new labels have replaced the temporary ones on the Pale-
ozoic specimens. Labels have also been printed for the Triassic plants.
To the exhibition of vertebrate paleontology will soon be added a
specimen of C/aosaurus, the preparation of which has occupied nearly
a year, and the mounted skeleton of a mastodon obtained at Church,
Michigan, in 1901.

VISITORS.

There was, during the past year, a large increase in the number of
visitors to the national collections. The total number of persons
admitted to the Museum building was 315,307, against 178,888 for
1902, an increase of 81 per cent; and to the Smithsonian building
181,174, against 144,107 for the previous year, an increase of about 26
per cent.

The following tables show, respectively, the attendance during each
month of the past year, and during each year beginning with 1881,
when the Museum building was first opened to the public:

MEETINGS AND LECTURES.

In accordance with the custom of previous years, certain scientific
societies and other bodies were allowed the use of the lecture hall in
the Museum building for the purpose of holding meetings and giving
lectures, as follows: .

On September 26, 1902, the associates and friends of Maj. John
Wesley Powell gathered here to commemorate the life and services of
this distinguished public man, the founder and director of the Bureau
of American Ethnology and for some time Director of the Geological
Survey, whose lamented death occurred but three days before.

From November 18 to 20 a national conference of the various Audo-
bon societies of the United States was held, in conjunction with the
American Ornithologists’ Union.

On November 22 Prof. John Ritchie, jr., of the Yerkes Observa-
tory, delivered under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution an
interesting lecture on Recent Celestial Photography.

On November 25 Dr. L. O. Howard, Entomologist of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Honorary Curator of Insects in the National

Museum, lectured on the subject of Entomology before an audience
composed largély of officers of the United States Army and Navy.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

On December 27 several interesting talks, illustrated with lantern
slides, were given by members of the Society for the Preservation of
Wild Flowers.

In the evening of January 1, 1903, an informal reception was ten.
dered to the members of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the American Society of Naturalists, and other
affiliated societies, then in session in this city.

During February and March a course of free Saturday afternoon
lectures was given, under the auspices of. the Biological Society of
Washington, as follows: February 14, An entomologist in China and
Japan, by Mr. C. L. Marlatt; February 21, Ancient birds and their
associates, by Mr. Frederic A. Lucas; February 28, Views of Liberia,
by Prof. O. F. Cook; March 7, The making of new plants, by Mr.
H. J. Webber; March 14, Three summers in Alaska, by Mr. Wilfred
H. Osgood.

On April 4 the lecture hall was used for the graduating exercises of
the Naval Medical School, and on April 14 for those of the Army
Medical School. i

The National Academy of Sciences held its annual meeting from
April 21 to 28, 1903, the business meetings taking place in the offices
of the assistant secretary, and the reading of papers in the lecture
hall.

CORRESPONDENCE.

One of the most onerous duties which has devolved upon the
Museum from the time of its establishment has been the furnishing
of information in response to inquiries from the public at large upon
all the various subjects within the scope of its several departments.
The letters received containing such requests average several daily
throughout the year, and are rarely confined to a single subject, often
relating to collections of greater or less size which are transmitted.
for identification. Nearly 900 lots of specimens were received under
these conditions during the past year. These communications also
have reference, in many cases, to the building up and maintenance of
collections, the construction of cases, the installation, labeling, and
‘ataloguing of specimens, and other topics connected with museum
administration. Every communication of this character, made in
good faith, is responded to as promptly as possible, although the
labor involved draws very heavily upon the time of both the scien-
tific and the clerical staffs.

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information
is accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of
which more than 20,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed
during the year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4]

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Museum have consisted of an annual report,
comprising the second part, or volume, of the annual report of the
Smithsonian Institution; of a series of Proceedings for the ordinary
technical papers, and of a series of Bulletins for the longer technical
papers or monographs. In 1894 the National Herbarium, which, for
lack of space, had been held at the Department of Agriculture since
1869, was returned to the National Museum, but the publication con-
nected with it and entitled **‘ Contributions from the National Herba-
rium” established in 1890, continued to be issued by the Department
of Agriculture until this year, when Congress, upon the recommenda-
tion of the Secretary of Agriculture, transferred its management to
the National Museum, in accordance with the following item in the
sundry civil act for 1903:

For printing and publishing the contributions from the United States National
Herbarium, the editions of which shall not be less than three thousand copies,
including the preparation of necessary illustrations, proof reading, bibliographical
work, and special editorial work, seven thousand dollars: Provided, That one-half of
said copies shall be placed on sale at an advance of ten per centum over their cost.

Under this provision volumes 11 and vir previously published and
entitled respectively Botany of Western Texas, by J. M. Coulter, and
Systematic and Geographic Botany and Aboriginal Use of Plants, by
Coulter, Rose, Cook, and Chesnut, the editions of which had become
exhausted, were reprinted, and also the following new Contributions,
parts 1, 2, and 3 of volume vu, consisting of Studies of Mexican
and Central American Plants, by J. N. Rose; Economic Plants of
Porto Rico, by O. F. Cook and G. N. Collins; and A Study of cer-
tain Mexican and Guatemalan species of Polypodium, by William R.
Maxon.

Of the Bulletins of the Museum the most important one issued was
the second volume of Robert Ridgway’s extensive monograph on the
Birds of North and Middle America, covering the families Tanagridee
(Tanagers), Icteride (Troupials), Coerebide (Honey Creepers), and
Mniotiltidee (Wood Warblers). The third volume, sent to the printer
before the close of the fiscal year, treats of the Motacillide: (Wagtails
and Pipits); Hirundinide (Swallows), Vireonide (Vireos), Ampelidiz
(Waxwings), Ptiliognatide (Silken Chatterers), Dulide (Palm Chat-
terers), Laniide (Shrikes), Corvide (Crows and Jays), Paride (Tit-
mice), Sittide (Nuthatches), Certhiide (Creepers), Troglodytide
(Wrens), Cinclide (Dippers), Chameiidee (Wrentits), and Sylviide
(Kinglets, etc.).

Another noteworthy bulletin was that by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, of
the Division of Insects, entitled A List of North American Lepidop-
tera and Key to the Literature of this Order of Insects. It is num-
bered 52, and comprises 723 octavo pages.
492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The interest manifested in the history and anthropology of our
Philippine and other insular possessions rendered desirable the issu-
ance of instructions for the guidance of collectors of objects in these
branches, and to secure this purpose there has been printed an addi-
tional part of Bulletin 39 (Part Q), prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes
and Prof. O. T. Mason, under the title Instructions to Collectors of
Historical and Anthropological Specimens. ;

The twenty-fourth volume of Proceedings, printed in bound form at
the beginning of the fiscal year, contains thirty-four papers (1241 to
1274. inclusive), all of which were issued in the form of separates dur-
ing the preceding year. Fifteen of these papers were prepared by
members of the Museum staff, ten by Dr. David Starr Jordan and his
assistants, being mainly descriptions of Japanese fishes represented in
the Museum collections, and the remainder by other correspondents
and collaborators of the Museum.

Papers numbered from 1275 to 1805, constituting volume xxv,
and those numbered from 1306 to 1332 of volume xxvi, were also
printed by June 30. It is expected that numbers 1333 to 1349 will
soon be published, and that volumes xxv and xxvi will appear in
bound form during the summer of 1903.

There is a continuous demand for certain of the Museum publica-
tions no longer in stock, but the means this year have permitted the
reprinting of only the following: Mr. Robert Ridgway’s paper on the
Humming Birds, from the Museum Report for 1900; Dr. Stejneger’s
paper on The Poisonous Snakes of North America, from the Report
for 1893; Bulletin 37, entitled A Preliminary Catalogue of the Shell-
bearing Marine Mollusks and Brachiopods of the Southeastern Coast
of the United States, by Dr. William H. Dall; parts F, G, H, I, J, K
of Bulletin 39, containing directions for collecting insects, shells, min-
erals, rocks, specimens illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants and
fossils, and the first volume of Bulletin 47, entitled Fishes of North
and Middle America, by Doctors Jordan and Evermann.

All the publications of the Museum are distributed by the Office of
Correspondence and Documents, and it is estimated that during the
year not less than 10,000 volumes and 35,000 separate papers were
sent to libraries and individuals in the United States and foreign
countries.

Appendix IV of this report contains a list of the publications of the
Museum, of the members of its staff, and also of outside collaborators
to the extent that the papers of the latter were based on Museum
material. The number of authors is 90, and the total number of
papers mentioned by title is 277.

LIBRARY.

The assignment to the library of two of the galleries erected last
vear, one in the west-north, the other in the north-west range, has
added a considerable amount of space, which has long been needed.
This area has been fitted up with convenient stacks, permitting a gen-
eral overhauling and a more systematic rearrangement of the books
and pamphlets. During the latter part of the summer of 1902 the
library was closed for a time to enable this work to be carried out.
Its contents were classified and a large number of volumes belonging
to the Smithsonian deposit were turned over to the Institution for
transmission to the Library of Congress.

The increase of the library has been mainly due to two very impor-
tant gifts—the Hubbard and Schwarz and the Dall collections. The
former, consisting of 300 books and 1,500 pamphlets, was brought
together by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and Mr. E. A. Schwarz (Custodian
of Coleoptera in the Museum), while carrying on their studies more
or less conjointly, and forms an accessory to their large collection of
insects, presented by them to the Museum several years ago. It is
an entomological library, having reference mainly to the American
Coleoptera. The contribution by Dr. William H. Dall; Honorary
Curator of Mollusks, comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about
2,000 pamphlets on the mollusca, a special library of great value, which
has been accumulated by Dr. Dall during many years of research. It
is accompanied by a card catalogue covering the literature of Con-
chology, both recent and fossil, down to about 1860, though materially
added to since then.

The above collections and also the Goode library, purchased in 1898,
have been provided with book-plates.

The Museum library now possesses 19,161 bound volumes, and
82,063 unbound pamphlets, periodicals, etc. The cataloguing done
during the year cemprised 916 books, 1,571 pamphlets, and 9,838 parts
of periodicals, and 3,316 cards were added to the authors? catalogue.
~ The number of books, pamphlets and periodicals borrowed from the
general library was 18,750, while the number assigned to the sectional
libraries was 4,833. There has been no change in the sectional libra-
ries, which are as follows:

PHOTOGRAPHY.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer of the Museum, reports that 1,689
negatives, 3,367 silver prints, 307 platinum prints, 49 lantern slides,
and 1,016 blueprints have been made, and a large number of prints
havebeen mounted. Under Mr. Smillie’s direction much photographic
work has also been done for the National Zoological Park and the
Astrophysical Observatory, an assistant having been furnished by
those bureaus for that purpose.

Mr. Smillie has continued to act as chairman of the board of exam-
iners in photography for the U. 5. Civil Service Commission.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The Museum has received, as usual, important assistance from
several of the Departments and Bureaus of the Government. Its rela-
tions to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish Commission, the
Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology,
especially in regard to the transmission of collections, have been
referred to elsewhere. Officers of the Army and Navy stationed in
the new possessions have made valuable contributions, and representa-
tives abroad of the Department of State have been instrumental in
securing interesting material. The Departments of War and of the
Navy have rendered generous help toward building up the collections
of history and of the implements of war, having presented and
deposited during the year many objects of exceeding interest and
value. The Army Medical Museum has cooperated most liberally in
promoting the welfare of the recently established Division of Physical
Anthropology, and special acknowledgments are due to the Quarter-
master’s Department of the-Army for many courtesies in connection
with the transportation of specimens and outfits to and from distant
points.

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION.

An act providing for the celebration in the city of St. Louis, Mis-
souri, of the one hundredth anniversary of the acquisition by the
United States of the ‘* Louisiana Territory,” purchased from France,
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

was approved by the President of the United States on March 3, 1901.
The sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1903, carried an
appropriation of $800,000 to enable the Executive Departments, and
also the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus, the U. 5. Fish Com-
mission, the Department of Labor, the Library of Congress, and the
Bureau of the American Republics, to prepare suitable exhibits for the
occasion. Out of this appropriation the sum of $110,000 was allotted
to the Smithsonian Institution. Congress also appropriated $450,000
for the construction of a building for the display of the Government
collections.

Dr. Frederick W. True, Head Curator of Biology, has been desig-
nated by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to represent the
Institution and its bureaus on the Government board. The exposition
is expected to open on April 30 and to close on November 30, 1904.
The preparation of the exhibits under the Smithsonian Institution was
well under way at the close of the year, and it is intended that the
display made shall surpass any previous efforts by this branch of the
Government.

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF.

The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office
and three scientific departments, as follows: Antbropology, with 9
divisions and 4 sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 13 sections,
and Geology, with 3 divisions and 3 sections. This shows an increase
of one division in Anthropology and of one section in Biology, the
former relating to physical anthropology, the latter to the lower algee,
which have been separated from the higher alge. At the close of the
year the scientific staff consisted of 3 head curators, 17 curators, 13
assistant curators, 15 custodians, 12 aids, 4 associates, and 2 collabo-
rators, a total of 66 persons, only about one-half of whom were under
salary from the National Museum, the others, mainly employees of
other Government bureaus, serving in a volunteer or honorary
capacity.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, Head Curator of the Department of Anthro-
pology, having been appointed Chief of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology, was on November
15, 1902, placed in charge of the Department as acting head curator.
Dr. A. Hrdlicka, whose researches on the physical characteristics of
man are widely known, was on May 1, 1908, designated as assistant
curator of the newly organized Division of Physical Anthropology.
Dr. G. T. Moore, of the Department of Agriculture, was appointed
custodian of the section of lower algz on May 25, and at the same
time the designation of Mr. W. T. Swingle was changed to custodian
of the section of higher alge.

On December 31, 1902, Mr. Charles T, Simpson resigned his posi-
tion as principal aid in the Division of Mollusks, being succeeded by
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

Mr. Paul Bartsch, whose place was in turn taken by Mr. William B.

Marshall, appointed aid on April 1. Mr. R. G. Paine was made an

aid in the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians on April 6, and Mr.

T. Wayland Vaughan, Custodian of the Madreporarian Corals on
June 30.

A list of the members of the Museum staff is given in Appendix L.

NECROLOGY.

It is gratifying to note that during the past year no deaths have
oceurred in connection with the Museum staff, though among its
friends there have been several losses, only two of which will be men-
tioned here.

The first was that of Maj. J. W. Powell, explorer, geologist, and
anthropologist, for some time director of the U. S. Geological Survey,
and the founder and director of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
An account of his life and work will be found in the first volume of
the Smithsonian report for 1902, and it need only be recalled here that
in nearly all the varied subjects of his personal studies and of his
administrative oversight he was brought into close relations with the
Museum, which is indebted to him for valuable collections, for wise
suggestions, and for a continued interest in its welfare.

The second loss resulted from the death of Dr. James Cushing
Merrill, of the United States Army, which occurred in Washington
on October 27, 1902. Doctor Merrill was born in Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts, in 1853, and after attending school in Germany, he entered
the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, from which
he was graduated in 1874. About a year later he was appointed
assistant surgeon in the United States Army. While stationed at
yarious military posts in the west and southwest, he devoted much
time to the study and collection of birds and eggs, generously giving
away his collections, the National Museum being one of his favored
beneficiaries. The accession records show that between 1875 and 1896
no less than 28 separate lots of specimens were received from him,
these including a large number of valuable skins, eggs, and nests of
birds, besides mammals, fishes, and other natural history material.
Doctor Merrill was elected an active member of the American Orni-
thologists’ Union at its first congress in 1883. He was a careful and
accurate observer of the habits of birds and mammals, and also con-
tributed several important papers to scientific literature. Two of
these were published in the Proceedings of the National Museum,
their titles being as follows: Notes on the Ornithology of Southern
Texas, being a list of birds observed in the vicinity of Fort Brown,
Texas. from February, 1876, to June, 1878, and On the Habits of the
Rocky Mountain Goat.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By Otis T. Mason,
Acting Head Curator.

During the year a number of changes have taken place in the
personnel of the Department of Anthropology. When Mr. W. H.
Holmes, the Head Curator, was made Chief of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, Prof. O. T. Masen, Curator of Ethnology, was desig-
nated as Acting Head Curator, Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator,
became Acting Curator of the Division of Ethnology; and Mr. Paul
Beckwith, Aid in the Division of History, was temporarily assigned
to the Assistant Curatorship of Ethnology. Owing to continued fail-
ing health, Mrs. Fanny Dinsmore, stenographer, was compelled to
resign, and in January Mr. W. E. Wilson was selected to fill the
place. In January Mr. H. W. Hendley, who had assisted the Depart-
ment in preparing its exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition, was
appointed preparator in the Department, and in February Dr. Ales
Hrdlicka was called to the position of assistant curator in the newly
established Division of Physical Anthropology.

The work of the Department during the year has consisted largely
in cataloguing, caring for, and installing the collections received,
although the preparation of an exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition has called for a large share of attention. This work is in
charge of Mr. W. H. Holmes, who has undertaken to collect a series
of exhibits illustrative of the highest artistic achievements of the
American aborigines.

Until the present year the Department has been devoted entirely to
the culture side of the science of man, collections illustrating the
physical characters of the race, normal as well as abnormal, having
been cared for in the Army Medical Museum; but a large part of this
material has recently been transferred to the National Museum, and a
laboratory for the study of this branch has been established under the
curatorship of Dr. Ales Hrdlicka. Thus, for the first time in its his-
tory, the National Museum embraces the whole subject of -anthro-
pology, physical and cultural, so far at least as this branch can be
represented and illustrated by material objects.

52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The collections assigned to the Department during the year number
24,319 specimens, and have been distributed among the several divisions

and sections as follows:

GIFTS.

Among the numerous gifts received in the Department during the
year the following may be especially mentioned:

1. Collection of ethnological material from Sumatra and the Anda-
man and Nicobar islands, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Phila-
delphia, who is one of the most generous benefactors of the Muscum.
These collections number some 500 specimens, and illustrate the native
arts and industries of various primitive peoples of whom little is gen-
erally known. Their value is greatly enhanced by the fact that they
were obtained directly from the natives by a trained collector, and are
accompanied by all essential historical and descriptive data.

2. A large collection made bythe late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, in the Philippine Islands for the Pan-American
Exposition, and presented to the National Museum by the Government
board of the exposition. It includes upward of 1,500 specimens, and
illustrates in an effective manner many of the native industries of the
pou

- A small series of ethnological specimens collected among the
anne Indians of southeastern Alaska by Lieut. G. T. Emmons,
U.S. Navy. These specimens have especial value, because of the
careful record of tribe, manufacture, and use furnished by the collector.

4. A series of stone implements, believed to be of paleolithic age,
from the lateritic deposits near Madras, India, presented by Mr. H.
W. St ae of London, England.

CARE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The numerous accessions of the year, especially the large collections
of Abbott, Hilder, and others, have made it necessary to contract the
exhibition space in order to make room for the ever-growing study
series and for laboratory purposes. The demands of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition and of the newly-established Division of Physical
Anthropology for space have increased the embarrassment. The con-
gestion has been somewhat relieved by fitting up the galleries over
the south-west and west-north ranges, but overcrowding is still every-
where apparent.

The usual watchfulness over the ethnological collections to protect
them from insects and rust has been exercised, and Mr. Joseph Palmer
has devoted a large part of his time to the work of overhauling, reno-
vating and poisoning.

Until additional exhibition space is provided the installation of new
material is practically at an end, excepting where exhibits that have
been jong before the publie are replaced by others of greater interest.
-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57

The work of labeling the exhibits has been carried forward with all
possible energy during the year, and great advance has been made
over previous years, especially in the labeling of the larger units, such
as halls, alcoves, groups of exhibits, and cases.

In the Division of Ethnology the Philippine collection has been
temporarily arranged in cases in the north-west court gallery; the col-
lections obtained through the Museum-Gates expedition in Arizona
during the previous year have been placed in good order in the storage
series of the Pueblo court, and Mr. Thomas W. Sweeny has classified
and rearranged the large Eskimo study collection in the storage bases of
the north-west range. Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. Charles Luscombe
have been engaged in mending, modeling, making facsimilies of
specimens, and allied laboratory work.

During the entire fiscal year the hall of prehistoric archeology has
been closed on account of repairs, but the work of cataloguing and
caring for the collections has gone on without interruption under the
supervision of Mr. KE. P. Upham.

A large collection of Washington relics, transferred to the Museum
from the Patent Office, has been installed in the hall of American history
in connection with cognate exhibits, under the supervision of Mr.
A. H. Clark and Mr. Paul Beckwith. The exhibition series in this
division is all labeled and the crowded condition of the study series
has been greatly relieved by removing portions of it to the new gal-
leries. It has long been felt that a suitable catalogue of the historical
collections should be prepared for publication by the Museum, and
during the year this work was initiated by the. employment of Miss
Elizabeth Bryant Johnston, who has completed a descriptive catalogue
of the personal relics of George Washington.

In the Divisionof Physical Anthropology there is as yet no exhibition
series, the time of the new curator, Doctor Hrdlicka, having been
devoted to organizing the division and fitting up a laboratory of
anthropometry.

In the sections of historic religious ceremonials and classical arche-
ology, few changes have been made save that the labeling has been
carried practically to completion.

In the Division of Medicine the curator has been engaged in prepar-
ingacard catalogue of the collections. Each specimen, whether on exhi-
bition, in the study series or in storage, has an individual card, giving
name, number, collector, mode of acquisition, etc.

EXPLORATIONS.

During the yeara very limited amount of field work has been under-
taken by members of the Department’s staff. Mr. W. H. Holmes
continued his explorations in archeology on behalf of the Bureau of
Ethnology. Under his direction numerous mound relics and fossil
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

bones of ancient mammals were obtained near Kimmswick, Missouri,
by Mr. Gerard Fowke, and extensive collections were made in ancient
flint quarries and workshops in Carter County, Kentucky, and in Har-
rison County. Indiana, illustrating all the phases of flint working.

Mr. Holmes, aided by Mr. Fowke, made investigations in a hematite
mine at Leslie, Missouri, obtaining the collections referred to on a
preceding page.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, concluded
important explorations in the islands of Santo Domingo and Porto
Rico. It has long been known that the latter island was in some way
a sacred retreat of the ancient inhabitants of the Antilles. Many
years ago a large collection of objects of stone was presented to the
Museum by George Latimer, and Doctor Fewkes was successful in
supplementing this with valuable material, adding many new forms.
In addition to his archeological explorations, Doctor Fewkes made
careful studies of the natives, including the whites, blacks, and rem-
nants of ancient aborigines.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has continued his explorations
in the northern portion of the island of Sumatra and the small islands
adjoining, and the mainland in the Straits Settlements, contributing
the valuable collections already described.

RESEARCHES.

One of the chief aims of the Department of Anthropology has always
been to favor and encourage research, not only on the part of members
of the staff but of investigators elsewhere. Much attention has been
paid during the year to correspondence on every topic connected with
anthropology, and to obtain, if possible, for the friends of the Institu-
tion information that is not within their reach. Literature published
by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on anthropo-
logical subjects has been freely distributed. This remark applies
equally to the ethnology of America, the Philippine Islands, and inci-
dentally to other parts of the world. The curators have been almost
daily importuned for information concerning the nature and use of
archeological relics.

A collection of Indian shields was sent to Mr. James Mooney, Mount
Scott, Oklahoma, for study in the field.

In the Division of History questions arise constantly as to the mean-
ing of inscriptions and the readings on coins and medals. Already, in
the new Division of Physical Anthropology a beginning has been
made in supplying special instructions to observers and students. In
the Division of Ceramics errors with reference to the age and sources
of pottery are corrected. With the public, great interest is man1-
fested in the ‘‘Synoptic Series” of the Museum, and teachers are con-
stantly receiving instructions with reference to the development of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

various lines of industrial apparatus. All the divisions of the Depart-
ment of Anthropology have been active in this regard during the past
year.

In December Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe, director of the Royal Museum of
Sweden, Stockholm, studied Polynesian. and South American col-
lections. ;

Professors H. Pittier, of Costa Rica, and C. V. Hartmann, of Stock-
holm, received instructions in casting archeological specimens in the
anthropological laboratory.

In March Dr. A. B. Hunter, of Raleigh, North Carolina, received
instructions in making casts, photographs, and other methods of
ethnological investigation with a view to studying the negro of the
South.

Mr. Wells F. Andrews, statistician of the Immigration Bureau in
the Treasury Department, made studies in the Division of Ethnology
‘n order to classify immigrants into the United States. The scheme
furnished has been adopted by the Department.

Dr. Waldemar Bogoras, of the American Museuin of Natural His-
tory, New York, made a careful examination of the Eskimo collection
in order to find Siberian material. His results will appear in the
publications of that institution.

Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, jr., and Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton
received instructions in the methods of primitive fire-making.

Dr. Carl Von den Steinen, of Berlin, made a special study of the
technological processes employed by the North American Indians,

-especially in weaving and basketry.

Subsequent to the meeting of the Society of Americanists in New
York, many of the foreign delegates visited the Museum, where a
reception was held in their honor.

Dr. E. A. Bogue made an examination of the denture in the Indian
crania.

The Curator of the Division of Ethnology finished his comprehen-
sive work on American Indian basketry and Doctor Hough submitted
for publication his monograph on the results of the Museum-Gates
expedition to Arizona in 1901, which was printed in the Annual Report
of the National Museum for that year.

Dr. A. Hrdlicka published a report on the Lansing skeleton in the
American Anthropologist for June.

An address delivered by Dr. Cyrus Adler in connection with the
opening of the semitic museum of Harvard University was published
by that institution.

Dr. I. M. Casanowicz published four papers based mainly on the col-
lections in the National Museum.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

STORAGE.

Numerous specimens have been stored in buildings outside of the
Museum, but it has been the policy of the Department not to send out
of the building any specimens which can not be replaced in case of loss.
Asa result of this policy, the crowding of the halls has become more
embarrassing. Even the offices of the curators are being used as
receptacles of valued material for which there is no present place of
storage.

Since the death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of
Prehistoric Archeology, in 1902, Mr. Holmes has given especial atten-
tion to the interests of this division and has been faithfully assisted
by Mr. E. P. Upham.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By FrepEerick W. TrRup,
Head Curator.

The principal features of the year covered by this report were the
improvement of the installation of the exhibition series, brought
about largely by placing the supervision of the work in the hands of
a single officer, and the enlargement of the quarters for the National
Herbarium. In the majority of classes the number of specimens
added to the collections was less than last year; but in scientific value
there was no appreciable decline. The number of zoological speci-
mens added was not less than 70,000, of which 9,000 were vertebrates.
About 35,000 botanical specimens were also received. Some important
improvements were made in the installation of the great zoological
study series, but the need of more space and better facilities were
keenly felt. Preparations for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St.
Louis, 1904, were actively begun, and were in an advanced condition
at the close of the year.

XXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

With the consent of the Assistant Secretary, Mr. F. A. Lucas,
Curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy, was placed in tem-
porary charge of all exhibition work of the Department, November
1, 1902, and all the taxidermists and other natural history preparators
were directed to report to him. By this change the work has been
much better coordinated than hitherto, and the results obtained dur-
ing the year have been very satisfactory. The curators of the several
divisions are still called upon to select specimens for the exhibition
series, to furnish technical information for labels, or for the use of the
preparators, etc., but they are not expected to regularly supervise the
work of the preparators or to install collections in the exhibition
cases. There has been a growing recognition among the curators of
natural history museums of the fact that the needs of the general pub-
lic and of the special student and investigator are quite diverse, and
that endeavors to combine in one series collections of interest to both
are little better than a waste of time. The general public and the gen-
eral student are only confused by a multiplicity of specimens repre-
senting small variations of one species, or illustrating small steps in a

61
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Cd

single vital process, while the special student and investigator never
has too many specimens, and can seldom make much progress with
scant material.

The principal improvements during the year were in the halls
devoted to mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and fishes. The
interior of the wall-cases of the South Hall gallery, containing Old
World mammals, was repainted to correspond in color with the cases
on the main floor and to set off the specimens properly, the color of
the unpainted burlap background having proved too dull. At the
same time the floor cases on the gallery containing the small mammals
were refitted to correspond with those below. The result has been
a creat improvement in the general appearance of the cases and visi-
bility of the collections. The very attractive group of African horse-
felled monkeys, Colobus caudatus, prepared some time ago with
specimens presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, was placed in a new
case especially adapted for properly displaying it. The specimens
were cleaned and the accessories renovated by the chief taxidermist.
On the main floor, devoted to American mammals, the south wall-cases
mentioned in last year’s report were finished and filled with South
American mammals, which are now installed in a satisfactory manner.
No room has as yet been found, however, for such large forms as the
tapir, pampas deer, etc. The majority of the floor-cases were furnished
with new fittings, uniform in design and color. The group of Rocky
Mountain sheep made originally for the World’s Columbian Exposi-
tion, 1893, was taken from storage and erected at the northwest cor-
ner of the hall. The artificial rock-work was cut down and partially
remodeled and the specimens renovated by the chief taxidermist.
This completes the representation by groups of the principal large
ruminants of North America, except that space has not been found for
the White Goat group. The intention is to let this take the place of
one of the two caribou groups. Numerous small mammals were
added to the general North American series. A number of large
mammals were mounted during the year for the St. Louis Exposition,
but will not be displayed in Washington until the close of the exposi-
tion. New uniform printed labels for the entire American series of
small mammals, revised and brought up to date as regards nomencla-
ture, etc., were printed and placed with the specimens during the
year. The labels for the Old World series were also revised, and,
where necessary, new ones were prepared, printed, and put on the
specimens. The entire mammal exhibit, therefore, with a few excep-
tions in some groups, is now thoroughly and satisfactorily labeled.
The Indian rhinoceros, which had been on exhibition for many years,
was withdrawn, as it had become unsightly through the cracking of
the skin and could not be repaired satisfactorily.

In the hall in the Smithsonian building devoted to the lower inverte-
brates the interiors of all the wall-cases were repainted. As these
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

cases, for the most part, contain corals, it was decided to use black for
the background as best suited to bring the specimens into relief. The
corals and sponges were rearranged and some specimens added to the
general North American series.

Tn the insect hall the exhibit of North American species was extended
by the addition of representatives of the orders Lepidoptera, Euplex-
optera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera.

After the collection of fishes exhibited at the Pan-American Expo-
sition, Buffalo, 1901, was returned, a reclassification of all the casts
was made, the series being divided into two sections—marine fishes
and fresh-water fishes. The cases standing against the walls were
reconstructed and furnished with large glass and paneled bases, so as
to present a uniform appearance around the*hall. A large shark and
several other fishes of very large size were placed on top of the cases
and provided with new framed labels. The descriptive labels used at
Buffalo were mounted on standards of uniform design and placed
beside the species to which they refer. The series now exhibited, aside
from the small representation of deep-sea fishes, is entirely North
American. While it is desired to exhibit various series from other
parts of the world, there is not sufficient room for this purpose in the
present quarters. For this reason the South American fishes preserved
in formalin have been temporarily withdrawn. These preparations
were in quite good condition when last examined, but they are not
entirely satisfactory for exhibition on account of the bleaching of the
colors, dullness of the eyes, etc. Experiments were made during the
year in casting from formalin specimens. The results were quite satis-
factory, and it is believed that a series of casts made in this way and
painted might prove best for a permanent exhibit. A number of
molds of fishes and some casts of large fishes, which have been used by
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries in connection with
various expositions, were transferred to the Museum by the Commis-
sioner. Several of these casts were repaired and placed on exhibition,
as already mentioned.

All the labels for the reptiles and batrachians were reprinted in the
same style as the mammal labels, the object being to have all the faunal
labels uniform as regards matter and general appearance. Instead of
the particular locality in which a specimen exhibited was obtained,
these labels contain a brief statement of the geographical range of the
species represented, together of course with the common and scientific
names, the catalogue number of the specimen, and in the case of gifts,
the name of the donors. Specimens received from Government sur-
veys are labeled with the names of the organizations which transmitted
them.

Few changes of importance were made in connection with the
exhibits of birds and mollusks, but copy was prepared for new labels
for the entire North American series of birds. The labels had not
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

been printed when the year closed. The groups of birds, 16 in num-
ber, which were originally made for various expositions, were over-
hauled, and the cases made dust tight as far as possible and provided
with new framed labels. Under present conditions it is not deemed
expedient to build new cases for these groups. The beautiful speci-
mens of the Argus pheasant presented some time ago by Dr. W. L.
Abbott, were brought together by the taxidermists in the form of a
eroup, with ground-work, and placed ina new case. This group is one
of the most attractive and interesting objects in the entire exhibition
series. The baseboards of all the large alcove-cases were repainted.

In order to find room for the enlargement of the National Herba-
rium it became necessary to abandon the limited space on the Kast
Hall gallery previously allotted for botanical exhibits. This was done
most reluctantly, but in view of the necessities of the case it was
deemed unavoidable. With this change the Museum definitely aban-
doned making botanical exhibits for the present, but with the hope
that after the new building provided for by Congress is erected, abun-
dant room will be found for such collections.

During the year each of the exhibition halls was provided with a
large sign, calling attention in a few words to its contents, as for
example, ‘‘Lower Invertebrates,” ‘‘American Mammals,” ete. In
addition, uniform framed case labels, about 200 in number, were
provided for all the cases containing mammals, birds, reptiles,
batrachians, insects, and lower invertebrates. The series of case
labels for the exhibit of comparative anatomy was also completed.

A considerable number of requests were received during the year
for photographs of various groups and single objects in the exhibi-
tion series, chiefly for purposes of publication. The Bureau of
Engraving and Printing made photographs and sketches of the
mounted bison as a basis for the figure of that animal placed on
the new ten-dollar bill. An American eagle was mounted in a special
attitude for a similar purpose. Prof. M. M. Metealf, of the Woman’s
College of Baltimore, made a number of photographs of skeletons
and other objects for a forthcoming work on evolution. Dr. D. G.
Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, obtained photo-
graphs of certain whale skulls for a work on the mammals of Central
America. . :

EXPLORATIONS.

In the spring of 1903, Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Messrs.
William Palmer and J. W. Scollick, visited one of the stations of the
Cabot Steam Whaling Company, Newfoundland, to obtain a large whale
for the St. Louis Exposition. Toward the close of the fiscal year Mr.
Lucas reported that the skeleton and casts of the exterior of a sulphur-
bottom whale, about 75 feet long, had been obtained. By invitation
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

of the Geographical Society of Baltimore, Messrs. B. A. Bean and
J. H. Riley accompanied the expedition of the society to the Bahamas
to collect aquatic and land vertebrates. By invitation of Dr. L. O.
Howard, Dr. H. G. Dyar, accompanied by Mr. R. P. Currie, of the
National Museum, and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agri-
culture, made an expedition to British Columbia to collect insects, and
especially mosquitoes, under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution.
Mr. G. 8S. Miller, jr., spent a few weeks in collecting small mammals
in the vicinity of Hampton, Virginia. Messrs. Richmond, Ashmead,
Bartsch, and Currie spent some days in Philadelphia in the study of
the zoological collections of the Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Rose
visited the Museum of the New York Botanical Garden. Mr. W. R.
Maxon spent two months in Jamaica (April and May, 1903), where
he made a very large collection of plants, and especially of ferns.
He also obtained some fine examples of the large white ant nests found
in the island.

ACCESSIONS.

The accessions of the year, considered as separate lots of varying
sizes received from different sources, were considerably less than last
year, except in the Division of Plants and the Section of Birds’ Eggs.
The accessions of plants were greater in number than in any year since
1895, being in all 575, but the number of specimens comprised in them
was less than in the previous year, viz, about 53,500 specimens in
1902, and about 35,000 in 1903. The accessions of birds’ eggs, on the
contrary ; seareeci a more specimens than in 1902. The whole num-
ber of cena specimens received during the year was, as already
stated, about 70,000; of plants about 35,000 specimens. A notable and
most important one of the accessions was an increase in the num-
ber of types and cotypes presented, which comprise insects, fishes,
birds, and crustaceans. Among the largest zoological accessions
received were a collection of about 19,000 gall wasps and parasites
made in Canada, and transmitted by the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture; about 4,000 Costa Rican insects, purchased from Mr. P. Schild,
of Hamburg, Germany; about 2,000 Chilean insects, presented by
Mr. E. C. Reed, of Concepcion; a collection of about 2,000 fish, birds’
eos, sacllineis, and other marine invertebrates from the Hawaiian
Islands, transmitted by the U. 8. Fish Commission; a collection com-
prising about 1,500 birds’ eggs, insects and mammals from Paraguay;
the East Indian collections of Dr. Abbott, consisting of more than
1,200 mammals, birds, reptiles, ete. Considering the character of Dr.
Abbott’ s collections, which contain hundreds of sarurneceile they should
perhaps have been meen first, as it is obviously more difficult to
assemble large numbers of these animals than of any other class. The
largest collection of plants received during the year was one made by

5

NAT mus 1903
66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, in the Yellowstone National Park. It
comprises about 5,800 specimens, and was very generously donated to
the Museum by the collector. This is probably the largest scientific
collection of plants ever made in the park. Next in size was the col-
lection made by Mr. William R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in
Jamaica, comprising about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns.

It is a pleasure to record the continued activity of Dr. W. L.
Abbott in the exploration of the Kast Indies. The collections received
during the year were chiefly from the coast and islands of northwest-
ern Sumatra, as far south as Siboga, and from the Riou Peninsula, just
south of Singapore. They comprise, as already mentioned, mammals,
birds, reptiles, and batrachians, fishes, and insects. The Sumatran
mammals, about 500 in number, were studied by Mr. G. 8. Miller, jr.,
who discovered among them a new ape (A/acacus fuscus), four new
species of mouse deer (genus Z7agu/us), nine new squirrels, a new genus
and five new species of mice, and a new porcupine (Zrichys macrotis).
The birds from the same region also comprised about 500 specimens,
representing 152 species, of which 19 were found by Dr. C. W. Rich-
mond to be new to science. The collections from Pahang and the
Riou Archipelago have already yielded four new species of mouse
deer, and are probably as important as the preceding one for the light
they will throw on the distribution of Malayan species. The National
Museum has received from Dr. Abbott, since the beginning of his
explorations in the East Indies, no less than 2,500 mammals, 3,900
birds, 800 reptiles and batrachians, besides very numerous specimens
of other classes.

In 1902 the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer A/batross was sent to
the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of continuing the investigation
of the fisheries. In the course of this work large collections were
made in various branches of natural history and transmitted to the
Museum. Those received during the year covered by this report were
a valuable collection of birds’ eggs, about 1,500 marine mollusks in
alcohol, many new to the Government collections, and about 100 species
apparently undescribed; a collection of corals, and a second lot of
crustaceans. The Commission also transmitted a collection of 85 birds,
mainly from Laysan Island, north of Hawaii, including the type of a
tern, Procelsterma saxatilis Fisher. From the Albatross Samoan Expe-
dition of 1902 were received corals and crustaceans in addition to the
specimens transmitted last year. The Commission also furnished
about 800 specimens of the commoner species of marine invertebrates
of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, for distribution to educational estab-
lishments, together with a small collection of fishes from the same
locality, a specimen of the Tile fish (Lopholatilus), from 70 miles off
Nomans Land, the type and cotype of a new species of white-fish
( Coregonus stanleyi), from Aroostook County, Maine, and a cotype of
anew fish (//adropterus evermanni), from Tippecanoe Lake, Indiana.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, of East Las Vegas, New Mexico, pre-
sented eight lots of insects of different orders, containing many new
species, and including types and cotypes of species described by him;
also three lots of amphipod crustaceans and leeches, the former rep-
resenting a new form found in a warm spring.

An interesting collection of reptiles and batrachians from northern
Mexico and North Carolina was purchased from Brimley Brothers,
Raleigh, North Carolina. It contained a series of a salamander
(Desmognathus quadrimaculata), which had not been recognized since
Holbrook’s time. From the same source was obtained a small collec-
tion of North Carolina fishes, one of which was found to be unde-
scribed and was named Wotropis brimleyt by Mr. B. A. Bean; also
eight specimens of the very rare skipper, Pamphila carolina Skinner.

Among the most important purchases of the year were the zoological
collections made by Mr. William Foster in the vicinity of Sapucay,
a small town near Ascuncion, Paraguay. They comprise about 800
insects, 600 birds’ eggs, and 350 small mammals. The mammals were
principally bats. The specimens were all carefully prepared and
labeled and filled important gaps in the Government collections.

Mammals.—In addition to Dr. Abbott’s East Indian mammals and
chose from Paraguay just mentioned, the Museum received several
other accessions which deserve mention. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S.
Army, added to his generous donations of previous years two collec-
tions of small mammals, one from the Yellowstone Park, comprising
about 300 specimens, and the other from Fort Snelling, Minnesota,
comprising about 200 specimens. The collections of Kuropean small
mammals, already very rich, was increased by two collections, one
from Switzerland and one from Norway. An excellent series of
Japanese rodents and bats, purchased during the year, represents the
first well-prepared collection of mammals received by the Museum
from that country. Mr. B. 8. Rairden, United States Consul at
Batavia, Java, obtained for the Museum two specimens of a Javan
mouse-deer, which proved to be an undescribed species of much inter-
est, and was named Zragulus focalinus by Mr. G.S. Miller, jr. A
somewhat imperfect but very valuable skeleton of a peculiar porpoise
from the Hawaiian Islands was presented by Prof. Charles H. Gilbert
of the Stanford University. It represents the species Pseudorcu cras-
sidens, a form intermediate between the killers and blackfish, which
has not been obtained hitherto from the vicinity of the Hawaiian
Islands.

Birds.—Mr. Homer Davenport, of Morris Plains, New Jersey, pre-
sented to the Museum during the year 22 large and valuable birds
from his extensive aviary, among which were an Australian Goose, a
Javan Jungle-fowl, a Black-winged Peacock, Pavonigripennis, regarded
by some zoologists as a distinct species, and several beautiful pheas-
ants, including Diard’s Fire-back Pheasant, Lophura diard:. From

65 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Mr. A. Boucard were purchased two rare birds of paradise, Paradisea
quilielmi and Rhipidornis guiliedmi-I1I. A pair of rare flightless
cormorants from the Galapagos Islands, and about 300 birds from
this group and the islands off the west coast of Mexico, including a
series of Vesomimus trifasciatus, were also purchased. The Bishop
Museum, Honolulu, presented a collection of the birds of Guam, com-
posing about 44 specimens, representing species not previously con-
tained in the Government collection. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston,
presented about 50 desirable Honduras birds, and about 800 specimens
from Chiriqui, Costa Rica, were obtained from him in exchange. The
Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, transmitted a
fine collection of birds’ eggs from different parts of North America.

Reptiles and batrachians.—Messrs. Brimley and Sherman presented
a fine series of salamanders from North Carolina, and Mr. E. J. Brown
a number of rare reptiles from southern Florida. In a small collec-
tion from Cocos Island, Costa Rica, presented by Prof. P. Biolley,
were five specimens of a new gecko, described by Doctor Stejneger
under the name of Spherodactylus pacificus.

Fishes.—The accessions of fishes were remarkable on account of the
number of type specimens and cotypes included among them. An
especially important accession consisted of 42 types of species of
Hawaiian fishes, collected in 1889 and described by Dr. O. P. Jenkins,
of Stanford University. These were donated to the Museum by Doc-
tor Jenkins, and are # continuation of the series presented in 1901. A
collection of Japanese fishes, comprising 75 species, of which 3 were
represented by types and 16 by cotvpes, was presented by Stanford
University. They were collected by President D. 8. Jordan, by the
University of Tokyo, and by K. Otaki. Included with them were the
types of Bryostemma tarsodes and Bryolophus lysimus, two species
obtained near Unalaska Island by the A/butross. The types of the Jap-
anese species Draconetta xenica and Cyttopsis itea were also received
during the year.

Among single specimens of interest should be mentioned a very large
pipe-fish, /%stularia tabaccaria, 44 feet long, from Campeche Bank,
Mexico, presented by E. E. Saunders & Co. Dr. S. Wier Mitchell
presented a large salmon weighing 47 pounds, taken by him at Cas-
capedia, Quebec. Casts of this fine fish and of the pipe-fish were made
for the exhibition series. A deep-sea pelican-fish, genus Gastrostomus,
was received during the year from the U.S. S. Vero. It was obtained
during the survey for the trans-Pacific cable at a depth of between
2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. Mr. Louis Mobray, of Bermuda, obtained
a living specimen of the large Conger eel, Channomurena vittata, and
sent it to the New York Aquarium. Upon its death, which oecurred
in a few months, it was sent to the Museum by the director of the
aquarium, at the suggestion of Prof. C. L. Bristol. Dr. J. C. Thomp-

rc
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

son, U. S. Navy, presented a small but interesting collection of fishes
from the Dry Tortugas, Florida. The accessions from the U. 8.
Fish Commission and from Mr. H. H. Brimley have been already
mentioned. (See pp. 65 and 67.)

Mollusks.—In addition to the collections of the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion, already referred to, mention should be made of the donations of
two constant contributors to the Museum, Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd and
Rey. H. Loomis. Mrs. Oldroyd presented about 150 marine shells
from California in exceptionally fine condition, and Mr. Loomis’s
specimens of about 50 species from Japan and the Loochoo Islands
included many desiderata. California shells were also presented by
Mr. F. A. Woodworth, of San Francisco, and Hawatian land shells
by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii. A second consignment of
land and fresh-water shells from central Asia was received from the
Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia. Among single
specimens of special value should be mentioned a fine Voluta mamilla,
a large and very rare shell from Tasmania. A collection of Australian
land and fresh-water shells, comprising species not previously repre-
sented in the Museum, was purchased.

Insects.—The three largest accessions of insects—the U. 8. Depart-
ment of Agriculture collection from Canada (18,947 specimens), the
Costa Rican collection purchased of P. Schild (4,000 specimens), and
the collection from Chili presented by Mr. E. C. Reed (2,021 speci-
mens)-—have already been mentioned. Many of the remaining acces-
sions, 254 in number, contain material of great interest and value, but
it is obviously impossible to refer in detail to more than a few of
them in this report. (For a complete list see Appendix II.) One
of the most important was a collection of African butterflies received
in exchange from the Royal Natural History Museum, Stockholm,
which included examples of many species described by Doctor Auri-
villius. Another important exchange was effected with the American
Entomological Society, through which the Museum received examples
of about 100 species of Mexican and Central American Hymenoptera,
many of them cotypes of species described by Mr. Cresson. Prof.
Charles Robertson, of Carlenville, Illinois, presented cotypes of 19
species of Hyimenoptera described by him. A similar collection of
Coleoptera, presented by Prof. H. C. Fall, of Pasadena, California,
contained 34 cotypes of his species. A collection of mites, containing
types and cotypes, was presented by Prof. Robert H. Wolcott, of the
University of Nebraska.

Lower invertebrates.—The accessions of lower invertebrates, like
those of fishes, are noteworthy on account of the number of types and
cotypes included among them. The collections transmitted by the
U. 8. Fish Commission have been already mentioned. From the
Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France, was received a valuable
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

exchange comprising about 50 species of fresh-water crabs, nearly all
of which were previously unrepresented in the Government collection.
Many of the specimens were cotypes. The Stanford University pre-
sented a series of desirable specimens of Japanese crustaceans col-
lected by Doctor Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder in 1900. It included
several species previously undescribed. A small but interesting col-
lection of crustaceans from the Maldive Islands, including several
cotypes, was received in exchange from the Museum of Comparative
Zoology. They were collected by Doctor Agassiz and party in 1901-2.
Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the University of Michigan, presented 14 lots of
New England amphipod crustaceans, among which were types of sev-
eral species. Two smaller lots, with representations of other orders
of crustaceans from Costa Rica and Cocos Island, were presented by
the Museo Nacional, of San José, Costa Rica. Among them were
types of species of amphipods described by T. R. Rk. Stebbings. Four
lots of isopod crustaceans, including types, were presented by the
Harriman Alaskan expedition. Dr. C. H. Kigenmann, of the Indiana
State University, presented specimens of 4 species of crustaceans from
Cuba, including types of 8 species.

A yaluable collection of European parasites, comprising trematodes,
cestodes, and nematodes, was received by the Bureau of Animal
Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and catalogued in the
section of helminthological collections, National Museum. The Mu-
seum received a collection of parasites of fishes from Prof. Edwin
Linton, of Washington, Pennsylvania. The study collection of para-
sites is considered the finest scientific collection of the kind now existing
in the United States.

Plants.—The total number of accessions to the National Herbarium
during the year was 595, a number which has not been reached for the
last eight years. Of this number, 120 accessions, comprising about
5,000 specimens, were received through the U. S. Department of
Agriculture.

Doctor Mearns’s large collection from the Yellowstone National
Park, which constituted the most extensive accession of the year, has
already been mentioned. Probably next in interest is the collection
made by Mr. W. R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in Jamaica, which
comprised about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns. Two important col-
lections from the Philippine Islands, comprising about 1,400 specimens,
were received in exchange from the Insular Bureau of Agriculture,
Manila. These are belieyed to be the first collections from the islands
made by American botanists. Another collection of Philippine plants,
comprising about 1,000 specimens, was received from the Royal Botani-
val Gardens, Kew, England, in continuation of an exchange with that
institution. Capt. J. Donnell Smith has continued his valuable dona-
tions of West Indian and Central American plants. He presented
during the year a sixth series, consisting of 3875 specimens.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

Purchases of plants to the amount of $1,000 were made during the
year. The most important items were continuations of the California
collections of Mr. A. A. Heller (1,055 specimens) and the Nevada col-
lection of Prof. C. F. Baker (481 specimens). Other purchases were
as follows: Plants in the United States (3,223 specimens), viz, Maine
(639), California and Arizona (989), Georgia (497), Ohio (405), Missis-
sippi (693); plants from Central and South America, viz, Mexico (296),
Costa Rica (452), Venezuela (256).

Of the plants transmitted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture
during the year, the most important are the collections of Messrs.
I’, A. Walpole and W. W. Gorman from Alaska (1,323 specimens) and
those of Messrs. F. V. Coville, V. K. Chesnut, David Griffiths, and
others, from Washington, Oregon, and California (1,368 specimens).

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES.

In the Division of Mammals about 3,000 skulls of small species were
cleaned during the year, two-thirds of which were those belonging to
specimens in the collection of the Biological Survey, U.S. Department
of Agriculture. All the large skulls of the regular Museum series,
with the exception of about 100, have been cleaned, but about 1,500
small skulls still need cleaning. Little could be done toward continu-
ing the rearrangement of the skins of small species for lack of room
and cases, but the work of making over skins which were deteriorating
on account of faulty preparation progressed satisfactorily, about 406
skins having been renovated during the year. It is a cause of much
regret that nothing could be done toward improving the condition of
the large skins in vats and in the cases of the upper laboratory, many
of which are in imminent danger of destruction. ‘There are known to
be from 1,000 to 1,500 of the size of a wolf and upward which need
attention. Some of these are large antelopes and other important
mammals which are now difficult to obtain. The collection of mam-
mals in alcohol was thoroughly overhauled, and is in an excellent con-
dition as regards both preservation and arrangement. The large
storage case behind the wall case in the South Hall, used for the storage
of mammal skulls, was roofed over to exclude dust, and provided with
shelving. It is intended to fit the alcoves with standard racks and
drawers next year for the better installation of the valuable series of
skulls kept there.

The laboratories of the Division of Birds are much overcrowded,
and many devices have to be resorted to in order to accommodate the
collections. It has been found necessary to place different parts of
the collections in rooms widely separated, which greatly increases the
difficulties of administration. Some little improvement was made in
the arrangement of the collection of large birds in the west basement,
but progress was slow on account of insufficient help and space. It is
2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

a satisfaction to report that the Passerine birds, which are the ones
most consulted, are at present well arranged and entirely accessible.
About half the study collection, comprising, perhaps, 65,000 specimens,
is without standard Museum labels, and many of the water birds need
new labels. Some progress in replacing worn out labels was made
during the year.

The condition of the collection of birds’ eggs is very satisfactory.
For a collection of such great size the proportion of perfect specimens
is remarkably large. Considerable progress was made in the rearrange-
ment of both eggs and nests, but more new cases will be required
before it can be completed.

The curator of the Division of Reptilesand Batrachians was without
assistants this year until April, and progress in the rearrangement of
the study series was necessarily slow. A considerable advance has
been made, however,and the collection is now in good condition and
its accessibility increased.

In the Division of Fishes, the principal operation was the prepara-
tion of aseries of 50 sets of specimens for distribution to educational
institutions. These sets average about sixty species each, making a
total of some 3,250 individual specimens in all. Until the staff of this
division is increased, little can be done beyond keeping the collection
from deteriorating.

The study series of mollusks is all in fairly good condition and is
accessible, so that any specimens wanted can be brought to hand ina
few moments. The collection of Naiades was put in perfect order,
and the cataloguing and numbering of the boxes of duplicates brought
up to date. The remainder of the Jeffreys collection of shells is now
most in need of attention. On account of the intricacies of the case
the work can not be done rapidly. As in other divisions the need of
more space is keenly felt.

The great systematic collection of insects of all orders, with the
exception of the Rhynchota, is at present in excellent condition, well
arranged, and accessible to students. The curator of the Division of
Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard, reports as follows on the work of the
division: :

The insect collections are in excellent condition, increasing rapidly in the differ-
ent orders, and all being rearranged in the standard insect drawers, in systematic
order. It is believed, if the same liberality is continued in supplying us with these
standard insect drawers as last year, that the valuable collections in the different
orders will be soon safely secured and permanently rearranged.

The Lepidoptera are now all arranged in these drawers and this order is in excel-
vent shape. This work has been done almost entirely by Doctor Dyar, who deserves
great credit, not only for making many additions to the collection through his friends
and correspondents, but also for putting the collection in such admirable order.

Mr. E. A. Schwarz still continues the rearrangement of the beetles, and during the
past few months has rearranged several families down to the Lampyride. It will,
however, be a long time before this large order can be rearranged, and Mr. Schwarz
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

will require many more drawers before his task is completed. In a few days he will
begin arranging the material from the Philippines, West Indies, and South America.

Dr. Ashmead is almost continuously at work on the Hymenoptera, and has rear-
ranged the Chalcidoidea and part of the Cynipoidea. If room No. 3, now occupied by
him, is fitted up with racks to contain standard insect drawers he could, the com-
ing year, rearrange this whole order in these drawers. He considers it important
that this be done immediately to more securely conserve the many hundreds of val-
uable types and cotypes represented in the collection.

The Schmidt boxes, in which many types are still kept, he considers unsafe for
keeping valuable types. Hundreds of types and cotypes are now being sent to us
from all over the world and proper facilities must be provided for the present pres-
ervation of all types intrusted to the Museum.

Mr. Currie still continues his work on the Neuropteroid insects and has made some
important additions to the orders Odonata, Neuroptera, and Trichoptera.

The Orthoptera have been removed to Dr. Dyar’s room and have been rearranged
into the standard insect drawers by Mr. Caudell, who has done much work on these
insects, made large additions of specimens, and is substantially in charge of the order.

Mr. Coquillett also continues his work on the Diptera with indefatigable industry
and has worked up, named, and rearranged several families. The additions to the
family Culicidz, or the mosquitoes, are especially large and noteworthy.

Very little work is being done in the other orders of insects not mentioned,
although Mr. Heidemann finds time to do something occasionally with the Rhynchota.

Our collection of Rhynchota, or bugs (Hemiptera and Homoptera), is large and
valuable, and should be placed immediately in charge of a competent specialist.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates a special cataloguer was
employed for four months to bring up the cataloguing of the crusta-
ceans, holothurians, etc., which had fallen behind on account of lack of
sufficient clerical assistance. One hundred new sets of duplicate inver-
tebrates were prepared for distribution to accademical establishments.
Some small sets were also prepared to meet special demands. The
extensive collections in alcohol were thoroughly overhauled, the bot-
tles replenished and new labels added where necessary. This impor-
tant part of the zoological collections is now in good condition.
Additional shelving was provided for the collection of anomuran crus-
taceans and worms in the rooms assigned in the north tower of the
Smithsonian building. The Museum benefited by the gratuitous
services of Mr. T. W. Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, who
rearranged the collection of corals so as to make room for the reception
of recent additions.

The scope of the Section of Helminthological Collections, under the
custodianship of Dr. C. W. Stiles, was enlarged during the year by
the introduction into the catalogues of the collections of the U. 5.
Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service. The collections of the
Division of Zoology, Bureau of Animal Industry, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, are also catalogued in this section of the Museum.

The need of enlarging the quarters for the National Herbarium was
so urgent that the space allotted for an exhibition on the east hall bal-
cony was, as already stated, added -to the laboratory. One hundred
and eleven new standard insect-proof cases were added during the year,
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

making a total of 225 now in use. About 125 additional cases will be
required to complete the reinstallment of the herbarium, and it is
hoped that these can be provided next year. The Honorary Curator,
Mr. F. V. Coville, reports as follows regarding the work done on the
collections during the year:

During the year we haye added 111 standard insect-proof cases, making 255 now
in use. It is hoped that some 125 new cases will be built during the coming year,
which will about complete the installation of the collection. It will then be ina
better condition than ever before. Very few insects are to be found in our new cases.

At the time the herbarium was actually transferred to the National Museum, July
1, 1894, we began to stamp every herbarium sheet added to the collection. It was
assumed that there were then not less than 200,000 sheets in the herbarium, and the
stamp therefore was set at 200,000. The number of specimens stamped and added to
the herbarium since then is 220,000. Of these 17,055 have been added this year.

The work of recording the old part of the herbarium has almost ceased and speci-
mens are only stamped in cases where they are sent away as a loan. This record
extends from 1 to 27,218. In addition to this, 125,001 to 156,835 have been stamped.

It was decided at the close of the year that all the herbarium sheets
hereafter printed should bear the legend ‘‘ United States National
Museum” as well as the impress of the numbering stamp, which bears
the words ‘* United States National Herbarium.”

Blueprints of the standard herbarium cases adopted by the Museum
were sent by request to the chief of the Insular Bureau of Agriculture,
Manila. :

At the suggestion of Dr. C. W. Stiles the matter of imperfections in
the red labels used inside of receptacles containing type specimens of
animals preserved in liquid was taken up by a special committee.
The committee submitted a report recommending the sole use of
labels printed with a permanent ink containing sulphide of mercury.

LOAN OF COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS.

The loan of specimens to specialists in the United States and in
foreign countries for purposes of scientific research continued during
the year as usual. Only the more important transactions of this char-
acter can be noticed in this report. As explained last year, the Museum
usually benefits quite as much by these transactions as the persons who
obtain the-use of the material, as the specimens are studied, identified,
and also quite commonly labeled. The results of the investigations
are sometimes published by the Museum, sometimes by the scientific
organizations to which the specialists belong, and sometimes under
private auspices.

In the Division of Birds, 11 loans were made, comprising 188 speci-
mens. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural
History, obtained the use of 68 specimens, chiefly shore larks, genus
Otocoris. Forty-five specimens of warblers, genus Dendroica, were
sent to Mr. Joseph Grinnell, of Palo Alto, California, to assist him

in determining the California forms of ). aestiva. Dr. Jonathan
Dwight, jr., obtained the loan of 29 specimens of plovers (genus
Aegialitis) for use in connection with his studies of the molting of
birds. All the lots sent out, with one exception, were returned dur-
ing the year. The loans of mammals were more numerous, amounting
in all to 29 lots, comprising about 300 specimens. Dr. J. A. Allen
obtained the use of 110 specimens of seals and other mammals for use
in his work on the mammals of eastern Siberia. Forty-one specimens
were sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn to assist him in the preparation of a
report on the mammals of southern New Mexico and western Texas,
and 14 bats, of the genus Vyct/nomus, for use in identifying bats of that
genus from the Bahama Islands. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Colum-
bian Museum, borrowed 35 specimens in connection with his work on
Central American mammats. Other loans were chiefly to the scientific
assistants in the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture. The
majority of the material was returned during the year. The mollusks,
of the family Achatinellidx, loaned to the late Alpheus Hyatt, were
transferred after his death to Prof. A. T. Mayer, who is engaged in
completing the work left unfinished by Professor Hyatt. Of insects,
9 loans were made, the most important being a collection of 626
Orthoptera and Dermaptera, which was sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of
Philadelphia. Dr. Philip P. Calvert, of Philadelphia, received 285
specimens of dragon flies (Odonata), and Dr. E. P. Felt, of Albany,
New York, 106 specimens of ophionid hymenoptera. The material
loaned was, for the most part, still in the hands of the specialists at the
close of the year. Of marine invertebrates, exclusive of mollusks, 9
loans were made, 2 of which deserve mention. Prof. H. Coutiére, of
the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie, Paris, received the crustaceans of
the family Alpheide collected by the Hawaiian and Samoan expedi-
tions of the Fish Commission steamer A/batross, and also the general
Museum collections of that family for report. All the specimens of
the so-called //olothuria atra were sent to Prof. Charles L. Edwards,
of Trinity College, in connection with his studies of variation. The
stomatopod crustaceans, collected by the staff of the steamer A/batross
in Hawaii and Samoa, were sent to Dr. R. P. Bigelow, of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, who volunteered to report on them.
Three lots of ostracoda were sent to Mr. R. W. Sharpe, of Wilmette,
Illinois, who has undertaken to report on this group for the Museum.

A number of skulls of mammals were sent to Dr. J. M. Ingersoll,
of New York, who is engaged in a comparative study of the sinuses of
the nose. Plants were loaned during the year, chiefly to the botanists
of the Ames Botanical Laboratory, North Easton, Massachusetts, the
Biltmore Herbarium, the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University, the
New York Botanical Garden, and to Dr. C. E. Waters, Mr. Karl W.

MF,

Wiegand, and Mrs. Caroline W. Harris.

6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

As already stated, 100 new sets of marine invertebrates from the
duplicate collections, were made up during the year, for distribution
to educational establishments, in accordance with the long-standing
practice of the Museum. Each set contained about 200 specimens,
representing from 92 to 99 species, making in all about 20,000 speci-
mens. During the year 50 of these sets were distributed. About
one-half of them were sent to high schools and other public schools
throughout the United States, and the remainder to various universi-
ties, colleges, normal schools, public libraries, seminaries, academies,
training schools, and science clubs.

About 50 sets of fishes were also made up for distribution.

A series of 60 skins of monkevs, and some other mammals which
were without data as regards localities, etc., and hence of no especial
value in the study collection of the Division of Mammals, were dis-
tributed to four colleges. which signified their desire to make use of
the material in teaching.

LABORATORY USE OF COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS.

The collections of mammals, birds, insects and plants were frequently
consulted by the naturalists of the U. S$. Department of Agriculture,
as in previous years. Mrs. Vernon Bailey pursued studies of birds in
connection with her book on birds of the Western United States.
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, examined the collections of neotropi-
val birds, and the committee on nomenclature, of the American Orni-
thologists Union, examined a large amount of material for the purpose
of ascertaining, as in past years, the status of newly described North
American species. The series of Old World chameleons was studied
by Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has in
preparation a monographic work on these reptiles. In an endeavor
to establish the real status of the snake, knownas Tropidonotus erythro-
gaster, Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigan, made compari-
sons of specimens in the Museum. Comparisons of insects were made
by the following entomologists: Prof. John B. Smith (Noctuidae),
Dr. W. J. Holland (Moths), Dr. J. A. G. Rehn (Orthoptera), Mr. J. C.
Bradley (parasitic hymenoptera and sawflies), Mr. H. H. Ballou
(Specidae). Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany, examined the
collections of Coleoptera and identified some of the exotic material.
He spoke highly of the work of the late Martin L. Linell, who was for
many years an aid in the Division of Insects.

As for some years past, Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the New York
Botanical Garden, was a frequent visitor to the herbarium. During
the past year he was principally interested in studying the Crassula-
ceae. Dr. E. L. Greene spent much time in reviewing certain of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. (fp
Papaveraceae, and Mr. Theodor Holm, the Carices. Dr. L. M. Under-
wood, of Columbia University, examined the collections of ferns.

Inquiries were received from Stanford University concerning the
methods of cataloguing and labeling employed in the Department, and
were answered as fully as circumstances would permit.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS.

This very important branch of the work of the Department, the founda-
tion, indeed, and the final aim of all its other activities, was carried on with
no less ardor than in previous years. The segregation of work on the
exhibition series, explained in a preceding page, left the scientific
staff somewhat more time in which to pursue investigations, while the
activity of systematists in various parts of the country, involving the
use of the Government collections, showed no abatement.

It is only possible in this place to mention some of the more impor-
tant investigations carried on by the members of the scientific staff of
the Museum. A complete list of all papers based on the Museum col-
lections published by the staff for the year will be found in Appendix II
of this volume. It is interesting to note that the articles exceed 150
in number, and appeared in about thirty different journals, including
the following: Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, Bulletin of
the U. S. National Museum, Proceedings of the Biological Society of
Washington, Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, Science Yearbook of the Carnegie Institution, The Auk,
Naturen, Nautilus, American Journal of Pharmacy, Journal of Con-
chology, Smithsonian Report, Biographical Memoirs of the National
Academy of Sciences, Canadian Entomologist, Journal of the New
York Entomological Society, Psyche, Proceedings of the Entomolog-
ical Society of Washington, Entomological News, Transactions of the
Entomological Society, Country Life in America, Bulletin of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology, Zoologischer Anzeiger, Public
Health Report, Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. 8.
Department of Agriculture, American Medicine, Bulletin of the
Hygienic Laboratory, U. 8. Public Health Service, Journal of Com-
parative Medicine, Contributions from the National Herbarium, Annats
of Botany, Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Plant World, and
Fern Bulletin.

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s extensive manual of
North and Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and
22 plates, was published during the year. It deals with the families
of Tanagers, Troupials, Honey Creepers, and Wood Warblers (Tana-
grid, Icteridee, Coerebidee, and Mniotiltide), comprising 77 genera
and 433 species and subspecies.

The preparation of the third volume, covering 15 families, was in an
advanced stage at the close of the year, about 400 pages being already
78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

in type. Dr. Charles W. Richmond’s paper on the birds collected by
Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss in the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands was published by the Museum during the year. Doctor
Richmond spent considerable time in identifying the Abbott collection
of birds for the west coast of Sumatra and in working up a collection
from the South Pacific. He continued work on the card catalogue of
the genera and species of birds. ‘Two papers on South American birds
in the Museum collection, by Mr. H. C. Oberholser, appeared during
the year, and also one by Dr. W. K. Fisher on a new tern from the
Hawaiian Islands. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation
of material for a supplementary volume on the life histories of North
American birds, with special reference to their nests and eggs, to com-
plete the important work left unfinished by the death of Major C. E.
Bendire.

Dr. L. Stejneger completed his study of the reptiles of Porto Rico,
and handed the manuscript in for publication in November. It is
hoped that means will be found for its publication at an early date.
When the year closed he was still engaged in the investigation of the
herpetological fauna of eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on
Holbrook’s salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca Moun-
tains, Arizona, were published by the Museum during the year.

In accordance with the arrangement made with President D. S.
Jordan, the Museum published during the year 14 papers on Japanese
fishes, prepared by himself and conjointly with other ichthyologists.
Two papers on the osteology of fishes, by Mr. E. C. Starks, were pub-
lished, and a brief paper by Dr. Theodore Gill on the use of the name
‘* torpedo.”

in connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks
of Florida, Dr. W. H. Dall prepared reviews of the recent mollusks
of the groups Veneride, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartide. Dr.
Bartsch continued work on the Pyramidellidae, and had nearly com-
pleted the investigation at the close of the year.

The researches carried on by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., had for their
principal object the elucidation of Doctor Abbott’s collections of East
Indian mammals. As stated on a previous page, he found in the col-
lection studied 17 new species of mouse deer, genus Tragulus, and 16
new species in other orders, together with a new genus, Lenothriv.
In going over the Museum collection of American bats, he detected 20
undescribed species, diagnoses of which are published in the Proceed-
ings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He also pre-
pared a number of notes on different species of bats and rodents.
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, made a study of the ocelots in the
Museum collection and in other collections, the results of which were
published in September, 1902, as Proceedings paper No. 1286. Dr.
M. W. Lyon, jr., completed and handed in for publication his list of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

type specimens of mammals, exclusive of cetaceans, in the collections
of the Museum. As photographs of the types are to be prepared, this
catalogue has not yet been published. It records the presence of type
specimens, or type material, of 469 species and subspecies. (This is
exclusive of the type specimens in the collection of the Biological
Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, which are probably at least
as many.) Dr. Lyon has also pursued investigations relative to the
osteology of the rabbits, and published two brief notes on other mam-
mals. The Head Curator completed his comparison of North American
and European species of whalebone whales, and toward the close of
the year submitted a manuscript of about 1,000 pages, with 50 plates.
He also prepared papers on Dr. Philippi’s species of Chilean porpoises,
on a killer whale stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of
Prodelphinus obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the com.
mon porpoise of the genus Zursiops, and on the occurrence of the
pollack whale, Balenoptera borealis, in American waters.

Doctor Ashmead continued his study of the classification of the
Chaleid flies, which was in course of publication by the Carnegie
Museum at the close of the year, and a series of papers on the wasps
of the groups Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea, was pub-
lished in the Canadian Entomologist and other entomological journals.
He continued work on his monographs of North America Braconidee, a
Philippine Hymenoptera, Japanese Hymenoptera, and also a catalogue
of North American Hymenoptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied
in identifying and arranging the Diptera, and completed a revision of
the genera of the family Empidide. A paper by him describing four
new genera and 94 new species of North America diptera appeared in
the Museum Proceedings in September, 1902. Mr. Nathan Banks
published 16 papers on spiders and on other subjects of a more general
character. A paper on dragon flies, and one on ant lions, by Mr. R. P.
Currie, were published by the Entomological Society of Washington
during the year. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of
North American Neuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant
lions. Mr. August Busck published 2 papers on the codling moth,
and one on a new species of the family Yponomentidae. His revision
of the American moths of the family Gelechiidae was published by the
Museum during the year. The Museum Proceedings for the year also
contained a paper by Dr. H. G. Dyar on the larva of moths from
Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John B. Smith’s monograph
of the moths of the family Noctuidae. Dr. J. E. Benedict published
descriptions of new species of Galatheidae, and completed a revision of
the genus Lepidopa, and descriptions of other new Albuneidae. He
also engaged in the study of the anomuran crabs from Japan and the
Hawaiian Islands, collected by the Albatross, some new crabs of the
family Dromidae, and some interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun
80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

continued work on a monograph of the fresh-water crabs, based on the
collections of the National Museum, the Muséum d’ Histoire Naturelle,
Paris, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, and
other institutions. She also published five short papers on crusta-
ceans during the year, one of which, describing new Hawaiian crabs,
appeared in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. Harriet Richardson pub-
lished descriptions of two new isopods. Two papers on crustaceans
collected in and near Mammoth Cave and Nickajack Cave, by Prof.
W. P. Hay, were published by the Museum.

Dr. Charles B. Wilson completed his study of the collection of
North American copepod crustaceans of the family Argulide, the
results of which were published by the Museum as Proceedings paper
No. 1302. It occupies 107 pages, and includes a review of all the
species of the family and a bibliography, and is accompanied by 20
plates.

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of Helminthological Collections, made
an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among the
people of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the attacks
of a new species of hookworm, Uncinaria americana. Healso carried
on investigations regarding frequency of the occurrence of parasites
in men. He published nine papers relating to parasitology during
the year and three others along the same line conjointly with Dr.
Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; also the first three parts
of an index catalogue of medical and veterinary zoology, Doctor Has-
sall being a coauthor. The staff of the National Herbarium was too
fully occupied during the year with routine work and the rearrange-
ment of the collections to devote a great deal of time to investigations.
A third section of Doctor Rose’s studies of Mexican and Central
American plants was published, and a paper in joint authorship with
Mr. W. B. Hemsley on the genus Ju/iania. He continued work on
the Crassulaceze of North America conjointly with Doctor Britton,
and completed a preliminary paper relating to that group of plants.
Mr. C, L. Pollard published a number of notes in the Plant World,
and described two new violets from the United States. He also pub-
lished conjointly with Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell descriptions of four
new plants from new Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued studies on
the Museum collection of ferns, and Mr. Edward 8. Steele completed
a monograph of the genus Lacinaria.

EXPOSITIONS.

As stated in the last report, a part of the collections displayed at
the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, 1901, were later transferred
to the Charleston Exposition, which closed May 31, 1902. The
exhibit made at the latter place was returned to Washington in June.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

In the meantime preparations were begun for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, St. Louis, 1904. The schedule of exhibits for this expo-
sition, approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
includes the display of a series of specimens of the large game mam-
mals of the world, the cast of an adult sulphur-bottom whale (the
largest existing animal), a series of the largest and most attractive
birds, such as the ostriches, pheasants, birds of paradise, etc.; large
reptiles, such as the crocodiles, alligators, boas, pythons, cobras, and
the like; aseries of models of deep-sea fishes; a systematic series of
invertebrates, arranged with the special view of illustrating modern
methods of museum installation and labeling; a series of the eggs of
vertebrates; a collection of butterflies. An exhibit from the National
Herbarium, and some minor exhibits, will probably be decided upon
later. A representation of the Children’s Room, showing the methods
to interest children in the study of animate nature, will also be made.

A report on the Pan-American Exposition was submitted during this
year, and will be found in the Assistant Secretary’s report for 1900-
1901, pp. 177 to 231. The Head Curator, having been in charge of
the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at
the Charleston Exposition, also submitted a report in that connection
which will be found in the Assistant Secretary’s report for 1901-2,
». 165 and 166.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By Grorce P. MERRILL,
Head Curator.

The year that has just closed compares very favorably with those
immediately preceding, both as to the number and value of the acces-
sions. The Department is to be particularly congratulated on acquiring
the Rominger and Sherwood collections of vertebrate and invertebrate
fossils; another large portion of the Ulrich collection, and three entire
meteorites from Kentucky and North Carolina, as noted below. The
fine example of the Shergotty, India, meteorite, secured through
the courtesy of Dr. T. H. Holland, and a fragment of the celebrated
diamond-bearing meteorite from Novo Urei, Russia, are also worthy of
mention.

ACCESSIONS.

The total number of accessions received by the Department is shown
in tabular form below, those for 1900-1901 and 1901-2 being also
given for purposes of comparison:

DIVISION OF MINERALOGY.

1. A collection of some 200 specimens of minerals from various
American localities, received from the U. 8. Geological Survey at the
close of the Pan-American and Charleston expositions. Conspicuous
in this series are the fine tourmalinitic quartzes from Little Pipestone
district, Montana, the larger being some 2 feet in length and coated on
one side with a parallel growth of small, richly-colored amethysts.
A second example is a crystal of smoky quartz some 18 inches in
length, with good terminations, but broken across the bottom so as to
show the sagenitic black tourmaline. The series also contains several
cross sections of crystals, 3 or more inches in diameter, showing
to good advantage the zonal arrangement of the quartz and tourma-
line; also a very complete series of aurichalcites and specimens of the
comparatively rare minerals coloradoite and melonite, as well as fine
tourmalines from California, endlichite from New Mexico, quartz
from North Carolina and New York, parisite from Montana, cinnabar
from Utah and California, fluorite from New Hampshire, gothite from
Colorado, melanotekite from New Mexico, barite from Colorado,

86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
SECTION OF INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.

1. A collection of some 1,200 species (75,000 specimens) of bryozoa
and 2,500 thin sections, from the E. O. Ulrich collection.

2, The Carl Rominger collection of Mississippi Valley Paleozoic
invertebrates. This consists largely of corals (many of which are
figured and described in the reports of the Geological Survey of
Michigan), crinoids, and mollusks, representing not less than 14,000
specimens.

3. The Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonie
vertebrate and invertebrate fossils. This contains many choice slabs
filled with large brachiopods and mollusca, besides about 3,000 small
specimens.

4. Collections of trilobites with limbs (7Zrzarthrus beck/) studied by
Doctor Walcott and described in the Proceedings of the Biological
Society of Washington, 1894; of Little Metis sponges, and some
twenty boxes of Paleozoic fossils, from the U.S. Geological Survey.

5. One large slab containing 18 fine specimens of melonites and some
135 labeled specimens from the Marcellus limestone; received from
Dr. C. E. Beecher, of Yale University.

SECTION OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.

1. Casts of mandibular rami; teeth of Mastodon humboldti and Mas-
todon cordillerum, veceived fromthe British Museum.

2. Cast of egg of Himeus crassus.

3. Reptilian footprints in sandstone, from Mount Carbon, Penn-
sylvania.

4. A tooth (type) of Cladodus formosus, from Needle Mountains
quadrangle, Colorado; collected by Whitman Cross.

SECTION OF PALEOBOTANY.

1. Kighty-three specimens of Paleozoic plants, from the Ulrich
collection.

2. A small series of fossil plants, from the Permian of Ohio.

3. Four hundred and eighty-eight specimens of Triassic plants, from
Connecticut and Massachusetts; received from the U. S. Geological
Survey.

ROUTINE.

During the year under consideration the geographic exhibit of
economic minerals in the southwest court has been largely overhauled
and cases and specimens cleaned and rearranged. The collection of non-
metallic minerals on the baleony has likewise undergone rearrange-
ment. ‘The case containing the stratigraphic and historical collections,
against the south wall in the west-south range, has been entirely recon-
structed and the collections reinstalled. In the course of this work
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87
some 2,500 blocks constructed on a new plan were introduced. These
are made of a tripartate veneering and only about one-fourth inch in
thickness.

In six floor upright exhibition cases and one wall-case, double doors
have been replaced by single, thus more than doubling the size of the
glass. The improvement is so great as to suggest the advisability of
carrying out the work in all the cases of this type.

The collections on the west front of the Museum have been over-
hauled and many specimens removed to storage, whereby the appear-
ance of the west front is considerably improved. The work has, as
usual, been done under the direct supervision of Mr. Newhall.

Manuscript for about 1,300 labels has been prepared and sent to the
Government Printer. Upward of 6,000 specimen and reference cards
have also been prepared, and an equal number of specimens numbered.

The work of preparing the type catalogue has progressed but slowly,
only about 300 slips having been written. The large influx of new and
especially type material, has made it seem advisable to postpone the
immediate publication of this list. This work, together with the gen-
eral stenographic and clerical work of the department, has remained
in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves.

In the section of invertebrate paleontology a large amount of work
has been done in arranging the new materials, particularly those of
the E. O. Ulvich collection. During the year there were identified or
placed in final museum condition upward of 16,000 specimens. These
are recorded in the registers, but, on account of lack of clerical help,
have not been numbered, nor have cards been made for the card
catalogue.

Dr. Peale reports that work on the paleobotanical series has con-
tinued along the same lines as last year. The exhibition series has been
partially rearranged and new labels have been printed and exchanged
for the temporary labels of the Paleozoic portion of the collection.

Work in the section of vertebrate paleontology has proceeded but
slowly, owing to the small force engaged. Mr. Stewart has been at
work during almost the entire year upon a mount of the Claosaurus.
The work is now nearly completed, and it is expected that during the
coming fall this very interesting vertebrate fossil will be placed on
exhibition in the southeast court. The hind limb of a Brontosaurus
has been prepared and placed on exhibition during the time under
consideration.

No explorations have been carried on during the year at the expense
of the Museum. Messrs. Schuchert and Bassler and the Head Curator
have been in the field on various occasions, but either at their own
expense or that of other organizations. Much valuable material has
thus been obtained.
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

EXCHANGES AND LOANS.

There have been sent out from the Division of Geology during this
period, to various individuals and students, some 1,262 individual
specimens and 1,288 pounds of miscellaneous material—this entirely
aside from such materials as are ordinarily loaned for study and inves-
tigation. For the last-named purposes there have been loaned during
the year, from the Division of Geology:

To T. Nelson Dale, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 6 specimens of roofing
slates and thin sections.

To George I. Adams, U. S. Geological Survey, 9 specimens of
gypsum.

To George F. Barker, University of Pennsylvania, 3 specimens of
uraninite.

From the Division of Mineralogy, material has been furnished to
the Chemical and Physical Department of the U. 8. Geological Sur-
vey, to the Division of Roads of the Department of Agriculture, and to
the Bureau of Soils of the same Department. Samples of the Putnam
County, Georgia, and Admire, Kansas, meteorites were sent to Dr.
EK. Cohen, Greifswald, Germany, for use in his researches on meteoric
iron.

From the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology there were loaned
to Dr. C. K. Beecher 43 specimens of Upper Carboniferous insects.
To A. W. Grabau, Columbia University, 8 crinoids.. To Dr. M. Coss-
mann, Paris, 16 Cretaceous gastropods. To Prof. 8. W. Williston,
University of Chicago, 257 specimens of Tertiary insects. To Dr.
John M. Clarke, State paleontologist, Albany, New York, a large lot
of Lower Silurian graptolites; and to the Royal Austrian Museum
(Dr. Handlirsch), 562 Carboniferous insects.

Portions of collections in the section of vertebrate paleontology
have been studied by Dr. E. C. Case, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Prof.
S. W. Williston, University of Chicago; Dr. J. B..Hatcher, Carnegie
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the Amer-
ican Museum of Natural History in New York City; and Dr. John
M. Clarke, State paleontologist of New York.

The paleobotanical collections, as usual, have been continually
available to the paleobotanists of the U. S. Geological Survey. In
addition, Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Gardens,
has on several occasions visited the Museum in connection with his
work on the island series of the Upper Cretaceous.

PRESENT CONDITION OF COLLECTIONS.

It may be safely stated that, as a whole, the collections are in better
condition than ever before. The improvement has been constant, and
though not as rapid as one could wish, is fairly satisfactory—perhaps
as satisfactory as can be expected in the present building. Naturally
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89

there must be a constant weeding out of old material and the insertion
of new in order that the collections may be kept up to date, but expan-
sion alone any lines other than that of vertebrate paleontology is
practically prohibited through lack of space. The work which is now
being done in connection with preparations for the Louisiana Pur-
chase Exposition will, on the assumption that the collections return to
us in safety, fill the halls to their utmost extent, and it will unques-
tionably be necessary to store a considerable amount of less desirable
material.

Mention may be made here of the mounted skeleton of the Church,
Michigan, mastodon, collected by Mr. Alban Stewart in the spring of
1901, which is now in an adyanced state of preparation. This gives
the Museum its first complete mounted representative of this interest-
ing group of quadrupeds.

The acquisition for the workshops of a one-half horsepower motor
with flexible shaft and fittings for drilling and cutting, and a ‘‘Jenny
Lind” polisher, together with a renewal of the large grinding bed and
the remodeling of the reciprocating stone saw, have greatly facilitated
the work of the preparators.

The work of the year, as on previous occasions, has been compli-
cated by preparation for an exposition.

RESEARCH.

Various influences have prevented the Head Curator from taking an
active part in research in connection with the Museum collections.
Numerous brief papers have been published, but as they were not, for
the most part, based upon Museum materials, they need not be men-
tioned here.

In connection with Mr. Tassin, investigations have been made upon
the meteorite collections, but the results as yet are far from ready for
publication.

The Head Curator has in course of preparation a work upon the
History of American Geology. This is as yet so far from complete
as to need no special notice at this time.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies on Lower Devonie fossils,
as reported last year. A report to be published by the Geological
Survey of Maryland on this subject is progressing satisfactorily, and
it is expected will be ready for the printer some time during the com-
ing year.

Mr. Schuchert has also completed a study of the Cystidea of the
Manlius and Coeymans formations. The paper is about ready for pub-
lication.

Mr. R. S. Bassler has in preparation studies on the Bryozoa and
Ostracoda. A paper reviewing the entire Bryozoa of the Rochester
shales will, it is expected, be completed during the coming winter.
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Mr. Phalen has made a study of rocks collected by Messrs. Schuchert
and White in Greenland in 1897.

Papers by members of the U. 8. Geological Survey upon materials
in the section of paleobotany are noted in the bibliography.

The personnel of the Department remains the same as last year. Mr.
J. W. Coleman, skilled laborer in the section of vertebrate paleon-
tology, who had been away on leave of absence, returned to work on
September 19, 1902, but finally severed his connection with the
Museum during the latter part of June.

General history of

The story of a word—Mammal.
Pop. Sci. Monthly, LX1, Sept., 1902, pp. 434—
438.

The etymology and singular form of the
word Mammalia have been erroneously given
in all dictionaries as derived from the Latin
adjective mammalis and as cognate with vari-
ous words in living European languages. It
is contended that the name was first given by
Linneeus in 1758, and that he formed it in
analogy with Animalia and derived it directly
from the noun Mamma and added the suffix
-alia. A history of the use of the word is
given.

The first use of Mammals and

Mammalians.
Science (new series), Xvi, No. 417, Dec. 26,
1902, pp. 1034-1035.

The earliest use of the word Mammals seems
to have been made by Good in 1818 in the
Pantalogia, and that of Mammalians by Kirby
in 1835 in his Bridgewater treatise.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The hosts of Argulids

and their nomenclature. |
Science (new series), XVII, No. 418, Jan. 2,
1903, p. 33.

The names of the fish-hosts of many of the
species described in the ‘‘ Monograph of North
American Parasitic Copepods of the family
Argulide,” by C. B. Wilson, are corrected
and the fishes identified.

The bones of the shoulder girdle
of fishes.

Science (new series), XviI, No. 424, Feb.
13, 1903, pp. 255-256.

The most characteristic system of bones of
the pisciform vertebrates is manifest in the
shoulder girdle, and the classes of selachians
and typical fishes, or teleostomes, have been
segregated under the name Lyrifera, on ac-
count of the character of this girdle. The
consideration of the bones, however, mili-
tates decidedly against the acceptance of the
views generally held. Secapula and coracoid
were given originally to the composite bone
and its process familiar from manifestation
in man. The bones of fishes to which the
names have been given are certainly not ho-
mologous. They,in fact, are only developed
as such in fishes specialized as teleosts and
very remote from the primitive stock of the
terrestrial vertebrates. A special nomencla-
ture is therefore necessary. The so-called
scapula has been designated as hypercoracoid,
the coracoid as hypocoracozd, and the Span-
genstuck, or precoracoid, as mesocoracoid.
The mesocoracoid disappears in most fishes;
all the acanthopterygians and offshoots from
that stock being deprived oi that ossicle.

fish genus Lampris.

13, 1903, pp. 256-257.

Recently the foremost ichthyologist of Eu-
rope, Doctor Boulenger, reexamined the
osteology of Lampris, and especially the
shoulder girdie, and attained novel concep-
tions as to the athnities of that genus. The
number oO! bones in the shoulder girdle of
Lampris is the same as in ordinary acanthop-
teryglan fishes, but two of them haye been
interpreted trom a different standpoint than
by his predecessors. (1) The very large bone
which occupies the lower and posterior part
ot the girdle was considered by him to be a
peculiar bone, named interclayicle, and
homologized with a homonymous bone of the
hemibranchs, and (2) the smaller one imme-
diately above it and behind the bones sup-
porting the pectoral fin was regarded as a
“eoracoid’’ or hypocoracoid. Therefore he
considered it as the representative not only
ota pecuhar family (Lampridid), but of an
independent higher group named Selenich-
thyes and coordinated with the Hemibranchii
and Lophobranchii, the three being associated
together as representatives of a suborder to

which the new name Catosteomi was given.
To test this conclusion the skeleton of Lampris
was submitted to renewed examination.
That examination forced the author to ac-
ceptance of the principal ideas of the older
ichthyologists; four actinosts, or pterygials,
are recognized, and the coracoid of Boulenger
is identified with the fourth. The hypocora-
coid is found in the interclavicle of Boulen-
ger. Asa consequence, the genus is restored
to the group of acanthopterygians. Never-
theless, the differences between Lampris and
all other fishes are sufliciently great to entitle
it to rank as the type of a family (Lampridi-
dee), as well as a special superfamily (Lam-
pridoidea).

Origin of the name Monotremes.

Science (new series), XVII, No. 428, Mar.

13, 1903, pp. 433-434.

It is shown that the name Monotremes was
given by E. Geoffroy as an ordinal designation
(in French form only) in 1803, the order
(ordre) diagnosed, and the genera ‘ Orni-
thorhinchus’’ and ‘‘Echidna”’ referred to it.

Homologies of the anterior limb.
Science (new series), XVII, No. 430, Mar.
27, 1903, p. 489.

It is contended that Polypterus gives us a
key to the problem in question, as has been
already urged by the writer in 1872, 1878, and
1882. This view, after long neglect, was
independently urged later by others, especi-
ally Emery and Pollard, but with differences
of detail. The humerus, radius, ulna, carpal,
and metacarpal bones are found in a recog-
nizable condition in Polypterus. That genus
is the nearest o1 the living fishes in relation-
ship to the amphibians and consequently all
terrestrial vertebrates

In refutation of Mr. Henry W. Fowler’s

it is demonstrated, by an analysis of his treat-

Remarks on the attitude of Linnzeus with

Reference is made to various fish names
used in Brickell’s ‘‘ Natural History of North
Carolina,’ published in 1737. The story of
the devilfish running away with a ‘vessel
fora league or two’ isrepeated. Information
is asked if certain names are still used for
fishes, viz, ‘‘Sea-Tench’’ for the Tautog,
“ Welchmen’”’ for black basses, and ‘' Irish-
men”’ for crappies.

that the first edition had been discontinued

however, found a copy of a fourth volume in

with considerations on its bearing on nomen-
clature. The volume appears to have been
suppressed.

The conclusion is that the skeleton, so far
as the physical characteristics are concerned,
is practically identical in type with that of
the modern Indian of the same region and
presents no indications of any great antiquity.

The John Day basin lies in north central
Oregon between the north and south ranges
of the Blue Mountains, covering an area of
approximately 10,000 square miles, drained by
the John Day River and its tributaries. The
flora of the basin, as set forth in this paper,
comprises 150 forms distributed among 37
natural families and the anomalous group of
Phyllites. Of the 150 forms enumerated, 24
have not been specifically named, and 44
species and one variety are described as new,
the previously known species numbering 81.
The beds are allof Tertiary age, ranging from
Lower Eocene to Upper Miocene. The con-
ditions prevailing in the John Day basin in
Tertiary times extended into central Wash-
ington, northwestern Idaho, and western

Oregon.

The present part of this monograph deals
with four exclusively American families of
Passeres (Tanagride, Icteride, Ccerebide,
and Mniotiltidz), embracing 77 genera and
433 species and subspecies. The treatment of
species is similar to that followed in the first
part of the work. Brief descriptions of the
known plumages are given, followed by
measurements, the geographical ranges, and
a full synonymy. The following forms are
introduced as new: Phenicothraupis rubica
nelsoni (p. 145), Compsothlypis americana ra-

(Pub-

malinz (p. 486), Geothlypis incompta (p. 677),

thickness of 3,169 feet. These formations are
followed by the Lower Deyonic deposits, with
a thickness of 608 feet (Helderbergian, 260
feet, and Oriskanian, 348 feet). The yarious
formations are based on fossil content as fixed
by the New York series, are of the North At-

sion of study of eggs. (Editorial. )
Osprey, 1V, No. 1, Sept., 1899, pp. 9-10.

The desirability of extending the study of

eggs beyond their shells is urged. The in-

vestigations of Valenciennes and Frémy on

the contents of the egg, published in 1854, are

referred to, and the difference between the

reaction to boiling is indicated in the case of

the albumen of the Lapwing. Dataare asked

for as ‘‘to the absolute and relative time re-
quired by the white and yellow to become |

hard in boiling, the degree of hardness ac-
quired, and the behavior of white and yellow
to reagents.”? It is also added that ‘‘the edi-
bility and taste of eggs of different kinds would
also be interesting subjects for inyestigation.”’

The opinion of J. E. Harting that the Dinor-
nis maximus was ‘the largest known bird
that had ever lived”’ is noted. The Thrasae-
tus harpyia, or Harpy Eagle, is declared to be
apparently the largest bird of prey, weighing
28 to 30 pounds. Attention is called to the
overlooked fact that the common Turkey
may be ‘‘the largest bird that flies,’ as it
sometimes may exceptionally attain a weight
of 70 pounds. Such a turkey, howeyer, could
seareely fly.

(editorial. )
Osprey, Iv, No. 6, Feb., 1900, pp. 90-91.

A continuation of a former editorial article
on the same subject, in which the land shell-
bearing Gasteropods are considered. The
conclusion is reached that ‘“‘the extent of
differentiation and segregation of the pre-
dominant Achatinellines almost compels us
to believe that their progenitors came upon
the islands very early. With the present fee-
ble light to guide us, it seems to be more
likely that these progenitors came from the
west of the islands.”’ This is in contrast with
the indications furnished by the birds as at
present understood. Weare thus left in an
unsettled condition, and must await future
more detailed studies.

An abstract of ‘‘a communication to the
National Academy of Sciences made April 18,
1900.” It is contended that the African fauna
“has two sides, facing in opposite directions,
and it can not be understood without taking
both into consideration.’’ The association of
Africa with Asia or Europe is ‘illogical and
falsifies the record.’ ‘Whatever facts a
classification may be intended to embody,
the African fauna must be isolated. If we
wish to express, in our terminology, a former
condition of affairs, Eogeea is a term adapted
to do so.”

Significance and etymology of the
word mammal.
Osprey, Iv, No. 10, June, 1900, pp. 157-159.
The etymology imagined in the Century
Dictionary and others is shown to be errone-
ous. The name mammaliais declared to haye
been formed by Linneus in analogy with
Animalia, from the word mamma with the
suffix alia. The singular, consequently,
should be mammal and not mammale. The
history of the anglicized form mammal and
Mammifer is also indicated.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxi1I, No. 1234,
June 6, 1901, 735-788.

The name Heptatrema is traced back to its
origin and the history of the nomenclature of
the genus detailed. It is shown that the
earliest name was Eptatretus (1819) and that
consequently the family name should be
Eptatretidz.

Note on the genus Hollandia of

Karsh.
Science (mew series), x11, June 14, 1901,
pp. 949-950.

The name Hollandia, haying been applied
in 1892 to one genus, could not be given to a
second, and consequently the genus of but-
terflies named Hollandia by Karsch in 1897
isrenamed Hollandella. The family Holan-
diidx is degraded to the rank of a subfamily

named Hollandelline.

Nomenclature at Berlin.
Osprey, V, No. 8, Aug., 1901, pp. 126-127.
Comments are made on some of the rules
promulgated by the recent Zoological Con-
gress at Berlin, as well as certain names pub-
lished by French ornithologists. The criti-
cized names are such as were formed by
“compounding the first part or syllables of
one word and the final elements of another,”
such as Embernagea composed of Ember [iza]
and [7a]nagra.

Alewives.
Notes and Queries (9), vi1I, No. 206, Noy.
30, 1901, pp. 451-452.

In answer to a previous inquiry (Vol. vm,
p. 406) the etymology and true name of the
American Alewife are given. In correction
of the great New England Dictionary it is re-
marked that Alewife was and still isa name
applied in some places in England to one of
the Shads, and quite naturally it was brought
over to the United States by the immigrants
from England. Aloofe, given as an etymon
and an Indian name, is nothing but Aloose,
the antique s haying been mistaken for an f.
Aloose, Alose, and Alice, as well as Alewife,
are derivatives from the old Latin Alosa.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE BUILDINGS OCCUPIED BY THE
NATIONAL COLLECTIONS.

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge 6f the U.S. National Museum.

INTRODUCTION.

The object of this paper is to briefly describe the history and
character of the several buildings in which the science and art collec-
tions belonging to this Government have been housed and cared for,
the time for such an account seeming especially opportune, in view of
the recent beginning of an additional, larger, and more elaborate
structure to meet the demands for increased space. No attempt is
made to contrast the present accommodations with those provided
elsewhere for a like purpose, only such criticisms being offered as
are directly suggested by the buildings themselves.

The scope of the U.S. National Museum, as defined by acts of
Congress, is exceedingly broad, including, besides natural history,
geology, archeology and ethnology, the various arts and industries of
man. Its development, resulting largely from Government explora-
tions, has been greatest in the four subjects first mentioned. The
collections illustrating the industrial arts, though now mainly in
storage, are nearly as extensive in the amount of exhibition space
required, and they can be rapidly enlarged and perfected as soon as
a place is found for them.

Since the seventh decade of the last century the Museum has been
continuously in a state of congestion, and with ever increasing acces-
sions, it early became necessary to resort to outside storage, in which
the amount of material is now extremely large. The demand for
additional room, therefore, dates back over twenty years, being based
partly on the need of placing these valuable collections under safe
conditions and partly on the important requirement of bringing them
into service by classification and arrangement. Last year an impor-
tant step in this direction was realized—the passage of an act of Con-
gress under which a more commodious and worthy building will

speedily be secured.
181
182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 19903.

As to the suitability for museum purposes of the existing buildings
it may be said that the Smithsonian building was erected before
much was known of museum needs, and it was moreover designed
only in part for museum use. Its publie halls, though exhibiting
many important defects, have as a whole served their purpose well.
The accommodations for laboratories and the storage of reserve collee-
tions are, on the other hand, very poor, being mainly found in base-
ment and small tower rooms, inconvenient and badly lighted.

The Museum building, constructed soon after the Centennial Exhi-
bition of 1876, primarily for the extensive collections brought to
Washington from that source, was put up hastily and cheaply, and
therefore not as substantially as was advisable. It is practically one
great exhibition hall, since its partition walls are pierced at frequent
intervals with broad and high arched openings. The lighting in the
main is not unsatisfactory, though with a different roof construction it
could be much improved. Here again, however, fault is to be found
with the space available for workrooms and storerooms, since, having
practically no basement, these rooms are confined to the towers and
pavilions.

In planning the new granite building an opportunity is offered for
correcting these faults. Good and convenient laboratories and storage
rooms have been provided for, and it is intended that the exhibition
halls shall show a decided improvement over those in the older
structures.

The history of the buildings is briefly as follows:

In 1840 a society was organized in the city of Washington under the
name of the National Institution, afterwards changed to the National
Institute, among whose objects was the direction of the Smith-
son bequest, then under discussion by Congress, and the bringing
together of collections in natural history, ethnology, and such other
subjects as fall within the scope of a general museum. Its member-
ship included many prominent persons, among them members of the
Government and of Congress, which gave to the society a recognized
position and secured to its purposes extensive quarters in the building
of the Patent Office. Here were assembled the many valuable speci-
mens brought home by the famous United States Exploring Expedition
around the world, as well as others derived from both Government
and private sources, which formed the nucleus of the present national
collections, soon to pass under other control.

Under date of December 6, 1838, the President announced to Con-
gress the receipt in this country and the investment of the Smithson
bequest, amounting to a little more than half a million dollars, and
also invited the attention of that body to the obligation devolving upon
the United States to fulfill the objects of that bequest. During the
seven and three-quarters years which ensued to the time of the actual
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 183

foundation of the Smithsonian Institution, this matter was constantly
before Congress, the subject of numerous propositions and of extended
debates. By the will of Smithson the city of Washington was to be
the home of the establishment, but the character and extent of its
buildings, as well as their site, depended upon the policy which
Congress might adopt for carrying out the wishes of the benefactor, so
tersely yet wisely expressed.

The bill which was finally passed and received the approval of the
President on August 10, 1846, gave to the Smithsonian Institution the
custody of the national collections, and provided for a site and building
in the following terms:

AN ACT To establish the “‘Smithsonian Institution,” for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.

Src. 4. And be it further enacted, That, after the board of regents shall have met and
become organized, it shall be their duty forthwith to proceed to select a suitable site
for such building as may be necessary for the institution, which ground may be taken
and appropriated out of that part of the public ground in the city of Washington
lying between the patent office and Seventh Street: Provided, The President of the
United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Commissioner of the Patent Office, shall
consent to the same; but, if the persons last named shall not consent, then such loca-
tion may be made upon any other of the public grounds within the city of Washing-
ton, belonging to the United States, which said regents may select, by and with the
consent of the persons herein named; and the said ground, so selected, shall be set
out by proper metes and bounds, and a description of the same shall be made, and
recorded in a book to be provided for that purpose, and signed by the said regents,
or so many of them as may be convened at the time of their said organization; and
such record, or a copy thereof, certified by the chancellor and secretary of the board
of regents, shall be received in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries
of the lands appropriated to the said institution; and, upon the making of such rec-
ord, such site and lands shall be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of
this act, to the said institution.

Src. 5. And be it further enacted, That, so soon as the board of regents shall have
selected the said site, they shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and
durable materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of sufficient
size, and with suitable rooms or halls, for the reception and arrangement, upon a
liberal scale, of objects of natural history, including a geological and mineralogical
cabinet; also a chemical laboratory, a library, a gallery of art, and the necessary
lecture rooms; and the said board shall have authority, by themselves, or by a com-
mittee of three of their members, to contract for the completion of such building,
upon such plan as may be directed by the board of regents, and shall take sufficient
security for the building and finishing the same according to the said plan, and in
the time stipulated in such contract; and may so locate said building, if they shall
deem it proper, as in appearance to form a wing to the patent office building, and
may so connect the same with the present hall of said patent office building,
containing the national cabinet of curiosities, as to constitute the said hall, in whole
or in part, the deposit for the cabinet of said institution, if they deem it expedient
to do so: provided, said building shall be located upon said patent office lot, in the
manner aforesaid: Provided, however, That the whole expense of the building and
enclosures aforesaid shall not exceed the amount of , which sum is hereby
appropriated, payable out of money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated,

184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

together with such sum or sums out of the annual interest accruing to the institu-
tion, as may, in any year, remain unexpended, after paying the current expenses of
the institution. And duplicates of all such contracts as may be made by the said
board of regents shall be deposited with the treasurer of the United States; and all
claims on any contract made as aforesaid shall be allowed and certified by the board
of regents, or the executive committee thereof, as the case may be, and, being signed
by the chancellor and secretary of the board, shall be a sufficient voucher for settle-
ment and payment at the treasury of the United States. And the board of regents
shall be authorized to employ such persons as they may deem necessary to superin-
tend the erection of the building and fitting up the rooms of the institution. And all
laws for the protection of public property in the city of Washington shall apply to,
and be in force for, the protection of the lands, buildings, and other property, of
said institution. And all moneys recovered by, or accruing to, the institution, shall
be paid into the treasury of the United States, to the credit of the Smithsonian
bequest, and separately accounted for, as provided in the act approved July first,
eighteen hundred and thirty-six, accepting said bequest.

Src. 6. A nd be it further enacted, That, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens,
belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city of
Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to such.
persons as may be authorized by the board of regents to receive them, and shall be
arranged in such order, and go classed, as best [to] facilitate the examination and study
of them, in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the institution; * * *

Sec. 7. And be it further enacted, That the secretary of the board of regents shall
take charge of the building and property of said institution. * * *

(Statutes IX, 102. See also The Smithsonian Institution, Documents relative to
its origin and history, 1835-1899, I, pp. 429-434. )

The Smithsonian building, as is well known, was placed upon the

Mall. It was planned with reference to accommodations for a museum,
a library, and other purposes, but the transfer of the specimens from
the Patent Office did not take place until 1858, when Congress began
to make small appropriations for the maintenance of the museum
feature. The collections increased so rapidly that by 1875 they were
occupying fully three-fourths of the Smithsonian building, and, in
fact, all parts not actually required for the activities of the parent
institution, the administrative offices, and the exchange service.

The Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, from which so large a
quantity of valuable objects was acquired that they had to be stored
provisionally in the so-called “Armory building,” which they com-
pletely filled, led to the erection of the present Museum building. It
proved inadequate from the beginning, and for many years new
collections have been accumulating in outside rented buildings, mere

on the Mall, but along its northern edge, directly facing the Smith-
sonian building. Upon its completion, the Museum will be in oceu-
pancy of a group of three buildings, counting a part of the Smithso-
nian as one, and it may safely be predicted that none will long contain
any vacant space.

THE SMITHSONIAN GROUNDS.

In a bill for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, pre-
pared by Representative John Quincy Adams, and presented to the
United States Senate on February 18, 1839,” provision was made for
an astronomical observatory, to be erected under the direction of the
Secretary of the Treasury upon land belonging to the United States,
which, after its selection, should be granted for the purpose and con-
veyed asa deed of gift to the trustees of the Institution. ‘The locality
known as Camp Hill, near the banks of the Potomac River and the
mouth of Rock Creek, opposite Analostan Island, seems to have been
under consideration at that time. It was the same site that Washing-
ton had designated for the National University, and was subsequently
used for the object Mr. Adams had in mind, but under the direction
of the United States Naval Establishment.

In another bill, introduced in the Senate by Lewis F. Linn, on Feb-
ruary 10, 1841,’ it was proposed that the entire tract known as the
Mall be appropriated for the uses of the Smithsonian Institution, with
the provision that the buildings should be erected in accordance with
plans prepared by and under the supervision of the National Institu-
‘tion, to be approved by the President of the United States. In bills
submitted to the same body in June and December, 1844, by the
Library Committee, consisting of Senators Rufus Choate, Benjamin
Tappan, and James McP. Berrien, appeared the first definite charac-
terization of the building, which was to be placed upon a site to be
selected in that portion of the Mall lying west of Seventh street. -

The bill for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution which
finally passed Congress and received the approval of the President on
August 10, 1546,° was drafted by Representative Robert Dale Owen.
The sections relating to the site and building are quoted on pages 183
and 184 of the introduction.

Upon the organization of the Board of Regents attention in regard
to the site seems first to have been directed toward the Mall, and here
its location was finally established, though not without some difficul-
ties and delay, the choice being subject to approval by the President
of the United States, the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, War, and
the Navy, and the Commissioner of Patents. At a meeting’ of the
Regents on September 9, 1846, the chancellor, the Secretary, and the

executive committee, five in all, were constituted a committee on
grounds and buildings, whose first report, submitted on November 30
of the same year, resulted in the passage of the following resolution:

That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do select and adopt asa site for
their buildings so much of the Mall, in the city of Washington, as lies between
Seventh street and the river Potomac, if the consent of the persons named in the
fourth section of the act to establish the Smithsonian Institution for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men be obtained thereto; and that upon such consent
being obtained in due form, the Secretary is hereby instructed to cause the said
ground so selected to be set out by proper metes and bounds.

On December 1 following .the Board amended the above resolution
by adding the following clause after the word Potomac:
Subject to the power of Congress to grant any portion of the same west of Four-

teenth street to the Washington Monument Society for the purpose of erecting a
monument thereon.

As consent to this proposition was not obtained, it was resolved by
the Regents on December 9:

That a committee of three be appointed by the chancellor to confer with the
President of the United States and the other persons named in the fourth section of
said act, and ask their consent to the selection by said Regents of that portion of
said reservation lying between Seventh and Twelfth streets west, in said city, as the
site for the necessary buildings of said institution; and, if such consent be given—

It is further resolved, That said buildings be located thereon, and at least two hun-
dred and fifty feet south of the centre thereof.

The committee designated consisted of Representatives Hough and
Owen and Senator Evans, but failing in the object of their mission,
the Board resolved, on December 23:

That the Regents of the Smithsonian do select and appropriate as the site for
their buildings the south half of so much of the ‘‘ Mall,”’ in the city of Washington,
as lies between Ninth and Twelfth streets.

The consent to this choice by the President and other persons
named in the fourth section of the fundamental act was communicated
to the Board on January 20, 1847, and the further provisions of the
act were then carried out, namely:

And the said ground so selected shall be set out by proper metes and bounds,
and a description of the same shall be made, and recorded in a book to be provided
for that purpose, and signed by the said Regents, or so many of them as may be
convened at the time of their said organization; and such record, or a copy thereof,
certified by the chancellor and Secretary of the Board of Regents, shall be received
in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries of the lands appropriated to

the said Institution; and upon the making of such record such site and lands shall
be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of this act, to the said Institution.

After the close of these proceedings, however, which at the time
seemed to be conclusive and did finally prevail, the subject of a site
was again reopened and led to further inquiries and considerations.
These can best be told in the words of the late Dr. George Brown
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 187

Goode, as recorded-in his paper on the Smithsonian Building and
Grounds.“

After the present site had been selected there appears to have been some dissatis-
faction in regard to it; nor is this to be wondered at, since at that time the Mall was
remote from the inhabited portion of the city, being a part of what was then known
as ‘‘The Island,’’ now called South Washington. This portion of the city was cut
off by an old and unsightly canal running to the Potomac and crossed by simple
wooden bridges at four points between the Capitol and the Potomac River. It was
unfenced and waste, occupied from time to time by military encampments and by
traveling showmen. After the completion of the east wing in 1850, when the first
lectures were held in the Institution, the Regents were obliged to build plank walks
for the accommodation of visitors. Indeed, with the exception of the Capitol
grounds and those surrounding the Executive Mansion, the open places in the city
were entirely unimproved.

Soon after the selection of the present site the question was reconsidered by the
Board, and a committee appointed to obtain, if possible, another location. In the
bill as it finally passed Congress permission had been given to locate the building
on the space between the Patent Office and Seventh street, now occupied by the
building used for the offices of the Interior Department. This was partly to enable
the Institution to utilize for its collections the large hall in the Patent Office then
assigned to the ‘‘ National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’ partly, no doubt, to secure a more
central location. To obtain this ground, however, it was necessary to have the
approval of the President of the United States and other public officials, which was
not found practicable. The committee fixed upon Judiciary Square, an open space
of rough ground, in which at that time the city hall (a portion of the present struc-
ture), the infirmary, and the city jail were located. Though the adjoining streets
were entirely vacant, this site was regarded as much more accessible than the Mall.

A proposition was submitted to the common council of the city of Washington,
that the site of the city hall should be resigned for the use of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution upon its offering to pay to the city $50,000, a sum deemed sufficient to erect a —
building for the use of the city government upon the site south of Pennsylvania
avenue, between Seventh and Ninth streets, now occupied by the Center Market.
A bill was introduced into Congress, authorizing the Regents to purchase the city
hall, but the common council refused to consider the proposition and the site of the
Mall was used.

That part of the Mall appropriated to the Institution has been known
as the Smithsonian reservation, while to the entire square between
Seventh street and Twelfth street, west, including the reservation,
the name Smithsonian Park has been commonly applied.

At their meetings of December 4, 1846, and January 28, 1847, the
Regents appropriated a total sum of $4,000 for grading, laying out,
and planting the grounds of the Institution, under the direction of the
building committee, which was also authorized to expend not over
$10,000 in the construction of a permanent fence around the grounds.
The latter, however, was erected for less than $500.

In 1848, the building committee entered into a contract with John
Douglas, of Washington, to the extent of $1,050 for inclosing the
reservation with a hedge and for planting trees and shrubs. The

architect of the building marked out the paths and roads and indicated
the positions of the trees and shrubs, to comprise about 160 species,
principally American. The surrounding hedge was to consist on each
of the four sides, respectively, of pyrocanthus, osage orange, cherokee
rose, and hawthorn. Although considerable progress in this work
seems to have been made during the year, the contract was considered
not to have been properly complied with, and it was canceled in 1849.

The same year, for the convenience of those who attended the lec-
tures in the east wing of the Smithsonian building, a walk was built
from Seventh street to the eastern gate of the grounds and the path
from the Twelfth Street Bridge was repaired. In speaking of the
considerable expense which such improvements outside the reservation
entailed upon the Institution, Secretary Henry, in his report for 1849,
sald:

It is hoped that the authorities of the city of Washington will cause bridges to
be erected across the canal and walks to be constructed through the publie grounds,
to facilitate the approach to the building, and that the Institution will not be expected
to provide accommodations of this kind.

In their report for 1850, the building committee stated that up to
the end of that year $3,747.51 had been spent upon the grounds, and
that probably little more expenditure on that account would be neces-
sary. Portions of the roads about the building had been graded and
many trees and shrubs set out. An appropriation having been made
by Congress for the purpose, Mr. Andrew J. Downing, at the request
of the President, was then preparing a plan for converting the entire
Mall, including the Smithsonian grounds, into a landscape garden. If
this plan were adopted, the Smithsonian lot would form part of an
extended park, of which the Smithsonian building, by its site and
picturesque style of architecture, would be a prominent and attractive
feature.

In 1851, according to the report of the same committee, the Mall
was in course of rapid improvement under Mr. Downing. The cor-
poration of the city appropriated $2,500 for an iron bridge across the
canal at Tenth street, and a gravel walk was carried thence to the
building. The Smithsonian reservation of 19 acres had been inclosed
with a fence and planted with trees at an expense to the Institution of |
about $4,000, but the execution of Mr. Downing’s plan, at the cost
of the General Government, would, in the view of the committee,
render unnecessary any further disbursements by the Institution.
Without surrendering the right of use of the reservation appropri-
ated to the Institution, the partition fence between it and the other
part of the Mall had been removed and the whole given in charge of
Mr. Downing. |

Although relieved at this period, and at its own request, of the care -
and improvement of its grounds, which have since remained under the
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 189

supervision of the officer in charge of public grounds, the Institution
has always maintained a deep interest in the condition of its surround-
ings, and has in fact aided materially toward their betterment, as fre-
quently noted in the reports of Secretary Henry and his successors.

In 1855 Professor Henry wrote that since the death of the lamented
Downing but little had been done to complete the general plans of the
improvement of the Mall proposed by him and adopted by Congress,
although an annual appropriation had been made for keeping in order
the lot on which the Smithsonian building is situated. Regret was
expressed that Congress had not made an appropriation to promote
the suggestion of Dr. John Torrey and other botanists of establishing
here.an arboretum to exhibit the various ornamental trees of indi-
genous growth in this country.

This scheme was never more than tentatively carried out, but in 1899
the Secretary of Agriculture revived the subject, in his annual report,
from which the following extract is taken:

One of the needs of the Department is an aboretum in which can be brought
together for study all the trees that will grow in the climate of Washington. - The
need of such an establishment was felt early in the history of the capital and was
brought forward more than fifty years ago among the various plans proposed for the
use of the Smithson bequest, which was finally devoted to the founding of the pres-
ent Smithsonian Institution. In the report of the building committee of that Insti-
tution for 1850 the following statement occurs:

“Mr. Downing, the well-known writer on rural architecture, at the request of the
President, is now preparing a plan for converting the whole Mall, including the
Smithsonian grounds, into an extended landscape garden, to be traversed in different
directions by graveled walks and carriage drives and planted with specimens, prop-
erly labeled, of all the varieties of trees and shrubs which will flourish in this cli-
mate.”’

This admirable plan, apparently from lack of financial support from Congress, was
never systematically prosecuted, and the plantings at first made were so neglected
that the nurse trees themselves are now being rapidly broken down and destroyed
by storm, disease, and decay. When the grounds of the Department of Agriculture
were laid out, in 1868, Mr. William Saunders, then, as now, horticulturist of the
Department, established a small arboretum commensurate with the size of the
grounds. An arboretum in this climate, however, requires an area of several hun-
dred acres. The time has come when the economic needs of the Department and
the education and pleasure of the people demand a rich collection of trees planted
so as to secure the best effects of landscape art, furnishing complete materials for
the investigations of the Department of Agriculture, and so managed as to be a
perennial means of botanical education. We are now engaged in introducing useful
trees from all parts of the world, such as those producing fruits, dyes, nuts, oils, and
tans, those useful for ornamental purposes, and especially those promising shade,
shelter, and fuel in the arid region.

At the present time we have no central place in which to plant and maintain a
series of these trees for study and propagation. The importations must be sent out
as fasta they are received, without any opportunity for our investigators to make
any observations on their behavior under cultivation, and in the case of small and
valuable importations subjecting the whole stock to the possibility of total loss. In
view of these conditions, I wish to bring to the attention of Congress the importance
190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

of placing at the disposal of this Department an area of suitable size and situation
for a comprehensive arboretum. In order to give a specific basis for considera-
tion of this project, I suggest that the area known as the Mall be set aside for this
purpose.

’

‘*No part of the public domain,” said Professor Henry in 1856, ‘‘is
more used than the reservation on which the Smithsonian building
stands, but as yet no special appropriation has been made by Con-
gress for continuing the improvement of the grounds, and it is to be
regretted that years should be suffered to pass without planting the
trees which are in the future to add to the beauty, health, and comfort
of the capital of the nation.” In the same connection mention is made
of the beautiful monument erected that year near the Institution by
the American Pomological Society to the memory of Downing—a just
tribute to the worth of one of the benefactors of our country. The
adoption of his ornamental plan for the public parks of this city was
in part due to the example of the Regents in embellishing the grounds
around the Smithsonian building.

In 1858 Professor Henry remarked that—

The proposition to supply the public grounds with a complete series of American
trees has long been contemplated, but as no appropriation has been made by Con-
gress for this purpose, the Patent Office, conjointly with the Institution, has taken
the preliminary steps by issuing a circular asking for seeds of every species of our
forest trees and shrubs that would be likely to thrive in this latitude. This circular
has been widely distributed, and it is hoped will meet with a favorable response from
all who are interested in making more generally known, and in introducing into more
extensive cultivation, the natural ornamental products of our own soil. The seeds
are to be sent by mail to the Commissioner of Patents and placed in charge of the
officers having the care of the public grounds.

In 1862 Professor Henry reported that the trees and shrubbery in
the grounds were growing finely under the care of the commissioner
of public grounds, B. B. French, esq. He also called attention to
the city canal forming the boundary of the Smithsonian grounds on the
north, and across the basin or widest part of which most of the visi-
tors to the Institution had to pass. This basin,‘since the introduction
of Potomac water, had become the receptacle of the sewage of the
city, and was then an immense cesspool, constantly emitting noxious
