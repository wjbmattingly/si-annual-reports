THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898,

BY
CHARLES D. WALCOTT,

Acting Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the U. S. National
Museum.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

ORGANIZATION.!

In the introduction to the Report for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1897, attention was called to a new plan of organization, which went
_ into effect July 1, 1897, and the statement was made that the results
of its operations would be considered in the Report for 1898.

The various divisions and sections of Anthropology, Biology, and
Geology, which had previously been conducted independently of one
another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assistant
Secretary in charge of the Museum, were united under three head cura-
tors, one of anthropology, another of biology, and a third of geology.
This secured direct expert supervision and properly correlated the
work of each Gepartment. Before, such correlation had been impossi-
ble, owing to the large number of independent heads of sections and
divisions in each department, who planned and executed the work more
or less independently of one another. The official correspondence was
also more closely centralized in the executive office of the Museum.

Anthropology.—In the Department of Anthropology a large amount
of work was done by Mr. W. H. Holmes in reorganizing and installing
the exhibits, under a general scheme approved early in the year. The
organization of the department, the personnel, and the details of the
work will be found in his report. There are a number of sections that
have not yet been assigned to any division, remaining for the present
under the direct supervision of the head curator. Moreover, the clas-
sification of material and the division of work among the various mem-

bers of the present staff, so far as it has progressed, is largely tentative,
owing to the staff being composed of specialists in limited portions of
the field of anthropology; this necessitates a somewhat arbitrary

' The organization of the staff is given in Appendix I.

classification and organization. As the various branches of the work
develop, and increase is made in the number of curators, reclassifica-
tion of material and readjustment of the force will gradually lead to a
satisfactory and permanent organization.

The accessions to the department were numerous and valuable.
Among those of more notable importance is a collection of antiquities
and ethnological material, the bequest of the late Mr. W. Hallett
Phillips, of Washington, to the Smithsonian Institution. This collec-
tion is not only of great extent, but of exceptional value to archzolog-
ical science. It contains 12,467 ancient relics, mainly stone implements
from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnological specimens from Poly-
nesia. By transfer from the Bureau of American Ethnology the
Museum received material from Arizona, Arkansas, and Georgia; and
by transfer from the Army Medical Museum, a collection of 2,206
human crania, representing mainly the Indian tribes, ancient and mod-
ern, of North America. There was received on deposit, and at the
same time offered for sale, an extensive collection of stone implements
and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, together with
a collection of ethnological material from the Indians of the Great
Plains and the Rocky Mountains, made by Emile Granier, of Paris.
Valuable deposits were made by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. These
include a large number of pieces of apparatus made and used by him in
his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical sci-
ence. The General Electric Company also deposited many pieces of
original apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for light-
ing, the transmission of power, and like purposes. Other valuable
deposits are described in the report of the head curator.

During the year there were prepared by the curators and expert
preparators of the department a number of models illustrating primitive
life, processes, implements, utensils, ete.

The research work of the department during the year was extensive,
the study, comparison, and classification of the collections before instal-
lation being essential to their intelligent utilization.

The system of installation inaugurated by Mr. Holmes is somewhat
elaborate. The primary arrangement is founded, first, on the geo-
graphical or ethnographical assemblage, and, second, on the develop-
mental or genetic assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special.
They are the chronological, the comparative, the individual, ete. The
primary methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths
of anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited por-
tions of the field. A full description of the method of installation will
be found in Mr. Holmes’s report.

Biology.—The Department of Biology was embarrassed by reason of
Dr. True’s time being largely consumed in executive work, and it was
not until late in the year that he secured an assistant curator to take
charge of the work in the Division of Mammals.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

In many ways the Department of Biology, when established at the
beginning of the fiscal year, was in much better condition than either
of the other two departments. The several zoological divisions already
existing and the Division of Plants were brought together under a
separate administrative head. As many of these divisions have been
in existence since the reorganization of the Museum in 1881, and
several of them for a much longer period, the organization of the
department was a relatively simple matter. The biological specimens
constitute the larger part of the Museum collections. They had been
in charge of curators and assistants who followed the well-defined and
long-established methods of systematic zoology and botany, and there-
fore no radical changes in the scientific methods or in the business
administration of these divisions were required. The efforts of the
head curator were largely in the direction of developing those features
which, from various cases, had not had due prominence. He found the
same difficulties met with by the other head curators in regard to
laboratory and exhibition space and the force at hiscommand. A large
amount of the biological material is displayed in the Smithsonian build-
ing. The bringing together of all the invertebrates in this building
was accomplished during the year, and this is a great gain in the classi-
fication of the exhibits. These collections include insects, mollusks,
and all other classes of invertebrates. The display in Musuem build-
ing includes the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, fishes, and the collec-
tions representing comparative anatomy. The birds remain in the
Smithsonian building, it having been found impracticable to transfer
this large exhibit to the Museum building.

The erection of galleries in the Museum building—a subject adverted
to later—while not involving great changes in this department, as in
the departments of Anthropology and Geology, rendered necessary the
complete reinstallation of the large exhibition series of mammals. In
the reinstallation Dr. True arranged the zoological exhibition on a
faunal basis, special prominence being given to the faunas of the United
States. This principal series is to be supplemented by various smaller
series illustrating important topics in biology.

The additions to the zoological and botanical collections were nu-
merous, and in some directions unusually important. The generous
donation of Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz of their collection of Coleop-
tera, principally North American, comprising about 200,000 specimens
and representing approximately 12,000 species, is of great importance,
as it places the National Museum in advance of all others as regards
North American Coleoptera. Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his liberal
gifts to the Museum by presenting large collections of birds, mammals,
reptiles, insects, and other animals from lower Siam and Kashmir; and
Dr. W. L. Ralph supplemented his valuable additions to the collections
of birds’ eggs. The largest acquisition to the mollusks consisted in
the gift by Dr. R. Ellsworth Call of a collection including over 86,000
Specimens.
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

Great activity prevailed during the year in the Division of Plants.
Accessions to the number of 307 were made, including the purchase of
all of the most valuable sets of American plants offered for sale that
were needed to fill out the Government collections. This division is
more fortunate than others in the Museum, having funds from which
such purchases can be made.

The scientific bureaus of the Government, including the Fish Com-
mission and the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture,
continued to make very valuable additions to the national biological
collections. A full description of these, and also of numerous additions
from individuals, is given in the report of the head curator of the depart-
ment, where also will be found the changes in the personnel and an
account of the work for the year.

Geology.—In the Department of Geology Dr. Merrill gave a large por-
tion of his time during the year to studying various Huropean museums
for the purpose of obtaining information as to the best cases and methods
of installation of collections in museums. In addition to the head
curator’s absence, nearly all work was suspended in the exhibition halls
during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases, so
that little progress was made in the exhibition series during the first
half of the year. Dr. Merrill resumed active charge of the department
early in November, when he began a systematic examination of the
written and printed records of the various exploring expeditions and
surveys, with a view to ascertaining what geological material had been
collected which could properly be considered the property of the Gov-
ernment, and what disposition had been made of the same. The law
provides that collections made for the Government shall, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress, be deposited in the National
Museum.' It was found that this law had not in all cases been enforced,
with the result that several important collections had not been trans-
ferred to the Museum, although several of the earlier exploring expe-
ditions had passed out of existence, and in several instances the
individuals making the collections had likewise passed away. lt was
decided to investigate all such cases. A fine collection of fossil fishes,
made by the Hayden Survey, was obtained from the executors of
Professor Cope’s estate, and some other material is soon to be trans-
ferred by them. A request was made to the Geological Survey for
any material that could be transferred without detriment to investiga-
tions in progress, assurance being given that the Museum could take
charge of extensive collections. The Survey soon transferred a large

'“And all collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural his-
tory, archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geo-
logical Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States,
when no longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the

National Museum.” (Supplement to the Revised Statutes of the United States, Vol.
I, second edition, 1874-1891, page 252.)
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

amount of good material, including in one instance two carloads of
vertebrate fossils from the laboratories of Prof. O. C. Marsh, in New
Haven, Connecticut.

The collection of fossil invertebrates was greatly enriched by two
most important gifts. Through the bequest of the late I. H. Harris,
of Ohio, the Museum came into possession of his private collection of
over 20,000 specimens of fossils; this is particularly rich in many rare
forms and a number of original types. From Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of
Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum was already so largely
indebted, there was received a large collection of fossil insects, com-
prising upward of 4,600 specimens, of which more than 200 are types.
Other valuable accessions are mentioned in the report of the head
curator.

In the Division of Mineralogy satisfactory progress was made in the
installation of the exhibition series. An immense amount of detail
work in overhauling and classifying collections stored in boxes and
drawers was accomplished. Owing to the pressure of other matters
and the unsatisfactory condition of the exhibition halls, scarcely any
investigations of note were undertaken by the curators.

GALLERTES.

The erection of the galleries in three of the halls and the four courts
of the Museum building, under the acts of Congress approved June 11,
1896, and June 4, 1897, was completed during the year, with the excep-
tion of the permanent railings. This increased the available floor
space of the Museum 17,000 square feet, or about one-sixth of the former
exhibition space. The various wall exhibits that formerly extended to
a greater height than the base of the galleries were removed early in
the year, and after the galleries were completed many cases containing
exhibits were placed on them. In addition to the galleries already
completed, it was decided to construct other galleries affording a fur-
ther floor space of 6,468 square feet, mainly for the purpose of securing
more room for the library and for the preparation of exhibits.

ACCESSIONS.

During the fiscal year there were 1,441 accessions, containing upward
of 450,000 specimens, the largest number for any one year during the
past decade. The total number of specimens recorded to July 1, 1898,
exceeds 4,000,000,

ATTENDANCE.

Owing probably to the national disturbance and distraction caused
by the war, the attendance was less than during the previous year,
when the multitude attending the Presidential inauguration ran the
record unusually high. The following table shows that the number of
Visitors to the Museum since 1881 is 3,972,987.

ADMINISTRATION,

The administrative work of the Museum was conducted most effi-
ciently during the year, mainly by Dr. I’. W. True, as executive curator,
and for short intervals by Dr. G. P. Merrill and Mr. W. H. Holmes,
respectively. Mr.J.L. Willige was acting chief clerk during the absence
of Mr. Cox in connection with the Nashville and Omaha expositions.
As chief of buildings and superintendence, Mr. J. KE. Watkins took
charge of the erection of the new galleries, and much of the success
attending their construction is due to his careful supervision.

In conclusion, it is a pleasure to me to state that commendation
is due the head curators and their assistants for the energy and
patience they have shown and for their willingness to subordinate indi-
vidual desires and preferences to the general welfare of the work of
the Museum. It is owing to this esprit de corps that the work of the
Museum progressed so satisfactorily during the year.

CONDITIONS AND NEEDS.

A national museum should be the center of scientific activity in the
country in which it is located. In England the British Museum is
the mecca of scientific men. The national museums in Paris, Copen-
hagen, Vienna, Berlin, and other capitals of Europe stand in similar
relations to the scientific work of their respective countries. Sucha
relation the National Museum should hold to scientific men and affairs
in America. It should receive and take care of all classes of mate-
rial which have been or may be valuable for investigation or for the
illustration of the ethnology, natural history, geology, products, and
resources of our own country or for comparison with those of other
countries. It should furnish material for all kinds of scientific investi-
gations which deal with specimens or types, and give aid to such
researches and publish their results. It should present by illustration
such of the results of the scientific investigations of its corps of officers
as are susceptible of such representation. It should cooperate with all
of the higher educational institutions of learning in the country, and
assist in the promotion and diffusion of knowledge in all of the lines of
investigation which are carried on by them. It should provide library
facilities, and, as far as can be done with justice to itself, aid all post-
graduate students who may wish to take advantage of the generous
provisions made by the Government for scientific investigations.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

SPACE.

The growth of the U.S. National Museum was rapid under the sue-
cessful charge of the late Dr.G. Brown Goode. When the character
of the building and the funds available for its maintenance are consid-
ered, it compares favorably with any modern museum. It has received
large collections from the scientific departments of the Government, and
through private contribution (with some additions by purchase and
exchange), all of which have been accommodated as well as could be in
the inadequate laboratories, storerooms, and exhibition space. The
galleries just completed have added 16,000 square feet of floor space,
which will help to a certain extent to relieve the crowded condition of
the exhibition halls and courts below. As an illustration of the pres-
ent conditions and the necessity for more room, attention is called to the
anthropological collections, which illustrate the development and pro-
gress of man and his works. If the material now in the possession of
the Government in this department should be properly placed on exhi-
bition, it would occupy the entire space in the present Museum build-
ing. The great collections in zoology, botany, economic geology, gen-
eral geology, and paleontology should be entirely removed and placed
in a building properly constructed for their study and exhibition.

Laboratory space.—In the present building there is a great defi-
ciency in laboratory facilities. Curators and assistants are hampered
for want of room in which to lay out, arrange, classify, mount, and
label specimens. There should also be rooms in which students could
bring together and compare various series of objects, and have at
hand books and scientific apparatus. The present Museum build-
ing contains a few rooms suitable for the purposes mentioned, but
the majority have to be used as storerooms, laboratories, and offices,
and are therefore too much crowded to serve in any one of these
capacities. Owing to the pressure for space, courts, halls, and gal-
leries intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian
building and in the Museum building, are unavoidably occupied to a
considerable extent as laboratories and storerooms. This lack of labo-
ratory space is extremely detrimental to the interests of the Museum.

Quarters for storage.—Beyond six small basement rooms under two of
the corner pavilions the present building has absolutely no provision
in the way of basement or other rooms for the storage of collections
which come in from day to day from Government field collectors or
private donors, or such as are separated for distribution or held for the
use of students. To remedy this defect many expedients have neces-
sarily been resorted to, such as placing storage cases (faced with
mahogany to make them presentable) in the exhibition halls, hiring
storage rooms in private buildings, and filling up offices, entrances,
Staircase-landings, and passageways not absolutely indispensable.
The ingenuity which has been exercised in this direction by some of
the curators is very great and the annoyances that are daily endured
in the interest of preserving the collections deserve notice. What is
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

needed is a series of spacious fireproof, basements for the less perish-
able objects, the collections preserved in alcohol, and the ordinary
stores and tools, and equally spacious dry lofts and rooms for those
collections and stores which require protection from dampness.

Exhibition space.—The present Museum building, though large in
extent, is overcrowded. It was built with the cheapest materials and
under the cheapest system of construction. Its lack of architectural
dignity and the indifferent character of the materials of which it is
constructed give it the appearance of a temporary structure and tend
to cheapen the effect of the really good cases and the very valuable
collections which it contains. The visitor is everywhere confronted
with rough walls, unfinished ceilings, and obtrusive trusses and sup-
ports. It should also be remembered that a considerable portion of the
collections are still in the Smithsonian building, where the crowding
is scarcely less than in the Museum building.

INCREASE IN THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

The head curators, curators, assistant curators, and aids, constituting
the scientific staff of the National Museum, number in all 63 persons,
divided among sixteen divisions. Of these, 26 are compensated for
their services and the remainder serve gratuitously, being for the most
part connected with other bureaus of the Government. The system of
honorary curatorship, while admirable within restricted limits, is a dis-
advantage when carried to the present extent. Such a system has a
disintegrating effect upon the organization, as the men are not entirely
at the command of the administrative officers and are not obliged to
serve at definite hours or under the ordinary restrictions of the paid
curators. The number of honorary officers should be reduced by the
substitution of a larger number of salaried officers.

The total number of scientific assistants should be very considerably
increased, as nearly all of the divisions are short-handed and many of
the collections do not receive the care they should have. At present
there are not enough assistants who can serve as acting officers in a
higher grade when the regular occupants of those offices are ill or
necessarily detailed for service outside of Washington. Moreover, a
museum can not be successfully carried on with intermittent service,
and it is extremely desirable that there should always be a consider-
able number of young men learning the duties of scientific assistants,
and thus making themselves capable of taking the places of the older
men when the latter become incapacitated. There are now only four
or five such young men in the Museum service.

PUROHASING AND COLLECTING FUND.

The National Museum has at present no regular fund for the acqui-
sition of collections and special objects, and can only make purchases
from a contingent fund which rarely exceeds $3,000 or $4,000, and which
is likely at any time to be required for other necessary expenditures.
For this reason, every year valuable collections which should be in the
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. at

hands of the Government, go abroad or to municipal museums or pass
into the hands of private citizens. Money is also needed to fill out and
make significant the various series already established in the Museum.
The American Museum of Natural History in New York expends
annually $60,000 for the increase of its collections, and the Field
Columbian Museum in Chicago has spent for collections during the
last five years over $419,000. Much of this was expended the first
year, but material is purchased from time to time as it is needed to
_make collections more nearly complete.

No effort on any scale commensurate with the importance of the
Museum has hitherto been possible in the direction of acquiring col-
lections by field work and exploration. There are many kinds of col-
lections that can be obtained only by scientific men working in the field.
Collecting expeditions are often costly, but in many cases their results
are such as can be obtained in no other way. There is no doubt what-
ever that it would be a very great advantage to the National Museum
if it could every year, besides purchasing a reasonable amount of mate-
rial, send out collectors to various regions to obtain objects which are
never offered for sale, and which, if gathered by unskilled collectors,
would lose all their value.

The experience of many years has shown that however active sur-
veying and exploring expeditions may be, collections can not thus be
made to grow symmetrically. There are always gaps which can be
filled only by purchase of materials. It is often necessary, for purposes
of comparision and for study, that the Museum obtain collections from
abroad, and such as can be had also only by purchase or exchange.
This fact is well recognized abroad, and the British museums and some
of those on the Continent contain rarer and better specimens from
America than do the American museums.

DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIMENS.

It is well known that the Museum distributes great quantities of
duplicate specimens. This is a very important work and could be much
extended if the scientific staff were larger. The work of bringing
together, identifying, labeling, and preparing for shipment sets of speci-
mens for educational institutions is very considerable, and consumes so
much time that it can not be properly entered upon by the present

force.
A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

The immediate and greatest need is a suitable museum building.
The present building is 375 feet square. The space on the ground
floor is 140,625 square feet, and that in the galleries 16,000 square feet;
exhibition space 96,000 square feet. The entire cost was $315,400.

For comparison with the above figures the following statistics
relating to the American Museum of Natural History in New York are
given. Total floor space, 294,000 square feet, divided as follows: Exhi-
bition space, 196,000 square feet; laboratories, library, ete., 42,500
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

square feet; work rooms, storage, etc., 42,000 square feet; lecture hall,
13,500 square feet. These figures include the portions of the building
now being completed. The total cost of the museum to date, including
the completion of the new wings, is $3,559,470.15. The buildings and
the care of them are provided for by the city of New York. The
expenses of the scientific staff, increase of collections, etc. (the income
for which the present year is approximately $185,000), are defrayed
from endowments, membership fees, and contributions.

The present National Museum building was erected with the view of
covering the largest amount of space with the least outlay of money.
In this respect it may be considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely
more than the shadow of such a massive, dignified, and well-finished
building as should be the home of the great national collections. There
is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fire-proof building of several
stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern in equip-
ment, and on such a plan that it can be added to as occasion demands
in the future. A site for such a building is already owned by the Gov-
ernment; only the building needs to be provided for. What the Capi-
tol building is to the nation, the Library building to the National
Library, the Smithsonian building to the Smithsonian Institution, the
new museum building should be to the National Museum.

Exhibition and laboratory space.—If the present building were devoted
to the Department of Anthropology, in the new building there should
be provided fully 115,000 square feet of exhibition space for the Depart-
ment of Biology, and for its laboratory and office rooms 75,000 square
feet, making a total of 190,000 square feet. The space mentioned is
based upon careful estimates of what will be needed for the proper
housing of and work on the collections now in hand and that will prob-
ably come to the Museum within the present generation. It would be
provisionally assigned among the different divisions of the department

as follows:

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

It is estimated that 65,000 square feet of exhibition space will be
needed in the Department of Geology and 18,000 square feet for its
offices and laboratories.

In addition to the laboratories for biology and geology there should
also be provided 5,000 square feet of laboratory space for the use of
post-graduate and special students who come to Washington to avail
themselves of the exceptional opportunities for study offered by the
materials brought together in the National Museum and by the inves-
tigations carried on in the various scientific bureaus.

There will also be needed a considerable portion of the basement of a
building for rough storage, preparators’ shops, taxidermists’ rooms, ete.

Lecture hall.—The need of a suitable lecture hall is imperative. The
lecture hall of the American Museum of Natural History has 13,500
square feet of floor space and that of the Field Columbian Museum
4,250 square feet. A suitable hall for the National Museum should
include at least 6,000 square feet. and there should also be one or two
smaller rooms that could be used for lectures on special topics, when a
small audience only is expected.

The American Museum of Natural History, which has 294,000 square
feet of space, has so planned its buildings that additions can be made
to them as rapidly as funds are available and the increase of the col-
lections demand the space. Less than one-fourth of the structure as
originally planned is completed.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

With suitable buildings provided, the immediate development of
the National Museum naturally lies in three directions. First, the
occupation of the present building by the anthropological collections;
second, the housing, developing, and installing of the great biological
collections, and third, the development of a great museum of practical
geology.

First.—The collections in anthropology, as they stand to-day, cover
a wide field in a broken and disconnected way. It is difficult to use
them effectually to illustrate the great features of this branch of sci-
ence. They do not present a connected story of the peoples and cul-
tures of the world. This arises from the gaps in the collections and
the absence of suitable laboratory and exhibition space. This depart-
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

ment should have adequate representations of the American peoples
and their culture, not only of our own country, but of the whole
American continent. Our nation is the only one in America that can
reasonably be expected to do anything of importance toward the pres-
ervation of the materials necessary for the illustration of this vast
field, and as the American race is a unit, of which the tribes in our
own territory constitute but a fragment, it appears to be our duty to
take up this work in a comprehensive way. . Thus would be built up
not only a national museum but an American museum in the widest
sense. This applies not only to anthropology but to the other great
departments of the Museum. It will be impossible to carry on such a
work without turning over to the Department of Anthropology the
entire present building, with all of its laboratory and exhibition space.

Second.—The Department of Biology now occupies a large exhibi-
tion space in the Smithsonian building and 55,000 square feet in the
National Museum building. Large collections, which would be placed
on exhibition if space were available, are stored in laboratories and
inclosed spaces in the exhibition halls. As has already been explained,
in a new building there should be available for the Department of
Biology 190,000 square feet of exhibition, laboratory, and storage space.

The present exhibit is more complete than that of the other depart-
ments of the Museum. Of birds there is a large mounted series, one
of the finest in existence, but it is so indifferently housed that it fails
to make the impression it should. Of mammals there is a good North
American series and some excellent examples of exotic species. There
is a good and rather large exhibit of the various groups of the lower
forms of animals, including an especially fine series of corals and
sponges.

These are the only series at present exhibited which can be considered
at all comprehensive. Of the great groups of fishes, reptiles, and
amphibians there is room only for an outline representation. The
wonderful variety of form among insects can be scarcely more than sug-
gested in the space available. Of plants there has hitherto been no
exhibit worthy of the name, and the space which it has now been pos-
sible to set aside is entirely out of proportion to the vast extent and
importance of this great kingdom of nature.

Every natural-history museum of the first class should have at least
two comprehensive exhibition series—tirst, the Systematic Series, repre-
senting the natural groups among which all animals and plants, from
the highest to the lowest, are divided; second, the Faunal and Floral
Series, showing the animals and plants characteristic of each of the
grand divisions of the earth’s surface which naturalists have established
as a result of their studies of these two kingdoms of nature.

These two great comprehensive exhibits should be supplemented by
a number of Special Series, illustrating the more interesting phenomena
and phases of life, such as the macroscopic and microscopic structure of
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

animals and plants and their development from the germ to the fully
adult individual, and special modifications of form and color by which
animals are protected from their enemies, the adaptations for peculiar
environments and modes of life, the characteristics of youth, maturity,
and old age, the variation in form, size, and color among individuals of
the same species, the domiciles and other works constructed by birds,
mammals, insects, and the like.

To these series should be added another of great importance, the
Economic Series, representing the animals and plants as related to the
activities and needs of man.

Any one of these principal series in its full development would more
than fill the entire space now available.

Third.—There should be developed a museum of practical geology in
the broadest sense, which will be of service to every producer and con-
sumer of American mineral products, and to all students of geology who
are engaged in either economic or purely scientific investigations.

In addition to the series of rocks and fossils illustrating the stratig-
raphy and succession of the sedimentary rocks and the systematic col-
lection of minerals and ores, an exhibit showing how geologic work
benefits the daily life of the people should be developed. An illustra-
tion of this would be a representation of the artesian water supply of
the semiarid region, showing the stratification and structure of the
sedimentary rocks, and how hydrographic and geological investigations
clearly indicate the regions in which artesian water development may
be carried on successfully. Mining and areal geology could also be
illustrated in such manner as to place before the student and intelligent
observer the import and value of such work.

In most museums the principal effort has been to make a collection

of useful mineral products. This is desirable, but from a broad view of
illustrating the practical in addition to the scientific side of geology it
should be secondary. The best basis for classification on the practical
side of the museum exhibit appears to be the finished mineral product.
For instance, if pig iron be taken as a key material in classification,
the iron ores from which it has been obtained should be arranged so
as to show the various kinds whose combination has resulted in the
final result as pig iron. In connection with this should be grouped the
geological phenomena, which should include representations of any
geological conditions connected with the original deposition and the
occurrence of iron ores. This might inelude the conditions which have
led to the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphur compounds of iron, and
to the development of hydrous oxides of iron; also an illustration of what
has been demonstrated in regard to the solution of widely distributed
minerals in certain rocks and their subsequent concentration in ore
bodies by metasomatic action. All of the metals could be arranged
under such a classification, as also the nonmetallic products. To pre-
pare such an exhibit would require many years of work, the details of
which would be considered as each mineral product was taken in hand.
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Some of the preceding suggestions have been adopted by the Museum
authorities and partially put into execution, and the carrying of them
out is dependent upon enlarged facilities for laboratory work and exhi-
bition space. During the administration of Dr. Goode, the Museum
developed as far as possible under the conditions surrounding it. No
one knew better than he that only by securing new buildings and ex-
panding the Museum could it take the place in America that the sev-
eral national museums of Europe had taken in their respective coun-
tries. It is well recognized that a public museum is a necessity in
every highly civilized community, and that, as has been so well stated
by Dr. Goode, “the degree of civilization which any nation, city, or
province has attained is best shown by the character of its public mu-
seums and the liberality with which they are maintained.” At present
New York City is, in this respect, in advance of all other American cit-
ies and of the National Government. Whether the latter will take its
proper place by developing the National Museum as it has developed
the National Library remains to be seen. The question whether they
are willing to be represented by the Museum as it is to-day is before
the American people.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98.

By Wi.Lu1AmM H. HOLMEs,
Head Curator.

It is convenient to present the matter of the present report under the
following heads:

I. General administrative work.
Il. Acquirement of Museum materials.
Ill. Preservation of collections.
IV. Classification and research.
YV. Installation.
VI. The Anthropological exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and

GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.

A partial reorganization of the Museum made at the beginning of
the year resulted in the formation of three departments, one of which
is Anthropology. The various divisions and sections dealing with man
and his works, which have been conducted independently of one
another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assist-
ant Secretary in charge of the Museum, are now united under a head
curator of anthropology. This operates to give direct expert super-
vision of all the divisions and properly correlates the various branches
of acomplex work. The head curator took charge October 1, 1897, and a
number of changes were made in the scientific staff of the department
and in the limitations of the fields occupied by the various curators
and custodians. The present organization is indicated in Appendix I.

There are a number of sections included in the department not yet
assigned to any one of the above divisions, and these remain for the
present under the direct supervision of the head curator. The present
classification of the material and the assignment of the staff are by
no means final. It was found impossible to devise a scheme that
would satisfy the requirements of scientific classification and at the
Same time accommodate itself to the acquirements of the present
staff, which is composed of persons devoted each to special portions of
the field of anthropology. It is expected that as the various branches
of the work become fully developed and the collections are enriched
and rounded out so that a systematic treatment of the whole field is
possible, the questions of reclassification and rearrangement of the

force will gradually adjust themselves.
19
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

The clerical and other nonscientific work of the department has been
conducted as in preceding years, save that some changes in routine,
intended to facilitate the transaction of business, have been introduced.
Official correspondence is carried on almost wholly through the Museum
Office of Correspondence and the executive officer of the Museum. The
records are thus less scattered and more generally accessible than if in
the*hands of many individuals. The work of receiving, recording,
marking, and placing accessions is well provided for in the official rou-
tine, and the necessary poisoning of specimens, repairs, making of
replicas and models, the building of group exhibits, ete., are in the
hands of expert preparators.

During the year two notable episodes have diversified the work of
the department, viz, the building of galleries, and the preparation of
exhibits for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha. Iron
galleries were constructed in four of the seven anthropological halls
and this has not only seriously interfered with the progress of installa-
tion, throwing the halls affected into confusion for several months, but
has made it necessary to reinstall the major part of the exhibits in all
the halls. From year to year the spaces have become gradually over-
crowded with exhibits, and the opening of the galleries afforded the
opportunity of relieving the congestion in part. The first step in this
reassemblage of collections was the selection of furniture to accord
with the spaces and the collections, and the head curator has devoted
much time to the utilization of the various styles of cases to the best
advantage. Necessary alterations and repairs were made in cases,
pedestals, screens, etc., as the work progressed. In reassembling the
furniture, much attention was given to the opening of thoroughfares,
the widening of spaces, and in systematizing and simplifying the instal-
lation. The work on the main floor is now well advanced, but, in the
galleries where wall cases are in process of construction and in halls
where floors are being laid, it remains far from complete.

For a period of three months, ending with June 1, the energies of
the department were largely devoted to the preparation of an exhibit
for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, a detailed account of which is
given in another place.

-

ACQUIREMENT OF MUSEUM MATERIALS.

A primary function of the department is the acquirement of Museum
materials. These materials include specimens and the data relating to
them. Specimens consist of the actual objects, derived from every
part of the anthropological field, and of models and casts, as well as
of photographs and other representations of the actual objects. The
channels through which they are acquired are (1) gift; (2) transfer (from
the Smithsonian Institution and departments of the Government);
(3) purchase; (4) collection; (5) exchange, and (6) manufacture. To
these materials are added deposit or loan collections, the treatment of
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21

which is identical with that of bona fide acquisitions. The adminis-
tration of the function of acquisition in the department is uniform
with that of other departments.

Gifts.—The accessions for the year have been numerous and valuable,
and details relating to them will be found in another place. Among
the gifts are some of notable importance. A collection of antiquities
and ethonological material, the bequest of the late W. Hallett Phillips,
of Washington, is not only of great extent but of exceptional value to
archeological science, having been collected and recorded with care by
Mr. Phillips, who was a conscientious and discriminating devotee of
archeological research. The collection contains 12,467 ancient relics,
mainly stone implements from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnolog-
ical specimens from Polynesia. The latter material was collected by
Mr. Henry Adams, of Washington, during a prolonged voyage among
the Pacific islands.

Transfers.—The Smithsonian Institution, through the agency of its
Bureau of American Ethnology, has acquired by purchase and trans-
ferred to the Museum two collections of importance—a valuable series
of ancient stone and earthenware utensils from graves and mounds in
Arkansas, and a collection of antiquities from mounds of the well-known
Etowah group of Georgia, nade by Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown,
Georgia. The latter lot, together with the material previously obtained
from the same locality by agents of the Bureau of Ethnology, forms
one of the most instructive assemblages of archeological material ever
brought together from the mound region.

A noteworthy accession of the year is a collection of 2,206 human
crania transferred to the Museum from the Army Medical Museum,
through the courtesy of Surgeon-General G. M. Sternberg. This col-
lection has been accumulating for many years and represents mainly
the Indian tribes, ancient and modern, of North America. Much of
the material was acquired through National Museum agencies and was
turned over to the Medical Museum for the benefit of the corps of
students of physical anthropology connected with that institution. It
includes only nonpathologic remains and is to form the nucleus of a
division of physical anthropology in the Anthropological Department.

Deposits.—Of the various collections loaned to the Museum during
the year, and at the same time offered for sale, two are of more than
usual importance. (1) A very extensive series of stone implements
and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, owned by Dr.
Roland Steiner, and (2) a collection of ethnological material from the
Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Indian tribes, made by Emile
Granier, of Paris. Itis expected that these collections will be acquired
by the Museum at an early date. Other loan collections worthy of note
are (1) aseries of personal mementos of Gen. W.S. Hancock, deposited
by Cadet G. R. Hancock, of West Point Military Academy, and a num-
ber of important Jewish religious ceremonial objects deposited by Mr.
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

H. E. Benguiat. A valuable collection of Japanese porcelains, loaned
by Miss E. R. Scidmore, is now installed in the Gallery of Ceramics.

The Section of Electricity, Division of Mechanical Technology, has
been especially fortunate in acquiring material, and the following state-
ment of Mr. G. C. Maynard, custodian of the Section of Electricity, is
quoted from the report of Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator.

One of the most important accessions received during the year is an extensive
collection of apparatus deposited by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. This deposit
embraces a large number of pieces of apparatus made and used by Professor Bell in
his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical science. The inven-
tion and development of the speaking telephone, from the first crude experimental
device to the most perfect instrument now in use, is clearly illustrated by a series of
objects showing the various advancing steps by which the new art of telephony was
created. :

Another interesting portion of the collection is the apparatus devised and used by
Mr. Bell in his photophonic experiments, including the original instrument with
which, on the 2d of June, 1880, he successfuily transmitted articulate speech by
means of a beam of light from the roof of the Franklin School building, in Washing-
ton, to his laboratory on L street, a distance of 213 meters. Mr. Bell contributed his
original induction balance apparatus, including that devised by him for the purpose
of locating the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield, and similar appara-
tus of later dates. In addition to the above the accession includes Bell’s multiplex
telegraph instruments, his induction balance audiometer, for testing hearing, and
an Edison phonograph of the earliest pattern, in which the sound waves are recorded
on a sheet of tin foil.

The deposits made by the General Electric Company are of much interest and value.
Among the historical objects are the first Thomson-Houston three-coil, are-light
dynamo, made in 1879, which formed the basis of the Thomson-Houston electric
lighting system, the first automatic regulator used with this machine, a dynamo and
electric motor used in the Thomson-Houston factory at New Britain in 1880-1881, the
first electric welding machine made by Thomson, and many other pieces of original
apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for lighting, the transmission
of power, and other purposes. Another contribution from the same company 1s one
of the first incandescent electric-lighting dynamos, made and put in operation by
Edison in 1879, on board the steamship Columbia, of the Oregon Steamship Navigation
Company, which was the first steamboat equipped with incandescent electric lights.
This dynamo was continued in active use for a period of nearly twenty years, and
is still serviceable. Especial interest attaches to this machine for the reason that it
is one of the first lot of four dynamos made in this country for commercial incandes-
cent electric lighting. One of the others formed part of the eyuipment of the polar
exploring vessel Jeannette, commanded by Captain De Long, on its cruise into the
Arctic Sea, where it was lost in 1882. Contributions of a series of historical incan-
descent lamps and specimens of insulated conductors have also been received from
the General Electric Company.

The Coe Brass Manufacturing Company, of Ansonia, Connecticut, through its
president, Mr. George F. Brooker, presented to the Museum ten dynamos made
between the years 1873 and 1879, by William Wallace, for the generation of elec-
tricity for electric lighting, electroplating, and other purposes. Some of these
machines were in practical operation during the Centennial Exposition at Philadel-
phia, and are said to be the first are-light dynamos used for public lighting in this
country.

An electric generator of still earlier date than any of those referred to was made
by Charles A. Seeley in 1867. In regard to this machine it is said that early in the
year 1867, when the principle of self-excitation in dynamos was new, and in fact
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 23

practically unknown except to a few of the most advanced electricians in this coun-
try, the subject of electric lighting was broached by Professor Seeley to Mr. Horace
Greeley. Mr. Greeley became deeply interested and highly amused at the idea of
grinding out electricity with a crank and then making light of it, as he expressed
his understanding of Professor Seeley’s description of an are light operated by a
dynamo. Mr. Greeley suggested that Seeley should build a dynamo and other appa-
ratus, which were accordingly started at once. The satisfactory results of the
experiment led to the publication of an editorial in Mr. Greeley’s paper, the New
York Tribune, on March 28, 1867, which foreshadowed the success that has since
been attained in the art of electric lighting. The Seeley dynamo and the original
electric motor and railway devised in 1834 by Thomas Davenport, who was the first
inventor of a method of applying galvanism to produce rotary motion, were received
as a deposit from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers through Ralph W.
Pope, the secretary of the organization.

The dynamos added to the section during the year represent almost the entire
range of American inventions which form the basis of the practical methods of elec-
tric lighting, both by are and incandescent lamps, and mark an important epoch in
the history of artificial illumination. Duplicates of few, if any, of these machines
are in existence.

A Morse telegraph register, presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Prof.
Henry Ortmann, of Baltimore, by direction of the late Rev. Henry Schieb, appears
to be of especial interest. The instrument was in the possession of Mr. Schieb for
many years, and is said to have been used on a private telegraph line operated by
him and Professor Morse prior to the building of the public line between Washington
and Baltimore in 1844.

Mr. Edward L. Morse has during the year deposited several instruments and doc-
uments relating to his father’s telegraphic inventions.

There have been added to the Henry collection a number of experimental electrical
instruments found by Miss Mary A. Henry in the possession of Miss Annie Wrightsen,
of Albany, from whom the apparatus was purchased.

Results of exploration.—Explorations begun during the preceding
year, under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, have
yielded material of great value. Excavations conducted by Dr. J.
Walter Fewkes, near Tucson, Arizona, have resulted in the acquisition
of some 1,300 specimens of pottery and other classes of relics, and Mr.
J. B. Hatcher, collecting for the Bureau of Ethnology, has forwarded a
number of unique ethnological specimens from Patagonia. Explora-
tions undertaken in Brown County, Ohio, by Mr. Gerard Fowke, also
for the Bureau, yielded a limited collection of relics from stone-grave
burials of the mound builders.

Eaxchange.—The exchanges have not been important, although col-
lections of considerable value have been acquired, as follows: (1) Vari-
ous ethnological and archeological objects from South America in
exchange for pueblo collections with the Field Columbian Museum, of
Chicago. (2) A series of flint nodules, flaked flints, and flint working
tools from the gun-flint factories of Brandon, England, in exchange
for chert quarry refuse from Indian Territory.

Manufacture.—The department relies for many of its most interest-
ing and instructive exhibits upon the skill of its curators and expert
preparators. During the year a number of models have been prepared
illustrating primitive life, processes, implements, utensils, etc., and
24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

numerous reproductions of objects of interest, in plaster, have been
made.

Notwithstanding the large number of accessions and their undoubted .
value, it should be noted that the results of the year’s collection are not
wholly satisfactory. The meagerness of funds for purchase has made
it impossible to secure some of the most important collections offered,
and as no provision is made for exploration and systematic expert col-
lection, it is found that, save for the occasional well-ordered collections
donated or transferred, the acquisitions are fragmentary and lack the
detailed data so essential to the student engaged in research.

»

PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS.

Following the acquisition of museum materials are various steps
looking to their preservation. The collections for the year have been
accessioned, recorded, and marked as usual, and have been stored or
placed in the study or exhibition series by the curators. The depart-
ment suffers much inconvenience from lack of space and facilities
for handling the collections. Instead of a well-ordered laboratory in
which to open, spread out, examine, compare, and classify specimens as
they arrive or as subsequent research goes on, small portions of the
exhibition halls have been screened off for the purpose, thus interfering
with installation, and often rendering hasty removals and premature
Storage necessary. At the close of the year one entire gallery is
devoted to laboratory uses and is thus necessarily closed to the public.
I regard the lack of laboratory space as extremely detrimental to the
interests of the department.

A large part of the ethnological collections require expert attention
on their arrival in the Museum. They are unclean and infested with
destructive insects, and experienced preparators are required for clean-
ing and preserving. The latter work is carried on in a small shop in
an outbuilding. This is very inconvenient and requires the removal of
the collections to be treated from the Museum building to one which
is by no means a safe repository for valuable specimens.

The question of storage of material has arisen many times during the
year, and numerous collections have been removed to storage. The
exhibition halls, although much less crowded than at the beginning of
the year, still contain more material than can be properly exhibited.
The total surplus is, therefore, very great. The present exhibits occupy
60,000 square feet of space, the entire floor space of the Museum being
only about 100,000 feet. The anthropological collections properly
installed would fill the entire Museum building.

CLASSIFICATION AND RESEARCH.

The third important function of the department relates to the use of
the collections in conducting researches looking to exhibition and pub-
lication. All possible information relating to the specimens is secured,
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25

and they are studied, compared, and classified. This work is essential
to their intelligent utilization, and necessarily precedes installation and
publication. It is the work which most constantly employs the atten-
tion of the curators and is referred to at length in the reports which
they have submitted.

Researches having in view publication of results have been conducted
by Prof. O. T. Mason, Dr. Walter Hough, Mr. J. E. Watkins, and Dr.
Thomas Wilson. In several cases collectors have engaged in the study
of the collections made by themselves. This is true especially of Dr.
Fewkes, Mr. Cushing, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. Stewart Culin.
Mr. J. D. MeGuire has prepared a monograph on tobacco pipes, employ-
ing the collections of the Divisions of Ethnology and Prehistoric Archee-
ology, and Dr. Edward Eggleston, and Dr. H. Carrington Bolton have
made studies of portions of the Copp collection of colonial relics in the
Division of History and Biography.

INSTALLATION.

Display of collections constitutes a most important function of the
Museum; it may be regarded as the essential function, since all others
are as well subserved by the storehouse and laboratory. Public dis-
play is the feature that gives the Museum its status as an educational
institution. The all-important question then is, in what way and by
what methods shall the department undertake to instruct by means of
its exhibits? Exhibition is not regarded simply as the presentation of
the materials of a museum so that the public may see them. The
essential point is the presentation in such logical order that the great
truths of human history may be told in the briefest and clearest way.

There are several methods of presenting the materials of anthro-
pology, but two of these are of primary importance and are used to the
practical exclusion of the others. The first is the geographical or
ethnographical assemblage, and the second the developmental or genetic
assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special; they are the
chronological, the comparative, the individual, etc. The first mentioned
methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths of
anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited por-
tions of the field—for special or limited ideas which are to be fully
elaborated.

THE GEOGRAPHICAL OR ETHNOGRAPHICAL ARRANGEMENT.

The most natural assemblage of the materials illustrating the peoples
of the world is in groups related one to another as are the peoples
themselves in more or less well-defined geographical divisions. Thus
assembled it is possible for the student or the ordinary museum visitor
to make his studies pretty much as he would make them in traveling
from country to country. The museum on this plan is a miniature
world, so far as the objective materials of anthropology are capable of
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

constituting such a world. Under this method of classification all
collections coming into the possession of the Museum may be intelli-
gently assembled. From this assemblage, whether as exhibition or
study series, selections of duplicate objects may be made for building
up exhibits illustrating the history of man as seen from other points
of view. ;

The materials employed in this grand division of the exhibits are
not yet brought together in the Museum in their final relationships.
The collections relating to living tribes and nations are separated from
those representing prehistoric peoples of the same areas, the latter
occupying the great hall of the Smithsonian Institution. It is hoped
that in the near future the construction of a new building, or a
reassigninent of the present Museum spaces, may lead to the proper
correlation of these important exhibits.

THE DEVELOPMENTAL ARRANGEMENT.

The second grand division of exhibits assumes to present selected
portions of the collections on a totally different plan from the pre-
ceding, and they are thus made to record and convey a totally distinct
class of ideas. The story told by these exhibits is not that of tribes
or .nations and their connection with particular environments, but
that of development of the race along the various lines of culture prog-
ress, each series beginning with the inceptive or lowest stages and
extending to the highest. These series are synoptic in character.

The following exhibits arranged on this plan have already been
assembled or are in process of segregation: tafe

Each specimen in these series stands not as an isolated product of
activity, but for an idea—a step in human progress; each series is a
logical assemblage of these ideas—these steps in human progress, and
the order is such as to suggest to the mind the broader truths of human
history. The group of series properly arranged serves to illustrate the

development of human thought and the gradual expansion of human
interests.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21

SPECIAL ASSEMBLAGE—CHRONOLOGICAL, CYCLOPEDICAL, COMPARATIVE,

There are innumerable subjects covering limited portions of the
anthropological field that call for special elaboration and separate
assemblage of materials. The history of a single nation may be thus
treated, as, for example, the history of the United States, a most
- appropriate subject for our National Museum; the history of Trance,
appropriate to a French museum, the order of presentation being chron-
ological. An elaborate assemblage of exhibits may be made for cyclo-
pedical or reference use merely, as in the case of our former section of
materia medica, but this method is not applicable to any large portion
of the field of anthropology. Other exhibits still may serve for pur-
poses of comparison of what different peoples do living under distinct
environments, as, for example, the series of drinking vessels in the
East Hall; of what has been accomplished by different nations or
establishments, as in the ceramic section.

PLACEMENT OF EXHIBITS.

The accompanying ground plan will serve to indicate the distribution
of the grand divisions of exhibits in the Museum building. The col-
lections of prehistoric archeology, placed in the great hall of the Smith-
sonian Institution, belong to Group A.

Grand divisions of anthropological exhibits in the Museum building.

The areas occupied by the three grand divisions are indicated by let-
ters as follows:

A. Geographical presentation of men and culture.

B. Developmental presentation of human activities.

C. Special presentations of activities and phenomena.

Four great halls and their galleries are devoted to exhibits assem-
bled on the geographical plan (A), the peoples of the world being repre-
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

sented with as much completeness as the limitations of the national
collections will permit. Three of these halls are occupied by American
materials and one by exhibits representing the remainder of the world.

In the West North Range or Catlin Hall (formerly the lecture hall)
are brought together, for the first time in any degree of completeness,
very extensive collections obtained from Indian tribes of the great
region which extends from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains.
These are arranged primarily by provinces, and secondarily by stocks
and tribes, but as yet they are only tentatively placed, as the entire
hall is to be cleared in the near future for laying a floor and building
galleries.

The walls of this hall are completely covered with portraits and
scenes representing mainly the great group of tribes assigned to the
hall. They are the work of George Catlin, the noted traveler and
artist. To this hall are assigned also various groups of lay figures
illustrating the tribes concerned, and the windows are to be embellished
with a series of photographic transparencies covering the same ground.

The hall known as the Northwest Range contains collections from
numerous Indian tribes of the northwest coast region, assembled at the
north end, and very complete exhibits from the Eskimo tribes of the
arctic regions, assembled in the south end of the hall.

The Northwest Court (Pueblo Court) contains exhibits pertaining to
the great group of town-building tribes of Arizona, New Mexico, and
adjacent sections, known as Pueblo (town) Indians. ‘The antiquities of
the region are also included, as they are known for the most part to per-
tain to the same general group of peoples. The collection of pottery
is very extensive, and the series of lay-figure industrial and ceremonial
groups make the display more than usually attractive.

In the gallery of this court are assembled, though not yet fully
installed, collections from the tribes of the great arid region of the
Southwest, other than the Pueblos, as well as limited series of objects
representing the tribes of Mexico, Central America, and South America.

The West Hall contains extensive collections from a multitude of
peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the gallery in the north side
is occupied by materials from Australia and the Indo-Pacific Islands.

Grand Division B, which includes exhibits arranged to illustrate the
progress and achievements of the race in many of its principal arts
and industries, occupies three halls and two galleries in the northeast
section of the building. A few additional exhibits belonging to this
division are still installed in other sections of the Museum. The prin-
ciples upon which they are assembled have been explained elsewhere.
In East Hall adjoining the Rotunda is placed a group of exhibits
epitomizing the history of various arts, domestic and industrial. In
the eastern portion of the hall are collections. illustrating transporta-
tion, electricity, physical experimentation, ete.

The Northeast Range (Boat Hall) is occupied by a very extensive
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

collection of boats, models of boats, and other exhibits exemplifying
the development of water transportation, and especially the progress
in steam navigation achieved in recent years by American inventors.

The Northeast Court, main floor, contains the remarkable collections
illustrating the graphic arts brought together by Mr. S. R. Koehler,
honorary curator, and the gallery is devoted to ceramics and examples
of art products in glass, enamel, lacquer, metal, and ivory.

The exhibit of materia medica, brought to a high degree of com-
pleteness by the honorary curator, Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. N., is installed
in the East Hall Gallery (north side). The more comprehensive title
of Division of Medicine having been substituted for that of ‘‘ materia
medica,” heretofore used, it is proposed to arrange and develop the
collection on the lines adopted for other branches of human activity,
and to attempt to illustrate the history of medicine, or the evolution
of ideas concerning disease and its treatment. The following provi-
sional classification is taken from Dr. Flint’s annual report:

A. Magical Medicine.
1. Exorcism, invocation, and incantation.
2. Amulets, talismans, and fetiches,
B. Psychical Medicine.
1. ‘Laying on of hands.”
2. Suggestion.
3. Hypnotism.
4. Faith cure.

1. Baths, massage, exercise, electricity.
2. Surgery, including acupuncture, cautery, blood letting, and surgical
operations in general.
D. Physiological or Internal Medicine.

The third grand division of exhibits, the Special, is represented by a
number of collections of importance. The North Hall is occupied by
a large series of exhibits arranged chronologically to illustrate the
history of the United States. Beginning at the left, just within the
north door, the period of discovery is presented. This is followed in
order by the Colonial and Revolutionary periods, the war of 1812-14,
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

the Mexican war, ete. Continuing on the west side are collections
illustrating the period of the civil war and notable personages and
episodes pertaining to it and to succeeding periods.

The Division of Religions occupies the West Hall Gallery (south side),
where interesting exhibits are assembled in groups illustrating the
Jewish, Mohammedan, Buddhistic, and other religions. The large col-
lection of musical instruments occupies the wall cases of the North Hall;
various collections of ceramic products, glass, metal work, etc., grouped
by peoples or manufacturing establishments, are placed in the gallery
of the Northeast Court, and exhibits illustrating the composition of
the human body and the analysis of foods and drinks occupy part of the
East Hall Gallery (north side).

ANTHROPOLOGICAL EXHIBIT OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM AT
THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.

The frequency with which the National Museum has been called upon
to prepare exposition exhibits has made it somewhat difficult to secure
fresh and interesting material for display. To obviate this difficulty in
the Department of Anthropology it was decided to assemble the limited
group of exhibits required on a plan differing essentially from that
adopted for previous expositions.

Heretofore the materials have been brought together in a somewhat
disconnected way, to illustrate particular peoples, or especial arts or
industries as represented by their products. On the present occasion
the activities of man are treated from the point of view of their devel-
opment. The various lines of progress are represented by a series of
objects, each typifying a step in the industrial and intellectual Syomuge
of the race.

As the exhibits required had to be drawn from all divisions of the
department, a single series of objects in many cases being made up
from the collections of two or more divisions or sections, members of
the anthropological staff were called upon to act as committees in assem-
bling the exhibits in which they were personally concerned. The full
resources of the Museum were thus drawn upon, yet the objects taken
were so few in number as not to interfere seriously with the present
Museum installation.

Each series of exhibits epitomizes a single branch of art or industry
and occupies a single case-front or fraction thereof, and may thus be
conveniently seen at one view. The scheme of treatment or presenta-
tion is just such as the systematic student would adopt in writing the
history of the subject, beginning with the inceptive stages and moving
forward step by step to the highest development. The following subjects
are presented, beginning at the left in the cases and progressing toward
the right:

The use of fire-—The story begins with the fire of voleanoes and light-
ning and the carrying of firebrands from the sources for rekindling,
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. on

illustrated by means of colored drawings; it is continued in a series
of exhibits showing progressive steps in the making of fire, illustrated
by rubbing sticks, revolving drills, flint and steel, the lucifer match,
and devices for producing the electric spark.

Illumination.—Two series of objects are chosen, the first illustrating
the torch in its many forms, arranged progressivly ; the second, the lamp,
beginning with the stone cup with oil and wick and ending with the
argand burner and the are light.

Fishing.—Of the various exploitative activities, so necessary to the
sustenance of the race, only one group—the art of fishing—is repre-
sented, others having been omitted for want of space. Series 1 illus-
trates the dart in its multiplicity of forms; series 2, the various toggle
devices; series 3, the hook; series 4, the sinker.

Domestic arts.—Household arts are represented by four series—one
epitomizing the history of cooking, and three illustrating utensils and
devices employed in eating and drinking (the cup, the spoon, and the
knife and fork).

Tools of general use.—The history of the more essential tools of human
handicraft is epitomized in seven series, each beginning with the sim-
plest forms—wmere splinters and masses of stone—and ending with the
highest forms, the marvelous machine-operated’ tools of to-day. They
are the hammer, the ax, the adz, the knife, the saw, the drill, and the
scraper.

Weapons.—Weapons of war have performed a most important part
in the history of progress, and the steps that led up from the stone and
the club held in the hand to the steel sword and compound machine
gun are strikingly suggested in two series presented: 1, weapons for
use in the hand—piercing and slashing weapons; and 2, projectile
weapons—the bow and arrow, the crossbow, the pistol and gun.

Transportation, marine.—The history of water transportation is epit-
omized in four of its leading lines of elaboration: 1, the hull, begin-
ning with the log raft and ending with the magnificent substructure of
the modern ship (represented by models); 2, hand propulsion—the
pole, the paddle and the oar (in part models); 3, the paddle wheel
(models); and 4, the screw propeller (models).

Transportation, land.—Land transportation is shown in six series
(models): 1, the burden bearer, man and beast; 2, the sliding load; 3,
the rolling load; 4, the wheeled vehicle; 5, the steam locomotive; and
6, the railway track.

The great group of elaborative activities concerned in manufacture
is illustrated in four exhibits: The ceramic art, the textile art, metal
work, and sculpture.

Ceramic art.—In this exhibit are included four series: 1, implements
and devices employed in manufacture—modeling tools, decorating
tools, stamps, molds, and the throwing wheel; 2, the vase, showing
progressive steps in shaping, decorating, and the results of firing on
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

the paste and surface finish; 3, glass making in its relation to ceramics;
and 4, enamel. ;

Textile art.—Weaving is represented by three series: 1, the spindle;
2, the shuttle; and 3, the loom; the latter illustrating in a remarka-
ble manner the rapid transition from primitive to highly developed
appliances.

Metal working.—The history of this important branch is partially
presented in three series: 1, metal reduction; 2, products of manufac-
ture, showing progressive order in processes, forms, and embellishments ;
and 3, tools and appliances of manufacture.

Sculpture—The stone-shaping arts begin with the simplest known
artificial modifications of natural forms and advance to the achieve-
ment of the highest ideals as represented in Greek art. Four series |
are shown: 1, prehistoric stone shaping (Europe); 2, aboriginal Ameri-
can sculpture; 3, sculpture of civilized nations; and 4, implements used
in stone shaping. Series 1, 2, and 3 are separated for the purpose of
contrasting the work of distinct periods and peoples.

Photography.—This art, the product of advanced culture, is repre-
sented by three series of objects, epitomizing the development of: 1, the
camera; 2, the lens; and 3, the picture.

The book.—A limited series of objects is devoted to the history of the
book, the method of assembling the several parts—the tablets and
sheets—being the feature considered.

Electricity—Electrical inventions, representing one of the youngest
and most marvelous branches of human activity, are shown in three
limited series—l1, experimental apparatus (Henry); 2, transmitting
apparatus (Morse and subsequent inventors); and 3, recording appa-
ratus.

Music.—Four series are devoted to the history of as many varieties
of musical instruments—1, wind instruments; 2, reed instruments; 3,
stringed instruments; and 4, percussion instruments.

The system of arranging these series is such as to make them fully
intelligible to the average museum or exposition visitor. A large label
or sign is framed and placed outside of each case at the top; a general
label for each exhibit, giving briefly the history of the subject treated,
is framed and placed inside the case. Also a label explaining each
progressive series is placed at the beginning of the series, and individ-
ual labels describing the specimens are placed with the specimens.

Associated with these developmental series are a number of life-
size figures, modeled in plaster and appropriately costumed, intended
to illustrate the practice of the arts in their primitive stages. They
give a vivid impression of primitive processes and serve to contrast
these with the methods and machinery of advanced civilization. The
subjects presented are as follows:

The fire maker.—A. Ute Indian making fire by twirling, between the
palms of his hands, a wooden shaft with its point set into a second
piece of wood.

NAT MUS 98——3d3
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE,

Head Curator.

The Department of Biology was established at the opening of the
fiscal year, July 1, 1897, by bringing together under a separate admin-
istrative head the several zoological divisions already existing in the
Museum, and the Division of Plants. The collections represented by
these various divisions together constitute the larger part of the
Museum, and have been accumulating for nearly half a century. The
majority of the divisions themselves have been in existence since the
reorganization of the Museum, in 1881, and several of them for a much
longer period.

On account of the great length of time that the collections have
been in existence, and the well defined and long-established methods of
systematic zoology and botany, no radical changes in the mode of con-
ducting the administrative or scientific business of the divisions has
been necessary or in contemplation. The efforts of the head curator
in the past year have been, as they probably will be in the future,
largely in the direction of developing those features which in the past,
for various causes, have not had due prominence.

The conditions prevailing as regards space and amount of assistance
are far from ideal, and until much increased facilities in these direc-
tions have been provided it seems improbable that any great general
advance can be made.

On the side of the exhibition of collections (the matter which appeals
most directly to the public) the deficiency is in the nature of insuffi-
cient and unsuitable space. Without a rearrangement which would
involve both of the other departments of the Museum and an amount
of work incommensurate with the result obtained, the proper sequence
of exhibition collections can not be had in the present quarters.

At the close of the last year the birds, reptiles, fishes, and mollusks
and other invertebrates, except insects, were displayed in the Smithso-
nian building, while the mammals, insects, and collections representing
comparative anatomy were displayed in the Museum building. As any
general transfer of the birds is impracticable at the present time,
endeavor was made to at least somewhat improve the sequence by
removing the insects to the Smithsonian building and transferring the
exhibits of batrachians, reptiles, and fishes to the Museum building.
This was accomplished without a great amount of labor or expense,

35
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

' and is a gain to the extent of bringing all the exhibits of invertebrates
together in the Smithsonian building.

The erection of galleries in the Museum building, while it did not
involve as much rearrangement in this department as in those of
anthropology and geology, nevertheless made a complete reinstalla-
tion of the large exhibition series of mammals unavoidable.

This change brought to view the desirability of having the zoologi-
cal collections, for the most part at least, arranged in accordance with
some one comprehensive plan. While many schemes of more or less
merit suggested themselves, the limitations as regards the extent and
character of the space at command were such as to preclude most of
them; while the anticipation that a new building may be provided at
no very distant time in the future, made the adoption of others seem
undesirable. After giving the matter serious thought, I decided that
the zoological exhibits should be arranged on a taunal basis, special
prominence being given to the faunas of the United States. This prin-
cipal series is to be supplemented by various smaller special series,
illustrating important topics in biology. The adoption of this plan, it
is believed, will cause the exhibits to be more significant and more
attractive to the public than hitherto, and at the same time the labor
and expense involved in effecting the modification will be limited.

A good start in this direction has been made during the past year in
connection with the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, and fishes. The
greatest change, as already stated, was made necessary in the Division
of Mammals on account of the erection of galleries in the south hall of
the Museum building, in which the exhibits are placed. The cases con-
taining groups of large mammals could no longer stand in the center
of the hall, and were therefore arranged at the sides under the galleries.
The main floor is now devoted to an American faunal collection, and
the galleries to the faunas of the rest of the world. It is the intention
to make the North American series complete, but other faunas can only
be represented by genera, even if it were desirable to do so, on account
of lack of space. The old wall cases were removed to the gallery, and
it is the intention to add to them at the beginning of the next fiscal
year, so that they will occupy the whole of the wall surface on both
sides of the gallery. Floor cases along the railings will be employed
for the smaller species.

The American batrachians, reptiles, and fishes were brought together
in the southeast range. At the close of the year the cases in the Smith-
sonian building containing marine invertebrates were rearranged, but
a complete reinstallation of the specimens and a modification of a
majority of the cases will be needed. The cases containing exhibits of
insects were removed, as already stated, to the Smithsonian building,
but no work has as yet been done on them. No extensive change is at
present In contemplation in connection with the exhibits of birds, mol-
lusks, or comparative anatomy.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37

Hitherto the Museam has had no botanical exbibition series, except
a small collection of specimens of native and foreign woods, pictures of
trees, etc., intended to illustrate the subject of forestry. This collection
was withdrawn from exhibition some years ago. To form a really
significant botanical exhibit itis recognized that it will be necessary to
begin de novo. Any advance in this direciion is hedged about by dif-
ficulties because of insufficient space. A beginning has, however, been
made by mounting under glass a representative series of seaweeds.
To these it is the intention to add outline series representing other
groups of plants, and to supplement these by special exhibits, such as
illustrations of poisonous plants, models of poisonous and edible fungi,
etc. The plans for these are, however, subject to modification in the
coming months, and it is even possible that the construction of galleries
in the ranges, and in particular in the southeast range, for which pro-
vision was made by Congress, will prevent any further installation of
exhibition collections during the coming year.

The additions to the zoological and botanical collections during the
year have been very numerous, and in some directions unusually
important. First should be mentioned the donation by Messrs. Henry
G. Hubbard and E. A. Schwarz of their collection of Coleoptera,
principally North American, comprising about 200,000 specimens, and
representing, approximately, 12,000 species. The addition of this great
and important collection places the National Museum in advance of all
others as regards North American Coleoptera, and the generosity of
the donors in presenting this vast amount of material, which they
have accumulated with so much labor and expense, can not be too
highly extolled.

The labors of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for so many years has been a
most generous benefactor of the Museum, demand liberal commenda-
tion. During the past year this indefatigable collector presented to
the Museum large collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and
other animals from Lower Siam and Kashmir. The Abbott collection
comprises the larger portion of the most valuable Old World material of
the Museum. Dr. W. L. Ralph has continued his valuable gratuitous
additions to the collection of birds’ eggs, and in this connection should
also be mentioned the gift of Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan, comprising more than 600 bird skins, 900 eggs, and 250
birds’ nests from the Philippine Islands. The friendly cooperation of
Dr. L. T. Chamberlain has resulted in large additions to the collection
of fresh-water mussels. The largest acquisition of the year in this diree-
tion was the gift of Dr. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, comprising
over 86,000 specimens. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts,
presented a very interesting series of bird skias, 170 in number, from
Santa Marta, Colombia.

The additions to the herbarium for the year exceed 40,000 specimens,
of which about one-half were obtained by purchase. Gifts of plants
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

have been numerous and amount together to about 4,000 specimens.
Prof. O. F. Cook presented 662 specimens of Liberian plants in excel-
lent condition and of much interest. Dr. B. L. Robinson, of Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, presented a large series of valuable Mexican
plants, numbering in all about 1,700 specimens. ‘These were admirably
supplemented by another collection of Mexican plants presented by
Mr. E. A. Goldman, of Alila, California. About 6,000 plants were
acquired by exchange during the year.

As already stated, about 20,000 herbarium specimens were pur-
chased. Every important American collection offered for sale was
obtained, with the result that the National Herbarium has been greatly
enriched.

The scientific bureaus of the Government, particularly the U.S. Fish
Commission and the Biological Survey and Division of Botany of the
Department of Agriculture, have continued to make very valuable
additions to the national collections. Especially to be mentioned are
the invertebrates collected by the naturalists of the Albatross, in 1896,
on the coasts of California, Japan, and Kamchatka, and in Bering Sea,
and the specimens obtained by the assistants of the Commission during
the past thirteen years, comprising more than 600 lots. Numerous
valuable types and cotypes of different species of fishes collected by
the Commission have also been transmitted. The Biological Survey
collected in Mexico a large series of land shells, which are regarded by
Mr. Dall, the curator of the Division of Mollusks, as the most intrinsi-
cally valuable acquisition of the year in that direction. Mr. Dall
remarks:

This series, collected at various times and localities, contains an unusual number

of fine undescribed species and numerous others new to the collection. The propor-
tion which may be described as really valuable is unusually large.

The accumulation of valuable specimens received singly or in small
lots from numerous friends of the Museum deserves notice. An enu-
meration of these will be found in Appendix I.

With the exception of plants, few purchases of importance were made
for the Department during the year, but a series of rodents from Pata-
gonia, collected by Mr. W. A. Peterson, comprising 239 specimens is
deserving of notice. The collection of mammals is very deticient in
South American specimens, and this material was especially desirable.

An extended reference to the explorations of members of the Museum
staff will be found on page 69. Collections were made by Messrs.
Rose and Pollard in Mexico and Florida, respectively; by Dr. Leon-
hard Stejneger in the vicinity of the Commander Islands; by Messrs.
Schuchert and White on the coast of Greenland, and by Mr. Robert
Ridgway in Florida. The explorations of Mr. R. P. Currie in Liberia
were referred to in the last Annual Report, although the larger portion
of the material obtained was not received until after the beginning of
the present fiscal year.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

Some important changes were made in the personnel of the depart-
ment during the year. In the Division of Insects, Dr. Harrison G. Dyar
was appointed custodian of Lepidoptera. Dr. William L. Ralph suc-
ceeds the late Maj. Charles Bendire as custodian of the Section of
Birds’ Eggs. Mr. W. T. Swingle was appointed custodian of the Sec-
tion of Algze and Mr. D. G. Fairchild of the Section of Lower Fungi.
These gentlemen have rendered exceedingly valuable services in their
several sections during the year. The department is indeed dependent
for its successful operation at the present time very largely upon the
gratuitous, disinterested efforts of its honorary curators and custo-
dians, the value of whose services can not be overestimated.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates Miss Harriet Richardson
and Miss Mary B. Smith served as volunteer assistants.

The routine work of entering, classifying, and caring for the collec-
tions in the several divisions has been carried on continuously, and it
may be said that the condition of the collections in general is better
than ever before. The greatest drawback has been tound in the lack
of sufficient laboratory space, the working rooms in some of the divi-
sions being crowded to such an extent that it is almost impossible for
the assistants to move about in them. This crowding affects the work
in many ways, making the arrangement of collections unavoidably
unsystematic, to a large extent, and rendering nearly impossible those
operations which require the use or inspection of large numbers of
specimens at the same time. The extensive collection of mammals of
the Department of Agriculture, including especially the large forms,
were brought together in a part of the southeast range, which has
been screened off for the purpose, no other space being found for this
bulky material. This encroachment upon the exhibition space is con-
sidered undesirable, but can not be avoided unless additions are made
to the Museum building or a larger structure provided. A similar
provision was made for the National Herbarium, in the Division of
Plants, a portion of the East Hall gallery being given up for the pur-
pose. The collection of plants has grown to great size and importance
and has entirely overflowed the quarters assigned to it a few years since.

In the Division of Mammals the type specimens were brought together
and carefully labeled with special red tags where needed. They will
be kept hereafter in special cases. The overcrowding in the upper
laboratory was somewhat relieved by a rearrangement of specimens,
but the case room is at present inadequate. The study series is in an
excellent state of preservation, but much in need of a rearrangement,
which, however, can not be accomplished until more case room is
provided.

In the Division of Birds Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator, reports that
a large portion of the series, including all the water birds and waders,
was thoroughly overhauled and rearranged in new dust-tight cases,
which have been provided for the purpose. Some twenty families still
AQ) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

require attention, and are now, for the most part, crowded into cases
which are unsuitable and are practically inaccessible. A special effort
has been made during the year to bring together type specimens of
birds and to see that they were properly labeled and arranged in cases
made for the purpose.

Doctor Ralph devoted a large amount of time to clearing away the
accumulation of work in the Section of Birds’ Eggs since the death of
Major Bendire. The collection now numbers over 64,000 specimens,
and is by far the most extensive in existence. While the eggs them-
selves are in excellent condition, the collection of nests is only indif-
ferently provided for, and new cases will be needed.

As is fully recognized by the curator, the exhibition series of birds is
by no means satisfactory. The cases in the Smithsonian building are
old and not dust tight, and are furthermore very much crowded together,
on which account, and because of the insufficient lighting in the hall,
the collection can not be appreciated at its true value. As already
stated in another part of the report, an attempt will probably be made
during the coming year to remedy these defects to a certain extent, but
the problem is a very difficult one, and it is doubtful whether the
exhibit can be brought up entirely to modern standards without more
expense than would be justified under present conditions. Special
attention was given to some of the series, such as the hornbills, a very
striking group, of which the Museum possesses a full collection. This
series was entirely overhauled and new forms added.

A special series arranged for children has been for some time exhib-
ited in a small room adjacent to the main hall, and was relabeled
throughout during the year.

In the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians, the exhibition series
was removed from the Smithsonian to the Museum building, as already
stated, and rearranged to form a faunal North American series. The
exotic mounted skins, which were indifferent in quality and insufficient
in number and variety to form a series of any significance, were boxed
and stored, duplicates of American species were removed, and the
remainder arranged in systematic order. The curator, Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, reports the general collections as being in excellent condi
tion, but no extensive operations were carried on, as he was necessarily
absent a considerable portion of the year in connection with his duties
as a member of the Fur Seal Commission.

The exhibit of the Division of Fishes at the close of the last fiscal
year consisted of several cases of casts and a large number of alcoholic
specimens in jars, all of which were displayed in one of the smaller
halls in the Smithsonian building. For reasons previously stated, the
casts were removed to the Museum building, where they were installed
in the southeast range in cases more suitable, and in such manner that
the characteristics of the American fauna could be appreciated at a
glance. The large collection of alcoholics was withdrawn from exhibi-
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41

tion, it having been shown that they could scarcely be made interesting
or instructive to the public. A place was found for them in the labora-
tory, which for some time had been occupied by mammals, a change
which has the advantage of allowing them to be protected from the
light and make them accessible to students without intruding upon
the public. Type specimens were placed in special cases and guarded
from the light, which causes deterioration.

The cases formerly used for the exhibition of fishes being old and of
a pattern not now considered suitable for such purposes, they were
removed to the laboratory and there made use of for the better arrange-
ment of the general study series.

Mr. William H. Dall, curator of the Division of Mollusks, reports
the great collections of that division in good condition, but calls atten-
tion to the inconvenience arising from overcrowding, which increases
year by year. A very large amount of material, comprising no less than
3,500 species of shells, was identified for correspondents of the Museum
during the year. In connection with this work, however, the Museum
receives many valuable specimens.

There has been very great activity in the Division of Insects during
the year, which the honorary curator, Dr. L. O. Howard, regards as a
phenomenal one in the history of the division. He writes:

The surprising part, however, is in the fact that the actual number of species and
specimens and their scientific value surpasses anything in the history of the division,
since, notwithstanding the wonderful increase and value of the specimens received
last year, due to the extensive exotic material presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, those
received during the present year will more than equal those received during the past
decade. This increase is due principally to the very large and valuable collection
of North American Coleoptera presented by Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz, while it
is worthy of note that the additions, without this collection would be nearly three
times as large as those in the previous fiscal year.

The collections are in a better state of preservation than ever before,
and a large amount of work has been done in rearranging and classify-
ing specimens. The material in each order has been divided according
to continents and arranged systematieally, by which plan the labor of
identifying new material is considerably lessened. Dr. Dyar, custodian
of Lepidoptera, has rearranged the collections of that order, adding
many species from his private collection, and in both ways very greatly
increasing the value of the collections. This voluntary work is of much
importance to the Museum and is highly appreciated. All the types and
cotypes at present in the collection have been properly labeled during
the year and recorded in a special catalogue. The whole number of
these specimens is nearly 6,000.

The chief operation of the Division of Marine Invertebrates was the
preparation of 100 sets of duplicate specimens, designed for distribu-
tion to high schools throughout the country. Each set contains speci-
mens representative of about 100 species, and more than 30,000
Specimens are included in the entire series. About one-half of these
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

sets have already been distributed. The distribution of this large
amount of material has relieved the storerooms and cases. As already
stated, a considerable change is contemplated in the exhibition series
of the division, and at the close of the year work was begun by a
readjustment of the the cases in the exhibition hall.

The curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy, Mr. F. A.
Lueas, was absent a considerable portion of the year in connection
with his duties as a member of the Fur Seal Commission. On that
account, and because he is also charged with the general care of the
vertebrate fossils, a large amount of work has not been done on the
osteological collections. So far as the exhibition series is concerned
this is not detrimental to the Museum, as the series is already very full
and very carefully arranged and labeled. The condition of the reserve
series, however, is not satisfactory, the curator reporting that more
than double the number of drawers now in use are needed for the
accommodation of specimens and their proper arrangement and to
permit the withdrawal from storage of the large amount of material
now practically inaccessible.

In the Division of Plants Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator, reports
that several important changes and improvements have taken place.

In order to provide a circulation. aisle for visitors around the East
Hall gallery it was necessary to move the screen at the east end back
some 4 feet into the botanical laboratory. The loss of space was com-
pensated for by assembling a double row of cases on the south side of
the gallery for its whole length, making in all about 200 running feet.
Whether this arrangement can be maintained permanently is perhaps
doubtful.

Two rooms in the east tower were fitted up for the collection of
eryptogamic plants, which, however, is likely to soon outgrow these
quarters.

The sectional herbarium, numbering some 30,000 specimens, which
was formerly kept in the Section of Paleobotany, was returned to the
general collection, and the work of distributing the specimens to their
proper places has progressed satisfactorily during the vear.

The separation and’ marking of type specimens has been continued.
During the year 252 such specimens were marked, inaking a total thus
far of 1,596. ;

Scientific investigations of more or less wide scope have been carried
on in the several divisions of the department during the year, and tle
results obtained are very creditable to the staff. Mr. Robert Ridgway
has made satisfactory progress on the comprehensive manual of North
and Middle American birds, which he has had in preparation for a con-
siderable time. The head curator of the department has continued
studies on the cetaceans, and has completed a paper on the nomen-
clature of the whalebone whales of the North Atlantic... Mr. G. S.
Miller, jr., has been engaged in an investigation of the Free-tailed bats.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. A3

He has published several minor papers on mammals during the year,
Dr. T. H. Bean has continued work on the collections of fishes made by
the Tish Commission steamer Albatross in South American waters,
and has made investigations in the waters of New York with special
reference to fish life. Mr. Barton A. Bean has continued investiga-
tions on the.collections of Mexican fishes and has completed one portion
of the work, the results of which are now in hand for publication. He
also made a study of the fishes of Wallowa Lake, Oregon, for the U.S.
Fish Commission, the results of which are given in a report already in
the hands of the Commissioner. Mr. W. H. Dall has devoted consid-
erable time to a revision of the bivalve shells in connection with his
work on the Tertiary invertebrate fauna, and has made various minor
investigations, The study of the fresh-water mussels has been con-
tinued by Mr. C. H. Simpson with important results. Dr. L. O. How-
aid has continued studies on the parasitic insects of the family Encyr-
tine, especially those parasitic on the Coccid, and has completed one
paper on that group. Mr. W. H. Ashmead has nearly completed his
monograph of the insects of the family Braconidie, which he has had in
hand for several years, and has worked up four large collections of
Hymenoptera. The collections of insects made by Messrs, Stejneger
and Barrett-Hamilton, of the Fur Seal Commission, on the Commander
Islands, bave been worked up and reported upon by Messrs. Schwarz,
Dyar, Coquillett, Banks, and Cook. The results will be published in
the report of the Fur Seal Commission. Mr. Coquillett completed his
monograph of the flies of the family Tachinidie and his revision of the
Simulidie, and both have been published. He also worked up the
Japanese Diptera, received from Professor Mitsukuri, and completed a
revision of the family Scatophagide. He has under hand revisions of
the Helomyzide and Sapromyzidw. Prof. O. Ff. Cook has continued
studies on the Myriapoda and the Orthopteran insects of the families
Mantide and Phasmide. Mr. J. EK. Benedict has completed his studies
of several groups of Isopod Crustaceans and published reports on the
Arcturide and the genera Synidotea and Idotea. He has continued
work on the Galatheidie and has in preparation a paper on the genus
Munidopsis. Miss M. J. Rathbun completed a paper on the Decapod
Crustaceans of Jamaica and on the Brachyuran Crustacea coliected by
the Iowa University expedition of 1893 to the Florida Keys and Baha-
mas. She also compieted three minor papers on Crustaceans and made
other studies in that group.

Mr. J. N. Rose, assistant curator in the Division of Plants, has
devoted a considerable portion of the year to the determination of the
botanical material collected by him in Mexico, with a view to the pub-
lication of the results of lis observations.

The collections of the department have been made use of extensively
by naturalists throughout the country and abroad, various series and
single specimens being loaned, as in previous years, for investigation.
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. -

(For a detailed list of loans see page 64.) The loans of botanical
material have been very numerous, aggregating in all about 3,900
specimens. Included in the records of loans are the names of the
botanical departments of Columbia, Cornell, and Harvard universities
and other universities and colleges, together with botanical gardens
and museums at home and abroad. In addition to these loans of
specimens the collections have been studied in Washington by numer-
ous specialists during the year. The naturalists of the U.S. Fish Com-
mission and of the Biological Survey and other bureaus of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture have of course had free access to the collections,
and have made use of them to a considerable extent.

The publications for the year (a list of which will be found in the
Bibliography) show a gratifying activity on the part of the scientific
staff of the department, and indicate also the large extent to which
the collections are being used by naturalists generally.

Considerable time was occupied during the year in preparations for
an exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, at
Omaha, Nebraska. The exhibit which was planned by the head cura-
tor, and assembled with great success by the heads of the several divi-
sions, consists of a representation of the aquatic faunas and marine
plants of the United States. Every group of animals inhabiting our
waters is included, from the lowest to the highest, and an extensive
and most excellent series of seaweeds. The large mounted birds and
the casts of fishes and reptiles are displayed in a large wall case con-
structed for the purpose. The remainder of the exhibit is shown in
narrow floor cases, with full plate-glass fronts. It includes some novel-
ties, such as jelly fish preserve:l in formalin, which have probably not
been seen at any previous exposition. The whole series is carefully
labeled. .
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98.

By GEORGE P. MERRILL,
Head Curator.

The past year has been one of great, if not unparalleled, progress in
the department. This for the reason that under the reorganization
which was effected early in the year, proper coordination of the various
divisions was for the first time rendered possible.

Owing to the suspension of work of all kinds in the exhibition halls
during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases,
together with the prolonged absence of the head curator in Europe, it
is true, however, that but little of this progress is as yet evident to the
public.

Since actively assuming charge of the department, early in Novem-
ber, the head curator has devoted much time to going over the written
and printed records of the various United States exploring expeditions
and surveys with a view to ascertaining what geological materials had
been collected which could be properly considered the property of the
Government, and what disposition had been made of the same. This
has resulted in bringing together some of the scattered materials
which had been loaned in years past for study purposes, or which had
never been turned over to the custody of the Museum. Moreover, so
soon as it became apparent that the department was ready and more
than willing to take charge of the materials, Prof. O. C. Marsh
announced his readiness to turn over the large series of vertebrate
fossils collected under his direction during his connection with the
U.S. Geological Survey under J. W. Powell. Mr. Lucas, the acting
assistant curator of the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, spent
four weeks, with proper assistance, at New Haven in May and June of
this year, with the result that two carloads of these fossils, comprising
many specimens of Triceratops, besides Dinoceras, Hlotheriwm, and
other Miocene forms, have already been received.

Arrangements have been made, through the administrator of the
estate of the late E. D. Cope,for the return to the Museum of the
extensive series of Eocene fishes, collected principally during the years
1872-73 in Utah and Wyoming, and retained by Professor Cope for
study. It is confidently expected that these will reach the Museum
even before this report appears in print.

In addition to the collection of vertebrate fossils already noted, the

division has obtained, through purchase, a valuable collection of Mosa-
45
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL* MUSEUM, 1898.

saurs from the Cretaceous of western Kansas, two collections of Elasmo-
branch teeth -and spines from the Carboniferous of Iowa, and an
unusually fine skull and fore-limb bones of Claosaurus.

Through the U. S. Geological Survey was obtained a small collection
of vertebrates, including a new species of Dinictis and a Suilline from
the Miocene of Dakota.

The Section of Invertebrate Paleontology has likewise been greatly
enriched, the two most important accessions being gifts. Through the
bequest of the late Mr. I. H. Harris the Museum has come into the
possession of his private collection of over 20,000 specimens of fossils.
This is one of the finest collections ever mode from the rocks of the
Cincinnati group, and is particularly rich in starfishes, crinoids, and
trilobites, and, moreover, contains a number ‘of original types.

Mr. Rh. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum is
already so largely indebted, has presented his extensive collection of
fossil insects. This comprises upwards of 4,640 specimens, of which
more than 200 are types. In addition, he also presented 97 other inver-
tebrate fossils, 408 vertebrate fossils, and added 132 specimens to his
series of fossil plants. From the U.S. Geological Survey was received
a series of over 600 specimens of Kinderhook crinoids, corals, and mol-
lusea, and 450 crinoids from the Burlington group in Iowa. In addition,
Messrs. Schuchert and White, of the Museum and Survey, made a
valuable collection representing the flora of the various Cretaceous and |
Tertiary horizons of North Greenland. Other valuable materials,
including an excellent Placenticeras, 22 inches in diameter, trom Dakota,
were obtained either by purchase or otherwise.

The Division of Mineralogy has materially benefited during the year
through the acquisition of much new material, including several new
and rare species.

The Division of Physical and Chemical Geology reports the acquisi-
tion of a large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, Prussia;
some large masses of a beautiful orbicular granite from Sweden; ‘ful-
gurites on andesite from Little Ararat in Armenia, besides a large
amount of petrographic material from the U.S. Geological Survey and
other sources. The Economie Series have been enriched through the
acquisition of some beautiful clear masses of rock salt from Heilbron,
Prussia, collected by the head curator; kaolins and clays from Germany
and Saxony; an excellent series of telluride ores from the Cripple
Creek district, Colorado, and other materials which need not be men-
tioned in detail here.

Aside from what has been accomplished in the Division of Mineralogy,
but little progress has been made in the work of installing the exhibi-
tion series. This is for the reason that the erection of the new galleries
in the exhibition halls of the Divisions of Paleontology and Economic
Geology, was not completed in season for more than a beginning to be
made. Indeed, the new cases in the paleontological halls are not yet
in readiness. Moreover, for a period of several weeks the energies of
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

nearly every curator and those of his assistants were fully occupied in
the work of preparation for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The
details of this work have been the subject of a special report, and need
not be repeated here.

Mr. Lucas reports that in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology
a large amount of preparatory work has been done incidental to
strengthening, restoring, and preparing for exhibition the skeleton of
Zeuglodon. Two skulls of Oreodon, and one of Mesohippus from the
Evans collection have been cleaned, a fine skull of Claosaurus and the
upper portion of a magnificent Triceratops nearly prepared for exhibi-
tion, and smaller skulls and parts of skeletons wholly or partially pre-
pared for exhibition or study. Work of this nature is extremely slow
and laborious, and additional preparators are sadly needed. When it
is remembered that, excepting when aided by Mr. Schuchert and others
in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, the entire work of this
division has thus far been carried on by Mr. Lucas, with the assistance
of one clerk and one preparator, it will be recognized at once that
surprising progress has been made.

The prolonged absence of Mr. Schuchert, incidental to the purchase
of materials for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and a subsequent
trip into Missouri, together with his Greenland trip earlier in the
season, has necessarily greatiy retarded his work. Satisfactory prog-
ress has been made in installing the study series and in the prepa-
ration of exhibition material, though this, too, is delayed, owing to the
condition of cases and exhibition halls. Practically nothing has been
accomplished with the paleobotanical series. It is expected that the
appointment of an assistant in charge of this collection, and the com-
pletion of the galleries and cases, will enable me to report more satis-
factory progress another year. Up to this time all Museum work -done
on these collections has been voluntary by members of the paleobotanical
staff of the Geological Survey, or by Mr. Schuchert and his assistants,
whose time was already more than occupied by the work of their own
division.

In the Division of Mineralogy I-have to report satisfactory progress
in the installation of the exhibition series. The Systematic Series, the
collection of meteorites, and several special series are now, for the first
time, satisfactorily installed, and Mr. Tassin, who has had immediate
charge of the work, is entitled te much credit, not merely for his energy
and industry, but as well for the taste he has manifested in the selection
and display of the material.

Much work yet remains to be done in the way of supplying deficien-
cies and labeling, but it is not too much to say that the collections as
a whole are in excellent condition.

In the Division of Physical and Chemical Geology (systematic and
applied) of which the head curator has immediate charge, no progress
whatever has been made with the exhibition series until within a
A8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. ‘

period of some two weeks, owing to the delay in the completion of
the gallery cases and Mr. Newhall’s absence in Nashville and Omaha.
The work is now progressing satisfactorily.

An immense amount of detailed work has been accomplished in over-
hauling and classifying collections stored in boxes and drawers, but
much yet remains to be done.

Searcely any investigations of note have been undertaken by any of
the curators, owing to the pressure of other matters and the unsatisfac-
tory condition of the exhibition halls. The head curator was himself
absent in Europe during the first five months of the year, attendant
upon the meetings and excursions of the Seventh International Geo-
logical Congress, and engaged in a study of European museums. Mr.
Lucas has nearly completed his work on the Fossil Bison of North
America, and Messrs. Charles Schuchert and David White have made
a preliminary study of the fossils collected by them in Greenland dur-
ing the summer of 1897. Their results are now in press.

With the exception of the collections made by Messrs. Schuchert
and White in Greenland and the necessarily limited amount of mate-
rial brought back by the head curator from Russia, scarcely anything
has been done toward the enrichment of the collections through the
direct efforts of Museum officials. The collections made by the U.S.
Geological Survey and obtained by gift, purchase, and exchange have
been already referred to.

The usual custom of loaning collections for study has been adhered
to. Two small lots of vertebrate materials were loaned during the
year, the one to Prof. H. L. Osborn, of New York, and the other to Dr.
C. Rh. Eastman, of Cambridge. Dr. J. F. Whiteaves, of Ottawa, Canada,
was in like manner loaned a collection of Hamilton fossils, and Dr, ©
George H. Girty, of the U.S. Geological Survey, has had the loan of a
collection of English Carboniferous pelecypods for comparison with
American species. A collection of thin sections of roofing slates was
loaned Prof. T. Nelson Dale, of Williamstown, Massachusetts, and the
U.S. Geological Survey has on sundry occasions been granted the
usual courtesies.

The condition of the laboratories and exhibition halls has been such
as to afford little encouragement to students and investigators. Prof.
O. P. Hay has studied the large Cretaceous fishes from Kansas, with a
view to deciding certain points in the structure of the skull and verte-
bral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the genus Portheus is
synonymous with Xiphactinas. Several new points on the structure
and affinities were ascertained and the conclusion reached that Xiphac-
tinas Leidy, was identical with Portheus Cope. Similar results were
reached independently by Alban Stewart, of Lawrence, Kansas. Prof.
Henry I. Osborn has likewise studied the type of such species of Cory-
phodon as are represented in the collections.

Aside from the studies of members of the U.S. Geological Survey,
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49

no investigations of note have been carried on in the Museum by other
than its officers, either in the sections of Invertebrate Paleontology
or Paleobotany. In the Division of Physical and Chemical Geology,
Mr. Thomas L. Watson, now of the State survey of Georgia, and
Dr. EK. C. E. Lord have each spent several months, the one conducting
investigations relative to the weathering of basic eruptive rocks and
the other working on the rocks collected by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns
along the line of the Mexican Boundary Survey, and a series of
eruptive rocks from Casco Bay, Maine.

The reasons already enumerated have necessarily cut down the num-
ber of papers that might otherwise have been published by the curators,
Such as have appeared are sufficiently noted in the Bibliography.

The rapid accumulation of materials, and particularly large materials
like vertebrate fossils, bids fair to tax to the utmost our resources for
handling, preparation, and proper care. When it is recalled that the
preparation of a single skull may require the services of a skilled
preparator for months, it will be seen at once that our present force is
quite inadequate. Moreover, work and storage rooms are pitifully
cramped. When further, one recalls the strikingly interesting char-
acter of the display that is possible with this class of material, as well
as its great value from a purely scientific standpoint, the desirability
of pushing the work with all possible vigor becomes at once apparent,
and I feel that I can not too strongly urge the granting of additional
funds for the purpose.

The work of rearranging the collections in physical geology, involy-
ing the actual moving of upward of 100,000 specimens, labeling, num-
bering, and bringing the card catalogue up to date, will consume a very
large portion of the coming year.

The same may be said regarding work in the sections of Inverte-
brate Paleontology and Paleobotany. There are at present not far
from 1,000 boxes of fossil materials of all kinds in storage, which must

be overhauled, identified, duplicates assorted for exchange and distri-
bution, worthless portions rejected, and the remainder made available
for study and exhibition.

The amount of detailed labor essential to the proper care of the col-
lections can be appreciated only by those who have had experience.
This applies to other departments than my own.

Notwithstanding the fact that we are for the time being overbur-
dened with materials, no opportunity should be lost for securing more,
even though the same may remain years in storage. It is too much to
expect that the present favorable conditions for collecting will always’
exist. Hyery reported discovery of interesting material, by members
of the U. S. Geological Survey, or other parties, should be investi-
gated, and where the character of the material warrants, immediate
Steps should be taken toward its procurement by purchase or other-
wise. It must be borne always in mind that delays in these matters

NAT MUS 98 4

HOS REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

result disastrously. This is particularly true regarding vertebrate
remains which, once exposed, become quickly ruined, unless promptly
and properly cared for, and inexperienced collectors often do more
harm than good. Moreover, other institutions, both American and
foreign, are ever on the alert to obtain that to which we naturally feel
the National Museum is best entitled.

I can not refrain, in conclusion, from stating that too much praise
can scarcely be awarded the individual curators and their assistants
for the untiring energy and patience manifested, and their willingness
always to lay aside individual desires and preferences for the welfare
of the department as a whole. But for this, the work of the head
curator would be disheartening in the extreme.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The amount appropriated for the National Museum for the current
fiscal year was $233,000. The total expenditures under this appropria-
tion aggregated $227,473.54, leaving a gross balance of $5,526.46. From
the appropriations for the previous fiscal year expenditures to the amount
of $10,492.95 were made, leaving a balance (subject to liabilities) of
$391.76.

ol
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

The appropriations for the fiscal year just ended were $25,275 in
excess of those for the preceding year, there being an increase of $6,775
in the amount appropriated for the preservation of collections, an
increase of $1,000 for heating and lighting, an increase of $15,000 in
the amount allotted for furniture and fixtures (to be used for the con-
struction of cases, etc., for the new galleries), and an appropriation of
$2,500 for removing and rebuilding storage sheds. It may be remarked
that the amount allotted for the preservation of collections fell short
of the estimate to the extent of $20,000, and that the appropriation for
heating and lighting was $1,000 below the estimate; also that the sum
asked for to be used in repairs to buildings was cut down one-half, the
amount provided being only $4,000. The sum of $18,000 was requested
for printing and binding, but only $12,000 was appropriated.

The unexpended balances of appropriations for the fiscal year 1895-96
remain the same as at the close of the last fiscal year, and are as fol-
lows: Preservation of collections, $1.32; furniture and fixtures, $0.20;
heating and lighting, $0.42; building repairs, $1.38. No further claims
having been presented against these appropriations, the balances will
revert into the Treasury, to be carried to the credit of the surplus fund,
under the provisions of section 3090 of the Revised Statutes.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Lea.

The following statement concerning the estimates for appropriations
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, is quoted from the report of the
acting chief clerk, Mr. J. L. Willige:

In October estimates were prepared of the appropriations required for the main-
tenance of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899. In
addition to the regular appropriations for furniture and fixtures, heating and light-
ing, preservation and increase of collections, building repairs, rent of workshops,
postage, and printing and binding, the following special appropriations were
requested: For illustrations for Museum publications, $5,000; for the purchase of
books, pamphlets, and periodicals for reference, $2,000; for the continuation of the
construction of galleries in the Museum building, the building of skylights in the
four courts, and the erection of a ventilator upon the roof of the lecture hall, $10,000;
for the erection of a fireproof building for workshop and storage purposes, $50,000;
for the purchase of the herbarium of the late M. 8S. Bebb, of Rockford, Illinois,
$5,000; for the purchase of the library of the late G. Brown Goode, $5,000.

“ An increase of $20,000 was requested in the estimates for the coming fiscal year
for the preservation, exhibition, and increase of the Museum collections. The
importance of the grant of this additional sum for the purpose of developing the
Department of Geology and expanding it in the direction of a museum of practical
geology and to enable substantial increases to be made in the compensation of the
higher grades of assistants in the Museum was strongly urged upon Congress.

The latest conference report on the sundry civil bill states the item at $165,000, an
increase of $5,000 over the appropriation for 1898.

In the estimates for appropriations for the coming fiscal year is an item of $15,000
for heating and lighting, being $1,000 in excess of the current appropriation.

In view of the considerable sum of money paid from year to year by the Museum
for the preparation of drawings for use in the Museum publications, it was endeav-
ored to have a specific appropriation of $5.000 provided for the purpose. It was
explained that this item of expenditure is an important one in carrying out the
policy of disseminating information regarding the Government collections among
educational institutions throughout the country, and the hope expressed that it
would not be necessary to continue the cost of illustrations as a charge upon the
appropriation for the preservation, exhibition, and increase of the Museum collec-
tions. The sundry civil bill, while not, however, containing a specific appropriation
for drawings, authorizes the expenditure for this purpose, from the preservation of
collections appropriation, of a sum not exceeding $5,500.

In the estimates submitted to Congress for the coming fiscal year is an item of
$17,000 for printing the Bulletins and Proceedings and labels and blanks for the
National Museum, and binding books and pamphlets for the Museum library. It is
urged that the entire sum asked be appropriated, in order that an edition of the
Museum publications large enough to supply the principal scientific and educational
establishments may be assured.

The sundry civil bill had not become a law at the close of the fiscal
year, but the appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1899, as

agreed to by the conferees of the Senate and: House of Representatives
are as follows: !

BUILDINGS.

In the acts of Congress approved June 11, 1896, and June 4, 1897,
provision was made for the erection of iron galleries in the Museum
building. Under these appropriations, amounting altogether to $16,000,
galleries have been erected in the four courts and in three of the halls
of the building, thus increasing the exhibition space by 17,000 square
feet. °

During the fiscal year just closed the work of constructing the gal-
leries has been under the direction of the Superintendent of the Library
of Congress.

In the estimates submitted to Congress for appropriations for the
coming fiscal year the sum of $10,000 was asked for, to be used in
erecting galleries connecting the courts with the adjoining halls, sup-
plying railings, painting the ironwork about the galleries, and placing
skylights above the courts. This item is included in the sundry civil
bill as passed by both Houses of Congress and sent to the President
for approval.

It was requested in the estimates for 1898-99 that provision be made
for the construction of a special building adapted for workshops and
for storage purposes. A preliminary plan for a building 50 feet front
by 130 feet deep, to be entirely fireproof in its construction and corre-
sponding in its materials and workmanship with the Museum building,
was prepared and submitted. The cost of the proposed building was
estimated at $50,000. The Government reservation between the
National and Army Medical museums, with frontage on B street south,
was suggested as an advantageous site for the building. The proposi- -
tion was not favorably acted upon by Congress, but, in addition to the
$2,000 customarily granted for the rental of a building for storage pur-
poses, the sum of $2,500 was appropriated for the rental of additional
quarters in which to place the carpenter and cabinet shops and for the
storage of the material contained in the wooden shops near the Fish
Commission building.

The storage sheds south of the Smithsonian buildings were removed
during the year. They had long been regarded as a source of danger
to the main building in case of fire. Some sections of the sheds were
removed to the yard of the storage building on Ninth street. The
remaining serviceable material was used in the erection of a two-story
workshop.

The wooden floors in two of the ranges were taken up and substan-
tial concrete floors laid in their stead. Mahogany wall cases and
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5D

screens have been constructed and placed in position on several of the
galleries.

In order to accommodate additional floor cases, the steam radiators
in some of the exhibition halls have been raised to a convenient height
and attached to the piers. Improvements in the water-supply system
have also been made.

The walls in many of the halls and ranges and in two of the courts
were painted during the year.

ACCESSIONS AND REGISTRATION,

The amount of material received during the year was unusually large,
aggregating 457,096 specimens. These were embraced in 1,441 sep-
arate accession lots. In the division of insects alone 226,000 specimens
were received, due to the acquisition of the Hubbard and Schwarz
collection, which is specially referred to elsewhere. Large quantities of
material were received by the Division of Mollusks and the Division
of Paleontology, and there have been notable increases in the collee-
tions of the divisions of prehistoric archeology, mammals, birds, and
plants. The following tables show the number of specimens added to
the various collections during the year and the total number of speci-
mens in each collection on June 30, 1898:

During the year, 25,405 packages were received by the Registrar. Of
this number, 690 contained specimens for the Museum collections (an
increase of 79 over the record for the previous year), 1,724 contained
supplies of various kinds for use in the offices and shops of the Museum,
and 11,522 consisted of publications. Three thousand and seventy-
three packages were sent out.

The entries on the outgoing transportation record numbered 1,482
and on the incoming transportation record 3,137.

Seven carloads of material were shipped to the Trans- Mississippi and
International Exposition at Omaha.

Two hundred and twenty-one packages were placed in storage and
57 were withdrawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGES.

Thirty-two thousand three hundred and sixty-three specimens were
sent out as gifts or in exchange, and 7,461 specimens were lent for
study during the year. A number of sets of marine invertebrates
have been prepared with a special view to supplying the needs of
schools, and these have been distributed to the number of about 17,000
Specimens. Many collections of rocks and ores and casts of prehistoric
implements were also presented to educational establishments.

A complete list of the distributions of the year is printed in Appen-
dix 11.

Several exchanges have been conducted with institutions and indi-
viduals in foreign countries, resulting in the acquisition of some valua-
ble material.

It is questionable whether this branch of the Museum work is, taken
as a whole year by year, very profitable. It is difficult to arrange satis-
factorily the details of an exchange with an establishment several thou-
sands of milesaway. Thenecessity of determining one uncertain point
may cause a delay of several months, during which time other oppor-
tunities for utilizing the material intended for exchange may have
arisen. Valuations placed on specimens vary, and what may seem to
us a generous offer on our part may be regarded as far from being an
equivalent to the other party. In certain cases it is impossible to fur-
nish first class specimens, and the failure to do so, although explana-
tion nay have been made in the correspondence leading to the exchange,
has not unfrequently placed this Museum in an undesirable and unde-
served position. Furthermore, it seldom happens that the-establish-
ment with which an exchange is being conducted is willing to part
with its best material, especially if sending first. Specimens which
en

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. o
were in good condition when shipped often deteriorate before reaching
their destination, and this again furnishes ground for dissatisfaction.

It is not likely, however, that transactions with establishments and
individuals who have been exchanging material with this Museum, to
the satisfaction of both, will be discontinued, although it is doubtful
whether special pains will be taken to extend negotiations of this
character into untried fields.

A number of exchanges which have been pending for special reasons
were completed during the year just closed. Among the mostimportant
transactions the following may be mentioned :

From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria,
66 specimens of Tertiary corals were received in exchange for Lower
Cretaceous fossils. The Paleontological Museum of the Royal Acad-
emy, Munich, Bavaria, received from the U. S. National Museum 16
specimens of Cambrian fossils, in exchange for material sent some time
ago. Thirty-three specimens of fossil plants, representing 20 species,
were received from the Natural History Society of New Brunswick,
St. John, and 90 specimens of fossil plants have been sent in return.
The Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia, has received 170 bird skins
from the National Museum, in continuation of exchanges. Land shells
from Transcaspia and the Caucasus and marine shells from the coast of
Russia have been received from the Zoological Museum of the Imperial
Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, in exchange for about 2,000
specimens of shells from the National Museum. Mons. M. Cossmann,
Paris, France, sent a collection of shells in exchange for publications.
Sixty-two specimens of Actinians have been transmitted to the Royal
Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, in exchange for
material yet to be forwarded. Crustaceans have been sent to the
Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland, in return for speci-
mens already received and in continuation of exchanges.

Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey, was author-
ized to arrange exchanges with several foreign museums during his
visit to Europe in the summer of 1897. He made an especial effort to
obtain corals from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of Europe.
Series of specimens have already been received from the Geological-
Paleontological Institute, Munich, Bavaria, and the Geological Society
of London; also from the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum,
Vienna, as stated above.

LABELS.

Ninety-eight requisitions were received from the various divisions of
the Museum during the year. Twelve of these were sent to the Gov-
ernment Printing Office to be filled, namely, requisitions for binding
482 books; for printing 3,958 labels, representing 197 forms, for print-
ing 700 specifications for supplies; for binding 13 volumes of vouchers;
for 500 manila pads, and 9 record books. There were printed at the
Museum 209,205 labels (representing 6,640 forms), of which 48,998 (rep-
resenting 3,902 forms) were for use in connection with the Trans-
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Mississippi and International Exposition. More than 160,000 letter
heads, envelopes, circulars, blanks, etc., representing 68 forms, were
also printed.

VISITORS.

There were 276,527 visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum build-
ings during the year. The following tables show respectively the num-
ber of visitors during each month of the fiscal year just closed, and the
total number during each year since the Museum building was opened

STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS.

During the year covered by this report the following persons have
been accorded access to the collections in the Museum:

Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agriculture, has spent much
time in the study of Eskimo collections and has completed a mono-
graph on the subject. Mr. P. C. Boyle, of Oil City, Pennsylvania,
studied the collection of lamps and illuminating devices. Mr. Stewart
Culin, Director of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, has had access to the collections of games
in connection with the preparation of a paper. Mr. J. D. MeGuire,
of Ellicott City, Maryland, has continued his work upon the pipes of
the American aborigines. The results of his investigations have been
embodied in a paper which will appear in the Report of the Museum
for 1897 (now in press). Major J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, examined the pipes collected by himself in
Utah many years ago. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes has prosecuted investi-
gations upon the material which he recently collected in the Southwest,
and has prepared a report upon his explorations during 1897-98. In
the Division of Historic Archwelogy information has been given to the
following: Mr. Richard Fisher, San Antonio, Texas; Mr. F. W. Hodge,
Bureau of Ethnology; Hon. Oscar Straus, Mr. George W. Moon, Lon-
don, England; and Prof. H. Hyvernat, of the Catholic University,
Washington.

Prof. James Hine, of the Ohio State University, consulted the Museum
collection of Neuroptera. Mr. Arthur C. Bradley, of Newport, New
Hampshire, examined the Noctuide for the purpose of identifying
specimens collected in New Hampshire. Mr. Nathan Banks, of the
Department of Agriculture, has frequently examined the Arachnida
and allied classes for purposes of study and identification. Prof.
Roland Thaxter, of Harvard University, spent several days during
March examining the collection of Coleoptera for minute fungi found
growing on their elytra. He secured some very rare species from the
exotic beetles. Professor Thaxter is engaged in monographing this
group of fungi (the Laboulbeniacex). Mrs. Annie T. Slosson and Doctor
Prime, of Franconia, New Hampshire; Mr. O. W. Barrett, of Claren-
don, Vermont; Dr. J. W. Holland, of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Dr. H.
G. Griffith and Mr. William J. Fox, of Philadelphia; Prof. F. M. Web-
ster, of Wooster, Ohio; and many others have consulted the collections
in the Division of Insects during the year.

Mr. EK. W. Nelson, Department of Agriculture, spent three months
or more studying the Museum collection of Mexican birds in connec-
tion with the determination of the material collected by him in Mex-
ico for the Biological Survey. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, Department
of Agriculture, studied the Horned Larks, with a view to revising
the group; the forms of Thryothorus bewicki, with a view to the prep-
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

aration of a revision of the group; the series of Amazilia cervini-
ventris, in order to determine the distribution of a new form; the series
of Megascops flammeolus, for the purpose of determining the forms
embraced under that name; also two small collections of birds from
West Africa. Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture, examined
the collection at various times in connection with his determination
of certain type specimens and the identification of material for the Bio.
logical Survey. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, made
use of the Museum collection in identifying a series of 700 birds from
the Santa Marta region of Colombia. Mr. J. W. Garrett, of Baltimore,
Maryland, consulted the library preparatory to identifying a collection
of Patagonian birds. Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of
Natural History, New York, studied the petrels, in order to determine
the validity of a Pacific coast form. Mrs. George C. Maynard and Miss
Florence Merriam, both of Washington, examined certain North Amer-
ican birds, for the purpose of describing them in popular works on birds.

Miss Jennie EK. Letson, of Buffalo, New York, devoted considerable
time to the study of mollusks. Mr. Outram Bangs spent a few days in
March, and again in May, making comparisons of North American
species of mammals. Professor Mitsukuri, of the University of Tokyo,
studied the collection of seals, in order to familiarize himself with their
taxonomic character. Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agricul-
ture, was given facilities for an extended study of the squirrels of
Mexico and Central America. Mr. George R. Wieland, State College,
Pennsylvania; examined specimens of marine and fresh-water turtles.
Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior Univer-
sity, examined fishes in connection with a report upon the investiga-
tions of the Fur Seal Commission, and in connection also with the prep-
aration of additional volumes of the work on the “Fishes of North
and Middle America.”! Dr. B. W. Evermann, who is associated with
Doctor Jordan as joint author of the above work, also made frequent
use of the collections. Dr. H. M.Smith and Dr. W. C. Kendall, ot the
U.S. Fish Commission, compared specimens of fishes in the collection
with others recently obtained by the Commission.

Miss Harriet Richardson made a study of certain groups of Isopoda,
including species of the genera Rocinela and Afga, and is preparing an
annotated list of the Isopoda of the west coast of North America. In
November Prof. K. Mitsukuri, of the University of Tokyo, spent about
a week at the Museum studying the Holothuroidea obtained during
the cruise of the Albatross to the Galapagos Islands in 1891. In
February, Mr. K. Kishinouye, of Tokyo, was engaged for two weeks
in studying the Medusxe and the Penidi. Since early in May Dr.
Charles M. Blackford, jr., of the Medical College of Georgia, has been
engaged in studying the Protozoa and other low forms of life.

Miss Anna Murray Vail, of the Torrey Botanical Club, New York

City, spent a few days at the Herbarium in individual work on the
Asclepiadacez, which she is engaged in monographing. Dr. John K.
Small, curator of the Herbarium of Columbia University, New York
City, consulted the Herbariuin frequently during a short visit to Wash-
ington in August, and in connection with his work he greatly assisted
the Museum by making a number of critical determinations. Mr. C. H.
Thompson, of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, St. Louis, was engaged
for a few days in the study of Lemnacee. Prof. L. M. Underwood,
Columbia University, New York, visited the Herbarium in November
and studied the Pteridophyta. Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic
University, Washington, frequently consulted the collection. He has
made many valuable suggestions, and has generously placed his library
at the disposal of members of the Museum staff. Through the oppor-
tunity thus afforded of studying certain works not to be found elsewhere
in the city, the members of the staff have been materially aided in
certain lines of investigation. Mr. William Canby, of Wilmington,
Delaware, made several visits to the Herbarium, and has contributed
some valuable plants. Mr. Canby has long been a correspondent of
the Museum, and has added many rare plants to the collection. Mr.
Hermann von Schrenk, of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, spent a
short time at the Herbarium in June. Prof. F. A. Waugh, of the
University of Vermont, examined certain specimens. Professor Ruth
of the -University of Tennessee inspected the arrangements in the
Herbarium.

In the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology many visitors have
requested the privilege of examining specimens, and their wishes have
been acceded to whenever practicable. Dr. E.C. E. Lord, of the U.S,
Geological Survey, and Dr. Thomas L. Watson, of Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, studied the collections in the Division of Geology.
Prof. O. P. Hay has examined the large Cretaceous fishes from Kan-
Sas with a view to deciding certain points in the structure of the
Skull and vertebral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the
genus Portheus is synonymous with Viphactinas. Several new points
in the structure and affinities of Viphactinas were ascertained and the
conclusion reached that Viphactinas Leidy was identical with Portheus
Cope, the latter name being a synonym. Prof. Henry F. Osborn
studied the types of such species of Coryphodon as are contained in the
collections, with the intention of making a revision of the species of
that genus.

On January 7, 1898, Miss Mary Bartlett Smith was given permission
to serve as volunteer assistant in the Division of Marine Invertebratés.

The privilege granted to visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum
buildings of photographing and sketching objects in the exhibition
halls has been availed of by a large number of persons. Many classes
from the public and private schools of Washington visited the Museum
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

during the year, and pupils from a number of schools outside of Wash-
ington also inspected the collections.

It may be stated here that permission can not be granted to photo-
graph objects on deposit and not the property of the Museum, until the
written consent of the owners has been obtained, nor can prints from
Museum negatives be furnished in such cases without the consent of
the owners.

Material has been sent out for examination as follows:

Objects of pottery, jade and serpentine axes and ornaments, ceremo-
nial axes, banner stones, and drilled and figured tablets were sent to
Mr. F. H. Cushing, Bureau of Ethnology. Bone gaming implements
were transmitted to Mr. Stewart Culin, of the University of Pennsyl-
vania, for use in the preparation of a paper on games. A collection of
games from the Philippine Islands was also sent. A series of Ute pipes
was lent to Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of Ethnology.

From the Division of Fishes the following material has been sent
out forstudy: To Dr. D.S. Jordan, Leland Stanford Junior University,
- California, specimens of Sebastes marinus, Sebastolobus alascanus, certain
species of the genera Zeus, Cheetodon, Holocentrus, and Ammodytes, and
a small collection of fishes made near the Commander Islands in 1897,
by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger; to the Museum of Comparative Zoology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the request of Professor Garman, two
specimens of Phycis regius; to Dr. T. H. Bean, specimens of Pantosteus
plebeius; to Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, Indiana University, Indianapolis,
Indiana, specimens for study in the preparation of a review of the blind
fishes; to S. Watase, Chicago, specimens of phosphorescent fishes, for
study in connection with the preparation of a paper upon the phos-
phorescent organs of animals.

Frequent use of the collection in the Division of Mammals has been
made by specialists of the Department of Agriculture, and a number
of specimens were borrowed, including types of Reithrodon montanus,
Perognathus monticola, P. californicus, Microtus edax, M. californicus,
Peromyscus boyli penicillatus, Hesperomys melanophrys, Perognathus
penicillatus, and P. spinatus. There were sent to Mr. Outram Bangs,
Boston, Massachusetts, 5 skulls of certain species of Putorius and 5
skulls of species of Hrethizon; to Mr. S. N. Rhoads, Academy of Nat-
ural Sciences, 7 skulls of mammals; to R. Lydekker, Harpenden,
Hertfordshire, England, 1 deer skull; to Dr. E. A. Mearns, Fort Clark,
Texas, 457 rodents from the Mexican boundary; to Mr. L. McNally, 1
muskrat; to Dr. J. A. Allen, American Museum of Natural History,
New York City, 196 red squirrels, and to Mr. J. D. Sornborger, Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, 1 white-footed mouse. The specimens sent to
Dr. Mearns were for use in completing his report on the mammals of
the Mexican boundary, and those to Dr. Allen for use in a revision
of the red squirrels.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

From the Division of Birds there were sent to Mr. Joseph Grinnell,
Pasadena, California, 24 specimens of Spinus tristis, to enable him to
determine the forms inhabiting California, 32 specimens of Salpinctes

genus, and plates of Dinichthys pustulosus were lent to Dr. C. RK. East-
man of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
English Carboniferous pelecypods were sent to Dr. G. H. Girty of the
U.S. Geological Survey. A collection of thin sections of slates was
lent to Prof. T. Nelson Dale, Williamstown, Mass.

In the foregoing paragraphs allusion is made only to specimens sent
in response to special applications. In addition, a large number of sets
of marine invertebrates, minerals, rocks and ores, etc., have been dis-
tributed among educational establishments desiring such material both
for study and exhibition. In this connection it may be stated that very
few of these collections are left, and unless special provision be soon
made by Congress which will enabie the Museum to engage the services
of competent assistants to select the duplicate specimens from the
various collections and make them up into sets, that branch of Museum
work will have to be practically suspended. It is quite impossible for
the present force of assistants in the scientific divisions to leave their
regular duties for special work of this character, which, while very
desirable and intended to be helpful to other museums, colleges, ete.,
has in it no element of gain whatever to the National Museum.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

The cooperation of the various Executive Departments and Bureaus
of the Government has continued during the year, and has resulted,
as usual, in the addition to the collections of valuable and interesting
material. This is especially so in the case of the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, the U.S. Fish Commission, and the Department of Agriculture.
The Museum not only benefits largely by the law providing that all
Government collections shall be turned over to it after they have served
the purpose for which they were obtained, but it also profits materially
by the hearty cooperation and courtesy so frequently manifested by
Government officials. A statement of the material transmitted by the
various Departments will be found in the Accession List (Appendix Ir).
The collections of particular interest are also referred to by the head
curators in their annual reports.

Especial mention should be made of the valuable services rendered
without remuneration by many of the members of the scientific staff
of the Museum. There are now thirteen curators, one assistant cura-
tor, and fifteen custodians who serve the Museum without pay. The
majority of these are in the employ of other Departments or Bureaus
of the Government, but have willingly given to the Museum such time
and attention as could be spared from their regular official duties.
There are also two collaborators, three associates in zoology, and one
in paleontology who are attached to the staff in an honorary capacity.
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIMENS AND INFORMATION FURNISHED.

During the year 576 “lots” of specimens (Nos. 4494-5069, inclusive)
were received for examination from individuals and educational estab-
lishments in various sections of the country. Of this material the
percentage which has been of sufficient interest for addition to the
Museum collections is very small. This branch of the work yields
little or no profit to the Museum, since the senders of valuable material
almost invariably request its return. Moreover, the condition in which
material is received is frequently a source of delay in securing prompt
determinations. In many instances the specimens are almost entirely
destroyed during transmittal, owing to insufficient packing.

Pamphlets describing the manner in which specimens of various
kinds may best be collected and prepared for shipment have been
widely distributed, and it is hoped that persons desiring to avail them-
selves of the facilities which the Museum affords in the identification
of specimens will comply with the suggestions which they contain.

Technical information on various subjects has been furnished to a
large number of correspondents during the year, and drawings or blue
prints of Museum cases have been transmitted to those who have
applied for them. There is hardly a day when from thirty to forty
letters are not written in response to communications received from
persons seeking definite knowledge of some kind.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Annual Report of the Museum for 1895 has been published, and
the papers in the Appendix have also appeared in separate form. The
Report for 1896 is now in type, with the exception of the index, and
the proof reading of the administrative portion of the volume for 1897
has been completed.

Volume xix of the Proceedings has been published. Most of the
papers in this volume were issued in separate form during the preced-
ing fiscal year. The last four, however, were published since July 1,
1897. Papers 1124-1139, inclusive, constituting Volume xXx, have
appeared.

The titles of all papers which have been published in separate form,
during the year are given in Appendix v.

The text of Bulletin 47 is now all in type, with the exception of the
“addenda.” The work, when completed, will consist of three volumes
and an atlas.

Another of the series of pamphlets containing directions for collect-
ing and preserving natural history specimens has been issued.’ This
paper is by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, and contains instructions for the
collection of scale insects. Circular 48, which has also been published,

1 Bulletin 39, Part L.
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

relates to collecting and preserving the bones and teeth of specimens
of Mastodon and Mammoth.

The titles of a large number of papers published during the year by
officers of the Museum and other investigators are given in the Biblio-
graphy (Appendix Iv). Many of these papers appeared in publica-
tions other than those of the Museum. The number of authors repre-
sented is 83, and the total number of papers mentioned, 234. The sub-
jects treated upon are indicated in the following tabie:

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in an order dated
March 19, 1898, placed 5,800 copies of the Museum Report at the dis-
posal of the Museum, retaining 1,200 copies, out of the edition of 7,000
allotted to both establishments, for distribution by the Institution
itself. This increase enables the Museum to supply a large number of
public libraries and schools which had not heretofore received the
volume.

In the last Annual Report mention was made of an arrangement by
which members of the scientific staff might, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, print papers based upon
Museum material in publications other than those of the Museum.
During the year perinission has been given to publish sixteen papers
in this way. The names of the authors are as follows: James E.
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Benedict, Miss M. J. Rathbun, J. N. Rose, Gerrit 8. Miller, jr., Walter
Hough, Robert Ridgway, David White, Charles Schuchert, and Miss
Harriet Richardson. The titles of those papers which have been pub-
lished within the fiscal year will be found in the Bibliography (Appen-
dix IV).

LIBRARY.

The librarian, Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions for the
year were as follows: Books, 848; pamphlets, 1,945; parts of period-
icals, 16,746; total, 19,539. These figures include the publications
retained trom the accessions to the library of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, which were as follows: Books, 407; pamphlets, 1,148; parts of
periodicals, 11,817. One thousand books belonging to the Smithsonian
deposit and 409 belonging to the Museum were bound.

More than 10,000 books were borrowed during the year, a consider-
able proportion of these being assigned to sectional libraries. About
17,000 books were consulted in the library.

The work of transferring titles to the new catalogue is progressing.

Two new sectional libraries have been organized during the year—
Technology and Stratigraphic Paleontology. There are now twenty-
three authorized sectional libraries, as follows:

Administration, Mesozoic fossils,
Birds, Mineralogy,
Botany, Mollusks,
Comparative anatomy, Oriental antiquities,
Ethnology, Paleobotany,
Fishes, Parasites,
Geology, Photography,
History, Prehistoric archeology,
Insects, Reptiles,
Mammals, Stratigraphic paleontology,
Marine invertebrates, Technology.
Medicine,
EXPLORATIONS.

A quantity of valuable material has come into the possession of the
Museum through explorations conducted by members of the Museum
staff, by other individuals, and by various bureaus of the Government.

Dr. W. L. Abbott has sent in large collections of birds, mammals,
reptiles, insects, and other animals collected by himself in lower Siam
and Kashmir, thus very materially adding to the valuable series of
specimens which have been received from him in past years.

Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed a
large series of bird skins, eggs, and nests collected in the Philippine
Islands.

An interesting series of bird skins collected in Santa Marta, Colom-
bia, was received from Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Massachusetts.

The Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, the U.S.
Fish Commission, and other Governmental bureaus have continued to
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

send in valuable collections obtained by their representatives in the
field.

A large lot of invertebrates collected by the naturalists of the steamer
Albatross in recent years on the coasts of California, Japan, and
Kamchatka and in the Bering Sea should receive special notice.

A large series of land shells collected in Mexico by the Biological
Survey constitutes an addition of more than ordinary value.

The expedition made by Mr. R. P. Currie in the neighborhood of
Mount Coffee, Liberia, West Africa, under the auspices of the Museum
and with the valuable assistance of Prof. O. F. Cook, of the Colonization
Society, resulted in the acquisition of a large number of insects, spiders,
and myriapods, numbering in all about 5,000 specimens, and some
valuable reptiles, birds, and mammals. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, while
pursuing investigations on the Commander Islands as a member of the
Fur Seal Commission, collected birds, insects and other animals for the
Museum. Of the insects 28 were found to represent new species and
others were very rare. Mr. Robert Ridgway made an exploration for
the Museum in the vicinity of Lake Okechobee, Florida, and obtained
a considerable number of rare birds.

Mr. J. N. Rose was engaged for four months in the summer and fall
of 1897 in making a botanical collection in western and central Mexico.
He visited a little known part of the country and succeeded in bringing
back a large and valuable collection of plants. The collection includes
more than 6,000 specimens and contains more than 100 species new to
science. Mr. Rose also succeeded in obtaining some interesting ethno-
logical specimens, including spinners, reels, etc., used by the natives in
converting cotton and Agave fiber into thread, strings, and rope. This
collection also includes native cups, spoons, mats, hats, ropes, ete. In
each case botanical specimens were obtained which show definitely the
origin of the products.

Karly in March an opportunity was presented for a botanist to acecom-
pany an expedition to the Keys of south Florida, undertaken by Messrs.
E. L. Morris and G, N, Collins for the purpose of making general scien-
tific collections. Mr. Pollard was authorized by the Acting Assistant
Secretary in charge of the Museum to accompany the expedition, leave
of absence for two months on full pay being granted him on condition
that the Museum receive a set of the botanical specimens obtained, and
that it should not assume payment of transportation or other expenses.
On March 4 Mr. Pollard proceeded directly with his companions to Key
West; the party there engaged a boat and made a complete circuit of
the Keys, reaching Miami, on the coast of Florida, April 5. After a
week spent at the latter place, the expedition returned by steamer to
Key West and thence to Washington. About 250 species of plants were
obtained. These have since been determined by Mr. Pollard and will
form the subject-matter of a report to be presented for publication at
an early date.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Dr. F. W. True and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., obtained natural history
material, including about 80 specimens of reptiles and batrachians in
Maine.

Dr. George P. Merrill, during his visit to Russia in the summer of
1897, collected some interesting geological material.

Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the Division of Strati-
graphic Paleontology, accompanied an expedition under the direction
of Lieutenant Peary, U. S. N., in July, for the purpose of gathering
fossils and other natural history material in the region of Noursoak
Peninsula, Greenland, and with a view especially to obtaining speci-
mens from the vicinity of Disko Island, to serve as a basis of compari-
son with related material gathered from the Cretaceous of the United
States. Mr. David White, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, accom
panied Mr, Schuchert. A large collection of Cretaceous and Tertiary
plants was secured; also some interesting specimens of fishes and
mollusks.

About 1,300 specimens of pottery and other relics from the vicinity
of Tucson, Arizona, have been received from Dr. J. W. Fewkes as a
further result of his explorations in that region. Dr. Walter Hough,
assistant curator of the Division of Ethnology, accompanied Dr. Fewkes
in the summer of 1897.

A number of unique ethnological specimens obtained by Mr. J. B.
Hatcher in Patagonia were received from the Bureau of Ethnology.

Material of great value obtained by the exploring parties of the
Bureau of Ethnology has also been received.

Collectors’ outfits —Outfits have been furnished to the following per-
sons, who have undertaken to collect material for the National Museum:
Mr. Edward J. Brown, Lemon City, Florida; Mr. John G. Webb,
Osprey, Florida; Rev. D. W. Snyder, for collecting in Africa; Dr.
Edgar A. Mearns, U. 8. A., Fort Clark, Texas; Hon. J. D. Mitchell,
Victoria, Texas; Prof. A. E. Verrill, Yale College, New Haven, Con-
necticut; Mr. George D. Wilder, Pekin, China; Mr. J. A. Loring, Owego,
New York, for collecting in European countries; Mr. J. S. Holmes,
Bowman’s Bluff, Henderson County, North Carolina.

Several members of the Museum staff have also been furnished with
collecting outfits, as follows: Mr. Charles Schuchert, Mr. David White,
Doctor F. W. True, Miss M. J. Rathbun, Mr. William Palmer, Dr.
Walter Hough, aud Mr. Robert Ridgway.

In addition to the colleeting trips undertaken by members of the
Museum staff, several of the curators and assistants were absent from
time to time during the year on other business pertaining to the .
Museum. Some were temporarily in the employ of other departments
or bureaus of the Government. ;

Thus Mr. F. A. Lucas was absent for several months during 1897,
having been detailed by the President to visit Alaska as a member of
the Fur Seal Commission. Dr. Stejneger was also a member of this
REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

Commission. Mr. Barton A. Bean, assistant curator of fishes, was
placed on detached service, with instructions to report on July 4 to
the U. S. Fish Commission, to accompany in the capacity of temporary
field assistant, a party sent out by the Commission for the purpose of
conducting an examination of the fish fauna of the group of lakes lying
east of the Klamath Lakes in southern Oregon. All necessary expenses
in connection with Mr. Bean’s trip were defrayed by the Commission.
Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology,
was requested, in connection with his duties as Commissioner from the
Government of the United States to the International Exposition held
at Brussels, Belgium, in 1897, to avail himself of the opportunities
offered by his stay in Brussels to make excursions to points of archio-
logical interest within convenient reach of the Belgian capital, and to
visit especially the newer anthropological museums of Belgium and
Holland. He was directed to give particular attention to collecting
information concerning the buildings occupied by these museums, the
interior arrangements (exhibition halls, laboratories, storage facilities,
ete.), and their methods of preparing, labeling, and installing speci-
mens. He was also authorized to attend, as delegate from the Institu-
tion and Museum, any congresses or other scientific meetings relating
to anthropology held in Brussels during the exposition.

In September Mr. J. E. Watkins, chief of buildings and superintend-
ence, proceeded to New York City for the purpose of examining the
exhibition cases in the American Museum of Natural History and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Prof. O. T. Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, visited Chi-
cago in November for the purpose of examining the collections in the
Field Columbian Museum.

On December 22 Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the
Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, was directed to proceed to
Waynesville, Ohio, for the purpose of representing the interests of the
National Museum in the matter of shipping to Washington the collec-
tion of fossils and other specimens bequeathed to the Museum by the
late Mr. I. H. Harris.

On February 25, 1898, Mr. Schuchert visited localities in New York,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, lowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Kentucky for the
purpose of inspecting fossils in the hands of private collectors, with
a view to completing the series to be exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi
Exposition. He was directed to report upon the collections examined
and make recommendations for the purchase of desirable material.

On April 16 Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, curator of the Division of Rep-
tiles and Batrachians, proceeded to Philadelphia to examine collections
at the residence of the late Prof. E. D. Cope, with a view to identifying
specimens belonging to the Government but which had been temporarily
in Professor Cope’s hands for study. He was requested at the same
time to avail himself of the opportunity offered by his presence in
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Philadelphia to visit the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences
for the purpose of arranging for the transmission to Washington of
specimens belonging to the National Museum. Dr. A. C. Peale was
also detailed to assist in this work.

On May 1 Dr. Stejneger left Washington for the purpose of visiting
England and the continent of Europe, at his own expense, with a view
to examining, in certain European museums, types of American species
of reptiles and batrachians, and specimens of the birds and reptiles of
Japan andof the north Pacific coast and adjacentislands. Dr. Stejneger
attended the International Fisheries Exposition, which opened at Ber-
gen, Norway, on May 16, with the expectation also of attending the
Fourth International Zoological Congress, which convenes at Cam-
bridge, England, on August 23. He was especially requested to secure
information concerning new museum methods in northern Europe.

Mr. I’. A. Lucas, acting assistant curator of Vertebrate Fossils,
journeyed to New Haven on May 4 to receive from Prof. O. C. Marsh
a number of fossil vertebrates for the Museum collection.

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGY.

Seventy-three mammals were received and skinned during the year.
A considerable proportion of these came from the National Zoological
Park, as shown in the following table:

In addition, 35 other specimens were received and immediately turned
over to other departments of the Museum.

Two large crocodiles were received from the Zoological Park. One
of these was skinned and preserved for mounting. A skin of an elk
was made up for the study series; also the skin of a kangaroo, the
skeleton being taken out entire in each instance.

Sixty-eight skins were received, as follows:

A specimen of Bassaricyon gabbii was mounted.

Several hundred large skins, both dry and in pickle, are on hand.
A large number of skulls of mammals were cleaned.

Improvements were made in the groups exhibited in the mammal
hallas follows: The two caribou groups were overhauled and renovated,
as were also the African monkey group and the sea-otter group. A
large number of single specimens were cleaned. A group of humming
birds was designed and arranged for the Division of Birds, and a large
number of minor matters received attention.

Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, was in Nashville for nearly a
month, engaged in repacking portions of the exhibit sent by the Museum
to the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Considerable work was also
done by Mr. Palmer in connection with the Trans-Mississippi and Inter-
national Exposition at Omaha. The taxidermists’ shop was removed
to new quarters during the year.

In the Division of Birds the taxidermists have cleaned and renovated
about 2,500 specimens, and have mounted or remounted a number of
others, a portion of them being intended for exhibition at the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition. A collection of birds which was exhibited at
the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was overhauled upon its return.

Various causes have combined to prevent satisfactory progress in
osteological work during the period covered by this report. Consider-
able work has been accomplished, however, under adverse circum-
stances, as shown by the following table:

ville on May 1, 1897, and continued until October 31. An appropri-
ation of $130,000 was made by Congress for the preparation of a
Government exhibit, the sum of $14,500 being allotted to the Smith-
sonian Institution and National Museum from this amount. A slight
increase in the Smithsonian allotment was afterwards made. Collec-
tions were exhibited by the following divisions and sections of the
Museum: Mammals, birds, reptiles and batrachians, fishes, mollusks,
insects, marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, paleontology,
geology, ininerals, ethnology, prehistoric archeology, religions, tech-
nology, electricity, historical collections, and medicine.

The Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the present fiscal year
contains a full account of the participation in the exposition by the
Institution and its various bureaus.

Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.—The Trans-Missis-
sippi and International Exposition opened at Omaha on June 1, 1898,

Life-Saving Service. The sum of $137,500 was appropriated for an
exhibit by the Exeertive Departments, the Smithsonian Institution,
including the National Museum, and the U.S. Fish Commission. Of
this amount $19,491.71 was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and
its bureaus. ;

Exhibits have been prepared by each of the three scientific depart-
mentsof the Museum—anthropology, biology, and geology. The Depart-
ment of Anthropology has sent series illustrative of fire-making and
illumination, exploitative industries, domestic arts, ceramic art, metal
working, sculpture, photography, land and marine transportation, and
the progress in certain branches of electrical engineering; groups of
life-sized figures representing people engaged in primitive arts; series
of weapons, tools, and musical instruments, and objects showing the
history of the development of bookmaking. The exhibit of the Depart-
ment of Biology includes series of the lower invertebrates, mollusks,
insects, fishes, reptiles and batrachians, birds, mammals, and aquatic
plants. The geological exhibits include series prepared in the divisions

about 15,546 specimens were found, as per appended list. The number of specimens here given is not
exact, but it appears safe to state that there will be more than that number present when the collee-
tion is completely brought together. The total includes the duplicate specimens which Mr. Harris
agreed should be exchanged by the U.S. National Museum whenever favorable opportunity offers.

first made known that genus, was S. aretus—
the Cancer arctus of Linneus. That, being
the only species, is necessarily the type, and
therefore the name Scyllarus must be retained
forit.”’ For the Scyllarus of Dana and mod-
ern authors the new name Scyllarides is
proposed. :

THE CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES OF NORTH
AMERICA.

By EDWARD DRINKER CopE, A. M., PH. D.,

Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the University of Pennsylvania, and
Member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences.

PREFACE.

The scope of the present work is to give an account of the physical
characteristics of the reptiles of the orders of Loricata and Squamata,
which inhabit the Nearctic zoological realm, so far as they are known
to the writer. That the work is far from complete I am well aware, but
that it is much in advance of other works in this respect may be well
admitted, as no general work of the kind has appeared since that of
Holbrook, half a century ago. With my book on the Batrachia, pub-
lished in 1889, and Dr. Baur’s on the Testudinata (in preparation), the
access to North American herpetology becomes equal to that which
the science of ornithology has long enjoyed.

The principles of classification which have been followed are those
which the nature of the case requires, so far as the author has been
able to discover them. One general statement may be made as an
abstract proposition, and that is that the taxonomy of organic beings
is a register of structural or anatomical characters from the most com-
prehensive to the smallest divisions. This is generally recognized in
the case of the former, but there are many naturalists who fail to recog-
nize it in the case of the more restricted divisions, and especially as
applying to genera. An indefinite idea of the “ naturalness” of the
collocation of species necessary to constitute genera still lingers in
their minds. By this idea of a “natural” association of species, they
mean a group which coincides in possessing a certain community of
Species characters, as color, and color pattern, size, nature of surfaces,
geographical range, etc., all of which, while of importance in their place,
are quite irrelevant to the question of generic divisions. I long since
pointed out that generic characters may, and in fact generally do, arise
in the process of evolution quite independently of the specific, so that
certain species of different genera resemble each other in the so-called
“natural,” that is, specific characters, more than they do other species of
their own genus. The same phenomenon is well known among higher

155
156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

groups, where I have called it ‘‘ heterology;” that is, the genera of a
family may parallel more or less the genera of another; or the families
of one order those of another order. It is not, then, remarkable that
sometimes one or more species of two or more genera should parallel
each other. The reason why the aggregate of appearances is sometimes
preferred to single structural differences as definition of the genus, is
because it is supposed that the contents of a genus must possess closer
‘affinity ” than species of separate genera. But this is not the case in
many instances, and may not be so in any instance where the evolution
of generic characters becomes known. Certain it is that in the embry-
onic life none of the specific characters appear before the generic.
Hence, species may be polyphyletic as regards genera.

The essential of systematic biology is exact definition. Taxonomy is
science only in so far as it is exact. If it be alleged that gradual evo-
lution of characters must preclude the possibility of exact definition, I
answer that this will only become a practical truth when all intermedi-
ate forms have been discovered. And it will never be a practical truth
for the botany and zoology of any single geologic epoch or period—as,
for instance, the present one—since most of the connecting forms belong
to past periods and are not treated of in works in zoology, but in those in
paleontology. There is therefore no excuse for the loose and inexact defi-
nitions which some taxonomists are accustomed to inflict on the world,
which are both unscientific, and serve at the same time to obscure the
subject and render it inaccessible to the student. It must be admitted,
however, that in a few instances it occurs that transition between two
important anatomical characters is discoverable in series of species of
the existing period. The special nature of such a case will determine
whether definitions with exceptions stated are admissible or not.

In the matter of nomenclature the author necessarily follows the rule
of priority now adopted in all codes, and the definitions of priority
contained in the report of the committee of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science of 1876. According to these rules, a
name can only have a status when accompanied with a description or
diagnosis of that to which it is applied, whether species, genus, or divi-
sion of higher rank. In the case of species, a recognizable figure is
regarded as of equal validity with a description, but a figure possesses
no discriminative character as a definition of any higher group. I must
here insist on another point, which it has not been thought necessary
hitherto to incorporate into any system of rules, since it is one which
lies at the basis of all language. That is that names shall be properly
spelled. This is necessary on account of the attempts on the part of
more or less illiterate persons to construct names for the use of biolo-
gists, and on account of the fact that certain other naturalists, not so
illiterate, feel bound to adopt their misspellings, and typographical
errors as well, on account of the supposed exigencies of the law of
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 15%

priority. Most of these persons take refuge behind the rules of the
American Ornithologists Union, and if the code of that body furnishes
defense for these violations of the elementary principles of language,
it should be corrected. Among misspellings are to be included hybrid
words and words which retain the Greek and other non- Latin spellings.
It may be repeated here that the language of scientific nomenclature is
Latin, and words derived from Greek and other languages are spelled
according to the rules of the Latin language.

It is stated above that the geographical scope of the present book is
the Nearctic realm. The southern continental boundary of this realm
is, however, not yet entirely clear. It evidently includes a large part of
the Mexican state of Sonora and the Mexican Plateau for a considera-
ble distance farther south. Owing to lack of collections, it is difficult
to state what the limit is in this direction, but I have included the state
of Guanajuato, where Dr. Alfredo Duges has traced many of the North-
ern species. On the east coast the fauna of the Tierra Caliente extends
northward to and even a little beyond the Rio Grande. In southwest-
ern Texas the presence of the genera of snakes, Sibon, Coniophanes, and
Drymobius, indicates the northern limit of that fauna.

The resuits contained herein are derived chiefly from the collections
of the United States National Museum. To these I have added infor-
mation based on my own collections and observations in the field.
The whole constitutes the first general work on the North American
Sauria since that of Holbrook in 1845, and the only one on the
Ophidia since the book of Baird and Girard, published in 1853. Pro-
fessor Baird had such a work on the Sauria in contemplation during
his lifetime, and he placed his manuscript in my hands about the year
1864 for completion. Of this manuscript I have made considerable use
in the following pages, the greater part of the descriptions of fifty-one
of the one hundred and nine known species of that suborder being
from his pen.

In the description of the general characters and distribution of the
genera of the families of the lizards I have frequently copied the lan-
guage of Boulenger in the Catalogue of the Lizards in the British
Museum, with omissions and additions. In the systematic arrange-
ment of the genera of families of lizards, of which I have been able
to examine but a limited number of species preserved in spirits, as
the Geckonidie, Agamide, and Gerrhosaurid, I have also followed
Boulenger.

Besides the collections of the U. S. National Museum, I have exam-
ined, in the preparation of this book, material belonging to the Acad-
emy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and to the Philadelphia
museums, to whose officers my thanks are especially due. I wish to
acknowledge also my indebtedness to Dr. Alexander Agassiz for the
opportunity of examining some Australian species; to Prof. Charles S.

of Oberlin, Ohio, for a small but valuable collection from South Africa;
to Mr. George K. Cherrie for a fine series from Costa Rica, and Drs.

Messrs. J. B. Wood and George Pine I am indebted for collections from
Florida; to Prof. W. T. Cummins for material from Texas, and to Dr.

am also especially indebted to the Zoological Society of Philadelphia
and its superintendent, Mr. Arthur E. Brown, for specimens from the

Class MONOCONDYLIA.
Subclass RE PTILIA

The subelass Reptilia is one of the two into which the members of
the class Monocondylia naturally fall. It is defined as follows:

Basicranial axis ossified. Vertebral column consisting chiefly of
centra. Limbs of the nonpiscine type, that is, embracing a single proxi-
mal element, two propodials, several mesopodials, metapodial, and pha-
langeal elements. One occipita leondyle. <A distinct quadrate bone, or
suspensorium of the lower jaw. Mandible segmented. Carpal, tarsal,
and metapodial elements not coossified with each other.

Cerebral hemispheres larger than mesencephalon, whose moieties are
fully exposed above, and not laterally. Cerebellum small. Heart with
three chambers. Aorta derived from two aorta roots, which consist of
one or two bows on each side. Lungs cellular, functional. Gall blad-
der, pancreas, and fat-bodies present. Integument scaly. Mammary
glands, none.

Reproduction viviparous or ovoviviparous. Fertilization internal.
Copulatory organs present. Embryo with amnion and allantois; pla-
centa, none.

The Reptilia are definitely known to appear in geological time in the
Coal Measures, near the close of the Carboniferous system, although
they probably appeared earlier during that system. They are repre-
sented by a number of orders, which are distinguished as follows:

I. Quadrate bone united with adjacent elements by suture; temporal regions with
reof of a few symmetrical segments. No distinct postorbital
bars; vertebre amphicelous; ilium narrow, vertical; feet ambu-

Quadrate bone united by immovable suture with the adjacent ele-
ments; 2 postorbital longitudinal bars; cervical and dorsal ribs mostly
two-headed, the capitulum articuiating with the centrum, with or with-
out parapophyses, and the tuberculum with the diapophyses. Sacrum
composed of but few vertebrz. Acetabulum closed. Sternum and
interclavicle present; abdominal ribs not connected with the true ribs,
and composed of separate segments. Bones of proximal series of car-
pus and tarsus specialized. Teeth in alveoli.

Ventricle of the heart divided. Two aorta roots. Epencephalon with
vermis and flocculi. Copulatory organ single. Anal orifice longitudi-
nal.

The order of the Loricata appeared in Triassic time, and has con-
tinued up to the present day. The Triassic types differ from those of
subsequent ages, so that they represent a suborder distinct from the
latter. In Jurassic and Cretaceous time the order was represented by
the greatest number of genera and species. Their distribution has
been cosmopolitan since their appearance. The affinities of the order
are with the Dinosauria, with which they are connected by the sub-
order Sauropoda of the latter.

The suborders differ as follows:

External nares posterior; internal nares less posterior; pterygoids articulating

with quadrate; postfrontal and postorbital bones distinct... -. -- PARASUCHIA.
Internal nares more posterior; external nares anterior; pterygoids not reaching
quadrates; postfrontal and postorbital bones not distinct -.-.......EUSUCHIA.

The Parasuchia include, so far as yet known, tlie single family of the
Belodontid. They are restricted to the Triassic system. The fam-
ilies of the Eusuchia are the following:

The first two families do not extend beyond Mesozoic time. The
Crocodilide commence in North America in the Upper Cretaceous; in
other parts of the world in the Hocene. We have to do with this fam-
ily only in the present work. Its genera differ as follows:

The genera Thoracosaurus and Holops are restricted, with present
knowledge, to the Upper Cretaceous formations of North America.
The other genera still exist, and are restricted to the warmer regions
of the earth. Tomistoma is Malaysian; Crocodilus is cosmopolitan ;
Osteolemus is African, while the other genera are South American,
except Alligator. This genus includes one North American and one
east. Asiatic species and one of unknown habitat. Gavialis is Indian.

In North America we have to do with the widely distributed Alligator
mississippiensis and the Crocodilus americanus, which ranges to the
southern part of the peninsula of Florida from an extensive habitat in
tropical America.

Many remarkable peculiarities characterize the osteology of this
family.

The pterygoids havea very peculiar form. They are much expanded
transversely posteriorly, resembling in this respect the Cotylosauria and
some of the Theromora of the Permian, but with this the resemblance
ceases. Near the middle line of the skull each one directs its free
posterior margin upward, assuming the direction of the basicranial
axis and, surrounding the posterior nares behind, unites with the
inferior descending axis of the sphenoid by a transverse serrate suture.
The pterygoid plate does not continue its vertical direction for long, but
soon unites with the quadrate posteriorly and the alisphenoid ante-
riorly by a serrate suture. This union of the pterygoid with the prox-
imal extremity of the quadrate, instead of the distal, is a specialization
peculiar to this family among reptiles. The superior prolongation of the

a a re

zygomatic (quadratojugal) to the supratemporomastoid and postfrontal
is equally peculiar to it. Another peculiarity is the non-entrance of the
exoccipital bone into the occipital condyle. Another remarkable pecu-
liarity is the union, a short distance below the brain case, of the Eusta-
chian tubes into a single median vertical canal, which descends to the
pharynx between the vertical axes of the basioccipital and sphenoid
bones.

The mandibular ramus is characterized by the distinctness of all the
elements and by two especial peculiarities. One of these is the absence
of coronoid process, the coronoid bone being a scale on the interior side
of the ramus. The other is the presence of a very large foramen
between the angular and surangular bones on the external face of the
ramus, which communicates with the large dental canal.

The vertebre are procwlous throughout. There are no intercentra
except the chevron bones and a preatlantal element, which articulates
with the lower part of the occipital condyle in front, and underlaps the
os entatum, or centrum of the atlas; posteriorly. This first and only cer-
vical intercentrum sends out, posteriorly and downward on each side, a
long intercentral rib. The atlas consists of separate elements, viz,
centrum, neurapophysis, and neural spine. The centrum is united by
suture with that of the axis vertebra, and the neurapophyses are in con-
tact anteriorly below with the intercentrum. They narrow upward to
a Squamosal suture with the neural spine, which is a thin, curved ele-
ment. The cervical ribs are short, and unite with a parapophysis and
diapophysis. The dorsal ribs have the capitular articulation on the
centrum, and the tubercular on the diapophysis for a short distance,
but the capitular articulation soon rises to the diapophysis, remaining
distinct from the tubercular. There are two sacral vertebra, and no
sacral ribs.

There is no clavicle, proscapula, or epicoracoid. The coracoid is in
contact with the anterior lateral border of the sternum. The supra-
scapula is represented by a cartilage. The ilium is short anteroposte-
riorly and does not extend anteriorly to the acetabulum, but does
extend for a short distance posteriorly to it. The pubis is excluded
from the acetabulum, articulating with the anterior base of the
ischium. The pubes are directed forward and have no symphysis, being
connected by cartilage only. They have no connection with the ischia
on the median line. The ischia are directed downward to a median
symphysis.

There are three elements in the proximal carpal series. Of these the
radiale and intermedium support the foot, and are remarkable for their
longitudinal elongation. The carpalia are more or less aborted. The
tarsalia are remarkable for the specialization of the bones of the first
tow. They are two in number; the large astragalus consisting, appar-
ently, of the tibiale and intermedium tarsi. The fibulare (caleaneum)
has what has not been shown to exist elsewhere amon g Reptilia, a tuber

caleis. Both these elements have a distal convex condylar surface for
the elements distal to them. The tarsalia are partially aborted.

No urinary bladder. A rudimental diaphragm. The viscera are
more particularly described under the genus Alligator.

Fourth mandibular tooth fitting into a pit in the upper jaw. Snout
rather short; nasal bones forming a septum dividing the nasal aper-
ture; supratemporal foss open, splenial bones not entering the man-
dibular symphysis. A dorsal shield formed of juxtaposed, keeled,
bony scutes; gular and ventral scutes without or with thin ossifications.

Osteology.—My knowledge of the osteology of this genus is derived
exclusively from the A. mississippiensis.

Premaxillaries with the spine very short, and uniting by suture with
the produced apices of the nasal bones. Lateral plate in considerable
sutural union with the nasals posterior to the nares. Frontal produced
in a narrow process between prefrontals. A small supraorbital bone
anteriorly placed. Parietal-like frontal, undivided, not sending out
supramastoid processes, and extending to the posterior border of the
superior table of the skull. Supratemporo-mastoid sending out a latero-
posterior process almost to the extremity of the exoccipital, and bounded
below posteriorly by the quadrate, medially by the meatus auditorius,
and ‘anteriorly from before backward, by the quadrate, the superior
process of the zygomatic, and by the postorbital part of the postfronto-
orbital. Anteriorly it is bounded by the postfrontal part of the post-
fronto-orbital. The articular surface of the quadrate is directed as
much backward as downward. ‘The zygomatic reaches its distal
extremity in front, while the jugal is continued three-fourths way from
its first point of contact with the zygomatic to its extremity. The
parieto-quadrate arch is not entirely fused with the elements lying
below it, as it is not united with the supraoccipital by suture, except
on the middle line. The lateral part of the superior border of the supra-
occipital is a Smooth tuberosity, and a foramen passes entirely below
the supratemporo-mastoid bone to the supratemporal foramen. Another
canal passes between the exoccipital and quadrate from behind for-
ward and inward to the temporal fossa. The supraoccipital does not
reach the foramen magnum below, but the latter is inclosed above by
the exoccipitals. The latter do not enter into the composition of the
occipital condyle, which consists e1tirely of the basioccipital.

The quadrate is remarkably extended forward. Below, it sends
down a broad process to join the pterygoid, medially it joins the
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 165

petrosal, while above it joins the alisphenoid, and to a less degree the
parietal. In its junction with the petrosal it overlaps that bone so
far as to almost exclude it from the external wall of the brain case, and
it can only be seen by looking within the posterior border of the tri-
geminal foramen. The alisphenoid is well developed, and joins above
the decurved border of the parietal posteriorly, the postfrontal medially,
and the frontal anteriorly. The alisphenoids meet on the middle line,
leaving a large foramen above for the rhinencephalon, and a large
8-shaped foramen below. The inferior part of the latter is immediately
posterior to the keel-like anterior process of the sphenoid. A strong
process descends to the pterygoid, bounding the trigeminal foramen in
front. This represents the epipterygoid of the Sauria. No orbito-
sphenoid or other interorbital bone.

The anterior half of the basioccipital has its longitudinal axis verti-
eal. The long axis of the sphenoid is also vertical. The medullary
part of the brain case is roofed by the exoccipitals only, but the supra-
occipital bounds the epencephalon above. The petrosal is much more
conspicuous on the internal than on the external wall of the brain case.
It is suboval, and is bounded by the alisphenoid, sphenoid, exoccipital,
supraoccipital, and to a small degree by the parietal. It is deeply
notched in front by the trigeminal foramen. Although the sphenoid is
mainly vertical in position it sends forward between the alisphenoids
a vertically compressed plate, already mentioned. The occipital and
sphenoid elements are coarsely cellular at various points. The ptery-
goids unite together on the median line and join the sphenoid behind
the posterior nares. The pterygoids send forward a process above the
palatines to the front of the orbits, where they cease. Here a strong
process of the prefrontal descends on each side and rests on the adja-
cent parts of the palatine and pterygoid. These processes are separate
on the middle line above and below, but touch at the middle of their
length. The ectopterygoids are large and each sends a process forward
on the maxillary, and a longer one on the pterygoid. The palatine and
maxillary bones are in mutual contact on the middle line, and no part
of the vomer or ethmoid is visible on the external surface.

The mandibular ramus has a rather elongate angle, which has its
superior concave surface divided lengthwise by an obtuse ridge. The
articular bone forms the greater part of the angle, the angular being a
narrow strip on its inferior side, which forms the apex, the surangular
sending a narrow splint on the external side, which does not extend so
far as the two other elements. The cotylus is not divided by a ridge,
but a transverse section is gently sigmoid, descending inward. The
coronoid is a large scale in front of the very large dental foramen, and
does not extend anterior to the vertical line of the angular. A large
foramen is inclosed between the latter and the splenial. The latter
element forms the entire internal side of the ramus, terminating acutely
below and within the fourth tooth. The groove in front of its apex is
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

closed with a straight suture at the fundus. ‘There is a foramen on the
inner side of the splenial opposite the eighteenth tooth, counting from
the front. The angular extends farther forward than the surangular,
and its narrow apical portion is on the inferior face of the ramus, ter-
minating at the eighteenth tooth.

In young specimens the posterior alveoli are not separated from each -
other, and the crowns of the teeth are more compressed than in adults.

The atlantal neural spine has no spinous process, but it is well devel-
oped on the other vertebrie. The atlas sends posteriorly a slender rib,
which is slightly bifurcate proximally. The other cervical ribs send a
distal process forward as well as backward. The dorsal ribs have a
small cartilaginous uncinate process near their distal extremities. The
abdominal ribs consist of four ossicles, forming a chevron directed for-
ward. ‘The interclavicle has no transverse branch, and extends well
in advance of the sternum and nearly to its posterior border. The
hemal ribs unite with the sternum, as follows: Two pairs unite directly,
and four pairs with a median xiphoid cartilage.

The coracoid is an elongate element, distally truncate, without
notches or processses; the usual foramen pierces it near the base. The
scapula is of somewhat similar form; it has no pro- or meso-scapular
process or angle. The humerus has one compressed tuberosity at a
considerable distance distad of the head. The distal extremity much
resembles that of the femur. The ulna is robust proximally, and the
olecranon is represented by a large sesamoid bone. The shaft of the
radius less compressed than that of the ulna, but is not very different
in actual sectional area. Its distal articular surface is a little larger
than that of the ulna, and is at nearly a right angle to it. In the
carpus the radiale is a much larger bone than the intermedium, but
both are similar in form, being much longer than wide, and having
expanded extremities and contracted shafts. Their distal articular
faces are concave. The ulnare projects freely backward. There is
but one carpale, and that corresponds with the third digit. The I and
II are represented by a cartilage. No centrals. Digits five, of which
the third is longest and the fifth shortest. The I, Il, and III only
have the distal phalanges unguiform and sheathed with horny claws.

The ilium projects as far as the diapophysis of the first caudal verte-
bra but does not fuse with it. The proximal end of the ischium is deeply
notched, which causes a perforation of the acetabulum. The femur
is longer than the humerus and the head is less compressed. There
is no distinction into the head and neck. There is but one trochanter
and that is on the posterior aspect and presents its tuberosity distad.
The condyle of the femur is not divided; no patella. The fibula is
much more slender than the tibia at all points. The astragalus articu-
lates with the fibula as well as with the tibia; its face of articulation
with the caleaneum is excavated. The latter has a convex fibula sur-
face, while the tibial surface of the astragalus is concave. Posterior to
the fibular condyle the calcaneum is excavated, and the tuber calcanei is
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 167

somewhat recurved at the apex. It is obliquely truncate behind and
below. The inferior face is excavated and the distal plane. There are
three tarsalia corresponding to four external digits; the first digit
articulating directly with the astragalus, the second digit joins one tar-
sale, the third and fourth one, while the fifth digit islacking. The fifth
tarsale is produced like a rudimental metatarsal. The three interior
digits only have unguiform distal phalanges with corneous sheaths,

Viscera. —The heart is situated in the anterior part of the body cay-
ity, and the lungs extend about half their length posterior to it. The
latter extend cousiderably cephalad of the bronchi, which enter at
about the posterior third of their length, at right angles to the axis of
the body. The liver is completely divided into right and left moie-
ties, each of which sends posteriorly a process of its external portion.
The alimentary canal is distinguished for the strong differentiation
of the stomach, which much exceeds anything known in the Sauria.
The cardium and pylorus are each small orifices, and the stomach has
a fundus at either end external and caudad to each. Toward the
pyloric fundus the walls are very thick with muscle. At its apex is a
small diverticulum in the A. mississippiensis. The small intestine is of
relatively small diameter and the large intestine is large, and is not
distinguished into coion and rectum, and has no cecum. The kidney
is coarsely lobate. ;

The mesenteries are not so simple as in the Sauria, as they are less
less distinct from each other, and send branehes in different directions.
The cesophagus has, besides the dorsal connection, connecticn with the
pericardium. The lungs are connected with both, and distally with
the cephalad surfaee of the liver. The liver has connection posteriorly
with all of these viscera, which is not muscular, but which represents
the dorsal part of the pericardium. <A longitudinal fold connects the
pericardium with the two halves of the liver and the stomach, repre-
senting the gastrohepatic mesentery of the Sauria. From the caudad
margin of the liver on the right side a sheet extends to the body wall,
remaining free from the latter as far posteriorly as the kidney. A
corresponding sheet extends from the distal aspect of the stomach on
the right side. Both are connected with the body wall by bands and
threads. From each lobe of the liver near the median line a sheet
extends to the median body wall below, which is strongly muscular.
This is regarded as homologous with the inferior portion of the dia-
phragm of the mammals, and this with the posterior transverse hepato-
dorsal sheet may correspond with that structure. If so, the important
difference remains that in the alligator it includes the liver between
its two layers, while in the mammals it is entirely superior to the liver.

The tympanic drum is deeply set beneath the superior postorbital
bar. It is protected by a fold of the integument which forms a flap,
which is suspended trom the postorbital bar, closing the orifice like a
lid.

Geologic history.—The genus Alligator is of much more modern origin

than Crocodilus, no undoubted extinct species having been discovered.
The neocene Crocodilus spencerti of England has been found to vary in
the direction of Alligator, and on such an individual was proposed the
A. hantoniensis, but the characters are said not to be normal.

Species.—Three species of this genus are known. One is the North
American; the other is found in China, and the habitat of the other is
unknown. Their characters are as follows:

Nineteen or twenty upper and as many lower teeth on each side;
head nearly twice as long as broad; snout much depressed, broadly
rounded at the end, with the lateral outline nearly straight; a very
short ridge in front of the orbit; upper eyelid bony anteriorly; two
pairs of large nuchal scutes, forming a square, separated on the median
line, with a pair of small ones in front and another pair behind; seven-
teen or eighteen transverse series of dorsal scutes, the broadest com-
posed of eight scutes; fingers hardly half webbed, outer toes about two-
thirds webbed; tail strongly compressed and crested posteriorly. Dark
green or blackish above, young with yellowish cross bands, lower parts
yellowish.

Total length, 2 meters 20 centimeters; reaches a length of 4 meters
(about 16 feet).

In young specimens, of a meter in length, the anterior parts of the
nasal and maxillary bones present coarse, flat tuberosities, while the
middle parts of those bones are nearly smooth. In adults the former
regions are nearly smooth, while the latter are pitted, producing a
shallow honeycombed surface. The posterior parts of the same bones

are nearly smooth, or feebly ridged longitudinally. The frontal, post-
frontal, parietal, and supratemporo-mastoid are always pitted. There
is a low longitudinal median ridge of the frontal bone between the
anterior parts of the orbits. The olfactory groove of the frontal is
narrow, and their lateral walls robust and low. The posterior part of
the surangular bone is honeycombed, while the dentary is smooth, but
is perforated by numerous small foramina.

The vertebree number as follows: C., 8; D., 10; L., 7; 8., 2; C., 36.
The neural spines of the cervicals are narrower anteroposteriorly than
those of the dorsals, except that of the axis, which is much the longest,
but is not moreelevated than the others. The hypapophysis of the sec-
ond cervical is very low, but those of the other cervicals and of the
anterior four dorsals are well developed; there is a low one on the fifth
dorsal. The mutual surfaces of the centra of the second sacral and
first caudal are flat. But three of the ribs articulate with the vertebral
centra, the remainder having the capitular articulations with the
diapophyses at increasing distances from their bases. Of the caudal
vertebra the anterior 18 have diapophyses. The first and second have
no chevrons, which are present on the following 21. The terminal cen-
tra are much compressed. The last abdominal rib is much more robust
than the others. It is similarly composed and posteriorly joins the
pubes at their bases. The phalanges areas follows: Manus, 2-3-4-3-3;
pes, 2-3-4-3, These details are derived from a skeleton in the museum
of the School of Biology of the University of Pennsylvania.

The alligator is characteristic of the Austroriparian region, ranging
from North Carolina to the Rio Grande of Texas. I have examined

‘erania of individuals taken in the Nueces River, Texas, and do not find
them to differ in any respect from those taken in Florida.

As regards the range of the alligator up the Mississippi, I have
gained the following information through my friend, Mr. Julius Hurter,
of St. Louis, who has for many years made a study of the batrachians
and reptiles of Missouri. He states that the oldest residents of the
southeastern county of that State have no knowledge ot the occurrence
of the species in that locality. The most northern locality with which
Mr. Hurter is personally acquain!ed is Rodney, Jefferson County, Miss.,
about latitude 32°,

Dr. Hugh M. Smith,! of the United States Fish Commission, says
that—

The maternal alligator in April or May seeks a sheltered spot on a bank and there
builds asmall mound. The foundation of the mound is of mud and grass, and on
this she lays some eggs. She covers the eggs with another stratum of grass and mud,
upon which she deposits some more eggs. ‘Thus she proceeds until she has laid from
100 to 200 eggs.

The eggs in the course of time are hatched by the sun, assisted by the heat which
the decomposition of the vegetable material generates. As soon as they have
“chipped the shell,” the baby alligators are led to the water by the mother, who

provides them with food which she disgorges, showing much anxiety for their safety.
At this early period of their existence they are exposed to many dangers, being a
favorite prey of fishes and turtles. Alligators’ eggs are sometimes eaten by the
Florida crackers. The robbing of the nests for market is helping to hasten the iney-
itable destruction of the alligator fishery, which has been an important and profit-
able industry in Florida. Facts recently gathered by the Fish Commission show
that the reptiles can not long escape practical extermination. Already they are
becoming scarce, and the price of hides has gone up.

_ It is estimated that 2,500,000 alligators were killed in Florida between 1880 and
1894.

In 1890 about 250 pounds of alligator teeth were sold, hunters receiving from $1
to $2 a pound for them. They are removed by burying the heads and rotting out
the teeth. Of the best teeth, about seventy make a pound. The stuffing of alli-
gators and the polishing of the teeth give employment to forty persons. Unfortu-
nately, alligators grow very slowly. At 15 years of age they are only 2 feet long.
A 12-footer may be reasonably supposed to be 75 years old.

The artifical propagation of alligators has been recently undertaken to supply the
trade in Florida curiosities.

The incubator system employed is quite simple. The eggs, which are about the
size of those of a goose, are placed in boxes of sand and covered up. The boxes are
exposed on a roof to the torrid rays of a tropical sun, and in a few days the young
reptiles are hatched.

Concerning this genus Boulenger remarks:!

Notwithstanding all that has been written on the specific characters of the croco-
diles, their distinction and definition remains a matter of considerable difficulty.
Although the extreme forms, viz, C. cataphractus and C. patustris, differ very widely,
the passage is so complete as to render even subgeneric divisions unadvisable. The
following key will, I hope, suffice in most cases for the exact determination of the
species, except with respect to newly born specimens, which can only be named by
comparison with older examples.

Boulenger then gives the foliowing table of the species:

I, Snout very slender, gavial-like, at least twice as long as broad at the base; man-
dibular symphysis extending to the level of the sixth, seventh, or
eighth tooth; premaxillo-maxillary suture, on the palate, produced

posteriorly.

one on each side of the anterior pair; the large nuchals sometimes fol-
lowed by one or two detached pairs of smaller scutes; usually two pairs
of smaller nuchals in a transverse row behind the occiput. Dorsal scutes
well separated from the nuchals, in fifteen or sixteen transverse and
four or six longitudinal rows; the scutes of the two median rows regu-
larly arranged, the others more or less irregular and more strongly
keeled; sides with scattered keeled scutes. A slight web between the
second and third fingers; outer toes extensively webbed. A serrated
fringe on the outer edge of the leg; scales on the limbs keeled. Black-
ish olive above, yellowish inferiorly; young pale olive, dotted and
spotted with black. (Boulenger.)

The largest specimen in the collection measures 34 meters.

Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Southern Mexico,
West Indies, Florida.

This species varies a good deal in the number and arrangement of
the nuchal scutes. Specimens from Tehuantepec, on the west coast of
Mexico, exhibit from two to four nuchal scuta and from two to five
cervical. Several specimens present the irregularity of having seuta
of the external dorsal series to join on the middle line of the back,
replacing the median row of scutes at those points.!

Mr. W. T. Hornaday originally observed this species to be an inhabi-
tant of the seacoast, streams, and lakes of southeastern Florida,! rang-
ing north as far as Lake Worth, a hundred miles north of the southern
extremity of the State. From this point Mr. Ward, of Rochester, New
York, obtained a specimen 9 feet in length. Mr. Hornaday supposed
these individuals to represent a species different from that of more
southern waters, but I have been unable to detect any difference. The
largest specimen he obtained measured 14 feet in length.

In its preference for salt water this species differs from the alligator.
It is said also to be more vicious in its disposition. A specimen
between 4 and 5 feet in length was once sent me by my late friend,
Professor Poey, of Havana. I kept it tethered in a yard and observed
its manners. It was ill-natured and not afraid to attack either by
snapping its jaws or striking with its tail.

A specimen of this species was sent to the National Museum from
Mazatlan, on the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. This is the nearest point
to the Nearctic realm at which it has been found on the Pacific coast.

SQUAMATA.
1, GENERAL ANATOMY. .

No quadratojugal (zygomatic) arch; quadrate therefore articulated
by its proximal extremity only. Noostabulare. Paroccipital present;
opisthotic early fused with the supramastoid, probably fused with the
parietal. Nostrils, both external and internal, subterminal. Maxillo-
palatines, palatines, and pterygoids distinct, paired; ectopterygoid
present and distinct. Teeth on maxillary and dentary bones. Stapes
with a long shaft, or columella, terminating in a cartilage.

Vertebral centra proccelous, rarely amphiccelous; caudals with chey-
rons. Neural arches coossified with centrum, except atlas, which has
neurapophyses separate from body and from each other; odontoid
process distinct. Not more than two vertebrae in sacrum. Cervical
ribs. Dorsal ribs single (i. e., tubercular) headed, articulating with
diapophyses; one to several pairs articulating with sternum. No
sacral ribs. No tegumeutary abdominal bones.

Scapular arch, when developed, consisting of suprascapula, scapula,
precoracoid, coracoid, clavicle, and interclavicle; frequently a pro-
scapula. The scapula is not coossified with the other elements. Cora-
coid articulating with the simple plate-like sternum. Pelvic areh,
when complete, embracing the three elements, which inclose below a
large obturator foramen. Ilium directed backward and upward.

Brain with large olfactory lobes, which are not as large as the hemi-
Spheres. The latter are larger than the thalami, and their ventricles
are on the external side of their nucleus (corpus striatum). Thalami
exposed above as well as laterally. Cerebellum small, without flocculi.

176 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

Central canal of spinal cord present. The eye possesses the usual
character of the Monocondylia in the presence of the pecten, which
extends from the choroidea to the sheath of the lens. It is not so
plicate as in birds. The organ of hearing conforms to the same type
in the absence of a helix and the presence of a lagena and sacculus.
The sympathetic nervous system is well developed and presents the
series of subvertebral ganglia.

The alimentary canal is little specialized in the different parts of its
course, but the stomach is distinguished by its greater diameter and
generally more muscular walls. The diameter of the rectum generally
exceeds that of the preceding parts of the canal. Gall bladder and
pancreas present. Adipose bodies present.

Heart with three chambers; two auricles and one ventricle. The lat-
ter gives origin to a truncus communis arteriosus, which sends off one
or two aorta bows on each side, which combine to form a single aorta
root on each side, which fuse into the single aorta on the middle line
below the vertebral column. <A sinus venosus. Posterior vena cava,
formed from the renal veins and traversing the liver after receiving
the portal vein. It is received, together with two jugulars, into the
sinus venosus. Posterior vertebral veins running below the ribs.

Sexes distinct. Testis and vas deferens distinct from renal ducts,
discharging separately into cloaca. Males with two prehensile organs,
each inclosed in a sheath, one on each side of the base of the tail.
They are everted toward the cloacal orifice when in use and are
retracted by invagination by the contraction of an axial muscle. They
are traversed by a groove, the suleus spermaticus, which, beginning at
the base on the inner side, winds to the apex on the outer side, uniting
into a short, common vagina opening into the cloaca from above to
receive the male prehensile organs. Oviducts distinct: The oviduct
consists of a tube, which, when not containing eggs, is collapsed, fall-
ing into numerous parallel, transverse folds. These folds are held in
place by an elastic band on each opposite border. The margin of the
fontanelle is of delicate membrane, and it is attached to the body wall
by a delicate fold of peritoneum

The integument is characteristically divided into small areas or
scales, by confluent inflections. These are occasionally the seat of
osseous deposit (Scincidz, Gerrhonotidae), but this is exceptional. No
osseous scuta, other than the cases mentioned. This description
applies as well to the extinct Pythonomorpha as to the Sauria and
Ophidia. Abdominal scales generally different from the dorsal.

The integument of the head is divided in many types into plates of
definite relations, which are homologous throughout the various sub-
divisions, and even between the suborders of Sauria and Ophidia. In
general, it may be believed that these plates have resulted from the
fusion of scales, both because scales are the primitive covering of the
body and are less specialized than the head plates, but also because
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. Daa

the types of affinity with the extinct types have scaly heads; for
instance, the Sphenodon of the Rhynchocephalian order is approached
closely in scale characters by the Pachygloss lizard. The Boide,
among snakes, recognized as the most primitive forms, also have
generally scaly heads and few or no plates. The scaly head also char-
acterives some of the higher types of snakes, as many Solenoglypha,
as well as the degenerate Epanodonta and Catodonta; while most of
the degenerate Sauria have head plates, but more or less fused.

2. DISTRIBUTION AND HABITS.

The Squamata are found in all except the Arctic and Antarctic
regions of the earth. Their numbers, both in species and individuals,
increase as we approach the Tropics. They are preeminently terrestrial
animals, and are never found far from shore, excepting certain snakes
which live in the ocean. On land they inhabit all localities that supply
food and shelter, whether in trees, on the surface of the earth, or
beneath the surface, or along the shores of bodies of water. ‘They are
for the greater part carnivorous, but certain lizards and a very few
snakes are herbivorous.

The Squamata, like other reptiles, possess much muscular power, and
above all others many of them are capable of great speed of motion.
Many of the arboreal species climb with wonderful rapidity, and others
get over the ground with great swiftness. Such are especially the
Teiide, or swift lizards, who are almost invisible when running, and
some of the snakes. A few lizards (Amblyrhynchus) are good swimmers,
while along all bodies of fresh water dwell snakes which are such
expert swimmers that they readily capture the fishes on which they
prey. The prehensile power of the Peropodous snakes is well known,
enabling them to kill small and medium-sized mammals by involving
them in their coils. Certain of the snakes have none of the remarkable
powers of speed, prehension, or swiftness possessed by others, but are
protected by a formidable poisonous biting apparatus, which enables
them to inflict mortal wounds on their prey, and which places them in
the front rank of dangerous animals.

The Squamata exhibit a low order of intelligence. Most of them
give few exhibitions of it, and it is then generally in connection with
obtaining food. They sometimes appear to recognize the person that
feeds them, and will overcome their timidity so far as to take food from.
the hand. I give an account, under the head of Liopeltis vernalis, of a
ruse adopted by this species for the purpose of taking prey; and under
Heterodon platyrhinus, of actions apparently intended to inspire fear in
a venomous snake with which it was confined.

3. CLASSIFICATION.

The Squamata are known under three principal modifications or sub-
orders, as follows:

Quadrate bone articulating with exoccipital; parietal bones not closing the brain
case in front; generally an epipterygoid and sternum; teeth with dentinal roots;
phalanges with condyles... ese uvewet mamaria ae ae ee er ee SAURIA.

Of these three suborders, the Pythonomorpha is extinct, having
begun and ended with Cretaceous time. The Sauria and Ophidia are
the subjects of the present work. Both begin in Cretaceous time, so
far as our present knowledge extends, but it is at the existing geo-
logie period of time that they present the greatest multiplication of
individuals and species. This statement is, of course, provisional and
dependent on future discoveries in paleontology for its verification or
contradiction.

The superficial characters given by systematic writers generally as

distinguishing the Sauria and Ophidia are quite insufficient for that
purpose. Johannes Miiller! first placed the distinction on a sound
basis by showing that in the Ophidia the frontal and parietal bones
descend to the basi-cranial axis as in no other vertebrates, thus closing
the brain case in front, while in the Sauria this does not occur, and
as the ali- and orbito-sphenoid bones are rudimental or wanting, the
brain case is without osseous wall in front. Some lizards present a
distinct approximation to the ophidian type in the strong decurvature
of the parietal bones at the rides; these are the Annulati and the
Annielloida. These groups display a similar approximation in the con-
tinuous sutural union of the occipital and parietal elements, a condition
universal in Ophidia and rare in Sauria.
' I have pointed out? another point of distinction between the two
divisions, viz, that the supratemporal (‘‘ squamosal” olim) is present in
the Sauria and absent in the Ophidia. As it is, however, absent in
the Annielloida and Amphisbenia, I have not included it in the defi-
nition of the former suborder. This definition has not been adopted by
those authors who erroneously regard the suspensorium of the quad-
rate bone in the Ophidia as identical with the supratemporal of the
lizards. I pointed out in the above essay (1871) that this element in the
snakes is homologous with the paroccipital of the Sauria, an opinion
which was not agreed with at that time, but which has now received the
assent of various anatomists, notably Professor Baur.

Baur and some others do not, however, agree that the element in ques-
tion is the paroccipital, but call it squamosal and other names. I was
led to identify it with the former element of the Testudinata, ete., by a
consideration of its structure in the Pythonomorpha,’ where it is much
more largely developed than in the Sauria, and where it supports the
quadrate bone as in the Ophidia, which it does not do, or does only
partially in a few cases, in the Sauria. I have made this more clear
than heretofore I hope in a recent essay. The paroccipital bone is
received deeply between the exoccipital and the petrosal in the Pytho-
nomorpha in the same manner as in the Tortricine snakes, a structure
which does not occur in the Sauria. This structure is somewhat

masked in some genera of Pythonomorpha by the extension of the
exoccipital over the paroccipital as a thin lamina on the posterior side;
but its true relation to the petrosal can be seen on the anterior side.
There can be no doubt that the Pythonomorpha form a line distinct
from the Sauria, and that their resemblances to the Varani are the
result of a parallel evolution rather than an indication of near affinity,
as supposed by Cuvier.

The failure of Cuvier, Owen, Dollo, Baur, and Marsh to perceive this
fact is due to their want of information as to what the differences
between the Ophidia and Sauria really are. Boulenger only has
reached correct views on the subject, although not on account of the
structure of the paroccipital, but on account of the character of the
dentition and of the limbs.’

The third character which I have pointed out as distinguishing the
suborders of Squamata is the difference in the mode of articulation of
the quadrate bone with the adjacent cranial elements. In the Sauria
it articulates with the exoccipital, being also in contact with the par-
occipital and the supratemporal. The contact with the paroccipital is
insignificant, owing to the small size of that element; and that with
the supratemporal is only important where that bone is well developed.
In many Sauria it is feeble or wanting. In the Pythonomorpha and
Ophidia on the other hand the quadrate articulates with the parocci-
pital, sometimes touching the supratemporal in the former. In some
of the degraded Ophidia, as the Typhlopidz and Stenostomide, the par-
occipital is not distinct, so that the quadrate appears to rest on the exoc-
cipital and the petrosal. It will, however, be necessary to subject these
types to more searching investigation before it can be known that the
paroccipital is absent.

As exceptions to the rule in the Sauria, Boulenger has pointed out that
the quadrate does not reach the exoccipital in the Agamid genus Chlamy-
dosaurus,? and I have found the same condition in Phrynocephalus.®

4, PHYLOGENY.

From this point of view the Ophidia and Pythonomorpha must be
traced to some type in which the paroccipital bone is less remote from
the brain case than is seen in the Sauria, where it has become a mere
rudiment. Such a phylogeny would be expressed as follows. An
investigation of the Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous might yield inter-
esting results.

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 181

This common ancestor is a land reptile with the peculiar character
of the paroccipital seen in the Pythonomorpha. Whether it would
enter this suborder remains to be ascertained. Irom it the Saurian
type has been derived by the reduction of the paroccipital, and its wide
remova! from the cranial wall. The ophidian order has resulted from
an enlargement of this element, together with its exclusion from the
cranial walls, to which it nevertheless remains adherent. Boulenger!
suggests that the Dolichosauria occupy this position.

The Squamata display among Reptilia tendencies which reach their
extreme expression in the Ophidia. These are, as already pointed out,
first, the disposition to reduction in the use of the limbs as supports of
the body, and a consequent increasing tendency to rest the body on the
ground when in motion; second, the increasing mobility of the suspen-
sorium of the mandible, permitting an increase in the gape of the
mouth, and the consequent capacity for swallowing large bodies.
These tendencies are seen, first, in the successive shortening of the
limbs and reduction in the number of the digits, and finally reduction
and abolition of the limbs themselves. Itis characteristic of the entire
suborder that the ribs have only the tubercular articulation with the
veterbrie, having lost the capitular, thus reducing the strength of the
Suspension of the viscera from the vertebral column. It thus becomes
first comfortable, and finally necessary that the body should be sup-
ported by the earth or object on which the animal rests, the process
being identical with that which has taken place in the Cetacea, which
have also lost the capitular rib articulations after long suspension of
the body in the water. This change is, of course, completed by the
total loss of limbs, as is seen in many Sauria and in all Ophidia. The
freedom of the distal extremity of the quadrate bone gives mobility
to the mandible; but this function does not reach any great develop-
ment in the Sauria, and is but little more obvious in the inferior
Ophidia (Angiostomata). In the Ophidia generally it acquires an
enormous development, most of all in the highest venomous forms
(Solenoglypha).

5. HISTORY.

The order Squamata was first correctly delimited by Merrem in 1820,’
who included in it only the Sauria and Ophidia. The name was pro-
posed by Oppel? in 1811, but he included in it the crocodiles. The
character viewed by these authors as definitive was the possession of
tegumentary scales, in contrast to the osseous carapace of the Testudi-
nata. They were unacquainted with the various anatomical characters
which distinguish the order from all others. The Sauria and Ophidia
were regarded as orders by other authors, including Duméril, in accord-
ance with the system of Brongniart (1799).

The first author to define the Squamata by anatomical characters

was Latreille. In 1825, in his Familles Naturelles du Réegne Animal,
he separated the Squamata, under the name Squamosa, from the tor-
toises and crocodiles, on account of the slight fixity of the quadrate
bone, the double male intromittent organs, and the structure of the
feet. He was followed in this after a long interval by Stannius, who
in 1856 reviewed the Squamata under the name of Streptostylica,!
including in it the two orders Sauria and Ophidia. I adopted this
name as that of a superorder in 1871,’ including in it the Sauria and
Ophidia, and a third order, the Pythonomorpha, which I had already
proposed in 1869 for the mosasauroid reptiles. This arrangement was
retained in a synopsis of the families of Vertebrata published in 1889,
except that the term Squamata was employed instead of Streptostylica,
and was applied to an order instead of a superorder. This arrangement
is continued in the present work. Dr. Boulenger has adopted this
system, but added the chameleons, or Rhiptoglossa, to the list of orders,
increasing the number to fuur. This change is not adopted in the pres-
ent work. The solidarity of the order Squamata is attested by the
reproductive system as well as by the osseous, and especially by the
characters of the male intromittent organ, as I have recently pointed out.

SAURIA.
I. ANATOMY.
1. OSTEOLOGY.

The following summary of the osteology of the Sauria is based on
examinations of the specimens contained in most of the museums of
Europe and of this country. For North American forms I am prinei-
pally indebted to the United States National Museum, my private
collection, and that of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel-
phia. The characters observed during my study of material in Europe,
which I found to be of the greatest taxonomic importance, I enumerated
in a paper which is printed in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia
Academy for 1864, p. 224. The use then made of those characters has
been generally accepted by subsequent writers.!| There are, however,
many other characters whose value is of uncertain taxonomic value,
which were not then mentioned, and which I now record.

The first description of the osteology of the Sauria is that of Cuvier,
which is contained in his Ossemens Fossiles.° This is an excellent
one, but the many types discovered since his time render it neces-

sary that a new survey of the subject should be made. In 1856 the
Zootomie der Amphibien, by Stannius, appeared. The account of the
osteology of lizards given in this work is more complete than that of
Cuvier, but it is incomplete in many points, and is not up to the require-
ments of the present time. The present study is made with especial
reference to the necessities of the paleontology of the order, therefore
the description of characters is made as specific as possible. The
principal novelty will be found in the references to North American
genera and in the descriptions of the hyoid apparatus. The deserip-
tion of the scapular and pelvic arches in certain genera with the
extremities degenerate or wanting, where they have not been previ-
ously described, is contained in a separate illustrated paper, which has
been published.!

Skull.—The premaxillary bone is single, except in the Scincidie, Acon-
tiide, and some Geckonidz (Phyllurus sp.). It is very small in the
Iguanid genus Phrynosoma, and in the Agamidz it is excluded from
contact with the vomer by processes of the maxillaries, which meet on
the middle line. In the Chameleonide the premaxillary is still smaller,
the body being narrower than the superior spine, and supporting but
one tooth. In the Anguide the premaxillary is bounded posteriorly
on each side by a foramen which is sometimes large, but is wanting
in other families, including the Helodermidx. In Lepidosternum it is
principally on the inferior face of the muzzle. The nasal bones are gen-
erally distinct, but in the Varanidze they are fused into a single nar-
row median element. In the Chameleonidze they do not attain the
nasal border, being cut off by the junction of the prefrontal with the
_ premaxillary and maxillary bones. Im the genus Feylinia the nasal
bones are fused into a broad plate. In Lepidosternum they are com-
pletely cut off from the nasal border by the maxillary, which is broadly
in contact with the premaxillary spine. In Rhineiira the nasal bone
reaches the nares, as in Amphisbena. The frontal bones are separate
in the Varanide, Helodermide, Anguide, Scincide, Anelytropside,
Anniellide, and Amphisbeenidie, and in some Geckonidxe. They are
coossified in some Geckonide; in the Iguanidwe, Agamidw, Xenosau-
ride, Eublepharidi, Chameleonidie, and Teiide. The parietals are
generally fused, the only exception being the Geckonidx, Uroplatide,
and Xantusiide. Prefrontals are always present, and in Anniellide,
Helodermidwe, and Chamieleonid they extend posteriorly to the post-
frontals, excluding the frontal from the orbital border. Lachrymals
are present, but they are fused with the prefrontal in the Scincide.
The jugal is generally present, even when there is no postorbital arch,
as in Geckonidw, where it is a splint; but in the Amphisbzenia,
Annielloidea, and in Feylinia, the splint-like element attached to the
maxillary extends to the pterygoid posteriorly and the prefrontal
anteriorly, and may include the lachrymal. The jugal extends ante-
riorly as far as the lachrymal except in the Scincid. The postfrontal

184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

is wanting and in most cases is fused with the postorbital in the
Varanide and Agamidie; but in other families it is distinct, with
sporadic cases of fusion, as in Onemidophorus. Superciliary bones
are present in Varanus, Phrynosoma, and several genera of Agamidz.
They belong to the tegumentary system, and articulate the anterior
with the prefrontal, the posterior (absent in Varanus) with the post-
frontorbital bone. The supraoccipital is undivided and forms the
superior part of the edge of the foramen magnum. Its anterior bor-
der is generally loosely articulated with the parietal, joining it by
a rudimental or developed median gomphosis with the supraoccipital
process. It is generally overhung by the parietal, always so when
the parietoquadrate arches are present. It is entirely overroofed by
the parietal in the Xantusiide, the two elements being connected by a
vertical laminiform septum. It is not overhung in the Annielloidea
and Amphisbzenia, and in these the articulation is a firm complete
transverse union. The parietoquadrate arch consists proximally of a
process of the parietal, which is directed outward and posteriorly,
which may represent the supramastoid element of the primitive Coty-
losauria. Distally this process receives an ascending process of the
paroccipital on its inferior aspect, sometimes anteriorly, sometimes pos-
teriorly. This arch is shortened and depressed in the Anelytropside
and is absent from the Anniellide and Amphisbeenia. In the Chame-
leonid it is differently composed, consisting of a superior posterior
process of the supratemporal, which rises upward and reaches the
produced apex of the undivided parietal. The supratemporal is accom-
panied for a short distance above the quadrate by the ascending
process of the paroccipital. The pineal foramen is present in the
Chameleonide, Agamide, Iguanidie, Anolide, Xenosauridx, Anguide,
Lacertid, Varanide, and Scincide. Itis wanting in the Helodermide,
Eublepharide, Teiide, Anniellidee, and in the Amphisbeenia. It perfo-
rates the parietal bone clear of all sutures in most of the families, but
it is near to or on the frontoparietal suture in Iguanide and Anolide,
and is in the frontal in Dipsosaurus and the Chameleonide. The occi-
pital condyle is compound, consisting of portions of the exoccipitals
and basioccipital. In many genera these segments become so thor-
oughly codssified at maturity as to be undistinguishable. In some of
the Geckonid (as Gecko, Uroplates) the occipital segment is so reduced
as to give the appearance of two condyles. In the Amphisbenia the
condyle is transverse and concave at the center, leaving the lateral
portions prominent.

The postorbital bone when present sends a process posteriorly to the
supratemporal, forming the supratemporal arch. In the genera without
this arch the postorbital may be wanting, as in Heloderma, or be rudi-
mental, as in Anniella. In the genera whose degeneration is advanced
the supratemporal bone is appressed to the parietal, inclosing no
foramen supratemporale, asin Feylinia. Inlimbless genera of Anguidze

the supratemporal touches the parietal anterior to the paroccipital, thus
reducing the supratemporal foramen. This occurs also in Gerrhonotus,
Celestus, Xenosaurus, and Xantusiide. In Heloderma the supratem-
poral is a rudiment on the external side of the base of the paroccipital.

The remarkable upward production of the supratemporal in Chame-
leon has been mentioned. Here this process takes the place of the
parietoquadrate arch. The exoccipitals are produced laterally, each
embracing, with the petrosal in front, the small paroccipital. This sus-
tains the superior extremity of the quadrate. In the snake-like genera,
as Feylinia, Anniella, and the Amphisbenia, this lateral elongation does
not exist. The exoccipital is snake-like, and the quadrate is sessile on
the side of the skull. The quadrate is generally convex at the upper part
of its anterior face, and its external anterior border is produced outward
so as to embrace a longitudinal concavity or conch, with the vertical mass
or column of the bone. This column is itself more or less concave, its
upper extremity being produced a little backward. In the Iguanidee
there is another concavity, internal to the column, similar to the external.
This is much narrowed in the majority of the families, and in the Vara-
nide and Helodermide, and in Phrynosoma, Eublepharis,-and Celestus
itis wanting. In Chameleon, Anniella, and the Amphisbeenia there is
no external conch, the quadrate being simply a rod, while in Feylinia it
is flattened in an antereposterior plane. The mandibular articulation is
more or less bilobate in all except Varanus, where itis plane. In Gecko
the bilobation is strongiy marked, as in the Permian Theriodonta. The
pterygoid bones extend forward from the quadrates, with which they are
in contact in all forms except Chameleon, toward the middle line. This
portion is generally grooved, but in Yenosaurus itis a slender rod. They
are received on the basipterygoid processes of the sphenoid, and then
diverge and assume alongitudinal position without meeting onthe middle
line. They are produced in an angle or process toward the posterior
extremity of the maxillary bone, from which they are separated by the
ectopterygoid. The pterygoids then join the palatines. Inafew genera
they bear a few small teeth. The palatines are separate from each other
and from the maxillaries, but send a process outward and forward to
the latter. They join in front each its corresponding half of the vomer.
The internal nares are situated each between the vomer and the maxil-
lary, and it notches more or less deeply the palatine, which forms its
posterior border. The vomers are separate in all forms excepting
Chameleon, and they have various ‘orms. In Geckonidie and Anolide
they are flat and fit closely together, and they have the same character
in many Agamide and Iguanide. In a few members of these families
(Uromastiz and Sauromalus) they are divided by a groove, which
becomes a fissure posteriorly, which is the character in most other liz-
ards. In the Varanid each vomer is produced posteriorly on each side
this fissure toa greater distance than in other forms. The planes of
the palate differ much in different families and groups. Thus, the vomer
186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

is on a much higher plane than the palatines in Chameeleonide and
Geckonide, the palatines curving downward to meet the pterygoids.
The latter are generally horizontal, but in Chameleon they are in a sub-
vertical plane, their free rounded extremities descending and fitting on
the inner side of the mandible. They do not quite reach the quadrate.
In the Agamide, Iguanidie, and Geckonidew the internal extremity of
the ectopterygoid is directed inferiorly, forming a downwardly directed
angle on each side of the palate. In the Amphisbenia the structure of
the palate is much more compact than in other lizards. The palatines
are in contact on the middle line and there is no palatomaxiilary fora-
men. That is, the palatine is in close contact with the maxillary, the
ectopterygoid being. tightly wedged in between them. The pterygoids
are in contact throughout their length with the sphenoid, and the prox-
imal end of each is tightly wedged between the latter and the quadrate.

The character of the petrosal must be attended to by anyone who
desires to understand the relations of the Sauria among themselves.
In no member of the Sauria is the trigeminus foramen closed ante-
riorly by bony tissue, but it is inclosed by the membrane which forms
the anterior wall of the brain case. The petrosal is divided into two
parts by the deep notch whose fundus forms the posterior border of this
foramen, which may be called the supra and infra foraminal portions.
The infraforaminal portion is divided in most of the families by a longi-
tudinal, keel-like ridge, which forms the superior border of a groove
whose inferior wall is formed by the sphenoid. This groove is not pres-
ent in Heloderma and is very shallow in Xenosaurus. It is wanting in
the Anniellidw and Amphisbenia. In the Geckonide it does not exist,
nor is the petrosal notched by the foramen, while the anterior border of
the petrosal forms a free crest which extends from above downward and
backward. In the Chaineleonide, Agamid, Iguanidz, and Anolidz
(families with papillose tongues) the supraforaminal part of the petro-
sal is short and is bounded by a convex anterior border which marks
the position of the anterior semicircular canal. In the Nyctisaura,
Thecaglossa, Diplogiossa, Leptoglossa, and Amphisbenia (families
with smooth or squamous tongues, except Anniella, Diploglossa, and
Nyctisaura) the petrosal is produced beyond this curved border below
the parietal. In many forms an outline of the semicircular canal
which forms the boundary in the other superfamilies may be traced,
whence I have termed this part of the petrosal posterior to it “the
arched body” in my former system of the Sauria.' The petrosal is
produced farthest beyond this arcade in the snakelike forms of the
Anniella aud Amphisbzenia, reaching almost to the orbit in Lepido-
sternum. The relation to the parietal differs, the differences resulting
from the greater or less reduction of the primitive supratemporal roof
and the greater or less entrance of the parietal into the lateral wall of
the brain case. In most of the families it is little or not decurved to

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 187

meet the petrosal; and in the Iguania, where it is decurved, it does not
come in contact with the petrosal, owing to the shortness of the latter.
In certain families where the petrosal is produced beyond the arcade,
and the parietal is decurved, the two elements are in contact for a
short distance, as in the Varanidz. In the Teiid and Scincide the
contact is mainly effected by a short descending process of the parie-
tal. This process is especially elongate in the Scincide. The arcade
is the anterior border of the petrosal in the Permian Theriodonta, and
it marks the position of the anterior semicircular canal. The membra-
nous wall of the brain case, anterior to the petrosal, contains an ossifi-
cation which is of uncertain homology. It reaches or approaches by its
superior extremity the frontal, and might hence be supposed to be the
orbitosphenoid; but this homology is vitiated by the fact that its infe-
rior portion passes behind the optic foramen. The latter position is
that of the alisphenoid, and so the bone is named by Parker!. But
there is another element, the epipterygoid, posterior to it and immedi-
ately anterior to the petrosal, which has been supposed to be the true
alisphenoid.

Leaving this question, and adopting for the bone in question the pro-
visional name of postoptic, | remark that it is typically triradiate, send-
ing two branches upward and one downward. This is its character
in Agamidez, Varanide, and Teiide. The posterior superior branch is
much reduced in many Iguanidie and Lacertidze and in some Agamidz
(Megalochilus), and it is absolutely wanting in Gerrhosaurus and
Chameleon. There is no postoptic in Heloderma. In the Rhynchoce-
phalian genus Sphenodon these two elements coexist with an orbito-
sphenoid, lying between the optic and trigeminal foramina. The two
together may be homologous with the mammalian alisphenoid. The
epipterygoid is present in all Lacertilia excepting the Chamzleonidxe
and Annulati (Amphisbenia). Its superior connections are quite char-
acteristic of the different families. Inferiorly it rests on the pterygoid
posterior to its ectopterygoid process, excepting in the Geckonide,
where its point of attachment is opposite to that process. In the same
family it does not reach the parietal, but the superior extremity rests
on the apex of the supraforaminal part of the petrosal. In the remain-
ing families there are three modes of superior attachment. In most of
the [guania and Acrodonta it reaches the parietal and does not touch
the short petrosal. In the other superfamilies it is in contact with the
petrosal. Inthe Varanidie, Helodermide, and most Anguide it reaches
the parietal, which does not meet it with a conspicuous descending
process. In Scincide and Teiide a conspicuous descending process
meets it. In a certain number of genera of various families it does not
quite reach the parietal. Such are Eublepharide, Gerrhosauridie,
Anguis, Lacerta, Phrynosoma (where it rests on the areade of the

‘Transactions Royal Society, 1879, p. 605, on the Development of the Skull in
Lacertilia.
188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

petrosal), Iguana, Uromastix, Agama, and Gonyocephalus (subcristatus).
In Lyriocephalus and Phrynocephalus the epipterygoid is very short.

The semicircular canals perforate the supraoccipital, the exoccipital,
and the petrosal. The internal is in a subtransverse vertical plane,
causing a convexity on the internal side of the supra- and exoccipitals,
and in some types a visible rib on the superoexternal suface of the
same. The external canal is in a horizontal plane and perforates the
base of the exoccipitopetrosal suspensorium, causing a horizonta: rib
on the anterior face of the latter in some forms. The anterior is in a
vertical anteroposterior plane, and perforates principally the petrosal,
occupying its anterior border, which forms the ‘“ arcade” in most of the
thick-tongued superorders, but crossing the bone much behind the
anterior border in the slender-tongued superorders and the Diplogiossa.
The fenestra ovalis is tightly closed by the disk of the stapes, which is
continued externally as the rodlike columella. This rod is slender
except in Anniella,where it is remarkably robust. In the other Amphis-
benia its tympanic extremity is somewhat thickened. The columella
is continued externally into a cartilage,which is more or less expanded
in the vertico-transverse plane, the distal portion always so, forming a
vertical lamina in contact with the tympanic membrane. This is the
epistapedial cartilage. It is frequently produced upward beyond its
point of attachment into a suprastapedial process. The plate thus
formed is almost separate from the proximal axial part of the cartilage
in Heloderma The axial portion has a descending process, the infra-
stapedial of Parker, in Lacerta, Heloderma, but not in Hublepharis,
Thecadactylus, and Phyllodactylus.

The rami of the lower jaw are united at the symphysis by ligament
only. The angle is a prolongation of the articular bone; it is elongate
and simple, except in Anniella and Chameleon, where it is absent.
The angular bone never reaches the angle, and has an anterior posi- -
tion, being sometimes fused with the articular. The relations of the
segments of the lower jaw are very characteristic in the divisions of
the Sauria. The splenial bone is wanting in the Chameleonide,
and is very small in the Agamid; in other families it is well devel-
oped. The dentary extends posteriorly on the external face of the
ramus, as the splenial diminishes, having the greatest posterior extent
in the two families mentioned. The coronoid is differently extended in
a similar ratio. Thus it is extended posteriorly on the external side of
the ramus, and not anteriorly, in the Chamleonide and Agamide;
both forward and backward in the Geckonide; and forward in the
other families. The angular is absent (fused with the articular, Bou-
lenger) in the Geckonide, Anolide, Acontiidwe, Anelytropsid, Anniel-
lide, and the Annulata, and is distinct in all other families. The
articular and surangular are fused in several genera of Iguanide; and
there are but three bones in the ramus of Xantusia, which see. The

angular extends well anteriorly on the interior border of the jaw in this
order, but is differently developed on the inner and outer faces. The
Chameleonidze and Agamid again show their similarity in having this
element chiefly exposed on the interior side, while in other types the
exposure is external. The Meckelian groove is open in the Chamee-
leonide, Agamidz, and Varanidie, but is roofed over more or less com-
pletely in all other families,

The hyoid system is not connected with the skull except in Geckonide,
Eublepharidie, and Lepidophyma, so far as I have examined them.
Thus in Thecadactylus, Phyllodactylus, and Eublepharis the ceratohyal
is continuous with a cartilage which projects from the paroccipital
above the posterior part of the auditory meatus. In Lepidophyma the
free epibranchial is attached to the inferior lateral angle of the basioc-
cipital. In forty-two genera of other families enumerated below this
is not the case. In no genus have I discovered any connection with
the stapedial cartilages. The hyoid system in lizards consists of a
glossohyal which is continuous with a basihyal tract, a hypohyal
often continuous with the basihyal tract, a ceratohyal, a first cerato-
branchial, and a second ceratobranchial which is always continuous
with the basihyal tract. There may be in addition an epibranchial, which
belongs to the first ceratobranchial. In some genera there is a free
epibranchial, which may be then closely approximated to the ceratohyal
(Humeces, Oligosoma, Gerrhonotus), or to the second ceratobranchial
(Lacerta, Xantusia, Lepidophyma). The only constantly ossified ele-
ment is the first ceratobranchial. The genera and families differ in the
presence or absence of the second ceratobranchials and epibranchials,
and the proximity or separation of the former. In general the Varanide,
Anguide, Zonuride, Gerrhosauridie, Scincide, Lacertide, and Xantu-
slide have epibranchials, while the thick-tongued and most degraded
types are without them. In the Teiidze the hypobranchials are much
produced anteriorly beyond the bases of the ceratohyals, and there
are no second ceratobranchials. In Anguidz the hypobranchials are
also greatly produced forward, but carry the ceratohyals with them.
Ceratobranchials of the second pair are also wanting in Varanide,
Helodermide, Chameleonide, Anguide, Anniellide, and Rhineiira;
Phyllodactylus, Thecadactylus, and Gecko, among Geckoniwe; and Eger-
nia, and Gongylus in Seincide. Ceratohyals are wanting in Chameleon,
Anguis, Anniella, and Annulata generally. In both Agamide and
Iguanide the second ceratobranchials are separated from each other
in the depressed genera of terrestrial habits, and in close contact with
cach other in those of arboreal habits; but they are in close contact in
Callisaurus and Crotaphytus, both terrestrial genera. In Calotes,
Iguana, and Anolis they act as the rim on which the gular pouch or
fan is stretched. The characters of Saurian hyoids may be tabulated
as follows: Most of the genera referred to are figured in Plates III
to VI.

Vertebral column.—Except in the families of the Geckonidz and
Uroplatide, the vertebral centra are proceelous. In the families named
they are amphicelous. The zygosphen articulation is present in the
Teiide and the larger Iguanide, including a rudiment in Crotaphytus.
In smaller Iguanide (Sceloporus, Phrynosoma) and in Sauria generally
this kind of articulation is wanting. In a good many families the
caudal vertebre are divided by a transverse fissure or suture in front
of the middle, which often splits the base and sometimes the length of
the diapophysis. Such a structure is seen in Iguanide (Iguana, Sauro-
malus, Sceloporus, Dipsosaurus), Anolide, Anguide (Celestus), Teiide
(Tupinambis, Cnemidophorus), Lacertidee (Lacerta), and Scincide
(Gongylus, Humeces). In Dipsosaurus, Anolis, and Lacerta the neural
spines of the caudal vertebre are double; in the other genera named,
single. In Varanidee, Helodermidie, Gerrhonotus, Crotaphytus, and
Phrynosoma, the caudal centra are undivided, and the neural spines
are single. In Ophisaurus the centra are undivided and the neural
spines double. The centra are excessively thin in Ophisauwrus, so that
they break more readily than they disarticulate. There are two sacral
vertebree except in genera with the posterior limbs rudimental or
absent. In some of these, however, especially the degenerate genera
of the Anguide, the rudimental ilium is attached to two diapophyses
which join each other distally.

Intercentra are present in the cervical and caudal regions in the
latter, supporting the chevron bones. Besides the intercentra there
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 11

are inferior processes of the cervical centra in some forms, the hypapo-
physes of Owen. These have been confused with the intercentra by
Boulenger, and have been renamed catapophyses by Baur.'

The first dorsal vertebra is that one which is first connected with the
sternum bya hemapophysis. In genera with a well-developed sternum
the number of vertebre anterior to the first dorsal is eight, except in
the Varanus niloticus (Cuvier) and V. griseus, where it is nine. In the
extinct Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous period the cervical vertebre
are Stated by Owen to number seventeen.

The number of ribs attached to the sternum diminishes with the
reduction of the limbs, from the normal of four on each side to one, and
total disconnection. A common hemapophysis or “xiphoid rod” suc-
ceeds these on each side, which gives attachment to two separate haema-
pophyses for ribs. The common hemapophysis is a segmentation of
the anterior part of the fifth hemapophysis, and it is not distinct
in some genera, as, Sauromalus. In Heloderma the fifth hamapo-
physis has no sternal segment or connection, and the sixth is want-
ing. In Varanus the fourth, fifth, and sixth are wanting. In genera
with the two appendicular hemapophyses they are closely appressed
on the middle line in the majority of the genera, but in genera of
depressed form they are separated, often widely. They are separated
in Stenodactylus guttatus, in Phymaturus, Crotaphytus, and Sceloporus.
They are more widely separated in Dipsosaurus, and most widely in
Sauromalus and Phrynosoma. Cervical ribs are present in varying
numbers, and the posterior ones are generally quite elongate. In cer-
tain genera and families the ribs posterior to those attached to the
sternum have their heemapophyses fused on the middle line below, thus
constituting a series of abdominal ribs. In the IJguanid genus Scartis-
cus there are two such ribs. In the Anolide there are four and five
pairs; in the Polychroine Iguanidz there are seven to ten. In the
Chameleonidze and Geckonide there are several pairs. The ribs of
Lepidosternum are remarkable for the presence of a capitular process
which has no distinet capitular articulation.

Scapular arch.—The clavicle is present in all the families except the
Chameeleonide, and in certain genera with degenerate fore limbs. In
such genera it is the last portion of the scapular arch to remain, and it
is the only element present in Feylinia (Anelytropside). It is always
osseous. The form of its proximal extremity varies in the different
families. It is simple in the Nyctisaura, Uroplatoidea, Acrodonta,
Iguania, Diploglossa, and Thecaglossa, and expanded and generally
perforate in the other superfamilies where present, except in some
degenerate genera where it is simple (see Plate LI, fig. 2). In Trachy-
saurus and Cophias its proximal end is dilated, but not perforate. The
scapula varies in form from elongate to short and wide. It presents a

1Proceedings, U.S. National Museum, XVII, 1894, p. 351.
192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

proscapular process in many families and genera. It is present in
Iguania and Nyctisaura, in the last named often decurved and acumi-
nate, and in Lophura, in Acrodonta. It is present among Leptoglossa
in Onemidophorus, and in some Ameivie, while in other Ameive it is
wanting. It is wanting generally in Acrodonta, Diploglossa, Theca-
glossa, and Leptoglossa, but it is present in Celestus striatus. It is
wanting in Rhiptoglossa. The coracoid is extended anteriorly to the
sternum, and it is generally deeply emarginate on its anterior interior
border. These emarginations are closed by the procoracoid, which
extends to the middle line, and is only partially or not at all ossified.
There are two coracoid emarginations in most Iguania, exceptions being
the terrestrial genera Urocentrum, Sceloporus, and Phrynosoma, and
the Anolidxe. There are also two in Varanide and Teiide. The Aga-
mide generally have but one, but Uromastix is an exception. There
is but one in Anguidee and Scincide (two in Tiliqua), and none in Helo-
dermidz and Chameleonide.

The interclavicle is a very characteristic element in the Sauria.
It is wanting in Chameleonide and in some genera with fore limbs
rudimental or absent. It is a simple splint in Helodermide and some
degenerate genera. In other families it has a transverse limb on each
side, which may be anterior, producing the ‘“‘anchor-shaped” form, or
median, producing the “cruciform” type. It isanchor shaped in Acro-
donta, Iguania, and Thecaglossa, and cruciform in Diploglossa and
Leptoglossa. In Nyctisaura it is cruciform, with the lateral processes
wide at the base. The sternum is a broad subrhombie plate which
articulates by its anterolateral borders with the precoracoid and cora-
coid, and by its posterolateral borders with the ribs. In genera with
well-developed limbs its principal differences are seen in the nature of
its fontanelles when present. In the Agamidz there are two, and in
most Iguanide there is one. Exceptions are the genera Polychrus
Sauromalus, and Dipsosaurus, where there is no fontanelle. There is
none in the Anolid. In Teiide and Lacertide itis present, but in Scin-
cid it is mostly absent, exceptions being the North American species
of Eumeces. The fontanelle is wanting in Geckonide, Diploglossa,
Helodermatoidea, Thecaglossa, and Leptoglossa, with the exceptions
above noted. The single median fontanelle is frequently concealed by
the median limb of the interclavicle. It is nearly divided in some spe-
cies of Sceloporus. |

The pelvic arch.—It is characteristic of the Sauria that the ilium
is directed upward and posteriorly, and that the obturator foramina
are well developed. The latter are only separated from each other by
ligament or cartilage, which may sometimes contain some lime salt. It
is produced posterior to the ischia in a triangular process, and less
frequently into a similar one-in front of the pubic symphysis. The
pubic foramen is always present. The pectineal process is present

except in Geckonide, but it is rudimental in some forms, as Phrynosoma.

There is a tuber ischii in all of the genera which have come under my
observation except Varanus. In Heloderma and some other forms it is
small.

The anterior limb.—The humerus is much alike in all Sauria, Chame-
leon only presenting peculiarities. The proximal end is expanded
neariy in one plane, and the middle portion of the flattened extremity
forms the oval head. This is not distinctly isolated, except by the pres-
ence of articular surface, from the greater and lesser tuberosities which
occupy the angles of the expansion. The shaft betrays no twist. The
distal end is chiefly occupied by the condyles; but there are epicon-
dyles, of which the internal is the more prominent, except in Cha-
mceleon, where they are wanting. The condyles consist of an external
rib and a medio-internal roller, which is generally bounded at the
internal extremity by a tuberosity, which is, however, wanting in
Chameleon. The ulna articulates with the median roller, its external
edge being beveled by the external rib. The head of the radius articu-
lates with the external rib, having shifted from its primitive position
on the inner side. It results from this that in pronation the radius
crosses the ulna. There is a short olecranon, except in Chameleon.
The ulna and radius have about an equal share in the carpal articula-
tion, sometimes the ulna a little the greater.

The constitution of the carpus is very uniform in Sauria, with
‘developed anterior limbs, the principal diversity being displayed by
the Chamezleonid. In all, we have in the proximal row three distinet
elements—the radiale, intermedium, and ulnare (= pisiforme), the lat-
ter mainly external to the ulna and directed posteriorly. Distal to the
radiale and intermedium, and between them and the carpalia of the

NAT MUS 98—15
194 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.

second row, is a single small centrale. There are five carpalia, each
corresponding to a metacarpal. I have failed to find in any of the
genera at my disposal any of the carpalia fused together or wanting.
In Chameleon, on the contrary, Cuvier has shown that there is no
ulnare, and that the centrale and carpalia are fused into a single round
median piece, to which the metacarpals are articulated. In all the
normal Sauria the tendons of the flexors of the digits are combined
on the palm, and the point of junction is occupied by a large flat sesa-
moid bone. The number of phalanges is also remarkably uniform.
They number in each digit, commencing with the pollex, 2-3-4-5-3.
The sole exception in the genera with well-developed extremities is
Chameleon, where the numbers are 2-3-4-4-3. This genus differs also
from other forms in the shapes of the metacarpals. Normally they are
cylindric and subparallel in position and united in a common integu-
ment; but in Chameleon they are flattened, with expanded extremities,
and divided into two bundles by a fissure, three within and two with-
out, enabling the three inner digits to oppose the two outer round a
branch of a tree. The number of digits in Sauria is normally 5-5,
but reductions take place presenting variations from 4-5 to 1-1, the
posterior limb usually displaying a lesser degree of degeneracy than
the anterior, although not always.

Posterior linb.—The femur differs from the humerus in having a dis-
tinct head, which is marked off from a trochanter. The former is not
hemispherical as in Mammalia, but is somewhat compressed, and is
oval in section. The trochanter is on the inferior anterior side of the
head, or in the position of the little trochanter of the mammalian femur.
There is no great trochanter nor third trochanter. The condyles of the
femur are not as well defined as in the Mammalia, and the patellar
groove is represented by a shallow concavity without lateral ridges.
Patella none, with some exceptional rudiments, as, for example, in
Varanus. In Chameleon all the prominent features of the femur are
toned down, the trochanter being represented by aridge. The fibula
is more slender than the tibia, and is larger distally than proximally,
the reverse of what obtains in the tibia. The latter has no crest.

Like the carpus, the tarsus is very uniform in the Sauria, the sole
important modification being exhibited by the Chamieleonid. There
are two fused proximal elements, which are probably tibiale-intermedium
and fibulare. They are only distinct in Heloderma among North Amer-
ican genera, but a trace of the suture is seen in Varanus. In most
Sauria there is then but one bone of the proximal row, which is flat
and wider than long. No centrale, and but two tarsalia, the third and
fourth, the latter much the larger. The second metatarsal projects
alongside of t. iii, so as to approximate the tibiale; its head is figured
by Cuvier as a distinct bone, but he does not describe it as such. In
Chameleon there is a single proximal tarsal element, which is not flat-
tened as in other lizards, and this articulates with a single subglobular
CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 195

tarsale, from which the metatarsals radiate.'. The phalanges number,
like those of the anterior foot, 2-3-4-5-3, in ordinary Sauria, and
2-3-4-4-3 in Chameleonide.

2. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.

The alimentary canal in the Sauria is not very highly specialized into
distinct regions. There can always be distinguished stomach and
small and large intestines, the former by its muscular walls and the
intestines by their respectively different diameters. The stomach is
always simple, and is curved to the right at the pylorus, though in
some of the serpentiform genera the curve is very slight. The small
intestine forms a sigmoid which forms a loop cephalad just distad of
the liver. This sigmoid is rarely simple, but is generally plicated, fre-
quently highly so. The large intestine may or may not be distinguished
into colon and rectum. The latter is constricted off at its extremity
from a cloaca, which has common orifice with a short common genital
chamber immediately above it, into which enter the oviducts, usually
at the extremity of two papille.

The liver is not subdivided except at its distal border. Its form
differs in the different superfamilies and families, and it is more elon-
gate and originates further posterior to the heart in the serpentiform
genera in each. The gall-bladder is always situated at or within its
posterior border, and not at a distance from it. Spleen and pancreas
present.

3. CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.

The heart is not situated far posteriorly in any form, not even in the
serpentiform. There is sometimes a second anterior aorta bow in front
of the usual aorta root. A carotis communis issuing from the right
aorta root. Anterior abdominal vein joining the renalis revehens near
the posterior border of the liver, and forming with the portal vein the
posterior cava. This vein passes through the liver, receiving numer-
ous hepatic veins. Two anterior cardinals (jugulars) enter the sinus
venosus with the postericr cava.

4, RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.

The Sauria have two lungs, excepting the Annulati, which have but
one. These are situated behind and on each side of the alimentary
canal opposite to that portion which immediately follows the heart,
excepting in the Annulati, where the lung lies ventrad of the alimen-
tary canal for part of its length at least. Trachea with or without

'Cuvier (Ossemens Fossiles, ed. 1836, p. 98) describes a distinct tibiale and fibulare
in Chameleon, and figures them (pl. 245, fig.52). These are not represented by Bou-
lenger (Proc. Zool. Soc., London, 1891, p. 118). They are, in fact, not distinct tarsal
elements, but are the epiphyses of the tibia and fibula, such as exist also in Heloderma
and other genera, The tibiale and fibulare are fused into a single element as in
other Saurians.

bronchi, which, when present, are usually very short, but are elongate
in the Thecaglossa. Laryngeal cartilages only specialized as to the
terminal one which forms a pair of shell-like arytenoids, which bound
the rima glottidis.

5. UROGENITAL SYSTEM.

Testes single, situate well anterior to the cloaca. Ovaries occupying
a corresponding position. Oviducts transversely plicate when empty,
with nonplicate borders, and with fontanelle a little anterior to position
of ovaries; orifice into vagina small; vasa deferentia convolute, adher-
ent to kidneys. Kidneys posterior, symmetrical; ureters short. Uri-
nary bladder generally present, but rudimental in some and absent in
a few forms, as, for instance, the Teiide.

The male intromittent organ or hemipenis presents much variety of
structure, showing some parallels to the corresponding part in the
snakes. It is, however, rarely spinous, as is so generally the case in the
Ophidia, the only spinous forms being, so far as I have examined, the
American Diploglossine and genera allied to Cophias. The higher
Sauria have the apical parts modified as in the Ophidia by the pres-
ence of calyculi. Such are characteristic of the Rhiptoglossa and
Pachyglossa. The Nyctisaura possess the same feature. The Diplo-
glossa, Helodermatoidea, and Thecaglossa have the organ flounced, the
flounces often pocketed or repand on the margin. In the Leptoglossa
we have lamine only; in the Teiidse mostly transverse, and in the
Scincidz mostly longitudinal. In various genera terminal papille are
present. The organ may be simple or bifurcate, or merely bilobate. I
have not met with the case so common in Ophidia where the sulcus
spermaticus is bifurcate and the organ undivided.

The structures of the hemipenis have a constant systematic value.
As in the Ophidia, the value differs with the character, but it varies
from generic to superfamily.

6. TEGUMENTARY SYSTEM.

This includes the dermal, the mucous, and the serous structures. I
give attention to the serous or peritoneal membrane, which presents a
considerable variety of structure among the Sauria.

A fold suspends the alimentary canal from the median dorsal line forming the
dorsal mesentery. No other mesenteries bind the canal, except the stomach, and
sometimes an adjacent portion of the small intestines, which have other connections.
The liver, on the other hand, has several mesenteric connections, as follows: Its
ventral face has usually a single sheet connecting it with the median ventral line,
but in rare instances it is bifurcate posteriorly (Trachysaurus), or even double
(Tiliqua). This sheet, or one of them, is continued along to the anterior abdominal
artery to the ventral wall, and sometimes along the gall duct to the pyloric part of
the small intestine. Each border of the liver is concave above, in adaptation to the
lungs, in the types where they extend so far posteriorly, which is the usual arrange-
ment. The median portion of the liver is concave above, usually in adaptation to the
stomach. From the left-hand ridge thus produced a sheet or mesentery extends to
the stomach, forming the gastrohepatic mesentery. From the right-hand superior
angle a mesentery extends to the right dorsal body wall, forming the right hepatic

mesentery. The three mesenteries now described are the only ones which are
universally present which bind the liver. The following sheets are present in
various types: Generally the right hepatic and the gastrohepatic give off sheets
to the right and left lungs respectively, constituting the right hepatopulmonary and
gastropulmonary mesenteries. A sheet occasionally goes off from the gastrohepatic
to the left body wall, forming the left gastro-parietal mesentery. This is frequently
represented by a narrow band, and occasionally, as in Dipsosaurus, it joins the
small intestine just beyond the extremity of the gastrohepatic sheet. This is not
represented on the accompanying diagram. In Heloderma a distinct sheet extends
from the left border of the liver to the left body wall, forming the left lateral hepatic
mesentery. In Polychrus and Anolis the left lung, instead of being attached to the
gastrohepatic mesentery, is attached by a sheet to the left border of the liver, form-
ing the left hepatopulmonary mesentery. In Varanus salvator there is a short median
gastrohepatic sheet. In Varanus, owing to the anterior position of the lungs, they
have no hepatic or gastric connections. In no Saurian have I observed a right
hepatopulmonary sheet, as the right hepatic mesentery takes in the right lung in
its course. The latter extends along the apical strip of the right lobe of the liver

to the genital mesentery in many genera. In Tupinambis, Dracaena, and some others
the right hepatic extends as a strong sheet to the right body wall, forming, with an
equally strong gastroparietal of the left side, a kind of diaphragm. In many genera
the right hepatic sheet is connected with the stomach, especially at its proximal part.

Besides the hepatic and gastric mesenteries, there are those which inclose the
internal genitalia, the urinary bladder, and the corpora adiposa. The genital
mesentery is sometimes quite extensively free, and is always so anteriorly, espe-
cially where it supports the wide fontanelle of the oviduct. There is no mesentery
of the corpora adiposa, and a pouch only in those cases where those bodies project
freely into the abdominal cavity, as is frequently the case. The cystic mesentery
is a transverse fold of the peritoneum which lines the inferior wall of the pelvic
cavity, and which incloses the urinary bladder when it is present.

The integument of the Sauria is divided into scales of a great
variety of structure. Some of them are ossified, and in such cases are
traversed by canals (Scincide). Others are produced into acute apices,
which are ensheathed by a very hard epidermis, which becomes formi-

dable as a horny weapon. On the posterior part of the inferior face of
the thigh in many genera the scales of one or rarely two rows are
deeply fossate, and the foss are occupied by a waxy plug, which pro-
jects beyond the general level. The use of this substance is uncertain,
but it is probably an important aid to the animal in maintaining its
hold on smooth surfaces. Lizards which move on the ground rest
much on the thighs, which are not elevated above the ground in many
types, but serve as the principal point of contact from which they make
their leaps. The same is true of some genera which leap among trees
from branches and trunks. A similar secretion issues from the preanal
scales in some Iguanide (Liolaemus, ete.), and in an African Lacertid
a rudimental structure of this character is found on many of the abdom-
inal scales (Poroidogaster). An approximation to this structure I have
seen on the preanal scales of an adult male of Sceloporus horridus of
Mexico. Here the epidermis is greatly thickened above the middle
posterior part of the scale, so much so as to make a deep impression
in the true skin, simulating a true preanal “pore.” I suspect that
the nature of these structures is similar to that of corns in higher
Vertebrata.

When the tails of lizards are fractured a cartilaginous rod is devel.
oped from the centrum of the last vertebra remaining, on which muscles
and integument appear. The scales are not similar to those of the
normal tail, but resemble generally those of snakes, having a rhombic

shape. Sometimes, as in various Scincidee and Geckonide, a series of
