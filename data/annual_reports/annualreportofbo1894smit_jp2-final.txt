JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 24, 189

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (the Hon. M. W. Fuller), in the chair; the
Vice-President (the Hon, A. E. Stevenson), the Hon. J. S. Morrill, the
Hon. 8. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, the Hon. R. R. Hitt, Dr. James C.
Welling, Dr. James B. Angell, and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were read from Dr, William Preston
Johnston and the Hon. J. B. Henderson, on account of illness, and from
Dr. Henry Coppée, on account of pressing business engagements.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read in abstract the
minutes of the last meeting, which were approved.

The Secretary then announced the following changes in the Board
of Regents since the last meeting:

The term of Senator George Gray having expired, he was on March
20, 1893, reappointed Regent by the Vice-President.

Representative R. R. Hitt, who was on August 11, 1893, appointed
by the Speaker of the House of Representatives to fill the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Lodge, was on January 4, 1894,
reappointed. The terms of Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky,
and Wheeler, of Alabama, having expired, they also were reappointed
Regents by the Speaker on January 4, 1894.

The Secretary presented his annual report to the Board of Regents
for the year ending June 30, 1893, with a few remarks concerning the
increase in the activities of the Institution, during which he called
attention to its recent contributions to science, made in its Astro-
physical Observatory; and also to the present large number of cor-
respondents, of which there were nearly 24,000, scattered throughout
the whole globe.

On motion the report was accepted.

Dr. Welling, on behalf of his colleagues, presented the report of the

executive committee for the year ending June 30, 1893, explaining that
xI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

the committee had examined every account and found them in each
instance correct.

On motion the report was adopted.

Dr. Welling, in behalf of his colleagues, submitted a resolution rela-
tive to income and expenditures, placing the income of the Institution
in the hands of the Secretary for his administration, Dr. Welling
called the attention of the Regents to a change in the usual wording
of the resolution, by the omission of some words liable to an inter-
pretation which might tend to prejudicially limit the activities of the
Institution.

The resolution (which had been passed in nearly the form now
recommended during earlier years) had since 1888 been framed in the
following words:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, ——, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the
Secretary with the advice of the executive committee upon the basis of the opera-
tions described in the last annual report of said committee, with full discrétion on
the part of the Secretary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of
the heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

This language was a departure from the form previously in use, and
for the reasons stated (among which were that the words ‘upon the
basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said com-
mittee” might seem to restrict the Secretary in the discharge of his
scientific trusts) the committee offered the following resolution, the
propriety of which must be apparent:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895,
be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary,
with the advice of the executive committee, with sull discretion on the part of the
Secretary as to items.

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted.

A modification of the act of Congress organizing the Institution, with
special reference to the constitution of the Establishment, was discussed
at some length in connection with bills introduced in the Senate bear-
ing upon the subject by Senators Morrill and Cullom.

The Secretary stated that his attention had been called to the fact
that a gentleman, a resident of Washington, Mr. Robert Stanton Avery,
intended to make the Smithsonian Institution his residuary legatee,
and had prepared the form of a will, which was submitted.

The Secretary had satisfied himself that Mr. Avery had had this
purpose before him for years, and that the will of which he had just
spoken was not an embodiment of any lately entertained or suddenly
conceived idea, but the expression of a long-matured purpose. He
further stated that Mr. Avery was desirous of knowing whether the
Regents were likely to aecept his bequest.

After some discussion the matter was, on motion of Mr. Breckinridge,
referred to the executive committee with instructions to write to Mr.
Avery acknowledging the receipt of the proposed will, thanking him
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

for it, declaring that the Board will accept, and expressing its appreci-
ation.

The Secretary recalled the attention of the Board to the fact that at
the last meeting he had stated that he had been informally advised by
Dr. Chambers, the executor of Mr. Hodgkinys’s estate, that the latter
had placed in the hands of a New York trust company certain bonds to
be contributed after Mr. Hodgkins’s death to the unrestricted portion
of his donation to the institution; and that the Regents, with this
understanding, had authorized the Secretary to add to this certain
accrued interest and to deposit the same with the other funds of the
institution in the Treasury, making the Hodgkins donation thus placed
in the Treasury $250,000, of which the income of $100,000 was for the
special purpose of the increase and diffusion of knowledge respecting
the properties of atmospheric air as beneficial to man, and $150,000
without restriction.

The Secretary had to state that, while he had received the bonds, he
had not thought himself justified in making this deposit in the Treas-
ury without further instructions from the Regents; and for this reason,
that it appeared that the executor had been misinformed as to the con-
ditions under which they were left, for when the Secretary was called
upon by the trust company to actually receipt for the bonds it was
found that Mr. Hodgkins had given them to form a portion not of the
unrestricted, but of the restricted part of his gift.

The Secretary read a communication from the surrogate of the court
of Suffolk County, N. Y., giving a statement of the condition of the
Hodgkins property, and he read also a statement submitted by the
executor concerning the residuary estate, and he asked instructions of
the Regents as to whether, under existing circumstances, he should
deposit the amounts referred to in the Treasury, or should continue to
hold the bonds, or whether he should take other action.

After some further discussion, Dr. Angell read the following resolu-
tions:

Resolved, That the executive committee and the Secretary are hereby constituted
a permanent committee, with authority to accept for the Institution any property,
real, personal, or mixed, that may be given to it for its purposes, ‘‘the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men,” with power to sell or to convert such property,
and to invest the proceeds in such manner as may appear to them for the interests
of the Institution: Provided, That no deposit be made of such proceeds with the per-
manent fund in the United States Treasury other than by special resolution of the
Regents.

Resolved, That the income derived from the property administered by the com-
mittee constituted by the preceding resolution be appropriated for the service of
the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary under the conditions of the resolu-
tion relative to income and expenditures adopted by the Board of Regents.

Resolved, That the Secretary is authorized to deposit in the United States Treas-
ury, at 6 per cent interest, under the terms of section 5591 of Title Lxxiim of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, such sums of money as may be placed unre-
strictedly at the disposition of the Institution not exceeding $97,000.

On motion of Senator Gray the resolutions were adopted.
XIV. JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary said that he had hoped that Congress would pass an
act providing for the erection of a statue of his eminent predecessor,
Secretary Baird, as it had done in the case of Secretary Henry. Efforts
in this direction in the past had, however, failed, but though he had
foregone neither the hope nor the intention, the present time was evi-
dently not opportune to secure such legislation. There was now no
altogether satisfactory likeness of Secretary Baird. The Secretary
desired to submit to the Board of Regents the propriety of authorizing
the execution of an oil portrait of the late Secretary, which, as in the
case of the one of Secretary Henry, might be placed in the Regents’
Room in perpetual remembrance of him.

Senator Morrill then read the following resolution, which was adopted :

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to have a life-size portrait of the late
Secretary of the Institution (Spencer F. Baird) painted by some competent artist,
which, when finished, may be preserved in the room occupied by the Regents for
their meetings.

The Secretary then stated to the Board that, under its resolution to
provide a new seal for the Institution, he had consulted Mr, Augustus
St. Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, who had taken interest in the mat-
ter, giving his personal supervision to the preparation and arrangement
of the lettering. [The Secretary here exhibited an impression of a
seal executed from Mr. St. Gaudens’s design.| Mr. St. Gaudens had,
when asked to render a bill, replied that he did not desire to submit an
account. The Secretary therefore thought that some action of the
Regents would be appropriate.

Senator Gray submitted the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to convey, in fitting terms, the thanks of
the Board of Regents to Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens for his design for a new seal for
the Institution.

On motion the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary brought to the attention of the Board of Regents the
fact that the late Chinese minister had presented to it an ancient and
specially rare bronze vase, the receipt of which had been noted only by
the ordinary form of acknowledgment at the time, and he therefore
thought that the Regents might like to authorize him to give, even at
this late day, some more formal expression of their thanks.

Thereupon Mr. Gray submitted the following resolution:

Resolyed, That the Secretary is requested to convey, in fitting terms, the thanks of
the Board of Regents to his excellency Chang Yen Hoon, member of the ministry of
the Tsung Li Yamen, for the gift of a valuable ancient vase, presented by him to the
Smithsonian Institution (in June, 1889),

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1894, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary, or, in his absence, of the
Acting Secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bonds approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30,
1894, including the work placed by Congress under its supervision in
the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory.

In the body of the report I have given briefly a general account of
the affairs of the Institution and of its bureaus for the year, reserving
for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports from the
officers in charge of the different branches of work.

The full report upon the National Museum by the assistant secre-
tary, Dr. G. Brown Goode, occupies a separate volume. (Report of
the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, 1894.)

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress, approved by the President March 4, 1894, section
5579 of the Revised Statutes was amended to read as follows:

heads of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an establish-
ment by the name of the Smithsonian Institution for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men, and by that name shall be known and
have perpetual succession with the powers, limitations, and restrictions
hereinafter contained, and no other.

As now organized the Smithsonian Establishment consists of the
following ex officio members:

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 24, 1894, at 10
o'clock a.m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in- the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

There has been no change in the personnel of the Board during the
year, the Regents whose terms have expired -having been reappointed,
as follows:

Dr. Andrew D. White, reappointed by joint resolution of Congress
approved by the President, March 19, 1594.

The Honorable Joseph Wheeler, the Honorable W. ©. P. Breckin-
ridge, and the Honorable Robert R. Hitt, reappointed by the Speaker
of the House of Representatives on January 4, 1894.

ADMINISTRATION.

I desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last report
that Congress be asked to make an appropriation to cover the expenses
incurred by the Institution incident to the administration of its Gov-
ernment trusts. These expenses are not specifically provided for by
any of the present appropriations, since they belong not singly to the
National Museum, or to the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the Inter-
national Exchange Service, or the like, but to expenditures common to
all of them, and which are not arranged for by the terms of the appro-
priations for any one. I repeat that, in the words of a previous report,
it is in the interests of economy that this expenditure should be met
from some common source, owing to the limited size of the establish-
ments in question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions
than to bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of
$17,000 for international exchanges, or an appropriation of $10,000 for
an observatory, can not each so well bear the separate provision of a
disbursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employees, as in
the case of larger bureaus, but that their limited needs can be better and
more economically managed by not duplicating such offices. There is,
however, no practicable way of arranging this in compliance with the
present terms of the appropriations, which may be said to tacitly assume
that each of these bureaus or divisions is thus completely provided for.
It is in some cases impossible that it should be so without the expend-
iture of greatly more than the appropriated sum, and the terms of the
appropriations should, in the interest of economy, either recognize the
propriety of meeting each bureau’s share of these common expenses out
of each one’s appropriation or else out of a special appropriation made
in their common interest.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, as
follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000.

Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of
the purposes thereof.

The above specified permanent fund is deposited, under section 5591,
of the Revised Statutes, modified as above noted, in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1893, the unexpended
balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report
for last year, was $57,092.82. Interest on the permanent fund, amount-
ing to $54,180, was received during the year, which, together with a
sum of $7,787.06, received from the sale of publications and from mis-
cellaneous sources, and $8,000 received as a portion of the residuary
legacy from the estate of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, made the total
receipts $69,967.06.

The entire expenditures during the year, including the $8,000 men-
tioned above, which was added to the permanent fund, amounted to
$67,461.38, for the details of which reference is made to the report of
the executive committee. On June 30, 1894, the balance in the Treas-
ury of the United States to the credit of the Secretary for the expenses
of the Institution was $59,598.50, which includes the sum of $10,000
referred to in previous reports, $5,000 received from the estate of Dr. J.
H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter
a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote certain physical
researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s consent, deposited
by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the Institution.

The Regents also hold the sum of $42,000, received upon the death
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, in approved railroad bonds, and forming
a part of the fund established by him for investigations, ete., of the
properties of atmospheric air.

This balance also includes the interest accummulated on the Hodg-
kins donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations,
and interest on the Hamilton fund, besides relatively considerable sums
held to meet obligations which may be expected to mature as the result
of different scientific investigations or publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 1893-94, of the following appropriations:

All vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October
2,1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury,
were as follows:

BUILDINGS.

The crowding of objects, belonging to the nation, in the halls of the
Institution and the Museum building, and in their workrooms, which
should be devoted to other purposes, has already been spoken of by me in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

previous reports. This condition, which seems to have almost reached
a limit of evil from the impossibility of further storage of such objects,
was brought to the especial attention of the last Congress, when it
became necessary to vacate the storage rooms occupied by the National
Museum in the old Armory building on account of intended changes
authorized by Congress for the benefit of the Fish Commission.

At this time a small building in the city several squares distant was
rented, under authority from Congress, for the storage of the materials,
and for the workshops removed from the Armory building, but this made
no provision for che articles returned from the Chicago Exposition.

At the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Institution,
which has been made by Congress the depository of all such objects,
felt obliged to resume the care of an immense collection of plants, con-
stituting the National Herbarium, which had previously been placed by
the Institution in the charge of that Department, and which it had now,
in fact, no room for. The collection was stored, under the charge of
the Department of Agriculture, in a building which was not fireproof,
and this fact was stated by the Department as influencing it in its
request that the Institution should resume charge of them, but the Insti-
tution itself has no place to put them, except in sheds more insecure than
those from which they came. It is true that room has been made for
them within the fireproof portion of the building, but only by the
transfer of a large mass of other objects to the wooden sheds, which
are in a condition of extreme danger. I can give a no more definite
idea of the alarming condition here than by saying thatit is such that
no insurance company would place risks on the sheds except at very
high rates.

The congestion in question has compelled the use not only of rooms
belonging -to the Museum building proper, for the accommodation of
objects like those which came from the Chicago Exposition, but of
those of the Institution intended for other purposes, such as the
“‘Chapel,” whose lofty vaulted roof was made firepoof by Congress
three years ago with quite another destination than the actual use
which necessity has imposed for the time.

It seems almost superfluous, after what has just been said, for me to
recall.in other terms the need of more adequate accommodations for the
national collections, but I may again refer to what has been set forth
at length on this subject in my previous reports, more especially in
that for 1892.

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

In the contemplation of the first architect, the Smithsonian building
was intended to produce the effect of a Norman castle, and its tall
towers, narrow embrasures, and like features do attain, if not archie-
ological correctness, at any rate a certain admitted attractiveness of
exterior. This has been reached, however, as is well known, not only
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

at a disproportionate outlay of money from the limited Smithsonian
fund (which was here, in fact, expended largely for the benefit of the
city in furnishing it with such a picturesque building), but at a cost of
an amount of permanent discomfort to the inmates which those who
are not there employed can hardly appreciate.

In particular, the narrow windows and the small diamond panes of
glass admit so little light that in winter days some of the rooms where
clerical work is carried on, need to be artificially lighted, and in all
cases the occupants Jose the advantage of what ought to be abundant
light, considering their open surroundings in the middle of a park. I
think it well to state that while I should have made many more changes
in the interest of the comfort and health of the clerical occupants of the
building if I had had the means to do so, I have never felt at liberty
to alter the external appearance of the building when alteration
could possibly be avoided, and I have therefore never authorized the
enlargement of any of the apertures in the stone work, or made any
changes of this kind which could be understood as modifying the
structural features (except in improving the sanitary conditions of the
basement), and when any change is mentioned here it will always be
understood that it is essentially the work of the carpenter in providing
for larger inside frames and larger lights in the sashes, and in like
alterations.

Thus in the east wing of the building, in the fourth story, a room
for containing the archives of the Institution has been provided, which
is well lighted by one of the few large windows the building possesses,
and which has been fitted for more convenient reference to the records
of the Institution. The second floor has been made brighter by
repainting and by some additional floor lights in the third floor, and
the windows in the room especially set apart for the safe-keeping of
the engravings and books of art belonging to the Institution have been
thus enlarged, while some of the rooms on the second floor have been
improved by slight alterations in the window frames. On the first
floor additional quarters were provided for the library in the rooms
which were vacated by the transfer of the exchange department to the
lower floor.

I have been enabled to make the above small changes at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund, but a restrictive clause contained in the
appropriation act of August 50, 1890, for repairs to the Smithsonian
Institution, having been removed by a clause in the sundry eivil act
for the year ending June 30, 1894, I have, with a portion of the unex-
pended amount of this appropriation, been also able to transform a suite
of dark and damp rooms in the basement on the south side into well-
lighted and comfortable, though too limited offices, in which every
attention has been paid to sanitation. The exchange bureau continues
to occupy these, but they were barely sufficient at first, and, through
the constant increase of the demand of the Government service, addi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fl

tional room for these exchanges will soon be called for, while the stor-
age facilities of the Institution are now otherwise severely taxed.

RESEARCH.

As I have elsewhere remarked, it appears to be an essential portion
of the original scheme of the government of the Institution that its
Secretary should be expected to advance knowledge, whether in letters
or in science, by personal research; and resolutions of the Regents
formally request the Secretary to contirue his investigations in physi-
cal science, and to present their results for publication in the Smith-
sonian * Contributions.”

The advancement of science through original research at the hands
of those eminent men, Henry and Baird, the former Secretaries of this
Institution, is known to all, but though the Secretary may be still
expected to personally contribute to the advancement of science, or art,
or letters, by his individual efforts, it is certain that the increasing
demands of time for labors of administration had greatly limited the
possibility of this, even in the time of Henry, and that at the present
day administrative duties, and especially those connected with the care
of Government interests, constitute a barrier to such investigations,
which is all but impassable.

1 have, however, given such limited time as could be spared from
administrative duties largely to the continuation of the researches
upon the solar spectrum mentioned in my last report. This work, car-
ried on in the Astro-physical Observatory, is believed to be of more than
common importance, aud is referred to at more length in connection with
the observatory report of this year.

The investigations, referred to in previous reports, upon aerody-
namics have been continued intermittently. They are not complete,
but they appear to point to conclusions of general and unusual interest.

Mention may also be made here of a grant of $50in December, 1893,
to the director of the Lick Observatory, Prof. EK. 8. Holden, for experi-
ments in solar photography, and of a grant of a like amount in May,
1894, to Dr. A. G. Webster, of Clark University, for certain researches
in the velocity of electrodynamic disturbances in wires.

Mr. W. A. Eddy was likewise aided to the amount of $50 in certain
experiments in the study of the electrical and other conditions of the
upper atmosphere by means of kites.

Investigations aided by the Hodgkins fund, and special researches
carried on in the Astro-physical Observatory are mentioned on another
page.

The researches referred to above are connected altogether with the
physical sciences, since aid to original research in the biological sciences
has been largely, though indirectly, provided through the Institution’s
connection with the National Museum and otherwise.

The subscription has been continued for twenty copies of the Astro-
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

nomical Journal as a slight aid to its publication, the separate numbers
of the journal being sent regularly to foreign libraries and observatories
as exchanges of the Institution.

EXPLORATIONS.

The explorations of the Institution during the year have been ear-
ried on chiefly through the National Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology. Natural history and ethnological explorations and studies were
made in Kashmir, India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands, by Dr.
William L. Abbott; by Professor Cook, in Liberia; by Consul-General
Crawford, in Finland, and by other collaborators of the Institution in
Central and South America and the West Indies, resulting in very
valuable additions to the Museum collection. In New Mexico and Ari-
zona, as also in several localities in the Eastern States, archeological
explorations by the Bureau of Ethnology have added much to our
knowledge of the habits and customs of the aborigines. The San Juan
Valley and the Canyon de Chelly were found to be rich in remains of
ancient American structures, indicating a numerous population. Some
of the aboriginal songs of the Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians
were preserved with the aid of the graphophone. I have on other
pages reviewed some of these explorations more in detail.

A brief abstract of Mr. Rockhill’s explorations in Mongolia and
Tibet, in 1891 and 1892, made partly under the auspices of the Insti-
tution, was published in the Annual Report for 1892. The detailed
diary of his journey is now in the hands of the printer, and will form
an octavo volume of about 400 pages, with numerous illustrations.
This book is believed to be of particular interest at the present time.

PUBLICATIONS.

One of the most important functions of the Institution is the diffu-
sion of knowledge by means of publications, and in this branch of
work the past year has been an active one. Since my last report there
have been published by the Smithsonian and its bureaus twelve vol-
umes and eighty-two pamphlets or parts of volumes, aggregating
5,854 printed pages, covering practically every branch of natural and
physical science.

The publieations of the Institution itself include three principal
series—Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections,
and the Annual Reports. The first two are printed at the expense of
the Smithsonian fund, while the reports are Government documents.

Contributions to Knowledge.—The Contributions to Knowledge are in
quarto form, and are the most important of the series. They include
only memoirs of extended original investigations and researches,
advancing what are believed to be new truths, and constituting, there-
fore, positive additions to human knowledge. ‘Twenty-seven volumes
of these have been completed since the Institution was founded,
including 125 memoirs pertaining to all branches of knowledge.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

It is the present practice to publish occasionally memoirs from the
Contributions in separate form, to be afterwards combined in a volume
when enough have been completed. Only one such memoir of Contri-
butions has been prepared during the year, which is a communication
by the Secretary under the title of The Internal Work of the Wind.

A volume of the Contributions is now passing through the press, and,
though its full description belongs more properly to a later report, it
may be stated here that its subject is oceanic ichthyology, that it is
prepared by Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, and that
the work, which will be a joint publication of the Institution and the
National Museum, is an exhaustive dissertation on the fishes of the
ocean depths and particularly those of the North Atlantic Basin.

As another memoir of Contributions, [ had hoped to complete the
publication of the photograpbic volume on the moon, to which I have
called attention in previous reports, but the science of photography
has not yet progressed sufficiently to meet the requirements of the
work.

Other memoirs are in preparation, to which attention will be called
in my next report.

Miscellaneous Collections.—The Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions is an octavo series intended to include works of scientific value,
but of less original importance than the Contributions to Knowledge.

Thirty-five complete volumes of Collections have been issued since
the Institution was founded, and four additional volumes are now in
preparation, parts of volumes 35 to 38 having already been published.

Volume xxxv of the Collections wiil include the Smithsonian Mete-
orological, Geographical, and Physical Tables. These tables are
intended to replace in modernized form and with newer knowledge the
Guyot Meteorological and Physical Tables, first published in 1852, and
which has since been a standard work of reference for investigators.
The first part of the volume, the Meteorological Tables, was published
last year. The Geographical Tables, prepared by Professor Woodward,
have been put in type during this year, but not yet issued; these tables
make a volume of 288 pages. The Physical Tables are now being pre-
pared by Prof. Thomas Gray, and may be expected to be completed in
1895.

Volume XXXVI is a single work, a very comprehensive Select Bibli-
ography of Chemistry, covering tbe four hundred years from 1492
to 1892, prepared by Dr. H. Carrington Bolton. This volume was pub-
lished in 1893, but the first edition was soon exhausted, and it became
necessary to issue a second edition during the present year.

There is now in progress the preparation of a supplement to this
Bibliography of Chemistry, to mclude titles of works down to 1895, as
well as some additions to the first volume. It is expected that the
supplement will number about 5,000 titles.

This bibliography actually aims to include everything that is of
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

importance in the literature of chemistry, the word “Select” being
only added as an indication that the work does not profess absolute
completeness. It represents the labors of a lifetime on the part of a
most industrious student of the bibliography of chemistry, and is a
work of reference of such value that is is believed it will be a necessity
to every chemical investigator.

Volume xxxvit of the Collections is a very complete Index to the
genera and species of the Foraminifera, by Prof. C. Davies Sherborn, of
London. The technical character of this work has rendered prompt
publication impracticable. The first part of the volume, ‘¢‘A to non,”
was issued during the year, and the second part is in progress.

Volume xxxyitt of the Collections is also in progress and consists
of several short papers, including ‘* Principles and method of classifi-
cation of varieties of the human species ;” “ Bibliography of Aceto-Acetic
Ester ;” ‘Indexes to literatures of Cerium and Lanthanum,” and “ Index
to literature of Didymium.” These indexes to chemical literature are
published in continuation of the series begun some years ago under the
recommendation of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.

A special octavo volume, now in press, consists of the Diary of a
Journey through Mongolia and Tibet, by Mr. W. W. Rockhill. This
expedition was carried on in part under the auspices of the Institu-
tion, and the diary is, in the main, a description of the characteristic
geographical and ethnological features of those countries, so seldom
visited by Europeans. <A large map, on a scale of 32 miles to the inch,
shows the route traversed by Mr. Rockhill, and is in itself a valuable
contribution to our knowledge of the region.

Following the usual custom, the several papers comprised in the
general appendix of the annual report have been issued separately
in pamphlet form; about sixty of these pamphlets were issued dur-
ing this year, as enumerated in the editor’s report.

Smithsonian annual reports—The delayed annual reports of the
Institution for the years 1891 and 1892 have been received and distrib-
uted, as also the annual reports of the United States National Museum
for those years.

The Secretary’s report for 1893 was issued in January in pamphlet
form. The manuscript of the general appendix to the report of the
Institution for 1893 was sent to the printer on March 31, and the entire
volume was stereotyped and press work in progress early in June,
thus bringing the work up to date, and avoiding the tedious delays
of previous years.

Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology.—The ninth and the tenth annual
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Institution
have both been received during the year. These volumes fully main-
tain the character established for the series, and are gradually bringing
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

up the arrearageof the work. The eleventh and twelfth annual reports
are in the hands of the printer and will soon be completed. Several
papers in the Bulletin series were issued during the year.

Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum.—The publications
of the Museum are mentioned on another page under the general head
of “The National Museum.”

LIBRARY.

In my report for 1887-88 I detailed a plan for increasing the library
by exchanges. Lists of periodicals were secured from the British
Museum, several universities, and a great number of leading special-
ists, and these lists were carefully revised in the former year and corre-
spondence then entered upon with each society and journal represented
on them. This work has now been completed, after nearly seven years
of labor. Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written, resulting in the
addition of 1,853 new periodicals to the list of those received, and entire
or partial completion of 1,042 defective series. It is already ‘time to
recommence this labor, which ought to be never ending if the periodi-
cal collections of the Institution are to continue to be what they are
believed to be to-day—the completest in the world. Accordingly it is
my intention to have new lists prepared and to continue this special
feature of the work of adding to the library by exchange during the
coming year.

Through the provision of new quarters for the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges I have been enabled to assign two additional rooms
for the use of the library, the one for a collection of books required for
reference, and the other as an office for the librarian, to the very great
advantage of the service. A room has also been set apart tor the
collection of prints belonging to the Institution.

The reading room of the Institution is no longer adequate for the
large collection of scientific periodicals received and for the persons
desiring to consult them. As it isnot possible to assign any additional
room for the library at present, I am considering a plan for some modi-
fications in the present reading room which will render it more suitable
to its purpose.

The total number of publications of every kind received during the
past pear reached 39,826, an increase of nearly 9,000 over the previous
year.

THE HODGKINS FUND.

The many responses to the large number of circulars announcing
the terms of the Hodgkins competition, and the numerous requests
for further information, have shown that a widespread interest in the
subject has been awakened. In February, 1894, a second edition of the
circulars announcing the prizes became necessary, which was issued
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in English, French, and German, and widely distributed. In answer
to numerous inquiries the following supplementary circular, descriptive
of the general character and work of the Institution, and making
mention of the Hodgkins fund, was also prepared and translated into
French and German, and through the courtesy of the Department of
State a number of copies were sent to several of the American
embassies in Europe for their general use, in answering questions
concerning the Smithsonian Institution:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, ———,189 .

Str: In answer to your inquiry [ am authorized to furnish the fol-
lowing information:

The SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION was originally constituted by an Act
of the National Legislature, to administer a bequest made to the Goy-
ernment of the United States in the early years of the present century.
The purpose of the bequest was declared to be ‘‘ The increase and dif:
fusion of knowledge among men,” and its acceptance by the nation is
the only instance of such an action in its history. The Institution,
then, occupies a peculiar relation to the Government. It is composed
as follows:

MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

PRESIDING OFFICER (ex-officio): The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

Chancellor: The Chief Justice of the United States.

The Vice-President of the United States.

The Secretary of Staie.

The Secretary ot the Treasury.

The Secretary ot War.

The Secretary of the Navy.

The Postmaster-General.

The Attorney-General.

The Secretary of the Interior.

The Secretary of Agriculture.

The high functionaries above mentioned are its members ex officio,
with the exception of the chancellor, who is elected. The law also cre-
ates a secretary of the above body, whom it calls “the Secretary of the
Institution.”

ADMINISTRATION.

The law further directs that the business of the Institution shall be
managed by a Board of Regents, composed of the Vice-President and
the Chief Justice of the United States, three Senators, three members of
the House of Representatives, and six other eminent persons nominated
by a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The Secretary of the Institution is also the Secretary of the Board of
Regents and their principal executive officer. His duties in this regard
are analogous to those of a Director. All correspondence should be
addressed to him.

It will be observed that the immediate and primary object of the
Smithsonian Institution, as above constituted, is to administer a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. il

certain fund, of which the United States has accepted the custody, for
the especial purpose of ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men,” so that its purpose in its most general sense is not limited
to the people of the United States of America, but extends to all man-
kind. This has been interpreted as indicating such a direction of the
activities of the Institution as shall result—

(1) In the increase of knowledge by original investigation and
study, either in science or literature.

(2) In the diffusion of this knowledge by publication, not only
through the United States, but everywhere, and especially by promot-
ing an imterchange of thought among those prominent in learning
among all nations, through its correspondents. These embrace insti-
tutions or societies conspicuous in art, science, or literature throughout
the world.

Its publications are in three principalissues, namely: The ‘Contribu-
tions to Knowledge,” the ‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” and the “Annual
Report.” Numerous works are published annually by it, under one of
these forms, and distributed to its principal correspondents, while
there is also published, at the expense of the Government, an edition
of the Report of the Board of Regents, containing an account of the
operations of the Institution during each year, which is distributed
throughout the country by the Congress.

The Institution has been authorized by law to deposit its original
fund in the Treasury of the United States, and it has further been
authorized to accept certain special bequests made by individuals,
where these have been such as to promote its general purpose, ‘‘The
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” Thus, for example,
the Institution has accepted and administered a fund which, under the
name of the donor, is called “‘The Hodgkins fund,” and which is given
for the especial purpose of “The increase and diffusion of more exact
knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric air
in connection with the welfare of man;” this fund is also deposited in
the Treasury of the United States. Other donations have been
received and are administered for other specific purposes.

The seat of the Institution is at Washington, but its activities reach
throughout the world in various ways, and principally through the
system of correspondence already referred to. The present number
of correspondents is about 24,000, and by means of this system the
Institution not only gives, but receives, communications from men of
learning in all countries.

In this and other ways it has gathered at Washington a special
library of books bearing upon the history of arts, sciences, discoveries,
and inventions.. The library now includes 300,000 titles, the greater
proportion of which is by permission of Congress deposited in the same
building and accessible with the National Library.

Besides the above activities, which are carried on with the special
fund already referred to, of which the nation has consented to act as
the guardian, there are certain bureaus or divisions of the Government
which the legislature has placed in its especial charge, and for the cost
of which Congress has, at different times, made special appropriations.
In this way it has placed under the charge of the Institution the
United States National Museum, the Bureau of International Exchanges,
the Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory. These also are administered by the Secretary,

under the direction of the Board of Regents. The present Secretary
of the Institution is S. P. Langley, to whom all communications should
be addressed, at Washington.*

In spite of the persistent effort to reach all who might be interested,
or who might wish to contribute to the competition, it was found that
in so wide a distribution the circulars had, in various instances, failed
to reach those for whom they were intended. This fact led to the
extension of the competition from July 1 to December 31, 1594. A
circular letter announcing this change of date, and offering to return,
at the expense of the Institution, papers which had been already sub-
mitted, was issued in June, 1894, and mailed to all competitors, besides

Monsieur: J’ai eu Vhonneur de recevoir votre lettre et je suis autorisé & vous donner les renseigne-
ments qui suivent:

L’ Institut SMITHSONIEN a été, & Vorigine, créé par une loi du Parlement Fédéral dans le but de gérer
un legs fait au Gouvernement des Etats-Unis dans les premié¢res années de ce siécle. L’objet du legs,
apres la déclaration qui en était faite, était ‘le développement et la propagation du savoir parmiles
hommes,” et lorsque la Nation Paccepta, elle donna le seul exemple de ce genre qui se puisse trouver
dans son histoire. Les relations de Institut avec le Gouvernement sont done d'une nature toute
spéciale.

Tl est constitué de la fagcn suivante:

MEMBRES DE L’INSTITUT.

Chancelier: Le Président de la Cour Supréme des Etats-Unis.

Le Vice-Président des Etats-Unis.

Le Secrétaire d’ Etat.

Le Secrétaire du Trésor.

Le Secrétaire de la Guerre.

Le Secrétaire de la Marine.

Le Ministre des Postes.

Le Ministre de la Justice.

Le Secrétaire de I’ Intérieur.

Les mae fonctionnaires susnommeés sont membres d’office de Institut, & exception du Chanceller
qui est élu.

La loi pourvoit l'Institut d’un Secrétaire Perpétuel; ilale titre de ‘Secretary of the Institution.”
ADMINISTRATION.

La loi dispose en outre que les affaires de l'Institut seront gérées par un Conseil d’ Administration
dont font partie le Vice-Président des Etats-Unis, le Président de la Cour Supréme, trois Sénateurs,
trois membres de la Chambre des Députés, et six autres personnes éminentes, nommées par un ordre
du jour voté conjointement par les deux Chambres.

Le Secrétaire Perpétuel de l'Institut est également Secrétaire du Conseil d’Administration, dont il
est le principal représentant exécutif. Ses fonctions a cet égard_ sont analogues a celles de
Directeur-Général. C'est & lui que doit étre adressée toute la correspondance. .

Comme on le voit, Vobjet immédiat de Institut Smithsonien, constitué ainsi qu'il vient d’étre
dit, est de gérer un certain fonds dont les Etats-Unis ont accepté la garde et qui doit étre spécialement
appliqué ‘tau développement et a la propagation du savoir parmi les hommes,”’ de sorte que cette
destination, prise dans son sens le plus général, n'est pas réduite au public des Etats-Unis mais
s’étend au monde entier.

L’interprétation qui lui a été donnée est que l Institut doit poursuivre ses efforts dans telle direction
qui produirait comme résultat:

1. Le développement des connaissances humaines, soit dans les sciences ou dans les lettres, par des
travaux originaux de recherches et d’études.

2. La propagation de ‘ces connaissances par des publications répandues non seulement dans les
Etats-Unis, mais en tous lieux, et surtout en encourageant parmi les savants de marque dans toutes
les nations, un échange intellectuel, par ’intermédiaire de ses correspondants qui se comptent parmi
les institutions ou socictés principales dans les arts, les sciences ou les lettres, dans le monde.

Ses publications affectent trois formes principales, & savoir: ‘‘The Contributions to Knowledge”
(Les Apports an Savoir), les ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections’ (Collections Variées) et 1’ ‘Annual Report”
(le Compte Rendu Annuel). Sous unedeces trois formes, l'Institut publie chaque année de nombreux
ouvrages qu’il distribue a ses principaux correspondants. Cependant, une édition du Rapport du
Conseil d’ Administration, donnant un compte rendu des opérations de l'Institut dans le courant de
chaque année, est aussi publiée aux frais du Gouvernement et répandue dans le pays par les soins du
Congres.

L'Institut a regu de la loi l'‘autorisation de déposer le fonds originel au Trésor des Etats-Unis et il
a été en outre autorisé 4 accepter certains legs spéciaux, faits par des personnes privées, lorsque ces

country and Kurope.*

Up to June 30, 1894, 259 memoirs, printed and manuscript, have been
received in connection with the competition, representing correspond-
ents in the United States, Mexico, England, Scotland, Norway, Den-
mark, Russia (including Finland), France, Belgium, Germany, Austria-
Hungary, Servia, Italy, and British India.

legs sont de nature A laider dans sa mission générale: ‘le développement et la propagation du savoir
parmi les hommes.’’ C’est ainsi, par exemple, que l'Institut a accepté et géré un fonds qui, du nom
de son donateur, est appelé ‘‘le fonds Hodgkins” et quia été donué expressément pour favoriser “le
développement et la propagation d’une connaissance plus précise sur le sujet de la nature et des pro-
priétés de Yair atmosphérique par rapport au bien étre humain,”’ somme qui est également déposée au
Trésor. D’autres dons ont été acceptés et sont gérés pour étre affectés & d’autres objets spécifiés.

Le siége de l'Institut est & Washington, mais sa sphére action s’étend en dehors des Etats-Unis
de diverses facons, et surtout au moyen du systéme de correspondance, dont ila été parlé plus haut.
Le nombre des correspondants s’éléve actuellement a 24,000 environ et lui permet non senlement de
donner, mais encore de recevoir des communications des hommes de savoir de tous les pays.

Par ce moyen et par d'autres encore, l'Institut a réuni 4 Washington, une bibliothéque spéciale de
livres traitant de histoire des arts, des sciences, des découvertes et des inventions. Elle comprend
300,000 ouvrages, dont la plus grande partie a été, par permission du Congres, déposée a la Bibliotheque
Nationale, ou ils peuvent étre consultés avec les autres richesses de la Bibliotheque.

En dehors de cette sphére d’action dont les moyens lui. sont fournis par les fonds particuliers en
question et dont le Gouvernement a bien youlu assumer la tutelle, P Institut a été spécialement commis
ar Ja Législature 4 la charge de certains départements ou certaines divisions du Gouvernement, pour
e maintien desquels le Congrés a, de temps 4 autre, voté des crédits spéciaux. C’est ainsi qu’ont été
placés sous la direction de l'Institut, le Musée des Etats-Unis, le Département des changes Interna-
tionaux, le Département d’Ethnologie, le Pare National de Zoologie, et LObservatoire Astro-physique.
Tous ces établissements sont dirigés par le Secrétaire Perpétuel sous le contréle du Conseil

HODGKINS PRIZES.
WASHINGTON, ———, 1894.

DEAR Sir: I beg leave to inform you that the time within which papers may be
submitted in competition for the Hodgkins fund prizes of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, for essays in regard to the nature or properties of atmospheric air, has been
extended from July 1 to December 31, 1894. This action has been taken for the
reason that many of the circulars seem to have failed to reach the persons for whom
they were intended.

In order that all competitors may have the advantage of this extension of time,
the Institution will, upon request, take pleasure in returning papers already sub-
mitted; all papers being subject to the general condition requiring delivery in
Washington City before January 1, 1895,

It is preferred that the name and address of each competitor be attached to the
manuscript; it is permitted, however, that anyone who desires it may send his name
and address in such a form that they can be detached from the manuscript, which
he may identify by means of a motto.

The manuscripts of unsuccessful candidates will be returned, if desired; but the
proprietorship of papers to which one of the prizes has been awarded will rest with
the Institution, which only desires to give them a wide publicity; and no copyright
privileges are in this case to be expected by the author.

Papers which have been already published will not be accepted in competition
for the prizes, but may be eligible for the medal. This medal will be awarded in
the same way that medals are usually awarded by the principal scientific societies,
the medalists being chosen from all investigators known to the committee of award
and not necessarily from those alone who have submitted papers.

It is requested that all packages, manuscript or printed, intended for competition
be marked ‘‘Hodgkins competition” upon the outside of the wrapper, and be
addressed to Mr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washing-
ton City, U.S. A.

Very respectfully, S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work of the advisory committee has been going on systematically
during the year; papers have been read and passed upon, and many
applications for grants considered.

Prof. E. W. Morley’s work on the determinations of the density of
oxygen and hydrogen, referred to in previous reports as aided by spe-
cial apparatus provided by the Institution, is approaching completion.

The investigations undertaken by Dr.J. 8S. billings and Dr. 8S. Weir
Mitchell into the nature of the peculiar substances of organic origin
contained in the air expired by human beings, to which reference was
made in my last report, is still continued under a grant from the Hodg-
kins fund, as also are the researches by Dr. O. Lummer and Dr, E.
Pringsheim, of Berlin University, on the determination of an exact
measure of the cooling of gases while expanding, with a view to revis-
ing the value of that most important constant which is technically
termed the “ gamma” function.

The limitations of the fund have, however, rendered it necessary,
with slight exceptions, to postpone further action in this direction for
the present, although it is hoped that it will prove practicable at a later
date to aid certain important researches to which attention has been
invited.

CORRESPONDENCE.

It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the diversity of the nature
of the correspondence carried on immediately in the Secretary’s office.
Without reference to the voluminous correspondence of the National
Museum, or the special correspondence of the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Zoological Park, and the Bureau of Exchanges, constant inquiries are
received from all parts of the country for information on almost every
conceivable topic, and requests for statistics and for information on the
most varying scientific subjects. This correspondence all receives care-
ful attention, and, as a part of the aim of the Institution in the “ diffu-
sion of knowledge,” an effort is made to give a full reply to all such in-
quiries, often involving an amount of labor on the part of the curators,
as well as of those more immediately occupied with the correspondence
of the Institution, out of proportion to the merits of the case.

I desire to remark that this increase of correspondence, even if that
upon the business of subordinate Government bureaus alone is consid-
ered, calls constantly for more clerical aid and other expenses which
there is no appropriation for, and which practically form an added
burden on the limited Smithsonian fund, which it ought not to bear, and
to refer in this connection to what is said under “ Administration.”

The entries in the registry book of letters received during the year
number 3,652, but these are only the relatively important letters.

The general card index to all the correspondence in the Secretary’s
office, which was begun on January 1, 1893, is kept up constantly to date,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1 Le

and has been extended back to include all letters written or received
since January 1, 1892.

All correspondence prior to this current correspondence file has been
placed in the archives, and the letters that have been received between
1882 and 1890 have recently been bound and indexed, completing the
series of indexes to correspondence.

Reports, memoranda, and data collected on various subjects not prop-
erly belonging to the correspondence are preserved in a miscellaneous
file and properly indexed.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Naples table-—The anticipations in regard to the Naples table,
which, as I have stated in the report for 1893, has been leased for a
period of three years upon the petition of the biologists and universi-
ties of the United States, have been apparently justified.

Numerous applications for the occupancy of the table have been
received and considered. The following, being favorably reported by
the advisory committee, were approved by me for the present year:

Mr. D. G. Fairchild, United States Department of Agriculture,
received the appointment for October, November, and December, 1895.

Dr. W. M. Wheeler, University of Chicago, was appointed for Jan-
uary, February, and March, 1894.

Dr. H. C. Bumpus, Brown University, appointed for February,
March, and April, 1894.

Prof. Lewis Murbach received an assignment of three months,
beginning June 20, 1894.

Desiring to give to all investigators an equal opportunity to avail
themselves of the advantage of a seat at the Smithsonian table, it has
been decided that final action upon an application may not be taken
more than six months in advance of the date for which the table is
desired, and that should more than one application be filed for the
same period, in cases of presumably equal merit, the assignment shall
be made according to priority of application. It has also been deter-
mined that no appointment shall be made for a period of more than
six months, although an occupant may apply for extension of time or
for reappointment at some future date.

Students who are appointed to the table for the full term of six
months are desired to report to me at the close of each three months of
their occupancy; those appointed for a shorter period are expected to
make such report at the close of their assignment.

In several instances the time desired by an applicant overlaps that
of another, as is the case in February and March of 1894, but through
the ready courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, director of the station, who kindly
offered to arrange for the accommodation of more than one occupant of
the table at the same time, it has thus far been found possible to make
the appointments without disappointing a student on this account.

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

With a view to profiting by the judgment of our representative biolo-
gists in administering the affairs of the Naples table, I requested, at an
early date, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, the
president of the Society of American Naturalists, the president of the
American Morphological Society, and the president of the Association
of American Anatomists to nominate each one member of. an advisory
committee, the personnel of which is as follows, I having designated
Doctor Billings, as chairman, and Doctor Stiles, as secretary of the
committee :

Advisory committee, Naples table—Dr. J. 8S. Billings, U. 8S. A,,
director of the United States Army Medical Museum, chairman; Dr. E.
B. Wilson, professor of zoology, Columbia University; Dr. J. A. Ryder,
professor of embryology, University of Pennsylvania; Dr.C. W. Stiles,
zoologist, United States Department of Agriculture, secretary.

lam indebted to this committee for valuable aid in examining the
testimonials accompanying applications for the occupancy of the table
and for recommendations with regard to appointments, as well as for
the consideration of the various questions in connection with the assign-
ment of the table, to which {£ have asked attention. The contract
giving to the Institution the tenure of the Naples table for the term
of three years was given in full in my last year’s report.

Seal of the Institution.—A suitable steel die has been prepared for
the new sealof the Institution, designed by Augustus St. Gaudens, and
formally adopted by the Board of Regents at their meeting of January
25, 1895, and the new seal has been affixed, when required, to formal
papers since February, 1894, though the first use of the design was
upon the circulars concerning the Hodgkins prizes, issued under date
of March 31, 1893.

The Worlds Columbian Exposition.—The display made by the Smith-
sonian Institution, including the National Museum and the Bureau of
Ethnology, embraced collections prepared by the following departments
of the Museum: Ethnology, physical geology, mammals, birds, reptiles,
fishes, insects, marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, minerals,
prehistoric anthropology, historical collections, a collection of objeets
illustrating religious ceremonial, graphic arts, musical instruments,
animal products, and a special exhibit of domesticated animals. In
addition, an exhibit illustrating methods of aboriginal quarrying was
prepared by Mr. William H. Holmes, a display of Japanese potteries
was installed by Mr. Hieromich Shugio, aud an exhibit of early elec-
trical apparatus, employed by Prof. Joseph Henry in his experiments
which led to the discovery of the electric telegraph, was also prepared.
Complete sets of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and
of the National Museum were exhibited, together with those of the
American Historical Association.

_ These collections are fully described in the report for 1893 of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

Assistant Secretary, who acted as the representative of the Institution
upon that occasion. It is only necessary to add here that the exhibit
proved exceedingly attractive to the visitors, as evidenced by the
crowding of the space trom the opening to the closing day, and by the
numerous favorable notices published in the newspapers and periodi-
cals of the country.

A considerable number of the staff of the Institution served as
judges of award in connection with the several scientific juries of the
Exposition.

The Exposition closed on October 31, and the reshipment of the
exhibits to Washington was immediately commenced.

At the close of the Exposition several interesting collections were
presented to the Institution by foreign Governments and by individuals
which it has been difficult to provide room for.

In this connection I desire to call especial attention to the regret-
table fact that many exhibits that might have been secured for the
National Museum, without expense to the Government, went elsewhere,
as no provision could be made here for their exhibition in the already
overcrowded condition of the Museum building.

Delegates to universities and learned societies —The Smithsonian Insti-
tution is not infrequently invited to send representatives to special
celebrations instituted by learned societies or universities with which
it is in correspondence, both in this country and abroad. Whenever
practicable, special delegates have been designated by the Secretary to
represent the Institution on such occasions,

Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University and curator of oriental
antiquities in the National Musenm, was appointed as Smithsonian -
representative at the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists to
be held in Geneva, September 3 to 12, 1894.

Woodcuts, ete—A room on the third floor of the Smithsonian build-
ing has been set apart for the storage of several thousand original
woodcuts, copperplates, and photo-engraved blocks used in illustration
of the publications of the Institution and National Museum. These
blocks, which have now been marked and catalogued and arranged tor
ready reference, are frequently asked for by publishers, and it has been
the policy of the Institution to allow their use for reproduction and
publication at the mere cost of electrotyping.

The expense of handling and storage of the collection of stereotype
plates of the different series of publications has become so great, and
the plates are so rarely called. for, that it has been determined to dis-
continue the preparation of the plates except when their future use can
be distinctly foreseen. From past experience it is thought that the
saving of the original cost of electrotyping will more than meet the
expense of reproducing any papers for which the future may bring
special demands,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Archives.—A room on the fourth floor, about 20 by 22 feet, in the
east wing of the Smithsonian building, has been specially fitted up for
the arrangement of the valuable and somewhat voluminous archives of
the Institution, in a form where they can be most readily consulted.
Twenty-nine cases of shelves and sets of drawers are already largely
filled with volumes of letters received and press copies of letters sent,
with indexes, drawings, diagrams, photographs, and plans of the build-
ings and grounds, original records of proceedings of the Board of
Regents, a full set of the publications of the Institution, copies of
original papers by the Secretaries of the Institution, etc., and space
has been provided for the anticipated wants of several years to come.

Considerable progress has been made in the classification and index-
ing of these papers under the new arrangement.

Assignment of rooms.—A room in the basement of the east wing,
which has been specially fitted up with piers for pendulum experi-
ments, and connected by telegraph, through the Western Union Tele-
graph Company’s office, with the United States Naval Observatory, is
still reserved for the occasional use of the officers of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Toner lecture fund.—In 1872 Dr. J. M. Toner, of Washington, con-
veyed about $3,000 in real and personal property to five trustees, con-
sisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Surgeon-
General of the United States Army, the Surgeon-General of the Navy,
the president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia, insti-
tuting thereby ‘‘The Toner lecture fund.” Ninety per cent of the inter-
est of the fund is to be applied for at least two annual memoirs or essays
by different individuals relative to some branch of medical science, to
be read in the city of Washington, under the name of “The Toner lec-
tures, each of these memoirs or lectures to contain some new truth fully
established by experiment or observation.”

As these lectures are intended to inerease and diffuse knowledge,
several of them have been accepted for publication in the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections. The first of the course was by Dr. J. J.
Woodward, ‘On the structure of cancerous tumors,” and was printed
in 1873. Nine other lectures, by Dr. C. KE. Brown-Sequard, Dr. J. M.
Da Costa, Dr. W. Adams, Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, Dr. G. E. Waring, jr.,
Dr. C. K. Mills, and Dr. Harrison Allen, have since been published by
the Institution, the last having appeared in 1890.

The Hamilton fund.—In 1874 the Institution received $1,000 from the
estate of James Hamilton, esq., of Carlisle, Pa., bequeathed in the fol-
lowing clause of his will: :

I give $1,000 to the Board of Regents ot the Smithsonian Institution,
located at Washington, D. C., to be invested by said Regents in some
safe fund, and the interest to be appropriated biennially by the secre-
taries, either in money or a medal, for such contribution, paper, or lec-
ture on any scientific or useful subject, as said secretaries may approve,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

Under resolution of the Regents the bequest was deposited in the
Treasury on the same terms as the original Smithsonian bequest. In
administering the trust the income has thus far been only partially used,
but allowed to accumulate, the annual interest not being yet sufficient
to bear the expense attendant on the designing and striking of a proper
medal.

Statue of Secretary Bairvd.—-In my report for 1892 I called attention
to a bill introduced in the Senate by Mr. Morrill to provide for the
erection of a bronze statue of Professor Baird in the grounds of the
Institution. The failure of the passage of this bill was a disappoint-
ment to the friends of the Institution, and I sincerely hope that Con-
gress may consent to make an appropriation suitable for such a
memorial.

American Historical Association.—The manuscript of the annual
report of the American Historical Association for the year 1895 was
transmitted to Congress on March 3, 1894. This is the fifth annual
report and consists chiefly of papers read at the Historical Congress at
Chicago in July, 1893. The association has no official relation to the
Institution further than that its annual reports are transmitted to Con-
gress through the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as required
by its incorporation act. The reports are Congressional documents, and
the Institution has no control of their distribution. The association
prints a special edition of the reports at its own expense and distributes
them to the State historical societies and to a number of foreign insti-
tutions and libraries. Under authority granted by Congress in the act
approved January 4, 1889, a storage room has been assigned in the
National Museum for the publications of the association, and in the fire-
proof vaults of the Institution the association has temporarily deposited
a valuable collection of manuscript records pertaining to the early
history of the telegraph.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In previous reports I have felt called upon to insist upon three things
in regard to the Museum: First, that the collections are increasing so
rapidly that unless additional space is provided for their proper admin-
istration and exhibition its efficiency will be greatly impaired; secondly,
that the collections, although growing rapidly in certain directions,
are not increasing as symmetrically and consistently as is manifestly
desirable.

The third point which I desire to emphasize, and to introduce before
the others, has reference to the most undesirable and dangerous neces-
sity of storing collections, which can not, for lack of space, be placed
on exhibition, in the wooden sheds south of the Smithsonian building
and in the basement of the building itself. The storage sheds them-
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

selves are merely temporary structures, neither fireproof nor entirely
safe in other particulars, and these are not only so crowded that they
can hoid no more, but their use has thus been perverted from the pur-
poses for which they were built, i. e., for temporary workshops, and as
packing and unpacking rooms. So great, however, has been the neces-
sity of economizing all available space, and of finding some place for
the storage of specimens preserved in dilute alcohol, that the Museum
has been compelled to use the sheds for inflammable material for which
there is no room elsewhere. In the basement of the building itself
are large alcoholic collections in bottles containing, in the bulk, many
thousands of gallonsof alcohol. These last specimens are not on exhi-
bition, but for want of space are stored immediately under the large
exhibition halls of the Smithsonian building.

Ihave the assurance of experts that a fire communicated to these
rooms would sweep through the entire length of the building, and
although the building itself is fireproof as against any ordinary dan-
ger, it may well be doubted whether any of the collections therein
exhibited can be regarded as safe, if the rooms immediately below
should be exposed to so peculiarly severe a conflagration as would be
caused by the ignition of these large quantities of inflammable material.
Besides this, these wooden sheds, which (as f have already intimated)
are used not only for storerooms, but for workshops, for the preserva-
tion of specimens, and also as sheds for the carpenters, are likewise
liable to cause serious losses, should a fire be kindled in any of them,
and all of these, | repeat, are immediately under the windows of the
Smithsonian building.

In a report recently submitted by one of the inspectors of the Asso-
ciation of Fire Underwriters, in response to a request from me for a
statement as to what insurance rates would be fixed upon the sheds in
question, the Smithsonian building is referred to as an undesirable
risk, owing solely to the presence of all this inflammable material
underneath and in the adjoining sheds, on which latter insurance can
not be placed for less than $40 per $1,000. This is, I am informed,
nearly ten times the rate which would be charged on an ordinary ware-
house. The chief danger, however, is not to the sheds themselves or
their contents, but to the adjoining collections which, without refer-
ence to their scientific interest but merely to their intrinsic value, repre-
sent a very large sum of money.

I repeat that this condition of affairs is one which urgently demands
immediate relief, and with this unreserved expression of my opinion it
seems to me that I have said all that I ean.

Apart trom the dangers incurred by the storage of inflammable
material in and adjoining the Smithsonian building, the Museum is
still confronted with the problem of caring for the numerous collections
which can not be now exhibited, and which, as I have shown, are at

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Di

the present time massed together in sheds and basements. During
the past year the disadvantages to the Museum, which have grown
out of this state of affairs, have been especially apparent. Very many
valuable collections which were brought to Chicago by foreign govern-
ments for exhibition at the World’s Fair wouid have been offered to
the National Museum had not the fact been so generally known that
they could not be properly accommodated in Washington. The few
collections which were acquired by the Museum at the close of the
Exposition, though not of very great bulk, were exceedingly valu-
able, but it must be said that the care of even these has largely
increased the congestion and has been the cause of considerable
additional embarrassment. I may add that everything that it is pos-
sible to do has already been done in the way of rearranging the collec-
tions, with a view to economizing space, and of withdrawing from the
exhibition series objects which could best be spared from the halls.

I now recur to the other topics of importance connected with the
Museum.

The Museum in its present condition is by no means advanta geously
arranged, with regard either to the general interests of the Institution
or to its own importance, owing in part to the fact that some of the col-
lections, under the pressure of overcrowded conditions, now occupy halls
which were intended for quite other purposes, such as the so-called
“Chapel” in the Smithsonian building, or which are unsuitable for the
exhibition of specimens, as is indeed the whole of the lower hall in the
Smithsonian building. Still more unfortunate is it that it is impossi-
ble to install different departments in halls by themselves. In the
Museum building, in many instances, widely distinct collections are of
necessity exhibited in the same hall, and an appearance of confusion
and lack of system, which is much to be deprecated, results.

There is probably no museum in the world in which so small a pro-
portion of the objects worthy of exhibition are visible to the public,
and in which the objects exhibited are crowded together so closely.
This crowding, indeed, has of necessity been carried to such an extent
in many of the halls that there is no space to pass between the cases,
except along a few principal aisles, and the storage rooms already
contain, mounted and labeled for exhibition, enough material to fill
several halls more. It is no exaggeration to say that if there were
another building as large as the present one it could within a very
short time be filled with specimens already here, and that the two
buildings together would seem as fully occupied as do now the buildings
of most other museums.

I earnestly call attention to the proper inference from these state-
ments, which is, not that one building can be made, or is being made,
to do the work of two, but that the one building in question is almost
ceasing to fulfill its proper function, and tends more and more to the
condition of a warehouse, to the detriment of its proper museum uses,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In order to relieve in some slight degree this increasing crowding of
of the halls, I have for some years asked for an appropriation for the
erection of galleries in two or more of the halls in the Museum build-
ing. Such galleries were provided for in the original plan of the
building, and they may be supported in such a manner as not to detract
from the appearance of‘the halls or to interfere with the installation of
the collections. They would afford very material relief in the matter of
exhibition and indirectly in that of storage.

There has been but little effort to increase the bulk of the collections
although, as in previous years, no opportunity has been spared to
increase the completeness and scientific value of the series in several
departments by the addition of special desiderata. Notwithstanding
this fact, the increment from legitimate sources, especially from the
various Departments of the Government, which are required by law to
deposit their accumulations here, has been more than 171,000 specimens.
This total, although double that of the previous year, was far below
that for 1892, when 260,000 specimens were added to the collections,
and not very much greater than that for 1891. The falling off in 1893
was due to the fact that the entire activities of the Museum staff were
devoted to preparations for the World’s Fair, and that a large number
of the correspondents of the Institution, as well as other persons to
whom the annual increase is ordinarily due, were also occupied in the
same way. A certainproportion of the accessions in 1894 were acquired
at the close of the World’s Fair in Chicago. These were almost with-
out exception collections which had been prepared by foreign exhib-
itors with the Smithsonian Institution in mind as the ultimate place of
deposit, and which were sent here at the close of the exposition.

It would have been possible to have obtained an immense number
of specimens on this occasion, but it was deemed proper to refrain from
efforts in this direction, not only because of the considerations just
referred to, but also on account of the desire of the people of Chicago
to retain such objects in their own city as a beginning toward a great
civic museum which might serve as a permanent memorial of the
World’s Columbian Exposition. It has always been the policy of the
Smithsonian Institution to encourage the development of such institu-
tions throughout the United States, and to assist in developing them,
and on this account many proffers of specimens were declined, with the
recommendation that they be offered to the Chicago Museum, and so
far as it was possible to do so, the attention of exhibitors who had col-
lections to dispose of, was directed toward that institution.

A careful approximation of the number of specimens now contained
in the various departments of the Museum shows that the total is about
three and one-quarter millions, almost all of which have been acquired
by gift, in exchange for other specimens, or as an equivalent for publi-
cations.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

Notwithstanding the unsymmetrical growth of the Museum, to which
I have already alluded, there are some very encouraging features in
connection with the increase of the collections. Every day numerous
specimens are contributed by persons who have either visited the
Museum and wish to testify their sympathy with its work, or have
become interested through its publications or by correspondence.

Not a few collections of great value have been given at various times,
such as the George Catlin Indian Gallery, the Lea Collection of Min-
erals and Shells, the Bendire and Ralph Collections of Birds’ Eggs,
the Lacoe Collection of Fossil Plants, and the Collection of the Ameri-
can Institute of Mining Engineers, which latter was transferred at the
close of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.

Since the accessions are almost entirely gifts, it is manifestly impos-
sible that the Museum collections should grow symmetrically. A large
proportion of the annual accessions are not sufficiently valuable to be
‘added to either the study or exhibition series. They are all useful,
however, in connection with the preparation of duplicate sets for dis-
tribution to educational institutions. The distribution of duplicate
material has been continued, and more than twenty-seven thousand
specimens, consisting principally of marine invertebrates, rocks,
minerals, fishes, and casts of prehistoric implements, have been trans-
mitted during the year to other museums, colleges, and normal schools.

The report of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the National
Museum, contains a list by groups of the material distributed, as well
as a geographical statement of the institutions supplied. The same
report also includes a list of the distributions of material made during
the last thirty-five years.

I have found it quite impossible to comply with all the applications
for specimens from universities, colleges, and other museums; nor can
this be done until Congress shall appropriate a sum of money sufficient
to render possible the employment of competent persons who, under
the supervision of the curators, can devote their time to separating
the duplicates in the various collections, and arranging them into sets
for distribution.

I may assume that it is the intention of Congress that the National
Museum of the United States shall be; so far as a museum can be, a
worthy exponent of the natural resources and scientific achievements
of the nation; that it shall be worthy the attention of visitors to the
capital; that it shall perform its proper functions as one of the scien-
tific departments of the Government, and shall aiso promote the
scientific and educational interests of the country at large.

It seems worthy of note, then, that while in almost all the largest
cities of Europe, including London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg,
Vienna, and Florence, the national collections are exhibited in groups
of buildings, here in Washington all similar collections are brought
together under the roofs of the Smithsonian and. National Museum
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

buildings and the Army Medical Museum building. The practice
which has so largely obtained abroad in this respect is for many rea-
sons unfortunate, since much labor is duplicated and collections of
similar character are found growing up in different parts of the same
city. It has, however, its advantages, for where the national collec-
tions are exhibited in a group of museums, each would have its own
space, and there would be employed in each building a staff as large
as that which is here concerned in the administration of the whole.

The National Museum will surely in time at least equal in size and
importance the museums of similar character in any of the national
capitals in Europe. Now is the time for obtaining many kinds of
objects such as it will be impossible to obtain after the country has
become more thoroughly settled, when its natural features and its large
animals will have been destroyed, and its aboriginal inhabitants
deprived of their race characteristics. The time is rapidly approach-
ing when many desirable objects can no longer be obtained, and it is a.
matter of deep regret that valuable collections are being constantly
exported to the Old World museums, which are able to pay for them
prices absolutely beyond the reach of any American institution, and I
repeat my statement of the regrettable fact that not only the American
student must leave America to study some important branches of the
history of native American races, but that the national collections are
relatively falling still further backward in this regard, as compared with
those of many other nations.

It is not advisable, therefore, to check the current of accessions, for
each year a very large number of objects are procured without cost,
which in a few years can not be secured at any price.

The fact that the Museum is embarrassed for lack of space and for
lack of means to secure a more symmetrical development of the collec-
tions,renders it all the more necessary that an efficient staff of curators
should be constantly at work, in order to preserve the material already
here and that which is constantly coming in—this, indeed, being their
first duty. It is also desirable that they should continue, by scientific
study and by publication, to develop the facts which are essential to
the correct understanding of the material, and that the collections
should be arranged and classified in such a manner as to be immedi-
ately accessible to the students of science from all parts of the country
and from abroad, who are constantly visiting Washington for the
purpose of consulting these collections in connection with their own
scientific studies.

The scientific staff is, in my judgment, as effective a one as can possi-
bly be expected under its present condition. It is unfortunate, how-
ever, that so many of the men in charge of the departments should
be volunteers, without compensation, a system which is found advan-
tageous to a limited extent only. With only this aid from specialists,
not even connected with the Museum, it is imposible for the curators
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

and their assistants to perform the urgent work of their departments.
In a degree, this is attributable to the growing frequency of the demand
of educational institutions and the outside public upon the staff for
information and aid. For the safe-keeping of the collections, whose
increase in value has rendered the responsibility of custody much greater,
the force of watchmen should also be increased, while to insure pzoper
cleanliness of the floors and cases, a larger number of laborers and clean-
ers should beemployed than is possible with the appropriation of the pres-
ent year. It is hoped, then, that the appropriation for the preservation:
of collections may be restored to at least the amount at which it stood
when the reduction was made in 1895; though even this sum, as L
have attempted to show in my ietters year by year accompanying the
estimates, is far below what is needed for efficient work.

It is also hoped that the appropriation for furniture and fixtures,
which has been considerably decreased of late years, may be made
larger, since the crowding of the exhibition halls renders it necessary
to reconstruct many old cases and to build new ones in places hitherto
unoccupied, because they have been thought hardly suitable for exhi-
bition, but to the use of which the administration is now driven.

It should be borne in mind also that there is constant expense ior the
repair and renovation of the cases already on hand, which yearly suf-
fer considerable damage from the throngs of visitors. The necessity
for repair and renovation of the building is yearly becoming greater
as it grows older, and there being no special provision to meet such
expense, its cost is of necessity, and by direction of the Treasury author-
ities, paid from the appropriation for ‘cases, furniture, fixtures, and
appliances required for the exhibition and safe-keeping of the collec-
tions.”

The necessity of a more liberal allowance by Congress for printing the
publications of the Museum still increases. The editions are far too
small to admit of placing complete sets in the libraries of each college,
university, scientific school, normal school, and scientific society in the
United States—which I deem of the highest importance—as well as
in every State library, and every local library of importance, as indi-
cated upon the provisional list which was published as Appendix D in
the report of the assistant secretary for 1889. In addition to these
institutions it is desired to send our publications to every national
library abroad, as well as to every great library, university, or academy
of sciences which has a center of scientific activity. In return for
the publications distributed to foreign libraries there is obtained in
exchange for the Museum library a large number of scientific publica-
tions of the greatest value, many of which it is impossible to buy, and
which, if purchasable, would require annually a large expenditure of
money. On account of the present small editions, the Museum is
unfortunately unable to send sets to many scientific institutions from
which it might otherwise obtain many valuable publications for its
library.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Notwithstanding these serious drawbacks, the publications of the
Museum (Proceedings and Bulletin) are distributed to about 2,200
libraries at home and abroad, and more than twice this number receive
the annual report. Specialists are previously supplied with the papers
emanating from the Museum in the form of extras which pertain to
their special studies; and on the mailing lists of the Museum are
probably not less than 3,000 names of persons thus supplied. It is
believed, however, thatin order to comply with all applications, editions
twice as large as at present would be necessary.

The reprinting of some of the earlier volumes of the proceedings
and bulletins is also much to be desired. This would enable the
Museum to complete the sets of its publications in libraries which have
been only partially supplied. The first four volumes of the proceed-
ings and the first sixteen bulletins were reprinted by the Smithsonian
Institution in the Miscellaneous Collections, and in this form only
libraries were supplied. But it eventually became necessary to cease
this method of enlarging the editions, owing to the drain which it
made on the fund of the Smithsonian Institution.

Many libraries, therefore, which were supplied with the volumes thus
reprinted have received none subsequently, and their desiderata are
being carefully noted with a view to supplying them from new editions,
if Congress will appropriate the money necessary to defray the cost of
reprinting. It is also to be hoped that Congress will see fit to restore
the former extent of the edition of the annual report. The Museum,
having no fund for the purchase of specimens, relies upon its reports 1n
’ a large measure for securing accessions to the collections, and already,
on account of the decrease in the edition, it has become necessary to
restrict the mailing list of individuals to those who have done the
Museum some actual service. This restrictive policy will undoubtedly
result in an increased demand for these volumes on members of the
Congressional bodies, for whose personal use a large proportion of the
edition is reserved.

During the past year the Museum has received much valuable assist-
ance and many courtesies at the hands of the Executive Departments
and Bureaus of the Government, for which acknowledgments are hereby
tendered. Several officers of the United States Geological Survey, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commission have served, as
in previous years, in the capacity of honorary curators of the collections.

:

BUREAU’ OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The work of investigating the languages, habits, customs, and class1-
fication of the North American Indians was commenced in 1872 at the
request of Gen. F. A. Walker, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who
had called upon the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for advice
as to some scientific method of grouping the Indians on their reserva-
tions.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a0

The Institution was at that time in possession of a large collection of
vocabularies and manuscripts, as yet unpublished, which were placed
in the hands of Maj. J. W, Powell, who had been previously studying
the tribes of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and who had
himself collected many vocabularies, and he was requested to report
upon their availability for the purpose in question. Major Powell made
a report upon these, showing to what extent they would bear upon the
subject and what was necessary to complete the work. Soon after, the
task was put in his charge, and it has been in progress since that time.

Incarrying on this work it was essential that all the languages of the
United States should be studied. It was not known at that time how
numerous these languages were, but since then a large number of vocab-
ularies have been collected in addition to those previously obtained. It
has been found by Major Powell that these vocabularies may be
grouped into about sixty classes, each representing a distinet family of
languages.

The linguistic investigation has always had for its object to group
the Indians by their affinities or their languages, and to determine what
tribes may be thrown together on reservations. This linguistic study
has been continued to the present time, and constantly, month by
month, and year by year, Major Powell has been in communication with
the Indian Office, furnishing the facts necessary to group Indian tribes
upon reservations.

At the request of Major Powell an appropriation of $20,000 was made
for this work in 1879. The work previously done, including the collee-
tion of vocabularies, was without expense, by missionaries, teachers,
and Army officers, and various students of American ethnology have
been employed without remuneration.

When this new apy 9opriation was made, it was turther asked that the
scope of the research be enlarged so as to embrace the habits and cus-
toms of the Indians, and especially their methods of tribal organiza-
tion and government, and the system of tribal laws in vogue among
the tribes. With that understanding the appropriation was made,
and it was soon afterwards somewhat increased, and has remained the
same amount, about $40,000, except that one year $50,000 was given,
so that Major Powell might retire from the Geological Survey and
devote himself exclusively to the Bureau of Ethnology. Cireum-
stances prevented this at the time, but recently he has severed all con-
nection with the Geological Survey, and is devoting himself entirely to
the ethnological work of the Institution.

The prosecution of investigations relating to the ethnology of*the
American Indians has been carried forward during the year in accord-
ance with law under the efficient control of Maj. J. W. Powell, the
flirector, aided by Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, as executive
officers. These researches of the Bureau of American Ethnology
embrace the subjects of archeology, descriptive ethnology, sociology,
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pictography and sign language, linguistics, mythology, psychology,
and bibliography, and the results obtained during the year have —
never been exceeded in value.

Exploratory work has been carried on in the western part of the
continent by several parties. The most extended exploration was made
in connection with an archeologic survey of portions of New Mexico
and Arizona, where a party examined the valleys of the Little Colorado
and San Juan rivers, as well as Canyon de Cheily and the vicinity of
San Francisco “wash.” In the first-named valley but few relics of
the aborigines were found, and reason was disclosed for believing that
this poverty in relics was due to the high velocity of the stream and
the ruggedness of its channel and valley bottom, by which irrigation
was rendered impracticable. Certain ruins of considerable interest
were, however, located and surveyed. — In Canyon de Chelly more than
60 ruins were examined and ground plans of many of them were made,
while a large series of photographs were taken. The San Juan Valley
also was found rich in remains of structures of the general type found
in Canyon de Chelly and elsewhere in the arid southwestern region.
The relative abundance of ruins, indicating a numerous ancient popu-
lation in Canyon de Chelly and San Juan Valley, is ascribed by
the archeologist to the facility with which the respective rivers may
be controlled for irrigation purposes, and abundant remains of the
irrigation works were found.

Another party spent several months in Indian Territory and Okla-
homa collecting information concerning the habits and customs of the
Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, as well as material objects
illustrating their arts and modes of life. This party was provided
with a graphophone, by means of which a number of aboriginal songs,
both with and without instrumental accompaniment, were recorded.
Other collaborators of the Bureau visited the Indians of northern
Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota and the Kwapa Reservation in
Indian Territory, where they were able to collect valuable material
relating to the habits, customs, social organization, myths, traditions,
and languages of the aborigines.

The archeologic investigations already begun in eastern United
States were continued in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, central Ohio, and Tennessee. The researches in Delaware
Valley, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are considered by the officers
of the Bureau as of special interest in their bearing on questions con-
cerning the arts of the prehistoric peoples of eastern North America,
while the investigations in Virginia are regarded as throwing useful
light on the arts of the aborigines at a time more immediately anterior
to the white invasion. Several reports on different archzologic sub-
jects were prepared for publication during the year. The director
notes with regret that Prof. W. H. Holmes, who has for some years
been in charge of this archeologie work, has severed his connection
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Sil

with the Bureau in order to accept an important position in the Pield
Columbian Museum, at Chicago.

The study of Maya and other Mexican codices and inscriptions has
been continued during the year. Some of the ancient inscriptions
have been deciphered and appear to indicate that the calendar systems
ot the prehistoric people of the Western Hemisphere were elaborate and
of considerable accuracy.

One of the lines of work in the Bureau since its institution is the
systematic arrangement of scattered information relating to the tribal
names and characteristics of the Indians found on this continent by
early explorers and travelers. This work, which involves extended
literary research, together with correspondence and conference with
travelers, missionaries, and others, has been carried forward during the
year, and the data collected are arranged on ecards, forming a tribal
dictionary, which is now quite voluminous. The information relating
to several tribes is now considered sufficiently complete to warrant
publication, and plans have been formulated in the Bureau for printing
the work in a series of bulletins.

Several years ago the Bureau began the task of collecting the rude
rock inscriptions made by the Indians on bowlders, cliffs, canyon walls,
and the sides or roofs of caves in many parts of the country. As shown
in the earlier published reports, these inscriptions are in some cases
connected with symbolic or heraldic paintings on skins or other sub-
stances, and in some degree with the gesture speech or sign language
so commonly employed among certain Indian tribes. The researches
have been continued, chiefly by Colonel Mallery, and are now substan-
tially completed. A monograph on pictography was published during
the year in the tenth annual report of the Director, while an accom-
nanying monograph on gesture speech is nearly ready for publication.
Although the work in sign language is not unique, the information
brought together is voluminous and exact, and the work is regarded
as especially interesting and useful to students of primitive modes of
expression in this and other countries.

One of the chief lines of research in the Bureau relates to the lan-
guages of the aborigines. The collection of texts, vocabularies, and
grammatic material has been continued, and reports on the subject
have been published. It is thought that the primitive languages of
this continent, which are remarkable for number and diversity, give
unexcelled opportunities for the study of linguistic development, and
with this view a large body of more or less compiete manuscript material
has been brought together for purposes of comparative study, as well
as for immediate publication. The linguistic manuscripts are stored in
fireproof vaults, where they are kept accessible to philologists and
other students. It is believed that the manuscript and other linguistic
material in the possession of the Bureau is richer than any other body
of linguistic records of primitive men.
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The American Indians, like other primitive peoples, were largely
influenced in their modes of life and relations among each other and
with the white pioneers by their myths and beliefs. During the past
year, as during preceding years, the collection of typical myths has
heen continued, and progress has been made in the discussion and
arrangement of this material in such manner as to indicate Indian
modes of thought and the motives by which primitive men are actu-
ated. Progress has been made in preparing material relating to this
subject for publication, and several of the reports issued during the
year relate in greater or less measure to Indian mythology.

Phe publication, in the form of a series of bulletins, of a bibliography
of Indian languages has been continued. This work is made as nearly
as possible exhaustive, and the basis of classification is such that
nearly all the more important literature relating to the American
Indians is included. Two bulletins on the subject were published dur-
ing the year, covering respectively the literature pertaining to the
Indians of the Salishan and Wakashan stocks.

During the past year publication has kept pace with research in
the Bureau, and a larger number of pages of ethnologic material have
been put in type than during any previous year in the history of the
organization. Two annual reports and four bulletins were distributed,
while several other reports, monographs, and bulletins were also com.
pleted at the close of the year. Partly by reason of the distribution of
publications, the accessions of the library through gift or exchange
have been unusually rich.

A detailed statement by the director of the Bureau of the work
accomplished under his direction accompanies this report as Appen-
chic ET,

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The Smithsonian Exchange Service was inaugurated nearly half a
century ago, with the object of carrying out one of the purposes of the
founder of the Institution in the diffusion of that knowledge which the
Institution itself helped to create.

ior this purpose it established correspondence with learned men all
over the world, until there is no civilized country or people, however
remote, upon the surface of the planet, so far as is known, where the
Institution is not thus represented. These correspondents have grown
in numbers until at the present time those external to the country alone
number nearly 17,000.

An attempt is made to convey, though imperfectly, in the accompa-
nying map, an idea of the wide distribution of the Institution’s corre-
spondents. In Western Europe and in the eastern part of the United
States but a small percentage of the actual numbers can be separately
shown upon this small scale, and it must therefore be understood the
map is not to be regarded as strictly statistical.
>

So ~—_--

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ao

1 desire here, however, to call attention not so much to the extensicu
ot this system of correspondence as to the existing relations of the
Smithsonian Institution and of the National Government to this
Exchange Service.

The service was, as I have stated, inaugurated nearly a half century
since, and at that time, in the absence of pecuniary means other than
its own little fund, the Institution appealed to the generosity of the
ocean and other large transportation companies to aid it in its unselfish
work of diffusing knowledge by carrying, free, cases containing the
communications between ljearne dsocieties and others in their respec-
tive countries. Foreign governments have always recognized the
peculiar service of the Institution by allowing its exchange cases free
passage through their customs services, and in our own country past
Secretaries of the Treasury have given special instructions to like effect.

In later years a most important change in this respect, and one
whose importance is still increasing, comes from the fact that the facili-
ties of the Exchange Service of the Institution are now made use of
by all branches of the Government service, and the cases carried by
these companies contain chiefly Government publications, such, for
instance, as the Congressional Record and others.

I again call attention to the fact that, though transportation charges
are now paid over many lines, it is only through the continuance of this
peculiar privilege of free freight over other lines, granted originally in
view of quite other conditions! that it is possible for the Institution to
continue the transportation of these documents under the present
appropriations, and efficiency and promptness can not be demanded of
the unpaid service upon which the Institution relies. It has happened,
for instance, that exchange boxes have been delayed seven months at
the seaport awaiting a convenient opportunity of shipment.

Congress has never made appropriations sufficient to meet the entire
expense of the exchange as conducted under the above partly gratuitous
ocean service, even in taking into account the repayment to the Insti-
tution of money advanced to certain Government bureaus for the dis-
tribution of their exchanges and the amounts received from other
bureaus under the ruling of the Regents referred to. An examination
of the records shows that the Institution has in past years expended
of its own fund over $38,000 in the transportation of Congressional
documents alone.”

The office has been laboring under the disadvantage of reduced appro-
priations, and it has been necessary to curtail expenses in every direc-
tion. Toward the close of the year, a deficiency estimate having failed
to receive favorable action, it became necessary to restrict greatly the
shipments and to notify many correspondents that transmissions would

be delayed. A great number of packages for shipment have therefore
accumulated at the end of June, including about 7,000 copies of Con-
gressional documents, and the work has fallen in arrears in other
respects in spite of the special exertions of an insufficient clerical force
to keep it up to date. The funds available for the exchange service
have been also reduced through the inability of some of the Govern-
ment bureaus to meet their proportionate share of the expenses involved
in the transmission of their documents abroad.

Referring to the report of the curator in charge of the exchange
office, it will be seen that over 100 tons of books passed through the
exchange oftice during the fiscal year 1893-94,

The disbursements for the year were $17,584.89, of which $14,474.58
were paid from the appropriation of $14,500 by Congress; $1,729.22
were paid by Government bureaus, and $436.73 by institutions, socie-
ties, and others, leaving a deficiency of $944.36.

The amount which was estimated as necessary for the expense of
the service for the fiscal year 1894-95 was $23,000, a sum which it was
hoped would render it unnecessary to call upon the different Govern-
ment bureaus to reimburse the Institution for a part of the expense
accompanying the transmission of their publications abroad, and would
also give effect to a second treaty entered into at Brussels, and pro-
claimed in 1889, for the immediate exchange of parliamentary docu-
ments between the contracting countries, a treaty which has been
inoperative on the part of the United States on account of the lack of
appropriations for the purpose, Congress having appropriated only
$17,000 as explained elsewhere.

The Smithsonian Institution, through the International Exchange
Service, is brought into close contact with all of the most important
libraries, scientific societies, and institutions of learning in the United
States, and the valuable services it has rendered to them in procuring
foreign publications has always been cordially recognized, but to con-
tinue the service in the condition of efficiency it reached a few years
ago, and to keep pace with the ever-increasing demands upon it, for
the transportation of Government documents, a larger appropriation
is indispensably necessary.

Many and just complaints of delays in the transmission of exchanges
have recently been received, and without adequate means for the sup-
port of the service, these Government documents as well as others, which
are reaching the Institution in increasing numbers, must be allowed to
accumulate untileven room for their reception and storage will be lacking.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

It is now five years since Congress made an appropriation for the
purchase of land for a national zoological park. In this time the land
then purchased has greatly increased in value.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

When Congress was asked to appropriate funds for this park it was
for a simpler and larger purpose than that of the present establishment,
since it was meant to found it rather in national than in local interests
aud largely in view of the fact that many North American animals,
constituting a part of the national wealth and formerly occupying a
large portion of its domain, were threatened with speedy extinction.

The actual extinction of the buffalo, of which herds consisting of
literally millions of individuals roamed the prairies less than a genera-
tion ago, is a subject of knowledge and comment throughout the world.
The beaver, the wapiti, the moose, and many other species useful to
man, which within the memory of those now living had their haunts
and were found in abundance east of the Mississippi, are each year
becoming more and more rare. ‘It was urged upon Congress that
unless steps were speedily taken to preserve the remaining few, and
to bring them under observation, these races must perish, as other
extinet species have done, and that with the disappearance of the last
individual all hope of their renewal would be lost.

The reservation of the Yellowstone National Park as a great game
preserve had been a first and very important movement toward their
preservation, but the very immensity of the reservation threatened to
defeat the plan, for as regards the rarer animals, these naturally kept
to the wilder and more remote regions of the park, where they could
not be protected from the marauding hunter, nor (what is not unimport-
ant) be observed by the naturalist. To retard their extinction (since
so long as a single pair exists and bears offspring the renewal of the
race in countless individuals is at least possible), and to provide oppor-
tunity for their careful study, was the intention of those who first advo-
vocated the establishment of a preserve near Washington large enough
to keep the animals as close to natural conditions as is possible, and
yet not so large but that they could always be protected and under
observation.

The Smithsonian Institution had for some years received frequent
gifts of animals, but no suitable accommodations existed, and it seemed
desirable that some provision should be made for the numerous speci-
mens which came by donations or from Government reservations, and
which were of necessity killed for scientific study or given away to
zoological gardens in other cities.

The act of Congress making provision for a park, entailed responsi-
bilities of a different character from those first contemplated, for instead
of creating a purely national institution for a national purpose, one-half
of the cost of purchase and maintenance was placed upon the tax-
payers of the District. The indirect but quite evident tendency of
this local taxation was to divert a large share of the appropriation to
meet the demands of the local taxpayer, and the Regents of the Simith-
sonian, under whom the park was placed, were directed to “ administer
the park for the advancement of science and the instruction and
recreation of the people.”
36 REPORT GF THE SECRETARY.

When the land was bought it was thought desirable to include as
great a length of Rock Creek as possible with sufficient width of
ground to afford large, retired paddocks.

The park has an area of nearly 167 acres, with an ample supply of
water for lakes, ponds, and inclosures, while the varied and picturesque
character of the banks of the creek affords a variety of exposure and
of effect delightful to all lovers of natural landscape.

There are as yet but four permanent buildings and the animals num-
ber 510, of which 200 are of the larger size.

Comparing this with similar establishments at other capitals, it may
be noted that the Gardens of the Zoological Society, in Regent’s
Park, London, established about 68 years ago, cover about 36 acres of
mere open common, crowded with buildings, and that the magnificent
collection of animals, some 2,500 in number, is housed in a fairly com-
fortable manner.

In Paris the portion of the Jardin des Plantes assigned to animals
is a plat of ground some 17 acres in extent, laid out tastefully, with
all the resources of the landscape gardener, but necessarily crowded
with its 900 animals.

In Berlin the portion of the Thiergarten appropriated for animals
occupies about 60 acres. The buildings are ornamental and substantial.
Fifteen hundred animals are accommodated and, necessarily, much
overcrowded. The landscape features are almost wholly subordinated.

In the United States the principal collections are in Philadelphia,
where the grounds occupy about 40 acres and the collection comprises
881 animals; in Cincinnati, where 36 acres are occupied with about 800
animals ; and in New York, where the city maintains about 700 animals
in Central Park, occupying an area of approximately 10 acres. In none
of these collections are the grounds of sufficient size to give any exten-
Sive range for the animals.

The accompanying diagram shows the-size of the National Zoological
Park compared with those of London, Paris, and Berlin.

I ought not to close these remarks without calling attention to the
evidence of the use of these gardens by the public. Even in their
present inchoate condition they have received as many as 30,000 visit-
itors in a single day. The ground constitutes a park so adjacent to
the city as to be accessible on foot to all, and an expression which has
been used elsewhere may be applied with no less justness here in
describing this park as the lungs of the city.

The natural advantages possessed by the National Zoological Park
are unrivaled. I am not aware that any city has a zoological park of
such extent, so picturesquely situated, and so easily accessible. It
is possible here to provide almost any exposure which animals may
require, to give them large paddocks with abundant shade and seclu-
sion, or to furnish for waterfowl] and other aquatic animals lakes, ponds,
and long reaches of water, where they can live in almost perfect natu-

ral conditions. These desiderata for the animals may be combined with
landscape effects; with stretches of meadow and wooded hillsides,
with overhanging cliffs and running water, with dense shade and sunny
slopes; such as can not fail to prove a lasting advantage and pleasure
to the public.

It is obvious that care should be taken to develop this park along
the lines which the natural conditions so clearly indicate, and that it
would be a mistake to mar its beauty by huddling the buildings together,
and by crowding the animals into small and uncomfortable quarters.

Having always in mind that the original object of the park was the
preservation of American animals, it is intended to make that a princi-
pal matter of consideration; yet it must be remembered that even in
the interest of North American zoology, comparative studies can not
be properly carried on without a certain proportion of animals belong-
ing to the Old World. It is to be expected, therefore, that a certain
number of foreign animals will be included in the collection when they
can be advantageously obtained.

The Yellowstone National Park has always been regarded as an
important preserve, from which supplies could be drawn for the
National Zoological Park. Its distance and the cost of transportation
have prevented its use to so great an extent as could be wished;
yet there have been received from it during the year a total of 28
animals, among which were a fine herd of young elk. In order to
properly utilize the resources of the Yellowstone Park, it will probably
be necessary to construct there a corral of considerable extent, into
which wild animals can be driven, inclosed, fed, and, at the proper
time, secured for shipment. Projects for a structure of this kind have
been considered, but the lack of funds has thus far prevented their
accomplishment.

It seems necessary to again refer to the desirability of changing the
appropriation act so as to permit the occasional purchase of animals.
Several times during the past year rare native animals have been offered
for sale at extremely low prices—indeed, for less than the cost of trans-
portation from the regions where they were obtained. Among such
are the Rocky Mountain Goat and the Mountain Sheep. This goat has
never before been seen in captivity, as far as I am aware, and the
sheep is extremely rare.

In October, 1893, the proprietor of the large menagerie which in 1890
presented the park with an elephant, offered to make a temporary deposit
of a number of animals without charge. In consideration of the words
of the fundamental act, “For the instruction and recreation of the
people,” it was decided to accept the offer, such arrangements being
customary in zoological gardens. It was stipulated that any animals
born should become the property of the United States. The experiment
was satisfactory, affording to the public an opportunity of seeing and
studying at leisure, a number of interesting specimens, such as the park
could not hope to possess for many years to come.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The appropriation made for the park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1894, was in the following terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water sup-
ply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading, planting, and otherwise
improving the grounds, erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures
for the animals, and for administrative purposes, care, subsistence, and
transportation of animals, including salaries and compensation of ail
necessary employees, and general incidental expenses not otherwise
provided for, fifty thousand dollars, one-half of which sum shall be paid
from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from
the Treasury of the United States; and a report in detail of the expenses
of the National Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the begin-
ning of each regular session.

By far the greater portion of this appropriation was expended for
food for the maintenance of the animals, and for keeping in proper care
and condition the buildings and accessories. The sum remaining,
being insufficient for new work of any great extent, has been expended
in necessary improvements, and in building roads and paths to the
different buildings and shelters.

The bridge near the Quarry-Road entrance has been somewhat
improved by the addition of footways and copings. This structure is,
however, far from satisfactory, having been built from a limited appro-
priation ata time when it was absolutely necessary to cross the stream
to reach the central portion of the park.

Certain questions involving the access of the public to the park, are
still pending and are connected with the plan of the suburban roads
now under consideration by the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia. The street railways are by no means convenient, as the
Fourteenth street line is over half a mile distant from the park, and the
Rock Creek Railway, although passing by the western gate of the park,
delivers its passengers at a distance almost as great from the buildings
where the animals are kept. The plan for the extension of the streets
of the District, includes a carriage road outside the park from the
point where the Adams Mill Road leaves it to Kennesaw Avenue.
When this is once established the strip of ground between it and
the park boundary should be purchased and added to the park.
This will be of advantage in many ways, first, for seclusion by pre-
venting private property from abutting upon the park and second, as
making more secure the eliff in the vicinity of the bear pits, which has
always been a menace and a serious disadvantage because of its prox-
imity to the park line, and the impossibility of properly treating it.

Further steps will probably be soon taken toward establishing
entrances at the southern end of the park. If this be done it will prob-
ably be necessary to improve the old Adams Mill Road, and to build
a second bridge crossing from the promontory where the office now
stands to the meadow near the animal house.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oo

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Iam gratified to state that the researches conducted here have con-
tinued to fulfill the expectations held out in previous reports. I believe
that the results attained may be stated to be the most important which
have ever been reached in regard to that region of the spectrum of
which so little is known, and which includes the greater portion of all
those energies of the sun which, through its heat, affect climate and
the crops, and are thus related not only to questions of abstract interest
but to utilities of national importance. The interest aroused by these
researches among men of science has been very gratifying, and it is
hoped that it may be found that no money granted by the Government
for scientific investigation has been more profitably employed than this,
even in the restricted point of view of the merely utilitarian advantages
which may be hoped from it.

For a more particular account of these recent results I refer to the
report of the Observatory.

Mr. kh. C. Child was appointed aid in the Observatory on September
1, 1893, and Mr. F. EK. Fowle, jr., as photographer, on June 1, 1894.
Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth resigned the position of senior assistant in
the Observatory on June 1, 1894.

Respectfully subinitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: In accordance with the provision of Congress, the Report of the National
Museum is published as the second volume of the Smithsonian Report. I shall here
refer briefly to only a few of the most important features of the operations of the
Museum during the year.

Accessions.—More than 171,000 specimens have been added to the collections. This
is more than double the total for last year, a gratifying result, 1n view of the fact
that very little direct effort was made to increase the collections.

Important collections have been received, as in past years, from the Geological
Survey, the Fish Commission, the Bureau of Ethnology, and other Bureaus of the
Government. Several valuable collections have been received from private sources,
and some very interesting material was presented by representatives of foreign
Governments to the National Museum at the close of the World’s Columbian
Exposition.

The detailed report for the year will contain a statistical statement showing the
number of specimens added during the year to each department, and for each year
since the opening of the Museum building.

The scientific staf.—The scientific staff is substantially the same as last year. A
few changes and additions have occurred in the curatorships. Having, as Assistant
Secretary, resumed the active direction of the affairs of the Museum, the designation
of Mr. True was on May 9 changed from Curator-in-charge to Executive Curator,
with special duties of administration. The Executive Curator may at times be called
upon totake general charge inmy absence. On July 15, Dr. C. H. White, U.S. N., was
recalled from his custodianship of the materia medica collections by the Secretary of
the Navy. Dr. C. U. Gravatt was detailed in his place, and served until January 22,
when he was relieved by Dr. R. A. Marmion, who was succeeded on June 15 by Medical
Inspector Daniel McMurtrie, the present incumbent. Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the
United States Geological Survey, was on May 7 appointed honorary aid in the Depart-
ment of Paleozoic Fosils. Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the Department of Agriculture, was
on March 17 appointed honorary curator of the helminthological collections.

Dr. Frank Baker resigned his position as honorary curator of the Department of
Comparative Anatomy in order to devote his entire time to his duties as Superin-
tendent of the National Zoological Park, and Mr. Frederick A. Lucas, assistant
curator of that department, was on November 21 appointed curator. Dr. Baker is
now recognized as associate curator. On January 1 Mr. Wirt Tassin was appointed
assistant curator in the Department of Minerals, filling the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Mr. William 8. Yeates.

Distribution of specimens.—F ollowing the custom of previous years, the transmission
of duplicate specimens to educational establishments has been continued, and it is

41
o
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

gratifying to note that, in comparison with last year, more than double the number
of specimens has been thus distributed. Of the 27,168 specimens thus disposed of, a
large proportion represent invertebrate forms of marine life. Several sets of rocks
and ores, minerals, and casts of prehistoric objects, as well as a few special collec-
tions of insects, fishes, birds, mollusks, and other material, were included. In addi-
tion, 1,448 specimens were lent to investigators for special study.

It has for many years been the intention of the Museum to make up a number of
duplicate sets in all the departments of the Museum, to be used in supplying educa-
tional institutions. Applications for specimens are received almest every day.
That valuable service could be rendered to colleges and schools in this way does not
admit of doubt, but it is impossible to carry out such a plan until the curators can
be supplied with the services of competent assistants to relieve them of the work of
sorting out the duplicates and arranging them into sets for distribution. And this
can not be arranged until Congress sees fit to make a large increase in the Museum
appropriation.

In order to give an idea of the extent to which this branch of the Museum work
has been carried on, even with the very limited facilities now at hand, it may be
stated that since 1871 about 370,000 specimens have thus been distributed.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building during the
year was 103,910, and to the Museum building 195,748.

Publications.—The report of the Museum for 1891 was published during the year,
and also, in the form of separates, a limited edition of each paper in the appendix.
The report for 1892 is nearly ready for delivery, and the separate editions of the
papers in the appevlix have already been issued. Volumes 15 and 16 of the Pro-
ceedings have appeared in bound form, and a few papers included in volume 17 have
been published as separates. Of the Bulletin, the following numbers have been
published: No. 43, A Monograph of the Bats of North America, by Harrison Allen,
M. D.; No. 44, Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Superfamily Noctuids found in
Boreal America, by John B. Smith; No. 45, The Myriapoda of North America, by
Charles Harvey Bollman; No, 46, Monograph of the North American Proctotrypide,
by William H. Ashmead.

Special Bulletin No. 2, Oceanic Ichthyology, by the writer and Tarleton H. Bean,
isin type. This work constitutes a monograph of the deep-sea and pelagic fishes
of the world. The material for No. 5 of this series is in course of preparation by
Maj. Charles Bendire. It will be a continuation of the subject of No. 1, Life
Histories of North American Birds, and will treat of the cuckoos, woodpeckers,
goat suckers, swifts, humming birds, flycatchers, horned larks, crows, jays, mag-
pies, blackbirds, orioles, and grackles.

I have elsewhere referred to the pressing necessity of an increase in the appropria-
tion for printing.

Specimens transmitted to the Museum for identification.—During the year 478 lots of
specimens were received fordetermination. Very little of this material can be advan-
tageously incorporated with the collections, and therefore the Museum receives but
little actual gain from this work, which occupies a large proportion of the time of
several of the curators, notably inthe Department of Geology. Requests for exami-
nation and report are, however, invariably complied with. Quantitative analyses,
however, can not be undertaken.

Foreign exchanges.—A number of exchanges have been affected with museums and
individuals in different parts of the world, and the National Museum has in this
manner acquired much valuable material. Among the institutions with which
these transactions have proved most advantageous to the Museum are the Australian
Museum, Sydney; Queensland Museum; Technological Museum of New South Wales;
National Museum of Costa Rica; Museum of Natural History, Paris; Imperial Royal
Museum of Vienna,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

Explorations.—The further explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott, in Kashmir,
India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands in the Indian Ocean, have resulted in addi-
tional important collections for the Museum. Several papers describing his collec-
tions have been published in the Proceedings of the National Museum.

Prof. O. F. Cook, of Huntington, N. Y., who is now traveling in Liberia, has
transmitted a large collection of ethnological objects and natural history specimens
from that country. ;

The researches in Finland of Hon, John M. Crawford, United States consul-general
at St.Petersburg, Russia, have resulted in the transmission of a most valuable col-
lection of ethnological objects. The collection was accompanied by a descriptive
list, minutely setting forth their uses.

Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., of Washington City, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson, of the
National Museum, during an exploring trip in the West Indies obtained for the
Museum a collection of Miocene marl and land shells.

The Intercontinental Railway Commission has presented to the Museum a large
collection of natural history specimens, obtained in Central America by Dr. W. C.
Shannon, U.S. A.

Mr. Mark B. Kerr, of New York City, has, in connection with his explorations in
Keuador, forwarded an interesting collection of natural history specimens from that
country.

A collection of reptiles and fishes, obtained by Dr. Einar Lénnberg, of Upsala,
Sweden, while engaged in an exploration of the coast of Florida, has been added to
the Museum collections. :

Large and varied collections have resulted from the explorations of Dr. Edgar A.
Mearns, U.S. A., who is still engaged in the work of the International Boundary
Commission.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: Ethnologie researches have been carried forward during the year in accord-
ance with act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating to
the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.”

The primary classification of the work is topical, and the researches pertaining
to each subject are divided between field studies and office work as circumstances
require. The chief lines of activity relate to (1) archeology, (2) descriptive eth-
nology, (3) sociology, (4) pictography and sign language, (5) linguistics, (6) myth-
ology, (7) psychology, and (8) bibliography, together with (9) publication, and the
ancillary exploratory and miscellaneous work.

The classification of the work is more definite than the assignment of the person-
nel, since circumstances from time to time require the concentration of a large part
of the energies of the Bureau on one or a few subjects, and thus special assignments
are made with advantage to the work and, it is believed, without injury, and indeed
commonly with benefit, to the workers.

EXPLORATION.

The most extended exploratory work of the year was that of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff
in connection with archeologie surveys in the Pueblo country of New Mexico and
Arizona. He left Washington early in July, 1893, and, outfitting at Holbrook, Ariz.,
proceeded to the Hopi villages of Tusayan, and toward the end of August to the
valley of the Little Colorado, which he explored in some detail. Contrary te
expectations this region was found to be poor in relics of the aborigines; only a few
small and unimportant ruins are scattered over the valley, and the sites were appar-
ently occupied for short periods only. It is noteworthy, that according to Hopi
tradition, it was along a valley tributary to the Little Colorado that the large tim-
bers used in the construction of the Spanish churches and mission buildings prior to
1680 were transported on the backs of Indians from San Francisco Mountains, nearly
100 miles away, and that this tradition appears to find corroboration in Mr. Minde-
leff’s observation of a party of Tusayan Indians transporting poles from the foot-
hills of the same mountains over the same route by the use of burros. The reason
for the dearth of ruins gradually became apparent as the explorations were con-
tinued; the topography about the Little Colorado and the character of the stream
itseif are such that its waters could not be controlled for purposes of irrigation by
any means at the command of ancient pueblo builders; even modern engineering
skill has thus far failed to control the stream, although many efforts in this direction
have been made.

Only at intervals are there flood plain lands suitable for primitive cultivation
and within easy reach of irrigation devices, and in such placesruins are usualiy found.
This is notably the case near the old Sunset crossing, where, perched on the hills
overlooking the flood plain, can be seen the ruins of ten or more villages, the largest
of which would have accommodated a population of 200. The ground plan of this
village shows a number of rectangular rooms, the whole bearing a strong resem-
blance to the plan of ruins found near the Tusayan villages. Tradition recites that

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

this village (or possibly a neighboring one) was called Homalobi, and was occupied
by the Water gens, the last to reach Tusayan. The indications are that the period
of occupancy was short.

Mr. Mindeleff found the river at Mormon crossing or ‘‘ the Crossing of the Fathers”
too high for fording, and his party proceeded with difficulty along the northern
bank to the old Sunset crossing near Winslow. After fording at this point, the
yarty proceeded to Camp Verde, crossing the Mogollon Mountains by way of Sunset
and Chavez passes. At Camp Verde an old field outfit was taken up and the party
returned by way of Flagstaff, reaching Little Colorado River at the mouth of San
Francisco wash. This region was formerly a favorite hunting ground of the
Tusayan, large parties leaving the villages to hunt antelope and other game so
recently as ten years ago; but the game has nearly disappeared, and the annual
hunting parties of the Tusayan Indians are now but amemory. From San Francisco
wash the party followed the southern branch of the river to Winslow, and the
northern side thence to Holbrook.

Leaving Holbrook early in October, Mr. Mindeleff proceeded northward toward
Canyon de Chelly. Advantage was taken of the opportunity to examine the local-
ity of a supposed ruin some 35 miles north of Holbrook, concerning which rumors
have been current for several years, and the supposed ruin was found to be a nat-
ural dike rising from the summit of a low hill as a wall of black basalt over 100
feet long, generally less than 2 feet thick, and sometimes 18 feet high. Near its
western end the remains of a habitation consisting of one or two rooms was found,
the ground being strewn with potsherds. So striking is this dike that the Navajo
guide insisted, even when standing before it, that it is artificial; yet examination
leaves no doubt as to its real character. Canyon de Chelly was reached about the
middle of October, and detailed examination of its cliff ruins was begun at once and
continued nearly to the end of December. More than sixty ruins were examined, and -
ground plans of many of them were made and a large series of photographs were
taken. The results of this survey, which is summarized elsewhere, are of great
interest.

Leaving Canyon.de Chelly in December, the party proceeded by way of Pueblo
Colorado and Fort Defiance, to San Juan River, where it was planned to winter. In
crossing Tunicha Mountains a snowstorm of unprecedented severity for the season
was encountered, and the party missed the trail and for a time were lost; among other
accidents a wagon was overturned in such manner that Mr. Mindeleff was caught
beneath it and his shoulder dislocated, whereby he was disabled for some months.
Fortunately the expedition was rescued by a party of ranchmen from Fort Defi-
ance, organized for the purpose when the severity of the storm was realized. The
success of the expedition and even the preservation of the lives of its members must
be ascribed largely to the humanity which inspired the rescue party and the energy
with which they pushed into the mountains, rendered almost impassable by the
snow and wind. The expcdition reached San Juan River a few days later, and soon
after disbanded. ;

When able to resume work Mr. Mindeleff began a reconnoissance of San Juan
Valley, not completed at the end of the fiscal year. This district was found rich in
ruins, mainly of a type resembling the oldest ruins in Canyon de Chelly. San Juan
Valley is terraced, and the river itself is a swift mountain stream, and conditions
are thus favorable for irrigation by primitive as well as civilized men. The detailed
surveys here were accordingly extended and resulted in substantial contributions to
the archeology of southwestern United States.

Mr. James Mooney spent some months, beginning with July, on the Kiowa Reser-
vation in Indian Territory, and subsequently visited the Arapahoe and Cheyenne
Indians for the purpose of collecting information concerning habits and customs as
well as beliefs and languages. He was provided with a graphophone, by means of
which he was able to record a number of aboriginal songs, both with and without
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

instrumental accompaniments, and in single voice effects as well asin chorus. Alto-
gether he spent five months in field work, of which part was exploratory.

Col. Garrick Mallery spent the greater part of the month of September among the
Indians of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota for the purpose of -veri-
fying and correcting notes obtained through correspondence.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman spent July and August and a portion of September among the
Ottawa Indians near Petoskey, Mich., the Ojibwa Indians at La Pointe Reservation,
Wis., and the Menomoni Indians at Keshena in the same State, and among the several
tribes information pertaining to their customs and beliefs was obtained.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey spent the month of January, 1894, on the Kwapa Reservation
in Indian Territory, investigating the social organization of the tribe and recording
their myths and traditions.

During the earlier part of the year the Director took advantage of opportunities
growing out of work in connection with the Geolegical Survey on the Pacific Coast to
visit several Indian tribes and to continue his researches relating to their habits,
myths, and languages.

ARCH AOLOGY.

Mr. W. H. Holmes was occupied throughout the year in arch:eologic researches,
’ chiefly in eastern United States. The first half of July was spent in organizing the
work of the year, and later he proceeded to different points in Delaware Valley for
the purpose of continuing studies of ancient quarries and quarry shops. A new
quarry shop was discovered on Delaware River, 15 miles above Trenton, yielding
rejects corresponding precisely with the objects so abundantly found in the gravels
on which the city of Trenton is built, and which were formerly classed as paleoliths.
Subsequently he visited a number of interesting localities in Ohio, giving especial
attention to the gravels at Newcomerstown, in or apparently in which an artificially
shaped stone has been found, this being the only case now strongly held to indicate
the existence of man during the Glacial period in this country.

In October he visited an island in Potomac River, near Point of Rocks, flooded by
arecent freshet in such manner as to lay bare an ancient village and aboriginal
workshop. This workshop proved of considerable interest in that here unmistak-
able indication was found for the first time that blocks of stone were used as anvils
in the production of certain classes of stone implements and weapons.

During February he directed the exploitation, by Mr. William Dinwiddie, of an
aboriginal steatite quarry near Clifton, Va. This quarry was found especially
instructive by reason of its large size, the great number of partly completed utensils
found within the opening and in the neighboring dump heap, and in the excellence
of its preservation,

In April Mr. Holmes, accompanied by Mr. McGee, repaired to an interesting site
near the mouth of Pass Creek, not far from Luray, Va., for the purpose of collect-
ing additional data relating to a noteworthy series of stone art products, to which
attention was called during the preceding fiscal year by Mr. Gerard Fowke.

A considerable additional collection was made and an aboriginal cemetery was
discovered in a neighboring field, and from it a typical collection of mortuary pot-
tery was taken. The stone art products in this locality are of exceptional interest,
as the “turtleback” forms are rejects from the manufacture of celts. The rejects
hitherto studied by Mr. Holmes represent, exclusively or predominantly, narrow-
pointed instruments such as spear points or arrow heads, while those found at the
mouth of Pass Creek represent predominantly the manufacture of broad and thin
pointed objects. <A sufficiently complete series of rejects and nearly completed .
forms to illustrate all stages in manufacturing was brought together.

Mr. McGee extended the observations from this locality up Pass Creek with the
purpose of discovering the original source of the stream pebbles and cobbles used by
the primitive artisans, and was rewarded by finding, well toward the head waters
of the stream, a large mass of intrusive rock, from which the pebbles were originally
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

derived. This part of the study also proved of exceptional interest, as it indicated
the delicacy with which the Indian manutacturer adjusted himself to his environ-
ment; in situ the rock is too massive and obdurate for working by primitive meth-
ods; in the upper reaches of the stream the bowlders derived from parent ledges are
too large for reduction without the use of metal; below the confluence of Pass
Creek with the Hawksbill the pebbles are too small and too scant for profitable
working; while just above the confluence, at the site discovered by Mr. Fowke, the
pebbles are at the same time of suitable size and sufficiently abundant for easy
working by primitive methods—in short, the best and, indeed, the only feasible site
for the aboriginal factory was that selected for the purpose. The material is a
peculiarly tough and strong crystalline rock, which flakes fairly well oooe is at the
same time adapted to battering and grinding.

During the first three months of the year Mr. Gerard Fowke was occupied, under
Mr. Holmes’s general instructions but under the immediate direction of the ethnolo-
gist in charge, in making collections from the little known but highly interesting
interior shell mounds in the valley of Tennessee River. This work yielded excellent
results, particularly in the form of material collected for the enrichment of the National
Museum. The collections were duly cleaned, prepared, and tabulated, and trans-
ferred to the Museum by Mr. Henry Walther.

Mr. William Dinwiddie, under Mr. Holmes’s immediate direction, spent the greater
part of the months of July, August, and September in archeologic reconnoissance
along the shores and tributaries of Chesapeake Bay with the object of demarking
more exactly by art products the territory belonging respectively to the different
peoples. His work also yielded abundant collections for the enrichment of the
National Museum for the benefit of contemporary and future students.

During February and March, as already noted, Mr. Dinwiddie was occupied in
investigating the aboriginal steatite quarry at Clifton, Va. The quarry was
cleared and its walls and floors were found to yield numerous and characteristic
traces of primitive workmanship; a rich collection of broken and partially finished
utensils was made; a good series of photographs, showing with unprecedented aceu-
racy the details of the quarrying and manufacturing operations, was taken; a num-
ber of the tools used in the work were found, while the entire collection has been
brought together for study and preservation in the National Museum. ‘The more
general results of the investigation of this quarry have been incorporated in
reports by Mr. Holmes, while a detailed paper on the subject is in preparation by Mr.
Dinwiddie.

The results of the work by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff in New Mexico and Arizona are
of much importance. The examination of over sixty ruins in Canyon de Chelly veri-
fies the conclusion previously reached by the same investigator that the cliff dwell-
ings here were primarily farming outlooks, and that the home villages were commonly
located on wholly indefensible sites on the ec: vunyon bottom. It was found that the ruins
are divisible into several groups, apparently representing a chronologic sequence, In
the later ruins highly suggestive details are found illustrating the gradual assimila-
tion of introduced or accultural ideas. Among other results there was obtained a
series of drawings and photographs showing the development of chimney structure
from the first crude attempts to imitate a form known only from casual observation
and description to a more finished structure. though the most finished product was
far from perfect, while the first attempts were exceedingly crude. Mr. Mindeleft
was led to conclude that the foreign ideas exemplified in the chimneys and other
structures were introduced in the architecture of Canyon de Chelly at a late period
of the occupancy of the territory, probably only a few decades before its abandon-
ment. Other details, such as the constructive use of adobe, were traced through the
various stages of development in the same way; and some ruins were found in which
the old and the new ideas find expression side by side in such manner as to indicate
that the village was occupied before the introduction of the foreign ideas, and that
the occupancy continued until after the ideas were definitely crystallized.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

One interesting group or series of ancient ruins was found, which had apparentiy
been overlooked by previous visitors. They occur in the upper part of the canyon
and »re nearly obliterated. The structures were always located on sites deter-
mined wholly by agricultural necessity and methods without reference to defensive
ends. Mr. Mindeleff is of opinion that these are the oldest ruins in the canyon
belonging to the initial period of occupancy, which extended over many decades.
Close attention was given also to a number of large ruins situated in the canyon
bottom without reference to defense, also overlooked by previous explorers. These
differ from the preceding type and are in some respects the most important ruins of
the canyon. They apparently represent the home pueblos occupied contemporane-
ously with the cliff dwellings, and bore the same relation to the latter that Zuni
bears to Nutria, Pescado, and Ojo Caliente, or that Oraibi bears to Moen Kopi. The
cliff dwellings were apparently occupied as a rule only during the summer months,
the occupants resorting to the pueblos during the winter. Thus the cliff dwellings
appear to represent a phase rather than a chronologic epoch in the history of the
pueblo builders.

Although the researches are not yet completed, Mr. Mindeleff is of opinion that
while some of the ruins may be precolumbian others were undoubtedly occupied in
the seventeenth century, and that the occupancy was probably continuous as regards
the district, though probably not continuous as regards particular tribes or sub-
tribes. A general result of the study was the classification of the various types of
ruins, ina chronologic order, in such manner that the history of the canyon from
the earliest occupancy up to the recent advent of English-speaking settlers is
clearly indicated. In combining the data acquired in Canyon De Chelly with those
obtained from Rio Verde during previous years, Mr. Mindeleff finds reason for the
conclusion that the ruins of the former district represent the first settlements in the
San Juan country, and that further developments will be found in the tributary
valleys, and also that the large communal buildings on the tributaries of the San
Juan, representing the highest architectural art attained by the pueblo builders,
will prove to be the ultimate form of the primitive village of this district.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas completed the revision of proofs of text and
illustrations of his report on mound explorations, and the work was put through the
press as the body of the twelfth annual report. The document comprises much
information relating to the Indian mounds of the Mississippi Valley and eastern
United States, and if seems reasonable to hope that the monograph may come to be
regarded as a standard source of information on the subject. Subsequently Dr.
Thomas gave special attention to the hieroglyphs and codices of the Maya—the
ancient inhabitants of Yucatan. One of the results of the work is the demonstration
that the time system recorded in the Dresden codex is precisely the same as that men-
tioned by the early Spanish authors, except that the years begin with what are con-
sidered the last instead of the first of the four-year series. It is also shown that this
brings the calendar of the Dresden codex into harmony with the calendars recorded
at Palenque, Lorillard City, and Tikal. A portion of the results of Dr. Thomas’s
work on this subject is published in one of the bulletins of the Bureau, a brochure
of 64 pages, entitled ‘‘The Maya Year.” Other results are incorporated in a bulletin
on the origin and significance of the calendric terms, which is not yet completed.

During the year Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson, of Philadelphia, was occupied in arche-
ologic researches, chiefly in Guatemala and eastern Mexico, under the provision of
the De Laincel fund and under the general supervision of the Director of the Bureau.
Some of the resultsof his interesting researches have been made public through
various scientific journals.

Specially noteworthy among the results of the archeologic work in the Bureau
during the current year are the monographs by Mr. Holmes on ancient pottery of
eastern United States and stone art of eastern United States. Both embrace the
results of researches extending over many years; both are elaborately illustrated

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

from material preserved in the National Museum; both represent the mature conclu-
sions of an able and carefully trained archwologist. The classification and interpre-
tation adopted by Mr. Holmes are primarily indigenous, though his comparative
studies have extended over the archeologic literature of the world, and it is believed
that his conclusions will form a firm basis for those branches of archeology to which
his work relates. To him science is indebted for a consistent method of interpret-
ing primitive art products through study of the arts of primitive peoples cognate
to those whose relics have come down to us trom prehistoric times. It was with
ereat regret that the Director accepted his resignation.from the Bureau toward the
end of the fiscal year, in order that he might transfer his labors to the Field Colum-
bian Museum.
DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

An important line of work in the Bureau for some years past has been the collec-
tion and systematic arrangement of tribal names and characteristics, with brief
description of the habits, customs, arts, beliefs, and institutions of the aborigines.
The information thus collected has been recorded on cards under the head of Tribal
Synonymy.

During the last year Mr. F. W. Hodge devoted several months to the descriptive
ethnology of several southwestern families, the Piman, Tanoan, Keresan, and Zunian
stocks receiving chief attention. Advantage was taken of the presence in Wash-
ington of Mr. Carl Lumholtz, who has spent several seasons among the tribes of
Chihuahua, to obtain valuable information relating to the Tarahumar, Tepehuan,
and Tubar Indians for use in the synongmy of the Piman stock. Mr. Hodge’s lit-
erary research during the year has enabled him satisfactorily “to identify the
obscurely recorded Jumano of the early Spanish explorers with the Comanche of
more recent date. In connection with the condensed descriptions contained in the
systematic work, Mr. Hodge has made progress in the preparation of a bibliography
of the Pueblo Indians, designed to serve as a basis for further research concerning
this interesting portion of our aboriginal population.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey made a number of important additions to the portion of the
tribal synonymy relating to the Siouan tribes, and Mr. James Mooney devoted some
time to classifying and extending the material already obtained relating to the
Cherokee Indians. Mr. Albert S. Gatschet also made contributions to this work.

Although the collection of material for the general descriptive ethnology of the
tribal synonymy of the American Indians was commenced some years since, and
although a large body of information has been collected and arranged on cards for
office use, publication has not yet been undertaken, partly by reason of the great
volume of the material, partly because the work is of such character as not soon to be
completed, since each new investigation yields additional information; but within
the past five years the records have been found so useful, and the demand for
information contained therein so extensive, that a plan for publication has been
formulated.

In accordance with this plan the material will be arranged by linguistic stocks and
published in bulletin form in the order of completion, each bulletin comprising a
stock. In addition to the usual pagination the bulletins devoted to the subject will
be consecutively paged (at bottom) for the series, and it is proposed to complete the
series by a bulletin so arranged as to form at the same time an index to the whole
and an abbreviated dictionary of the tribal and other names used by the American
Indians. In accordance with this plan the materials pertaining to a number of the
stocks have been made ready for the press, with the exception of brief introductions
which remain to be written.

During the first half of the fiscal year Dr. W. J. Hoffman continued the investi-
gation of the Menomoni and related Indians in field and office and prepared an
elaborate memoir, entitled ‘‘The Menomoni Indians,” which has been submitted for
publication in the fourteenth annual report. This tribe, located in northeastern

SM 94——4
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

Wisconsin, has long been known in a general way, but has received little scientific
study. Dr. Hoffman’s memoir embraces a history of the tribe from their discovery
by Nicollet in 1634 to the present day, including the several treaties made with the
Federal Government; it includes also the genealogies of the two rival lines of hered-
itary chiefs, together with an exposition of the ceremonials of the several cult soci-
eties, and of the mythology, industries, arts, and manufactures of the tribe.

SOCIOLOGY.

From time to time during the year the Director found opportunity for collecting
additional information relating to the institutions of the American Indians and for
the elaboration of material collected during previous years. Mr. McGee also made
progress in the arrangement of material pertaining to this subject gathered by
various collaborators. Mr. James Mooney spent several months in the field collect-
ing information relating to the Kiowa, Caddo, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, of
which a large part is sociologic. In addition he prepared during the year a memoir
onthe Siouan Tribes of the East, which has been sent to press as one of the series of
bulletins of the Bureau. In this paper the relations and movements of the tribes
recorded by early explorers and settlers of eastern United States are analyzed and,
after comparative study for the purpose of combining the various consistent records
and eliminating the uncertainties due to vague geographic and ethnographic records,
grouped as a consistent body of information relating to the aboriginal land-holders
of cisappalachian United States. The memoir represents much patient research
among early maps and throughout the earliest literature of the United States. It
is enriched by synonymy of the various tribes of the district, and incidentally con-
siderable information relating to the organization and social institutions of these
tribes is incorporated.

PICTOGRAPHY AND SIGN LANGUAGE,

Theearlier part of the year was spent by Col. Garrick Mallery in revising the
proots of his monograph on Picture Writing of the American Indians, which has
since been published in the tenth annual report of the Bureau. Some years were
devoted by Colonel Mallery to the collection of information on this subject and the
subject of sign language and gesture specch among the aborigines, and this mono-
graph represents the product of labors in the interesting line of research to which it
appertains. By reason of the invasion of white men, many of the primitive customs
of the Indians have been modified and some have been lost; and in few directions
is the modification more complete than in that of inseribing records on rocks and
other surfaces; and it has been the purpose to render this work as complete an expo-
sition of the crude graphic art of the American Indian as it is possible to make at
this time. Itis believed that the work will be found practically exhaustive and a
standard source of information. During the remaining portion of the year Colonel
Mallery has been engaged in the preparation of acompanion monograph on the sign-
language of the American Indians. The material for this work is even more evanes-
cent than that drawn on in the preparation of the preceding work; but the author’s
studies have extended over many years and a large part of western America, and he
has been favored by rich contributions from correspondents of the office. The work
is fully illustrated, as is necessary, since it is only by graphic presentation that
definite ideas concerning the multiform gestures and motions used in primitive inter-
change of thought can be clearly expressed. The monograph is approaching com-
pletion

LINGUISTICS.

The languages of the American Indians have received a large share of the atten-
tion of the Bureau ever since its institution. It has been the policy to collect texts
and vocabularies and material for grammars as rapidly and extensively as possible
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

before the disappearance of the primitive languages. Only a small part of the
material so collected has been published; but the vaults of the Bureau are rich in
data pertaining to the languages of many tribes representing most of the linguistic
stocks of the American Indians. Perhaps on no other continent has the linguistic
diversification of primitive peoples been wider than in northern America, and the
dialectic variations are hardly Jess striking. The aboriginal languages of this con-
tinent accordingly give an admirable opportunity for the study of the facts and
causes of linguistic development; and from the beginning it was deemed important
to collect the largest possible body of material for examination and discussion in its
bearing on the general subject. Carrying out the general policy, only subordinate
attention has been given to publication, and publication has been made only in
cases in which the material seemed especially typical or exceptionally complete.
Thus, while the amount of linguistic material published is not voluminous, the
manuscripts constantly accessible for purposes of study are abundant—richer, it is
believed, than any other body of linguistic records of a primitive people.

Mr. A. S. Gatschet devoted the entire year to linguistic work. Early in the year
he was employed in translating texts and in extracting lexie and grammatic ele-
ments of the Peoria and Shawano languages, recorded by him during the preceding
two years. This work gave abundant opportunities for comparing the two tongues
with the forty or fifty other dialects of the Algonquian stock, and the interesting
results of the comparison were embodied ina comparative vocabulary of the Algon-
quian languages. By this comparison the intimate relations between the dialects is
strikingly shown and at the same time the multiplicity of forms into which the
original tongues has been diversified has been brought out. Morphologically the
Algonquian tongue is built on a purely nominal basis, yet in the various dialects ¢
wide variety of ideas are expressed with surprising perfection. In all the Algon-
quian dialects verbal roots combine with other verbal roots in a single word giving
a peculiar and forcible expression to the verbal form, The compounding of words is
further extended by numerous adjectival suffixes descriptive of quality, these suffixes
indicating whether the noun qualified by such an adjective is an animate or inani-
mate subject, and showing whether complexion, size, age, or other qualities are to
be determined. This method of adjectival suffixes extends also to the numerals, and
in some dialects there are special suffixes to qualify numeral cardinals as determin-
ing animate or inanimate objects in the plural. Mr. Gatschet’s recent studies have
brought out the fact that the Algonquian languages of the western group (Arapahoe,
Cheyenne, and Siksika) differ considerably in their phonetics from the eastern dia-
lects, these differences being especially shown in the nasalization found among the
western representatives of the stock.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey spent the earlier part of the year in office work on the Biloxi
language, completing its systematic arrangement for preservation and reference,
He also revised the proofs of Contributions to North American Ethnology, Volume IX
(Riggs’s ‘“‘ Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography”), as well as his own memoir,
entitled ‘‘A Study of Siouan Cults,” in the eleventh annual report of the Bureau.
Both of these documents have now been published. The month of January was
spent on the Kwapa Reservation in Indian Territory in investigating the social organ-
ization of the tribes and recording their myths and traditions in the form of texts.
After his return from the field these texts were translated literally, but the prepara-
tion of explanatory notes and free translations was deferred. Some time was spent
in the elaboration of a list of the characters required for recording the various sounds
in the Siouan, Athapascan, and other linguistic families; in this work he had fora
time the assistance of a skilled oriental linguist, Dr. J. J. Nouri, from whom he
obtained for comparative purposes many of the peculiar sounds of the Semitic and
other Eastern languages. Some time was spent also in the examination of supposed
linguistic affinities between the Maya and Malay languages, and during the year he
recorded in final form eight Winnebago texts, dictated by Philip Longtail. Subse-
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

quently literal translations of these texts were made, and the preparatior of explana-
tory notes and free English translations was begun and the lexic elements were
extracted.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied during the earlier part of the year in researches
concerning the social relations recorded in the Iroquois language and the literature
relating to the people. In the course of this work it was shown that the independ-
ence of the tribe in local affairs was little if at all curtailed by the confederation of
the Five Nations, certain gentes being privileged from the beginning of the histori-
cal leagues (for there were undoubtedly several) to nominate lord-chiefs and vice-
chiefs to the league councils. Subsequently Mr. Hewitt made examination of the
data for the classification of the Waijilatpuan and Shahaptian groups of languages.
Despite the paucity of the linguistic material, he found that the groups display
peculiarities apparently due rather to divergent growth than to original diversity,
this being exceptionally true of the position of the attributing or predicating word
in the word-sentences or compound stems. In the lexicon the Shahaptian dialects
show specific superficial differences from the Waillatpuan group, but nevertheless a
large and important number of stems pertaining to the former, which have the same
or cognate significance, accord substantially in sound or form with terms in the lat-
ter; there are, moreover, in many of the dialects striking proofs of the effects of dis-
cordant linguistic growth. The general result of the study was to prove that the
two groups of languages have had a common history in part; and this conclusion
has been provisionally accepted in the classification of linguistic material in the
Bureau vaults. Other important studies relating to the affinities of the aboriginal
languages of northwestern America were successfully carried forward. Mr. Hewitt
also aided in the linguistic comparison of the Maya and Malayan terms collected by
Dr. Thomas. Some time was given also to the arrangement and transliteration of
the Tubar material collected by Dr. Carl Lumholtz in Mexico, with a view to publi-
cation. This collection, although not large, is of a special interest, since it was
obtained from the last three surviving representatives of the tribe who alone survive.
During the last months of the year Mr. Hewitt made a fruitful study of the so-called
irregular or anomalous verb in the Tuskarora or Mohawk dialects.

In connection with memoirs on the Menomoni Indians, already noted, Dr. Hoff-
man compiled a considerable vocabulary representing the language of this tribe.

In addition to the Tubar material in part transliterated by Mr. Hewitt, Dr. Carl
Lumholtz turned over to the Bureau the vocabularies collected from the Tarahumar
and Tepehuan tribes occupying the mountainous portions of the state of Chihuahua,
in the Republic of Mexico. Several other valuable contributions to the linguistic
material of the Bureau were made during the year. Among these may be mentioned
amanuscript of more than a thousand pages representing the vocabulary and gram-
mar of the Nez Perce Indians of Idaho, collected by the late Miss 8. L. McBeth and
kindly transmitted to the Bureau by her sister, Miss Kate C. McBeth.

MYTHOLOGY.

The myths and cognate beliefs of the American aborigines are of exceptional inter-
est, since they exemplify m many cases the influence of environment on the minds
of the devotees, and in some cases, moreover, the myths indicate the migrations of
the peoples among whom they are found. Accordingly, the studies by Mrs. Steven-
son and Mr. Cushing of the mythology of the Pueblo tribes, particularly that of the
Zuni, are of utmost importance in American anthropology.

Having completed his work in arranging the exhibits of the Bureau of American
Ethnology at the World’s Fair, Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing returned to Washing-
ton and resumed researches in mythology about the middle of September. Almost
continuously since that time he has, in conjunction with Mr. Stewart Culin, of the
University of Pennsylvania, whose attention has long been devoted to the games of
the Orient, carried forward a study of the origin of aboriginal games, based on his
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

intimate acquaintance with the games of the Zuni and a knowledge gained by his
investigations at the World’s Fair.

A study of these primitive games reveals the fact that they were not played for
amusement, as among civilized people, but chiefly for divination, which was prac-
ticed in connection with industries and enterprises of all sorts; so that divinatory
games occupied a prominent place in the thoughts and exercised an important
influence on the daily life of these people. It was. also found that in the Orient the
games were actually played with arrows and were still recognized as arrow games
by the players themselves as late as the eleventh or twelfth centuries B. C., thus
giving historic evidence of the arrow origin of lot and dice games in the Orient, and
confirming, in Mr. Culin’s estimation, Mr. Cushing’s hypothesis as to the identical
origin of such games in America. These researches have also brought to light many
significant facts bearing on the usages, beliefs, and ethnic relations of early peoples,
and the material result of the investigation is an elaborate paper on ‘‘Arrrow games
and their variants in America and the Orient,” under the joint authorship of Messrs,
Cushing and Culin, now well advanced in preparation. Mr. Cushing was greatly
aided in this work by Mr. Lows C. Moctezuma, an educated young Mexican, from
whom he obtained much information regarding the Indian games of his country.

Mr. Cushing has not allowed his researches relating to divinatory games com-
pletely to interrupt his more general studies relating to Zuni mythology, and during
the year has given special attention to the origin and primitive use of fire. Fire
myths are nearly universal and fire worship common among primitive peoples; and
it is the possession of fire making which perhaps more than any other characteristic
distinguishes mankind from the lower animals. The conquest of fire has not yet
been clearly traced, but Mr. Cushing’s researches are contributing materially to
knowledge of the subject.

The manuscript of Mr. Cushing’s paper bearing the title ‘‘Outlines of Zuni
creation myths” was brought to completion and at the close of the year was par-
tially in type as one of the accompanying papers of the Thirteenth Annual Report.

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, although partially disabled by overwork and
exposure during her last field season among the Sia Indians of New Mexico, began
in July the revision of the proofs of her article on that tribe which covered pages
3-157 of the eleventh annual report. On the completion of the proof reading, early
in September, Mrs. Stevenson continued the preparation of a report on certain myths
and ceremonials of the Zuni tribe, among whom she has spent a number of seasons.
Notwithstanding her ill health she succeeded in completing the preparation of most
of the illustrative material of the monograph and well advanced the final revision
of the text.

PSYCHOLOGY.

The Director has found opportunity for continuing his investigations in primitive
modes of thought, carried on during previous years. The result of these studies
was imparted to the members of the Bureau in a series of informal lectures for the
purpose of establishing a firmer and more definite basis for their researches in Indian
mythology and sociology.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The work on the bibliography of native American languages was continued by
Wr. James C. Pilling. Asin previous years much time was consumed in procuring
new material for the main catalogue, from which are prepared the bibliographies of
the various linguistic stocks. This work necessitates a careful review of all the
catalogue material relating to Americana generally—those of auction sales, of book-
sellers’ catalogues, of the reviews, ete.,—and these furnish brief titles, which are
used as memoranda for further research. In this manner several hundred new
titles have been added to the main catalogue during the year. For his painstaking
and untiring patience in this tedious task Mr. Pilling is receiving high praise. The
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

press reviews of the stock bibliographies already issued indicate the regard in which
they are held, for their incomparable completeness, by students in all parts of the
world.

During the last year there was issued a Bibliografia Espatiola de Lenguas indigena
de America, by the Comte de Vinaza, bearing the imprint Madrid, 1892. Although
issued years after the appearance of Mr. Pilling’s ‘‘ proof sheets,” and although the
compiler of the Bibliografia had unusual facilities, among them access to the archives
of Spain—an advantage enjoyed by few if any foreigners,—but seventy-five titles not
already containedin Mr. Pilling’s catalogue were found inthe Comte de Vinaza’s work.

The month of August was taken up by Mr. Pilling with an examination of the
plate proofs of the bibliography of the Salishan language, then ready for press, but
little correction worthy of notice was necessary. The bulletin, which comprises
86 pages and 4 facsimiles, was delivered by the Public Printer in the middle of
November.

During November work was renewed on the Wakashan bibliography. <A trip
extending over a few days was made to Lenox and Astor libraries, New York City,
some new material being obtained and defective titles corrected. The work was
forwarded to the Public Printer in January, and by the close of March the proof
reading was finished. This bibliography, which was ready for distribution early in
May, comprises 70 pages and 2 facsimiles. During the proof reading of the Waka-
shan bibliography the preparation of the bibliography of the Shahaptian languages
was begun, and at the close of the fiscal year was in an advanced stage of progress.

PUBLICATION.

During no similar period of the Bureau’s history have so many pages of ethno-
logic material been put in type. Since the close of the last fiscal year (1892-93) most
of the proof reading of the Tenth Annual Report was completed. The volume was
received from the printer in June, 1894. The monograph accompanying this report,
“Picture Writing of the American Indians,” by Garrick Mallery, covers 807 pages
and is illustrated by 54 plates and 1,290 figures. On July 27, 1893, the Eleventh
Annual Report was sent to the Public Printer, and before the close of October all the
proofs had been read. Proof reading of the Twelfth Annual Report was in progress
at the close of the year 1892-93, and continued until April, 1894. This report, which,
in addition to the administrative report of the Director, contains a paper by Mr.
Cyrus Thomas, entitled ‘‘ Report on the mound exploration of the Bureau of Eth-
nology,” was in the bindery at the close of the year. In February, 1894, the manu-
script of the Thirteenth Annual Report was sent to the Public Printer, and in June
the first proots were received. With the close of the fiscal year all the illustrations
for this annual had been engraved, and proof reading was well advanced.

At the close of the year 1892-93 the proof reading of the ‘ Bibliography of the
Salishan Languages,” by James Constantine Pilling, was almost completed. This
bulletin was delivered by the printer in November, 1895. The Bibliography of the
Wakashan Languages, by the same author, was sent to the printer in December,
1893; the first proofs were received in January, 1894; the proof reading was finished
in April, and the edition was delivered a month later.

Early in January of the present year the manuscript of a bulletin by Mr. John
Garland Pollard, on the Pamunkey Indians of Virginia, was sent to the Public
Printer, and by February 6 the final proofs had been revised. This bulletin was
delivered in April, 1894. '

At the close of the last fiscal year proof reading of Riggs’ ‘‘ Dakota Grammar,
Texts, and Ethnography,” which forms Contributions to North American Ethnology,
Volume IX, had been in progress about a month, and by the end of July the volume
was in page form.

The first proof of a bulletin entitled ‘‘The Maya Year,” by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, was
received early in February, 1894, the manuscript having been transmitted January
19. This brochure passed through the press and was delivered in May.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

In January, 1894, there was also sent to the Public Printer the manuscript of the
first of a proposed series of bulletins, entitled ‘‘Chinook Texts,” by Dr. Franz Boas.
The first proofs were received in March, and by July 1 176 pages and a number of
galleys were in type.

Another bulletin, ‘‘An Ancient Quarry in Indian Territory,” by William H. Holmes,
was sent to the Public Printer on February 17, and by the close of June the paper
was in type.

The following publications were received from press during the fiscal year:

Ninth Annual Report, for 1887-88, containing, in addition to the Director’s report
of 46 pages, the following papers: (1) ‘‘ Ethnological results of the Point Barrow expe-
dition,” by John Murdoch. Pages3 to 441, Pls. I-II, figs. 1-428. (2) ‘The medicine

MISCELLANEOUS.

Classification of manuscripts.—In the current appropriation for American Ethnology,
provision was made for rental of quarters for the use of the Bureau, and in accord-
ance therewith the sixth floor of the Adams Building on F street was leased, In addi-
tion to increased floor space for the use of its collaborators when not engaged in
field work, the Bureau now has two large fireproof vaults, in which has been safely
deposited the large body of valuable manuscript material in its possession, This
material, comprising over 1,400 specific linguistic papers, 60 miscellaneous linguistic
papers, and 236 manuscripts on miscellaneous ethnologic subjects, has been tenta-
tively catalogued by subject, linguistic family, and author, and another catalogue
alphabetically arranged by catalogue and unit is now being prepared.

World’s Columbian Exposition.—The labor of preparing theexhibit of the Bureau of
American Ethnology at the World’s Columbian Exposition was assigned to Mr. Wil-
liam H. Holmes, who was assisted by Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing. After directing
the installation of the collections Mr. Holmes returned to Washington, leaving to Mr,
Cushing the final arrangement of a number of lay figures which had been prepared
by Messrs. Holmes, Mooney, and Cushing. Mr. Cushing remained at the Exposition
in charge of the Bureau exhibit until the middle of September, meanwhile conduct-
ing the study of primitive American games noted above.

It is gratifying to be able to state that the figures and other collections
exhibited by the Bureau at the Chicago Exposition met with high praise from
every quarter. A report on these collections is in course of preparation by Mr.
Cushing with a view to publication.

Library.—F rom the time of the establishment of the Bureau until the autumn of
1893 the books received through gift, exchange, or purchase, were temporarily
deposited in the library of the Geological Survey. When the Bureau moved into
independent quarters Mr. Hodge, in connection with his work on synonymy, was
placed in charge of the library, which then numbered about 2,600 volumes. At the
close of the year the library had increased to 4,350 volumes, chiefly through exchange

APPENDIX III.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894.

It is confined, for the sake of convenient comparison, almost entirely to the pre-
sentation of statistics, compiled upon the plan established in 1888.

The Exchange Service has been conducted during the year under exceptionally dis-
advantageous conditions, owing to the decrease in the appropriation made by
Congress to the Institution for the conduct of the exchange operations, and also
owing to the fact that some of the Government bureaus transmitting large numbers
of documents were unable at the end of the year to reimburse the Institution, as
hitherto, for the expense incurred.

The actual number of packages received during the year was somewhat less than
during the year preceding, though the weight was considerably greater. This
decrease in the number of packages was due in part to the fact that toward the
close of the fiscal year, no deficiency appropriation having been passed by Congress,
it became necessary to restrict the operations of the Exchange Service, and to notify
a number of correspondents that it would be impracticable to transmit their
exchanges abroad until a further appropriation from Congress became available. A
further cause of the decrease was the discontinuance of the transmission in the
special Congressional Library exchange of a large number of small pamphlets or
orders from the War Department, occupying but a page or two each.

Notwithstanding this fact, it will be seen that 27 more cases were shipped abroad
than during any previous year.

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU.

The work of the Bureau is succinctly given in the annexed table, prepared in a

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

The apparent decrease in the number of correspondents shown in the following
table is to be explained from the fact that the present figures represent the actual
count of the ledger cards under the system adopted in 1892. The corresponding
figures in the table of last year represent the total number of correspondents on
both the new and old system of ledger cards.

For comparison with previous years, I add a statement from 1888 to 1894, which
will make apparent the growth in the service:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by
Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose and in part by appropria-
tions made to different Government departments or bureaus, either in their contin-
gent funds or in specific terms for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the
cost of transportation.

In addition to the transmission of its own documents the Government has under-
taken, through a treaty which was concluded at Brussels in 1886, and formally
ratitied and proclaimed by the President of the United States in 1889, the exchange
of the publications of learned societies in this and other countries and the Smith
sonian Institution has been recognized as the medium in the United States through
which this exchange is to be effected, other governments having established special
exchange bureaus for the purpose.

In 1878 the Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for
the publications sent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge
being necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution.
For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of like amount
to State institutions, from which a further small revenue has been derived.

As the same reasons for the continuance of this charge have existed to the present
time, the appropriations by Congress never having been sufficient to meet the entire
expense of the service, recommendation has frequently been made that the entire
appropriation allowed by the Government should be contained in a single item to the
Smithsonian Institution.

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the Exchange Service
for the fiscal year 1893-94 was in the following terms:

“For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United
States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,
including salaries or compensation of all necessary employés, fourteen thousand
five hundred dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian Insti-

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government
bureaus and other sources was $2,165.95, making the sum practically available for
the specific purpose of exchanges $16,665.95, while the expenses amounted to
$17,610.31, leaving a deficiency of $944.36.

An estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000 was submitted in
October, 1892, this sum being intended to include in a single appropriation various
small items in different appropriation bills, and also an item of $2,000 to cover the
expense of an immediate exchange of parliamentary documents with the countries
entering into the treaty at Brussels in 1886.

I would again call attention to the fact that no appropriation has been made for
this latter purpose.

CORRESPONDENTS.

As mentioned in previous reports, it became necessary in the latter part of 1891 to
provide for an addition to the series of ‘‘ ledger” cards upon which were entered all
packages sent or received from a given society or individual. A plan was approved
by which the cards were much reduced in size, the bulk of the older cards having
already become a matter of serious consideration.

The new and smaller ledger cards were begun on January 1, 1892, and since that
date all the transactions have been entered upon them. The abbreviation of the
records and their greater convenience in handling proved to be of the utmost service
when it became necessary to reduce the clerical force in the office, and it is only by
such abbreviation of the records and by the introduction of several minor labor-
saving devices that it has been at all possible to prevent the work from falling
irretrievably behind.

The number of new ledger cards on June 30, 1893, was 16,340, and on June 30, 1894,
20,223. This difference of 3,883 represents the increase in the number of new socie-
ties or individuals during the year making use of the service, while the entire num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ber of cards, 20,223, is the number of societies and individuals, both domestic and
foreign, with which the Exchange Office has had relations since January 1, 1892.
The new list of correspondents is classified as follows:

The actual count of the list of correspondents printed in 1886, together with all
the additions made since, gives 9,212 foreign societies; of which, however, 2,221 are
not as yet represented upon the new ledger cards. The accompanying map will
convey most clearly an idea of the wide distribution of these correspondents.

The entire record file of the Exchange Office contains the names of approximately
13,500 individuals and 11,500 institutions; and, although a considerable number of
these represent defunct institutions or individuals, their registry with a statement
of this fact is often of very great value in the Exchange Service.

Attention has been directed for sometime past to the fact that the list of corre-
spondents in the Exchange Office requires revision and recopying upon cards, the
original office list prepared and printed in 1886 having become so worn and so over-
ciowded by frequent interlineations as to be almost illegible.

The special exchange list for the distribution of Smithsonian documents is also in
need of revisionand correction. It was prepared many years ago, and not a few of the
libraries to which it was deemed proper at the time to send these publications have
sunk into obscurity, while many new libraries have been established to which it
seems desirable that Smithsonian documents should be sent. A considerable number
of requests are received each year inviting an exchange of publications, or requests
for the completion of the Smithsonian series of documents, with which it is rarely
practicable to comply. It is earnestly hoped, therefore, that means will be found
for revising this list and the general exchange list of correspondents. Either of
these lists present a task of considerable magnitude, and it is manifestly impossible
with the present force of employees—which is hardly able to keep up with the cur-
rent work of the Bureau—to enter upon such an undertaking at the present time.

The last list of Smithsonian correspondents, that published in 1886, is the only
one to which applicants can now be referred. That a printed list of the addresses
of the principal learned societies and libraries of the world would be thoroughly
appreciated, the frequent inquiries made to the Exchange Office abundantly testify.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which was given in full in the
report of the Curator of Exchanges for 1887-88, the exchange of the official publi-
cations of the United States Government with other countries has been continued
by the Institution, and it now forms a very large proportion of the Bureau’s work.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to, was
15,000, and there have been received in return 8,812 packages. The United States
Government departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 28,285
packages, and have received in return 14,555 packages. The total number of
exchanges for government libraries has therefore been 23,367 packages received and
43,285 packages sent abroad, a total of 66,652 packages, or about 67 per cent of the
entire number handled, :
62

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish seale

as our own.

Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the governments

with which the Institution are in correspondence would also probably result in a
considerable increase to the library of Congress.
The exchange on account of Government bureaus is shown in detail in the follow-

ing table:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

I regret to report that, through circumstances over which the personnel of the
Exchange Office could have no control, it was found impracticable to prevent the
work of the year from falling in arrears.

The appropriation for the fiscal year was $2,500 less than for the years immediately
preceding, and during the latter half of the year, no deficiency appropriation hav-
ing been passed by Congress it became necessary to curtail the expenses in every
possible way by reducing the number of employees and otherwise in order that the
regular appropriation might not be exceeded.

A further embarrassment arose from the fact already stated that some of the Goy-
ernment bureaus, ordinarily sending a very considerable number of documents
abroad through the Smithsonian Institution, were unable to reimburse the Institu-
tion, as in previous years, for the cost of transportation advanced to meet the
expense involved.

In several instances, therefore, it became necessary to advise correspondents that
it would be impossible to receive and transmit their publications until after the
close of the fiscal year, and, as freight charges could not be met, a very large number
of documents, constituting the miscellaneous exchanges, as well as some 7,000 Con-
gressional documents to be transmitted to parliamentary libraries with which the
exchange for the Library of Congress is conducted, had to be held over until after
the new appropriation became available.

The exchange relations with Greece are in the same condition as a year ago, when,
on account of the expenses attending the distribution of packages, the transmission
of miscellaneous exchanges was discontinued by request of the librarian of the
United National and University Libraries, formerly acting as the medium for dis-
tributing publications.

The transmissions to Brazil and Chile, which were for a time suspended, were
renewed, but the exchange with Mexico is still in an extremely unsatisfactory con-
dition, and the transmission of the parliamentary documents to the Mexican Goy-
ernment has been suspended awaiting some action by the Mexican authorities, to
whose attention the matter was brought through the Mexican minister.

The difficulties attending the transmission of documents to India has been finally
met by the action of the Secretary to the Government of India, at Calcutta, in
obtaining the consent of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India to continue the
former arrangement under which publications intended by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion for private institutions and individuals, as well as for Government depart-
ments and individuals in their official capacity, were forwarded to India from
London by the director-general of stores, at the cost of the civil department.

I take much pleasure in bearing witness to the efficiency of the employees in the
Exchange Office and in expressing appreciation of their efforts to keep up with the
added volume of work in spite of the unavoidable reduction in the force, and I beg
leave to call to your notice the careful attention to the interests of the Insitution on
the part of its special agents abroad, Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipsic, and Messrs.
William Wesley & Son, in London.

The Smithsonian Institution is also under special obligation to the Secretary of
the Treasury who has designated an officer of the United States Custom-House in
New York, to receive and despatch to Washington cases containing international
exchanges, all of these cases being passed both in this country and abroad free of
custom duties.

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and others for their liberality in granting the privilege of free freight or in other-
wise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other
firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the
disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge:

APPENDIX IV,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894:

The progress of the park has been along the lines already indicated in former
reports. The appropriation granted by Congress being insufficient to permit the
construction of any important new structures, attention has mainly been given to
perfecting the accommodations already established and to improving the means of
access enjoyed by the public.

The location of the deer paddocks, on the eastern bank of the little stream that
flows through the park, was found unfavorable, they being situated there against
the boundary fence, and the deer being consequently endangered by the presence of
dogs roving in the vicinity of the park. The sight of a dog frightened them to such
an extent as to cause them to injure themselves in their efforts to escape. Several
of them were killed, breaking their necks by running violently against the fence,
others broke their legs by becoming entangled, and still others, after leaping a fence
eight feet high were recaptured with much difficulty. The force of watchmen at the
park being insufficient to fully guard against such accidents, it was thought best to
remove the paddocks to a protected situation within the park, at a sufficient dis-
tance from the boundary fence to prevent disturbance of the animals. A site
was ‘selected a short distance below the llama house, and a suitable barn or
shelter was constructed of rough beams and thatch, as shown in the accompanying
illustration. The paddocks were inclosed by light wire fencing 8 feet in height.
No further trouble has arisen with the deer since this change was made. The
approximate cost of the house and paddocks was $600.

It being desirable to place the beavers in a locality suitable for their habits,
a retired valley was selected from which the public could be excluded, and the
animals were allowed to build undisturbed. These results were even more satis-
factory than were expected, as the animals at once commenced to cut down trees of
considerable size, and to construct a dam and a lodge. It is hoped that others may
be secured, and that they may be partially domesticated so as to carry on their
interesting operations under the observations of the public.

The large pond for waterfowl and other aquatic animals, situated south of the
meadow near the bridge, has finally been completed, but is not yet fenced in so as to
retain the animals. A smaller pond on the left bank of Rock Creek, near the Quarry
road entrance, has been prepared for swans. This will prove a picturesque feature
at this point, as water can be led into and out of it by a series of small cascades,
which will afford a pleasing variety.

The site of the prairie-dog town, among trees upon the top of a gravelly knoll, is
found to be unsatisfactory. It seems probable that when a large number are
confined in a limited space for a considerable length of time, the ground becomes
impregnated with injurious matters. It has been noted that the number of these
animals has been gradually decreasing, and it is estimated that the total has fallen
off by as many as 75 during the year. As soon as funds are available for the purpose,
it is intended to remove them to a healthier situation, and to arrange so that they

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

may be shifted from time to time. The present site will be an admirable sitnation
for a public comfort room and refectory, which is greatly needed for the accommo-
dation of the public.

A considerable sum has been spent in preparing a driveway from the animal house
to the west gate, through one of the most beautiful regions of the park. Consid-
erable excavations and fills were necessary at various points, and the sum at the dis-
posal of the administration was insufficient to properly surface and finish the road.
A substantial gutter was, however, laid upon the side of the roadway. During dry
summer weather this road is satisfactory, but the frosts of winter make it so soft as
to be almost impassable.

Seventy-three animals were lent the park during the winter by the proprietor of
the Forepaugh show. This proved a great attraction to the public, obtained at very
slight expense, the only increased charge being the food consumed. It is believed
that it would be advantageous to continue the practice of taking suitable and inter-
esting animals for the expense of their maintenance, as by this means some specimens
are almost certain to be added permanently to the collection, one of the stipulations
made in such cases being that all animals born in the park shall become the property
of the Government. A kangaroo and a monkey were in this way obtained.

The collection has thriven fairly well during the year, considering the fact that

~ no purchases can be made and that it isso much dependent on gifts—a list of the
donors of which is appended. The number of animals on hand at the close of the
fiscal year was 510, being a slight increase on the number at the beginning of the
year. The number of deaths was 251, chiefly among the smaller species, a consid-
erable number occurring among animals that were in bad condition when they were
lent to the park.

Among the interesting accessions was a young black bear, born on February 5,
1894. There are but few opportunities for observing the growth of these animals,
as they are rarely born in captivity. The little creature was very small at birth,
not larger than a good-sized rat, weighing but nine ounces, and it was thirty-nine
days before it opened its eyes. It has been very viyorous and healthy from the
first, and its development was evidently normal. A fine young African lion, from
Mashonaland, was presented by Mr. H. C. Moore, and promises to become a very
large animal when full grown.

REPORT ON THE ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As indicated in my last report, the general work of the Observatory for the fiscal
year has continued to be the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum described
in the general body of the report for 1893. This work may conveniently be divided
into three parts:

A. General spectrobolographic work.

B. Special spectrobolographic work.

C. Instrumental work, including manufacture of new apparatus and the perfec-
tion of old.

A. The general spectrobolographic work of the year may besummed up as follows:
(A “bolograph” is an automatic reproduction of the curve representing the distribu-
tion of the energy in the infra-red spectrum. )

A complete record of these bolographie curves, automatically registered by the

apparatus upon glass plates, has been filed for future investigation, the work in its

present stage being confined, as has already been stated, to the exploration of this
hitherto unexplored region and the identification of its landmarks.

The result of the work has been extremely satisfactory, so far as regards the number
and importance of the lines found. The accompanying illustration (see plate) show-
ing a portion of the infra-red spectrum from the region 1.4 to 2.24, beyond what a
few years ago was considered the limit of the infra-red spectrum, will show the
detail and clearness with which the present apparatus is capable of rendering what
can, only in the absence of a better word, be called the ‘‘appearance” of this region,
since, it must be borne in mind, no human being has senses capable of directly
discriminating between these interruptions, or of directly perceiving the form of

this display of energy.

76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The portion of the infra-red spectrum shown, which is that at present furthest
advanced, has been gone over several times, and each of the more than 200 lines
which occupy this plate has been verified by many observations. The plate shows
but asmall part of the region which is now being mapped, in all of which it is

believed the results will be equally encouraging. Although no investigation has —

been made of the meaning of the many significant lines in this great and now first

exhibited region, it is reasonable to think that their study may lead to conclusions
of only less importance than those resulting from the similar Frauenhofer lines in the
visible spectrum. It is especially believed that the science of meteoroloyy may
become indebted to a study of this region for many indications of phenomena
which can not now be foretold with any degree of accuracy.

PaRT OF THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (er

Three of these bolographs, taken from a large number covering the same region,
are shown in the illustration (Fig. 1), in order that the manner of recording the
variations in the distribution of the energy in this portion of the spectrum may be
shown, as well as the agreement of distinct observations made of the same region
at different times.

In order to accomplish this agreement and accuracy in the curves, many changes
suggested by experience have had to be made in the apparatus and equipment.
The temporary and overcrowded quarters in which this apparatus is stored have
been more and more occupied as the mechanical difficulties in the work increased,
until now the space is totally inadequate to the needs of such an investigation,
while an even more serious difficulty is that the locality is in the neighborhood of
street traffic, and disturbed by continual tremors.

B. The special bolographic work which is carried on during days unfavorable for
taking observations includes the classification, detailed examination, and finally,
the reduction of the bolographs taken into linear translations of the curves, in
which the final result is similar, so far as the automatic reduction processes will
admit, to the photographs of the visible part of the spectrum.

Much attention has been given to the photographic work, which has presented
problems somewhat difficult of solution. Much of the photographic apparatus has
had to be specially designed and constructed to fit the peculiar conditions governing
its use, but the present process, it is believed, will meet any exigencies of the work.

The work in this direction has kept pace with the original bolographs and I hope
soon to be able to issue the preliminary charts covering at least a portion of the
region under investigation.

C. What may be called the principal work of the Observatory of this kind during
the year has been the improvement of the apparatus and the instrumental conditions,
the lines of development being—

(1) Toward an increase of delicacy.

(2) Toward increased stability and accuracy.

The galvanometer, whose relative importance in the train of apparatus may almost
be compared to that of the brain in the nervous system, has been perfected still
further than was noted in my last report.

The utility of these improvements, however, has been, as I have already said,
greatly impaired by the situation of the Observatory, close to traveled streets,
where it is subject to disturbances of the most annoying kind. This will be better
understood when it is considered that the galvanometer never moves very sensibly
under a change of temperature on the bolograph of less than a millionth of a degree;
that it is on the registry of these minute changes that the whole system of discov-
ery rests, and that false changes can be introduced by the magnetism or the tremor
from passing traffic, which so embarrass the observer and enhance his labor
that it may be said to be almost hopeless to introduce any great further improve-
ment in this direction till the Observatory occupies a site free from such disturb-
ances, in place ofits present temporary and most unsuitable quarters. These inter-
ruptions and disturbances, whether magnetic or seismic, have prevented, except at
rare and short intervals, the full use of the apparatus in its more delicate capacities.

Apparatus.—The clockwork, upon which depends much of the accuracy and con-
sequently the final efficiency of the observations, has been continually studied and
improved.

The siderostat has been under continued improvements suggested by experience,
but these will be better described when complete.

The Observatory, during the year, has received from the commissioners of the Rus-
sian Government to the World’s Fair a very large block of optically fine rock salt
from the mines, from which a collimating lens over 7 inches in diameter and a prism
7 inches in height has been wrought (by Brashear), which, it is believed, are the
largest of their material in the world. To this prism and lens is due much of the
increased efficiency of the whole train of apparatus.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR.

A number of direct photographs of a portion of the visible spectrum and as much
of the infra-red as could be readily photographed were made by Mr. L. E. Jewell,
with the object of comparing direct photographs with bolographs of the same
region made under similar conditions.

A number of enlargements of the spectro-bolographic charts already finished have
been made with a view to their early publication.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. R. C. Child was appointed to the position of junior assistant on September 1,
1893.

Mr. F, L. O. Wadsworth resigned the position of senior assistant June 1, 1894.

On the same date Mr. Child was appointed aid, acting in charge of Observatory.

Mr. F. E. Fowle, jr., was appointed junior assistant on June 1, 1894.

APPENDIX VI.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith a report upon the operations of the
Library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,

The work of recording accessions has been conducted as heretofore, each publica-
tion being entered as received and given a special number. While this plan causes
the exhibit of numbers in excess of volumes received, there is to set off against it
the fact that an entire series received at one time is given but a single number.

The numbers in the accession book of the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of
Congress extend from 268387 to 292425; in all, 24,038 entries, an increase in numbers
over the year 1892-93 of 1,762.

The following tables show the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts received during the year:

This table shows an increase in publications over the year 1892-95 of 8,464.

Of these publications 587 volumes, 10,256 parts of volumes, and 1,575 pamphlets,
12,418 in all, were retained for use in the United States National Museum.

One thousand three hundred and forty-six medical dissertations were deposited in
the library of the Surgeon General, United States Army. The remaining publications
were sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt.

Besides these publications entered in the accession book of the Smithsonian
deposit of the Library of Congress there have been entered in the ‘office book”
1,580 numbers (extending from No. 4089 to No. 5669), representing 1,874 volumes and
parts of volumes received, and making a grand total of accessions for the year of
39,826 publications. -

This does not include a small number of books and journals purchased for the use
of the Astrophysical Observatory and of the Zoological Park.

The following universities have sent academic publications and inaugural disser-
tations:

Basel, Giessen, Kazen, Pennsylvania.
Berlin, Gottingen, Kiel, Rostock,
Berne, Greifswald, Konigsburg, Strassburg,
Bonn, Halle, A. S. Leipsic, .- Tubingen,

80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In 1887 you organized a plan for increasing the library by exchanges. Lists of
periodicals were secured from the British Museum, several universities, and a great
number of leading specialists. These lists were carefully revised and correspond-
ence entered upon with each society and journal there represented. During the
year this work was completed. Immediately upon its completion a new list of all
scientific publications issued in France was secured, and, after revision, correspond-
ence was entered upon; 1,191 letters asking for publications not on our list, or for
numbers to complete the series already in the Jibrary, have been written. As a
result, 503 new exchanges were acquired by the Institution, while 133 defective
series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers were able to supply
missing parts. This result is very nearly double that attained last year.

Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written for the purpose of increasing the num-
ber of periodicals and transactions of learned societies in the library; 1,853 new
periodicals have been added to the list of those received, and 1, 042 defective series
have been either wholly or partially completed.

Four thousand -two hundred and thirty-six acknowledgments of publications
received were made by the post card and other printed forms, while many gifts were
acknowledged by special letter.

Three sectional libraries are now established in the Institution—the editor’s, the
astronomical, and one for works on aerodromics.

In the last report attention was called to the crowded condition of the library
offices. Since that time two additional rooms have been assigned, one for a collection
of books required tor reference, and the other as an office for the librarian. In this
reference room, besides cyclopedias and dictionaries, are placed the publications of
six of the great scientific societies of the world.

A room has also been set apart for the collections of prints belonging to the Institu-
tion. A few of these have been framed and hung upon the walls, the remainder
being retained in bound volumes and portfolios.

The card-catalogue record of periodicals received has Jeen transferred from the
large cards formerly employed to the smaller card, known as the postal size; a new
card catalogue of periodicals in the Institution has also been prepared for the read-
ing room.

The library is governed by the following regulations, which with slight additions
were drawn up by the present Secretary some years ago:

CONSTITUTION OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY,

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the library of the Smithsonian Institution
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision that the Institu-
tion shall continue to enjoy its customary use of it. The following regulations refer
only to those books which under the above proviso are retained at the Smithsonian
Institution proper, or in its Museum library.

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are placed in the immediate
charge of a librarian, whose title shall be ‘‘lib:arian of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion,” and whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the
Library of Congress in a central library under his charge. The following regulations
are intended for the better execution of the aforesaid order:

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the Assistant Secretary, the Chief Cleik,
or assistant in charge, and also by the curators and acting curators, and the editor.
Curators and acting curators are permitted, subject to the approval of the Assistant
Secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional libraries to be kept in their
respective offices; but this shall only be done by withdrawing from the general col-
lection such books as relate exclusively to the objects under their care. Dictionaries,
cyclopedias, journals, or any works other than such as relate exclusively to the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

special department, can not form a part of such a sectional library, except upon the
recommendation of the librarian, approved by the Assistant Secretary.

4, The official in charge of each sectional library shall be responsible for its safe-
keeping and shall on no account lend the books,

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited.

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinct cases, the locks of which shall be
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times,
examine them and call the attention of the curators to any deficiencies.

7. No person who is not a member of the scientific staff of the Institution or
Museum shall withdraw books or other matter without written permission from the
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the assistant in charge, the
curator in charge of the Museum, or the librarian. Persons taking books from the
central library shall be responsible for the safe-keeping of the same, and shall make
good any losses. They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those
which are lost have been restored.

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are suitable for any
curator’s sectional library, and to recall any book not in & sectional library within
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, as
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare, or costly, or encyclopedic works,
or in other special instances, the librariam shall be authorized to designate books
which shall in no case be taken from the library. These regulations shall not
apply to any books now actually in the office of the editor. All books and other
matter not in the sectional library shall be at all times subject to recall by the
librarian.

9. The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause
to the contrary) recall any book upon receiving a written request for the same.

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Secretary any defective
series, any missing books, or any new serials or books which are specially desirable.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS.

11. All books, pamphlets, maps, and other publications acquired by the Smith-
sonian Institution through exchange, or donation, or purchase shall be separately
entered by the librarian, who shall prepare reference lists, with the aid of which he
shall, immediately upon their receipt from the assistant in charge of office, divide
them into two classes; one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt,
the other to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week.

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day-
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time, for
every separate book, or pamphlet, or map, without exception; but it is understood
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue.

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the daybook the letter “C”
(Smithsonian Library deposited in Library of Congress), or ‘‘G” (Smithsonian
Library deposited with Surgeon-General), or “I” (Smithsonian Library deposited
at the Institution). Books purchased at the Institution’s cost and intended for the
Secretary’s library, or the office library, shall be entered in a separate book, and it
shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first class are prepared
for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week.

U4. The librarian shall notify the exchange department within the current week of
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the
senders or donors of every article, at stated times, at intervals of not more than a
year, and shall make a record of such entry with the date of acknowledgment oppo-
site to the entry of the work in question.

SM 94-6
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

15. It shall be the duty of the librarian at all times to hold these books, in classes
“CG” and “G,” open to the inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report
to him the place and condition of any work under his charge in answer to any specific
inquiry.

16. In addition to the books which are included in the Smithsonian deposit in the
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the
Smithsonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shall be distinct-
ively marked, and it is understood that, while they form no part of the above-
described books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are in
other respects to be treated in accordance with the above regulations. No book or
chart belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured
for the specific use of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge of
the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctly stamped as belonging to his
office. Under this clause come books purchased especially for the office of* the
Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge, forming “office libraries.”
Indispensable books of reference in exchange departments, etc., form part of the
Chief Clerk’s office library.

This is to be understood as including the books purchased at the expense of the
Museum appropriation, but not necessarily the books obtained by exchange for
Museum publications, as it would be difficult, if not impossible, always to discrimi-
nate these under our present system. This point is reserved for future consideration,
but provisionally it is understood that the librarian is to send books to the Library
of Congress, if not evidently meant for the Museum.

The books provided for the. office of the Secretary, and stamped ‘‘ Secretary’s
library,” are a distinct class, having no relation to the Library of Congress or to the
sectional libraries. They may be lent on application in special cases by the Assist-
ant Secretary or assistant in charge through the librarian. All other books (not
forming a portion of the Smithsonian deposit with the Library of Congress, but
belonging to the Institution) are stamped ‘ Office library,” which includes editor’s
library, Chief Clerk’s office library, and others, and these, as well as those of the
Secretary’s library, are in the charge of the librarian.

Respectfully submitted.

Cyrus ADLER, Librarian.

Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMUETHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1894.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution. ;

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of
an annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had
been issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by
competent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1894.

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.!

By WILLIAM HARKNESS.

Nature may be studied in two widely different ways. On the one
hand we may employ a powerful microscope which will render visible
the minutest forms and limit our field of view to an infinitesimal frac-
tion of an inch situated within a foot of our own noses; or, on the other
hand, we may occupy some commanding position, and from thence,
aided perhaps by a telescope, we may obtain a comprehensive view of
an extensive region. The first method is that of the specialist, the
second is that of the philosopher, but both are necessary for an ade-
quate understanding of nature. The one has brought us knowledge
wherewith to defend ourselves against bacteria and microbes, which
are among the most deadly enemies of mankind, and the other has made
us acquainted with the great laws of matter and force upon which rests
the whole fabric of science. All nature is one, but for convenience of
classification we have divided our knowledge into a number of sciences
which we usually regard as quite distinct from each other. Along cer-
tain lines, or, more properly, in certain regions, these sciences neces-
sarily abut on each other, and just there lies the weakness of the
specialist. He is like a wayfarer who always finds obstacles in cross-
ing the boundaries between two countries, while to the traveler who
gazes over them from a commanding eminence the case is quite differ-
ent. If the boundary is an ocean shore, there is no mistaking it; if a
broad river or a chain of mountains, it is still distinct; but if only a
line of posts traced over hill and dale, then it becomes lost in the
natural features of the landscape, and the essential unity of the whole
region is apparent. In that case the border land is wholly a human
conception of which nature takes no cognizance, and so it is with the
scientific border land to which I propose to invite your attention this
evening.

To the popular mind there are no two sciences farther apart than
astronomy and geology. The one treats of the structure and mineral

constitution of our earth, the causes of its physical features and its
history, while the other treats of the celestial bodies, their magnitudes,
motions, distances, periods of revolution, eclipses, order, and of the
sauses of their various phenomena. And yet, many, perhaps I may
even say most, of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are
merely reflections of the motions of the earth, and in studying them
we are really studying it. Furthermore, precession, nutation, and the
phenomena of the tides depend largely upon the internal structure of
the earth, and there astronomy and geology merge into each other.
Nevertheless, the methods of the two sciences are widely different,
most astronomical problems being discussed quantitatively by means
of rigid mathematical formule, while in the vast majority of cases the
geological ones are discussed only qualitatively, each author contenting
himself with a mere statement of what he thinks. With precise data
the methods of astronomy lead to very exact results, for mathematics
is a mill which grinds exceeding fine; but, after all, what comes out of
a mill depends wholly upon what is put into it, and if the data are
uncertain, as is the case in most cosmological problems, there is little
to choose between the mathematics of the astronomer and the guesses
of the geologist.

If we examine the addresses delivered by former presidents of this
association, and of the sister—perhaps it would be nearer the truth to
say the parent—association on the other side of the Atlantic, we shall
find that they have generally dealt either with the recent advances
in some broad field of science, or else with the development of some
special subject. This evening I propose to adopt the latter course, and
I shall invite your attention to the present condition of our knowledge
respecting the magnitude of the solar system; but in so doing it will be
necessary to introduce some considerations derived from laboratory
experiments upon the luminiferous ether, others derived from experi-
ments upon ponderable matter, and still others relating both to the
surface phenomena and to the internal structure of the earth, and thus
we shall deal largely with the border land where astronomy, physics,
and geology merge into each other. .

The relative distances of the various bodies which compose the solar
system can be determined to a considerable degree of approximation
with very crude instruments as soon as the true plan of the system
becomes known, and that plan was taught by Pythagoras more than
five hundred years before Christ. It must have been known to the
Egyptians and Chaldeans still earlier, if Pythagoras really acquired
his knowledge of astronomy from them, as is- affirmed by some of the
ancient writers, but on that point there is no certainty. In public
Pythagoras seemingly accepted the current belief of his time, which
made the earth the center of the universe, but to his own chosen disci-
ples he communicated the true doctrine that the sun occupies the center
of the solar system and that the earth is only one of the planets revoly-

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 95

ing around it. Like all the world’s greatest sages, he seems to have
taught only orally. A century elapsed before his doctrines were reduced
to writing by Philolaus of Crotona, and it was still later before they
were taught in public for the first time by Hicetas, or as he is sometimes
valled Nicetas, of Syracuse. Then the familiar cry of impiety was
raised, and the Pythagorean system was eventually suppressed by that
now called the Ptolemaic, which held the field until it was overthrown
by Copernicus almost two thousand years later. Pliny tells us that
Pythagoras believed the distances to the sun and moon to be, respec-
tively, 252,000 and 12,600 stadia, or, taking the stadium at 625 feet,
29,837 and 1,492 English miles; but there is no record of the method
by which these numbers were ascertained.

After the relative distances of the various planets are known, it only
remains to determine the scale of the system, for which purpose the
distance between any two planets suffices. We know little about the
early history of the subject, but it is clear that the primitive astrono-
mers must have found the quantities to be measured too small for
detection with their instruments, and even in modern times the prob-
lem has proved to be an extremely difficult one. Arisfarchus, of
Samos, who flourished about 270 B. C., seems to have been the first to
attack it in a scientific manner. Stated in modern language, his rea-
soning was that when the moon is exactly half full the earth and
sun, as seen from its center, must make a right angle with each other,
and by measuring the angle between the sun and moon, as seen from
the earth at that instant, all the angles of the triangle joining the
earth, sun, and moon*would become known, and thus the ratio of the
distance of the sun to the distance of the moon would be determined.
Although perfectly correct in theory, the difficulty of deciding visually
upon the exact instance when the moon is half full is so great that it
can not be accurately done, even with the most powerful telescopes.
Of course Aristarchus had no telescope, and he does not explain how
he effected the observation, but his conclusion was that at the instant
in question the distance between the centers of the sun and moon as
seen from the earth is less than a right angle by one-thirtieth part
of the same. We should now express this by saying that the angle is
87°, but Aristarchus knew nothing of trigonometry, and in order to
solve his triangle he had recourse to an ingenious, but long and cum-
bersome, geometrical process, which has come down to us, and affords
conclusive proof of the condition of Greek mathematics at that time.
His conclusion was that the sun is nineteen times farther from the earth
than the moon, and if we combine that result with the modern value of
the moon’s parallax, viz, 3,422.38’, we obtain for the solar parallax
180’, which is more than twenty times too great.

The only other method of determining the solar parallax known to
the ancients was that devised by Hipparchus about 150 B.C. It was
based on measuring the rate of decrease of the diameter of the earth’s
96 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

shadow cone by noting the duration of lunar eclipses, and as the result
deduced from it happened to be pearly the same as that found by Aris-
tarchus, substantially his value of the parallax remained in vogue for
nearly two thousand years, and the discovery of the telescope was
required to reveal its erroneous character. Doubtless this persistency
was due to the extreme minuteness of the true parallax, which we now
know is far too small to have been visible upon the ancient instru-
ments, and thus the supposed measures of it were really nothing but
measures of their inaccuracy.

The telescope was first pointed to the heavens by Galileo in 1609, but
it needed a micrometer to convert it into an accurate measuring instru-
ment, and that did not come into be-ng until 1639, when it was invented
by William Gascoigne. After his death, in 1644, his original instru-
ment passed to Richard Townley, who attached it to a 14-foot telescope
at his residence in Townley, Lancashire, Engiand, where it was used
by Flamsteed in observing the diurnal parallax of Mars during its
opposition in 1672. A description of Gascoigne’s micrometer was pub-
lished in the Philosophical Transactions in 1667, and a little before
that a similar instrument had been invented by Auzout, in France, but
observatories were fewer then than now, and, so far as | know, J. D.
Cassini was the only person beside Flamsteed who attempted to deter-
mine the solar parallax from that opposition of Mars. Foreseeing the
importance of the opportunity, he had Richer dispatched to Cayenne
some months previously, and when the opposition came he effected two
determinations of the parallax; one being by the diurnal method, from
his own observations in Paris, and the other by the meridian method,
from observations in France by himself, Rémer, and Picard, combined
with those of Richer at Cayenne. This was the transition from the
ancient instruments with open sights to telescopes armed with microm-
eters, and the result must have been little short of stunning to the
seventeenth century astronomers, for it caused the hoary and gigantic
parallax of about 180” to shrink incontinently to 10”, and thus ex-
panded their conception of the solar system to something like its true
dimensions. More than fifty years previously Kepler had argued from
his ideas of the celestial harmonies that the solar parallax could not
exceed 60’, and a little later Horrocks had shown on more scientific
grounds that it was probably as small as 14”; but the final death blow
to the ancient values—ranging as high as 2’ or 3/—came from these
observations of Mars by Flamsteed, Cassini, and Richer.

Of course the results obtained in 1672 produced a keen desire on the
part of astronomers for further evidence respecting the true value of
the parallax, and as Mars comes into a favorable position for such
investigations only at intervals of about sixteen years, they had recourse
to observations of Mereury and Venus. In 1677 Halley observed the
diurnal parallax of Mercury, and also a transit of that planet across
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 97

the sun’s disk, at St. Helena, and in 1681 J. D. Cassini and Picard
observed Venus when she was on the same parallel with the sun, but
although the observations of Venus gave better resuJts than those of
Mercury, neither of them was conclusive, and we now know that such
methods are inaccurate even with the powerful instruments of the pres-
ent day. Nevertheless Halley’s attempt by means of the transit of
Mercury ultimately bore fruit in the shape of his celebrated paper of
1716, wherein he showed the peculiar advantages of transits of Venus
for determining the solar parallax. The idea of utilizing such tran-
sits for this purpose seems to have been vaguely conceived by James
Gregory, or perhaps even by Horrocks, but Halley was the first to
work it out completely, and long after his death his paper was mainly
instrumental in inducing the Governments of Europe to undertake the
observations of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, from which our
first accurate knowledge of the sun’s distance was obtained.

Those who are not familiar with practical astronomy may wonder
why the solar parallax can be got from Mars and Venus, but not from
Mercury or the sun itself. The explanation depends upon two facets.
Firstly, the nearest approach of these bodies to the earth is for Mars
33,874,000 miles, for Venus 23,654,000 miles, for Mereury 47,935,000
miles, and for the sun 91,239,000 miles. Consequently, for us Mars and
Venus have very much larger parallaxes than Mercury or the sun, and
of course the larger the parallax the easier it is to measure. Secondly,
even the largest of these parallaxes must be determined within far less
than one-tenth of a second of the truth, and while that degree of accu-
racy is possible in measuring short ares, it is quite unattainable in long
ones. Hence, one of the most essential conditions for the successful
measurement of parallaxes is that we shall be able to compare the
place of the near body with that of a more distant one situated in the
same region of the sky. In the case of Mars that can always be done
by making use of a neighboring star, but when Venus is near the earth
she is also so close to the sun that stars are not available, and conse-
quently her parallax can be satisfactorily measured only when her
position can be accurately referred to that of the sun, or, in other words,
only during her transits across the sun’s disk. But even when the two
bodies to be compared are sufficiently near each other, we are still
embarrassed by the fact that it is more difficult to measure the dis-
tance between the limb of a planet and a star or the limb of the sun
than it is to measure the distance between two stars, and since the dis-
covery of so many asteroids that circumstance has led to their use
for the determination of the solar parallax. Some of these bodies
approach within 75,250,000 miles of the earth’s orbit, and as they look
precisely like stars, the increased accuracy of pointing on them fully
makes up for their greater distance as compared with Mars or Venus.
_ After the Copernican system of the world and the Newtonian theory
of gravitation were accepted it soon became evident that trigonomet-

sm 94——7
98 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

rical measurements of the solar parallax might be supplemented by
determinations based on the theory of gravitation, and the first attempts
in that direction were made by Machin in 1729 and 'T. Mayer in 1753.
The measurement of the velocity of light*between points on the earth’s
surface, first effected by Fizeau in 1849, opened up still other possibili-
ties, and thus for determining the solar parallax we have at our com-
mand no less than three entirely distinct classes of methods, which are
known respectively as the trigonometrical, the gravitational, and the
photo-tachymetrical. We have already given a summary sketch of
the trigonometrical methods as applied by the ancient astronomers
to the dichotomy and shadow cone of the moon, and by the moderns to
Venus, Mars, and the asteroids, and we shall next glance briefly at the
gravitational and photo-tachymetrical methods.

The gravitational results which enter directly or indirectly into the
solar parallax are six in number, to wit: First, the relation of the moon’s
mass to the tides; second, the relation of the moon’s mass and parallax
to the force of gravity at the earth’s surface; third, the relation of the
solar parallax to the masses of the earth and moon; fourth, the rela-
tion of the solar and lunar parallaxes to the moon’s mass and parallac-
tic inequality; fifth, the relation of the solar and lunar parallaxes to
the moon’s mass and the earth’s lunar inequality; sixth, the relation of
the constants of nutation and precession to the moon’s parallax.

tespecting the first of these relations it is to be remarked that the
tide-producing forces are the attractions of the sun and moon upon the
waters of the ocean, and from the ratio of these attractions the moon’s
mass can readily be determined. But unfortunately the ratio of the
solar tides to the lunar tides is affected both by the depth of the sea
and by the character of the channels through which the water flows,
and for that reason the observed ratio of these tides requires multipli-
cation by a correcting factor in order to convert it into the ratio of the
forces. The matter is further complicated by this correcting factor
varying from port to port, and in order to get satisfactory results long
series of observations are necessary. The labor of deriving the moon’s
mass in this way was formerly so great that for more than half a cen-
tury Laplace’s determination from the tides at Brest remained unique;
but the recent application of harmonic analysis to the data supplied
by self-registering tide gauges is likely to yield abundant results in
the near future.

Our second gravitational relation, viz, that connecting the moon’s
mass and parallax with the force of gravity at the earth’s surface,
affords an indirect method of determining the moon’s parallax with
very great accuracy if the computation is carefully made, and with a
fair approximation to the truth even when the data are exceedingly
crude. To illustrate this, let us see what could be done with a railroad
transit such as is commonly used by surveyors, a steel tape, and a fairly
good watch. Neglecting small corrections due to the flattening of the

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 99

earth, the centrifugal force at its surface, the eccentricity of its orbit
and the mass of the moon, the law of gravitation shows that if we
multiply together the length of the seconds pendulum, the square of
the radius of the earth, and the square of the length of the sidereal
month, divide the product by four, and take the cube root of the quo-
tient, the result will be the distance from the earth to the moon. To
find the length of the seconds pendulum we would rate the watch by
means of the railroad transit, and then making a pendulum out of a
spherical leaden bullet suspended by a fine thread, we would adjust the
length of the thread until the pendulum made exactly three hundred
vibrations in five minutes by the watch. Then, supposing the experi-
ment to be made here or in New York City, we would find that the
distance from the point of suspension of the thread to the center of the
bullet was about 394 inches, and dividing that by the number of inches
in a mile, viz, 63,360, we would have for the length of the seconds pen-
dulum one sixteen hundred and twentieth of a mile. The next step
would be to ascertain the radius of the earth, and the quickest way
of doing so would probably be, first, to determine the latitude of some
point in New York City by means of the railroad transit; next to run
a traverse survey along the old post-road from New York to Albany,
and finally to determine the latitude of some point in Albany. The
traverse survey should surely be correct to one part in three hundred,
and as the distance between the two cities is about 2° the difference
of latitude might be determined to about the same percentage of
accuracy. In that way we would find the length of 2° of latitude to
be about 138 miles, whence the earth’s radius would be 3,953 miles. It
would then only remain to observe the time occupied by the moon in
making a sidereal revolution around the earth, or, in other words, the
time which she occupies in moving from any given star back to the same
star again. By noting that to within one-quarter of her own diameter
we would soon find that the time of revolution is about 27.52 days, and
multiplying that by the number of seconds in a day, viz, 86,400, we
would have for the length of the sidereal month 2,360,000 seconds.
With these data the computation would stand as follows: The radius
of the earth, 3,953 miles, multiplied by the length of a sidereal month,
2,360,000 seconds, and the product squared gives 87,060,000,000,000,-
000,000. Multiplying that by one-fourth of the length of the seconds
pendulum, viz, one sixty-four hundred and eightieth of a mile, and
extracting the cube root of the product, we would get 237,700 miles
_for the distance from the earth to the moon, which is only about 850
miles less than the truth, and certainly a remarkable result consider-
ing the crudeness of the instruments by which it might be obtained.
Nevertheless, when all the conditions are rigorously taken into account
these data are to be regarded as determining the relation between the
moon’s mass and parallax, rather than the parallax itself. .
100 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

Our third gravitational relation, to wit, that existing between the
solar parallax, the solar attractive force, and the masses of the earth
and moon, is analogous to the relation existing between the moon’s
mass and parallax and the force of gravity at the earth’s surface, but
itcan not be applied in exactly the same way on account of our inability
to swing a pendulum on the sun. Weare therefore compelled to adopt
some other method of determining the sun’s attractive force, and the
most available is that which consists in observing the perturbative
action of the earth and moon upon our nearest planetary neighbors—
Venus and Mars. From this action the law of gravitation enables us
to determine the ratio of the sun’s mass to the combined masses of the
earth and moon, and then the relation in question furnishes a means of
comparing the masses so found with trigonometrical determinations of
the solar parallax. Thus it appears that notwithstanding necessary
differences in the methods of procedure, the analogy between the sec-
ond and third gravitational relations holds not only with respect to
their theoretical basis, but also in their practical application, the one
being used to determine the relation between the mass of the moon and
its distance from the earth, and the other to determine the relation
between the combined masses of the earth and moon and their distance
from the sun.

Our fourth gravitational relation deals with the connection between
the solar parallax, the lunar parallax, the moon’s mass, and the moon’s
parallactic inequality. The important quantities are here the solar
parallax and the moon’s parallactic inequality, and although the deriva-
tion of the complete expression for the connection between them is a
little complicated, there is no difficulty in getting a general notion of
the forces involved. Asthe moon moves around the earth she is alter-
nately without and within the earth’s orbit. When she is without, the
sun’s attraction on her acts with that of the earth; when she is within,
the two attractions act in opposite directions. Thus in effect the cen-
tripetal force holding the moon to the earth is alternately increased and
diminished, with the result of elongating the moon’s orbit toward the
sun and compressing it on the opposite side. As the variation of the
centripetal force is not great, the change of form of the orbit is small;
nevertheless, the summation of the minute alterations thereby produced
in the moon’s orbital velocity suffices to put her sometimes ahead and
sometimes behind her mean place to an extent which oscillates from a
maximum toa minimum, as the earth passes from perihelion to aphelion,
and averages about 125’ of are. This perturbation of the moon is
known as the parallactic inequality, because it depends on the earth’s
distance from the sun, and can therefore be expressed in terms of the
solar parallax. Conversely, the solar parallax can be deduced from the
observed value of the parallactic inequality, but unfortunately there
are great practical difficulties in making the requisite observations with
a Sufficient degree of accuracy. Notwithstanding the ever-recurring

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 101

talk about the advantages to be obtained by observing a small, well-
defined crater instead of the moon’s limb, astronomers have hitherto
found it impracticable to use anything but the limb, and the disadvan-
tage of doing so, as compared with observing a star, is still further
increased by the circumstance that in general only one limb can be seen
at a time, the other being shrouded in darkness. If both limbs could
always be observed we should then have a uniform system of data for
determining the place of the center, but under existing circumstances
we are compelled to make our observations half upon one limb and half
upon the other, and thus they involve all the systematic errors which
may arise from the conditions under which these limbs are observed, and
all the uncertainty which attaches to irradiation, personal equation,
and our defective knowledge of the moon’s semidiameter.

Our fifth gravitational relation is that which exists between the solar
parallax, the lunar parallax, the moon’s mass, and the earth’s lunar ine-
quality. Strictly speaking the moon does not revolve around the earth’s
center, but both bodies revolve around the common center of gravity
of the two. In consequence of that an irregularity arises in the earth’s
orbital velocity around the sun, the common center of gravity moving
in accordance with the laws of elliptic motion, while the earth, on
account of its revolution around that center, undergoes an alternate
acceleration and retardation which has for its period a lunar month,
and is called the lunar inequality of the earth’s motion. We perceive
this inequality as an oscillation superposed on the elliptic motion of
the sun, and its semiamplitude is the measure of the angle subtended
at the sun by the interval between the center of the earth and the
common center of gravity of the earth and moon. Just as an astron-
omer on the moon might use the radius of her orbit around the earth
as a base for measuring her distance from the sun, so we may use this
interval for the same purpose. We find its length in miles from the
equatorial semidiameter of the earth, the moon’s parallax, and the
moon’s mass, and thus we have all the data for determining the solar
parallax from the inequality in question. In view of the great diffi-
culty which has been experienced in measuring the solar parallax itself,
it may be asked, Why we should attempt to deal with the parallactic
Inequality, which is about 26 per cent smaller? The answer is, Because
the latter is derived from differences of the sun’s right ascension,
which are furnished by the principal observatories in vast numbers,
and should give very accurate results on account of their being made
by methods which insure freedom from constant errors. Nevertheless,
the sun is not so well adapted for precise observations as the stars,
and Dr. Gill has recently found that heliometer measurements upon
asteroids which approach very near to the earth yield values of the
parallactic inequality superior to those obtained from right ascenSions
of the sun.

Our sixth gravitational relation is that which exists between the
moon’s parallax and the constants of precession and nutation. THvery
102 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

particle of the earth is attracted both by the sun and by the moon, but
in consequence of the polar flattening the resultant of these attractions
passes a little to one side of the earth’s center of gravity. Thus a
couple is set up, which, by its action upon the rotating earth, causes
the axis thereof to describe a surface which may be called a fluted cone,
with its apex at the earth’s center. <A top spinning with its axis
inclined describes a similar cone, except that the flutings are absent
and the apex is at the point upon which the spinning oceurs. For con-
venience of computation we resolve this action into two components,
and we name that which produces the cone the luni-solar precession,
and that which produces the flutings the nutation. In this phenomenon
the part played by the sun is comparatively small, and by eliminating
it we obtain a relation between the luni-solar precession, the nutation,
and the moon’s parallax which can be used to verify and correct the
observed values of these quantities.

In the preceding paragraph we have seen that the relation between
the quantities there considered depends largely upon the flattening of
the earth, and thus we are led to inquire how and with what degree
of accuracy that is determined. There are five methods—viz, one geo-
detic, one gravitational, and three astronomical. The geodetic method
depends upon measurements of the length of a degree on various parts
of the earth’s surface; and with the data hitherto accumulated it has
proved quite unsatisfactory. The gravitational method consists in
determining the length of the seconds pendulum over as great a range
of latitude as possible, and deducing therefrom the ratio of the earth’s
polar and equatorial semidiameters by means of Clairaut’s theorem.
The pendulum experiments show that the earth’s crust is less dense on
mountain plateaus than at the seacoast, and thus for the first time we
are brought into contact with geological considerations. The first
astronomical method consists in observing the moon’s parallax from
various points on the earth’s surface; and as these parallaxes are noth-
ing else than the angular semidiameter of the earth at the respective
points, as seen from the moon, they afford a direct measure of the flat-
tening. The second and third astronomical methods are based upon
certain perturbations of the moon which depend upon the tigure of the
earth, and should give extremely accurate results; but unfortunately
very great difficulties oppose themselves to the exact measurement of
the perturbations. There is also an astronomico-geological method
which can not yet be regarded as conclusive on account of our lack of
knowledge respecting the law of density which prevails in the interior
of the éarth. It is based upon the fact that a certain function of the
earth’s moments of inertia can be determined from the observed values
of the coefficients of precession and nutation, and could also be deter-
mined from the figure and dimensions of the earth if we knew the exact
distribution of matter in its interior. Our present knowledge on that
subject is limited to a superficial layer not more than 10 miles thick,

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 103

but it is usual to assume that the deeper matter is distributed, accord-
ing to Lagrange’s law, and then by writing the function in question in a
form which leaves the flattening indeterminate, and equating the expres-
sion so found to the value given by the precession and nutation, we
readily obtain the flattening. As yet these methods do not give con-
sistent results, and so long as serious discrepancies remain between
them there can be no security that we have arrived at the truth.

It should be remarked that in order to compute the function of the
earth’s moments of inertia which we have just been considering, we
require not only the figure and dimensions of the earth and the law of
distribution of density in its interier, but also its mean and surface
densities. The experiments for determining the mean density have
consisted in comparing the earth’s attraction with the attraction either
of a mountain or of a known thickness of the earth’s crust or of a
known mass of metal. In the case of mountains the comparisons have
been made with plumb lines and pendulums; in the case of known
layers of the earth’s crust they have been made by swinging pendu-
lums at the surface and down in mines; and in the case of known
masses of metal they have been made with torsion balances, fine chem-
ical balances, and pendulums. The surface density results from a study
of the materials composing the earth’s crust, but notwithstanding the
apparent simplicity of that process it is doubtful if we have yet
attained as accurate a result as in the case of the mean density.

Before quitting this part of our subject it is important to point out
that the luni-solar precession can not be directly observed, but must be
derived from the general precession. The former of these qualities
depends only upon the action of the sun and moon, while the latter is
affected in addition by the action of all the planets, and to ascertain
what that is we must determine their masses. The methods of doing
so fall into two great classes, according as the planets dealt with have
or have not satellites. The most favorable case is that in which one or
more satellites are present, because the mass of the primary follows
immediately from their distances and revolution times; but even then
there is a difficulty in the way of obtaining very exact results. By
extending the observations over sufficiently long periods the revolution
times may be ascertained with any desired degree of accuracy; but all
measurements of the distance of a satellite from its primary are
affected by personal equation, which we can not be sure of completely
eliminating, and thus a considerable margin of uncertainty is brought
into the masses. In the cases of Mereury and Venus, which have no
satellites, and to a certain extent in the case of the earth also, the only
available way of ascertaining the masses is from the perturbations
produced by the action of the various planets on each other. These
perturbations are of two kinds, periodic and secular. When sufficient
data have been accumulated for the exact determination of the secular
perturbations they will give the best results, but as yet it remains
advantageous to employ the periodic perturbations also.
104 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

Passing now to the photo-tachymetrical methods, we have first to
glance briefly at the mechanical appliances by which the tremendous
velocity of light has been successfully measured. They are of the sim-
plest possible character, and are based either upon a toothed wheel or
upon a revolving mirror.

The toothed-wheel method was first used by Fizeau, in 1849. To
understand its operation, imagine a gun barrel with a toothed wheel
revolving at right angles to its muzzle in such a way that the barrel is
alternately closed and opened as the teeth and the spaces between them
pass before it. Then, with the whee] in rapid motion, at the instant
when a space is opposite the muzzle let a ball be fired. It will pass out
freely, and after traversing a certam distance let it strike an elastic
cushion and be reflected back upon itsown path. When it reaches the
wheel, if it hits a space it will return into the gun barrel, but if it hits
a tooth it will be stopped. Examining the matter a little more closely
we see that, as the ball requires a certain time to go and return, if
during that time the wheel moves through an odd multiple of the angle
between a space and a tooth the ball will be stopped, while if it moves
through an even multiple of that angle the ball will return into the
barrel. Now imagine the gun barrel, the ball, and the elastic cushion to
be replaced, respectively, by a telescope, a light wave, and a mirror.
Then if the wheel moved at such a speed that the returning light wave
struck against the tooth following the space through which it issued, to
an eye looking into the telescope all would be darkness. If the wheel
moved a little faster and the returning light wave passed through the
space succeeding that through which it issued, the eye at the telescope
would perceive a flash of light, and if the speed was continuously
increased a continual succession of eclipses and illuminations would
follow each other according as the returning light was stopped against
a tooth or passed through a space farther and farther behind that
through which it issued. Under these conditions the time occupied by
the light in traversing the space from the wheel to the mirror and back
again would evidently be the same as the time required by the wheel
to revolve through the angle between the space through which the light
issued and that through which it returned, and thus the velocity of
light would become known from the distance between the telescope and
the mirror, together with the speed of the wheel. Of course the longer
the distance traversed and the greater the velocity of the wheel the
more accurate would be the result.

The revolving-mirror method was first used by Foucault in 1862.
Conceive the toothed wheel of Fizeau’s apparatus to be replaced by a
mirror attached to a vertical axis and capable of being put into rapid
rotation. Then it will be possible so to arrange the apparatus that
light issuing from the telescope shall strike the movable mirror and be
reflected to the distant mirror, whence it will be returned to the moy-
able mirror again, and being thrown back into the telescope will appear

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 105

as a star in the center of the field of view. That adjustment being
made, if the mirror were caused to revolve at a speed of some hundred
turns per second it would move through an appreciable angle while the
light was passing from it to the distant mirror and back again, and in
accordance with the laws of reflection, the star in the field of the tele-
scope would move from the center by twice the angle through which
the mirror had turned. Thus the deviation of the star from the center
of the field would measure the angle through which the mirror turned
during the time occupied by light in passing twice over the interval
between the fixed and revolving mirrors, and from the magnitude of
that angle, together with the known speed of the mirror, the velocity
of the light could be calculated.

In applying either of these methods the resulting velocity is that of
light when traversing the earth’s atmosphere, but what we want is its
velocity in space, which we suppose to be destitute of ponderable
material, and in order to obtain that the velocity in the atmosphere
must be multiplied by the refractive index of air. The correct velocity
so obtained can then be used to find the solar parallax, either from the
time required by light to traverse the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit,
or from the ratio of the velocity of light to the orbital velocity of the
earth.

Any periodic correction which occurs in computing the place of a
heavenly body or the time of a celestial phenomenon is called by
astronomers an equation, and as the time required by light to traverse
the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit first presented itself in the guise of
a correction to the computed times of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites,
it has received the name of the light equation. The earth’s orbit being
interior to that of Jupiter, and both having the sun for their center, it
is evident that the distances between the two planets must vary from
the sum to the difference of the radii of their respective orbits, and the
time required by light to travel from one planet to the other must vary
proportionately. Consequently, if the observed times of the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites are compared with the times computed upon the
assumption that the two planets are always separated by their mean
distance, it will be found that the eclipses occur too early when the
earth is at less than its mean distance from Jupiter, and too late when
it is farther off, and from large numbers of such observations the value
of the light equation has been deduced.

The combination of the motion of light through our atmosphere with
the orbital motion of the earth gives rise to the annual aberration, all
the phases of which are computed from its maximum value, commonly
called the constant of aberration. There is also a diurnal aberration
due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, but that is quite small and
does not concern us this evening. When aberration was discovered
the corpuscular theory of light was in vogue, and it offered a charm-
ingly simple explanation of the whole phenomenon. The hypothetical
106 - ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

light corpuscles impinging upon the earth were thought to behave pre-
cisely like the drops in a shower of rain, and you all know that their
apparent direction is affected by any motion on the part of the observer.
In acalm day, when the drops are falling perpendicularly, a man stand-
ing still holds his umbrella directly over his head, but as soon as he
begins to move forward he inclines his umbrella in the same direction,
and the more rapidly he moves the greater must be its inclination in
order to meet the descending shower. Similarly, the apparent direc-
tion of oncoming light corpuscles would be affected by the orbital
motion of the earth, so that in effect it would always be the resultant
arising from combining the motion of the light with a motion equal and
opposite to that of the earth. But since the falsity of the corpuscular
theory has been proved that explanation is no longer tenable, aud as
yet we have not been able to replace it with anything equally satis-
factory based on the now universally accepted undulatory theory. In
accordance with the latter theory we must conceive the earth as plow-
ing its way through the ether, and the point which has hitherto baffled
us is whether or not in so doing it produces any disturbance of the ether
which affects the aberration. In our present ignorance on that point
we can only say that the aberration constant 1s certainly very nearly |
equal to the ratio of the earth’s orbital velocity to the velocity of light,
but we can not affirm that it is rigorously so.

The luminiferous ether was invented to account for the phenomena
of light, and for two hundred years it was not suspected of having any
other function. The emission theory postulated only the corpuscles
which constitute light itself, but the undulatory theory fills all space
with an imponderable substance possessing properties even more
remarkable than those of ordinary matter, and to some of the acutest
intellects the magnitude of this idea has proved an almost insuperable
objection against the whole theory. So late as 1862 Sir David Brews-
ter, who had gained a world-wide reputation by his optical researches,
expressed himself as staggered by the notion of filling all space with
some substance merely to enable a little twinkling star to send its
light to us; but not long after Clerk Maxwell removed that difficulty
by a discovery coextensive with the undulatory theory itself. Since
1845, when Faraday first performed his celebrated experiment of mag-
netizing a ray of light, the idea that electricity is a phenomenon of the
ether had been steadily growing, until at last Maxwell perceived that
if such were the fact the rate of propagation of an electro-magnetic
wave must be the same as the velocity of light. At that time no one
knew how to generate such waves, but Maxwell’s theory showed him
that their velocity must be equal to the number of electric units of
quantity in the electro-magnet unit, and careful experiments soon proved
that that is the velocity of light. Thus it was put almost beyond the
possibility of doubt that the ether gives rise to the phenomena of elec-
tricity and magnetism as well as to those of light, and perhaps it may

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 107

even be concerned in the production of gravitation itself. What could
be apparently more remote than these electric quantities and the solar
parallax? And yet we have here a relation between them, but we
make no use of it because as yet the same relation can be far more
accurately determined from experiments upop the velocity of light.

Now, let us recall the quantities and methods of observation which
we have found to be involved, either directly or indirectly, with the
solar parallax. They are, the solar parallax, obtained from transits of
Venus, oppositions of Mars, and oppositions of certain asteroids; the
lunar parallax, found both directly and from measurements of the force
of gravity at the earth’s surface; the constants of precession, nutation,
and aberration, obtained from observations of the stars; the parallac-
tic inequality of the moon; the lunar inequality of the earth, usually
obtained from observations of the sun, but recently found from heli-
ometer observations of certain asteroids; the mass of the earth, found
from the solar parallax and also from the periodic and secular pertur-
bations of Venus and Mars; the mass of the moon, found from the
lunar inequality of the earth and also from the ratio of the solar and
lunar components of the ocean tides; the masses of all the planets,
obtained from observations of their satellites whenever possible, and
when no satellites exist, then from observations of their mutual pertur-
bations, both periodic and secular; the velocity of light, obtained from
experiments with revolving mirrors and toothed wheels, together with
laboratory determinations of the index of refraction of atmospheric
air; the light equation, obtained from observations of the eclipses of
Jupiter’s satellites; the figure of the earth, obtained from geodetic
triangulations, measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum
in various latitudes, and observations of certain perturbations of the
moon; the mean density of the earth, obtained from measurements of
the attractions of mountains, from pendulum experiments in mines,
and from experiments on the attraction of known masses of matter
made either with torsion balances or with the most delicate chemical
balances; the surface density of the earth, obtained from geological
examinations of the surface strata; and, lastly, the law of distribution
of density in the interior of the earth, which in the present state of
geological knowledge we can do little more than guess at.

Here, then, we have a large group of astronomical, geodetic, geological
and physical quantities which must all be considered in finding the
solar parallax, and which are all so entangled with each other that no
one of them can be varied without affecting all the rest. It is there-
fore impossible to make an accurate determination of any one of them
apart from the remainder of the group, and thus we are driven to the
conclusion that they must all be determined simultaneously. Such has
not been the practice of astronomers in the past, but it is the method
to which they must inevitably resort in the future. A cursory glance
at an analogous problem occurring in geodesy may be instructive.
108 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

When a country is covered with a net of triangles it is always found
that the observed angles are subject to a certain amount of error, and
a century ago it was the habit to correct the angles in each triangle
without much regard to the effect upon adjacent triangles. Conse-
quently the adjustment of the errors was imperfect, and in computing
the interval between any two distant points the result would vary some-
what with the triangles used in the computation—that is, if one compu-
tation was made through a chain of triangles running around on the
right-hand side, another through a chain of triangles running straight
between the two points, and a third through a chain of triangles run-
ning around on the left-hand side, the results were usually all different.
At that time things were less highly specialized than now, and all geo-
detic operations were yet in the hands of first-rate astronomers, who
soon devised processes for overcoming the difficulty. They imagined
every observed angle to be subject to a small correction, and as these
corrections were all entangled with each other through the geometrical
conditions of the net, by a most ingenious application of the method of
least squares they determined them all simultaneously in such a way as
to satisfy the whole of the geometrical conditions. Thus the best posst-
ble adjustment was obtained, and no matter what triangles were used
in passing from one point to another, the result was always the same.
That method is now applied to every important triangulation, and its
omission would be regarded as proof of incompetency on the part of
those in charge of the work.

Now let us compare the conditions existing respectively in a trian-
gulation net and in the group of quantities for the determination of the
solar parallax. In the net every angle is subject to a small correction,
and the whole system of corrections must be so determined as to make
the sum of their weighted squares a minimum and at the same time
satisfy all the geometrical conditions of the net. Like the triangles,
the quantities composing the group from which the solar parallax must
be determined are all subject to error, and therefore we must regard
each of them as requiring a small correction, and all these corrections
must be so determ.ned as to make the sum of their weighted squares a
minimum, and at the same time satisfy every one of the equations
expressing the relations between the various components of the group.

Thus it appears that the method required for adjusting the solar par-
allax and its related constants is in all respects the same as that which
has so long been used for adjusting systems of triangulation, and as
the latter method was invented by astronomers, it is natural to inquire
Why have they not applied it to the fundamental problem of their own
science? The reasons are various, but they may all be classed under
two heads: First, an inveterate habit of overestimating the accuracy
of our own work as compared with that of others; and second, the
unfortunate effect of too much specialization.
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 109

The prevailing opinion certainly is that great advances have recently
been made in astronomy, and so they have in the fields of spectral
analysis and in the measurement of minute quantities of radiant heat;
but the solution of the vast majority of astronomical problems depends
upon the exact measurement of angles, and in that little or no progress
has been made. Bradley, with his zenith sector a hundred and fifty
years ago, and Bessel and Struve, with their circles and transit instru-
ments seventy years ago, made observations not sensibly inferior to
those of the present day, and indeed it would have been surprising if
they had not done so. The essentials for accurately determining star
places are a skilled observer, a clock, and a transit circle, the latter
consisting of a telescope, a divided circle, and four micrometer micro-
scopes. Surely no one will claim that we have to-day any more skillful
observers than were Bessel, Bradley, and Struve, and the only way in
which we have improved upon the telescopes made by Dollond one
hundred and thirty years ago is by increasing their aperture and rela-
tively diminishing their focal distance. The most famous dividing
engine now in existence was made by the elder Repsold seventy-five
years ago; but as the errors of divided circles and their micrometer
microscopes are always carefully determined, the accuracy of the meas-
ured angles is quite independent of any small improvement in the
accuracy of the divisions or of the micrometer screws. Only in the
matter of clocks has there been some advance, and even that is not
very great. On the whole, the star places of to-day are a little better
than those of seventy-five years ago, but even yet there is great room
for improvement. One of the commonest applications of these star
places is to the determination of latitude, but it is very doubtful if
there is any point on the face of the earth whose latitude is known
certainly within one-tenth of a second.

Looking at the question from another point of view, it is notorious
that the contact observations of the transits of Venus in 1761 and L769
were so discordant that from the same observations Encke and E. J.
Stone got respectively for the solar parallax 8.59’ and 8.91’... In 1870
no one thought it possible that there could be any difficulty with the
contact observations of the then approaching transits of 1874 and 1882,
but we have found from sad experience that our vaunted modern instru-
ments gave very little better results for the last pair of transits than
our predecessors obtained with much cruder appliances in 1761 and 1769,

The theory of probability and uniform experience alike show that the
limit of accuracy attainable with any instrument is soon reached; and
yet we all know the fascination which continually lures us on in our
efforts to get better results out of the familiar telescopes and circles
which have constituted the standard equipment of observatories for
nearly a century. Possibly these instruments may be capable of indi-
cating somewhat smaller quantities than we have hitherto succeeded
110 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

in measuring with them, but their limit can not be far off, because they
already show the disturbing effects of slight inequalities of temperature
and other uncontrollable causes. So far as these effects are accidental
they eliminate themselves from every long series of observations, but
there always remains a residuum of constant error, perhaps quite
unsuspected, which gives us no end of trouble. Encke’s value of the
solar parallax affords a fine illustration.of this. From the transits of
Venus in 1761 and 1769 he found 8.58” in 1824, which he subsequently
corrected to 8.57’, and for thirty years that value was universally
accepted. The first objection to it came from Hansen in 1854, a second
followed from Leverrier in 1858, both based upon facts connected with
the lunar theory, and eventually it became evident that Encke’s parallax
was about one-fourth of a second too small. :

Now please observe that Encke’s value was obtained trigonometric-
ally, and its inaccuracy was never suspected until it was revealed by
eravitational methods, which were themselves in error about one-tenth
of a second and required subsequent correction in other ways. Here,
then, was a lesson to astronomers, who are all more or less specialists,
but it merely enforced the perfectly well-known principle .that the con-
stant errors of any one method are accidental errors with respect to all
other methods, and therefore the readiest way of eliminating them is
by combining the results from as many different methods as possible.
However, the abler the specialist the more certain he is to be blind to
all methods but his own, and astronomers have profited so little by the
Encke-Hansen-Leverrier incident of thirty-five years ago that to-day
they are mostly divided into two great parties, one of whom holds that
the parallax can be best determined from a combination of the constant
of aberration with the velocity of light and the other believes only in
the results of heliometer measurements upon asteroids. By all means
continue the heliometer measurements and do everything possible to
clear up the mystery which now surrounds the constant of aberration,
but why ignore the work of predecessors who were quite as able as
ourselves? If it were desired to determine some one angle of a triangu-
lation net with special exactness, what would be thought of a man who
attempted to do so by repeated measurements of the angle in question
while he persistently neglected to adjust the net? And yet until
very recently astronomers have been doing precisely that kind of
thing with the solar parallax. Ido not think there is any exaggeration
in saying that the trustworthy observations now on record for the
determination of the numerous quantities which are functions of the
parallax could not, be duplicated by the most industrious astronomer
working continuously for a thousand years. How, then, can we suppose
that the result properly deducible from them can be materially affected
by anything that any of us can do in a lifetime unless we are fortunate
enough to invent methods of measurement vastly superior to any

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. Peat

hitherto imagined? Probably the existing observations for the deter-
mination of most of these quantities are as exact as any that can ever
be made with our present instruments, and if they were freed from
constant errors they would certainly give results very near the truth.
To that end we have only to form a system of simultaneous equations
between all the observed quantities and then deduce the most probable
values of these quantities by the method of least squares. Perhaps
some of you may think that the value so obtained for the solar parallax
would depend largely upon the relative weights assigned to the various
quantities, but such is not the case. With almost any possible system
of weights the solar parallax will come out very nearly 8.809” + 0.0057’,
whence we have for the mean distance between the earth and the sun
92,797,000 miles, with a probable error of only 59,700 miles; and for
the diameter of the solar system, measured to its outermost member,
the planet Neptune, 5,578,400,000 miles.
SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS!

By WILLIAM H. PICKERING.

It is probable that the astronomer whose name is most closely linked
with the planet Mars at the present time is Giovanni Schiaparelli;
and yet, although nearly everybody has heard of Schiaparelli’s canals,
very few astronomers even, outside of France and Italy, had until
recently more than a very vague notion what were really his ideas in
regard to them. This is due probably to the fact that he has written
exclusively in Italian, a language which very few American astrono-
mers, and I believe very few English ones, understand. To this fact
chiefly, I think, is due the great incredulity with which his observa-
tions have been treated, at least until recently, in both of these coun-
tries. Astronomers could understand his maps; they knew, therefore,
what he had done, but they could not understand his descriptions of
his observations, and so were incredulous regarding their accuracy.
Moreover, such a mass‘of detail appeared upon his maps, which had
not before been seen by others, that it completely masked the more
striking features of the planet, thus rendering its appearance entirely
different from that which it presented in the telescope under ordinary
atmospheric conditions.

But within the last few years a change has occurred. Flammarion
has translated a large part of Schiaparelli’s writings into French, a
language with which most English speaking astronomers are familiar,
and moreover the canals have been seen by a number of astronomers
whose descriptions of them in Englsh and French could be under-
stood and were found to agree with those of Schiaparelli.

But errors are still frequently made by people who might be expected
to know better. Thus, many people suppose that Schiaparelli was the
original discoverer of the canals, a claim which he never made for him-
self. In point of fact, some of them appear upon maps of the planet
published more than fifty years ago. The former English incredulity
in the matter seems the more strange, smce many of the canals were
seen by Dawes in 1864 and by Burton and Dreyer in 1879. Schia-
parelli, however, has discovered far more canals than anyone else, and
he is also the discoverer of their gemination.

In this connection it may be that a brief chronological statement of
the more important facts and discoveries relating to Mars will not be
without interest. In compiling it I have been chiefly indebted to Flam-
marion’s classic work, La Planéte Mars, although other sources have
also been consulted.

272 B. C. The first known observation of Mars is recorded in Ptol-
emy’s Almagest.

1610 A. D. The phases of Mars were discovered by Galileo.

1659, The first sketch showing surface detail was made by Huy-
gens. He also suggested a rotation in twenty-four hours.

1666. Cassini determined the rotation of Mars to take place in
twenty-tour hours and forty minutes. Healso observed the polar caps,
and “he distinguished on the disk of Mars, near the terminator, a
white spot advancing into the dark portion, and representing, without
doubt, like those of the moon, a roughness or irregularity of the sur-
face.” This latter statement is curious, but the effect was undoubtedly
due to irradiation, since his telescope was entirely inadequate to enable
him to observe such a delicate phenomenon.

1777. With the exception of Huygens, Hooke, and possibly Maraldi,
no one succeeded in making recognizable sketches of the surface detail
upon Mars for over a century, until Sir William Herschel took the mat-
ter up in this year.

1783. Sir William Herschel detected the variation of the size of the
polar snoweaps with the seasons, measured the polar compression, and
determined the inclination of the axis of the planet to its orbit.

1785-1802. Schroeter made an extended study of the planet. His
drawings are upon the whole rather better than those of Herschel. He
discovered, among other things, the very dark spots to which I have
referred in my publications as the Northern and Equatorial Seas. He,
however, supposed them to be clouds.

1840. Beer and Maedler published the first map of the planet, assign-
ing latitudes and longitudes to the various markings. On this map are
indicated the first canals and the first of the small lakes, so many of
which have been discovered during the last few years. The canals are
Nectar and Agathodzemon and portions of Hades and Tartarus. The
lake is Lacus Pheenicis. Their map is the first: satisfactory represen-
tation of the entire surface of the planet. The only region which pre-
vious observers had clearly distinguished was that in the vicinity of
the Syrtis Major.

1858. Secchi made a careful study of the colors exhibited by the
planet.

1862. Lockyer made the first series of really good sketches of the
planet, showing all the characteristic forms with which we are now so
familiar. His drawings, and also those of some of the other observers,
give the first indications of the appearance of the central branch-in
the Y, so called by Secchi.

1864. Dawes detected eight or ten of the canals.

1867. Huggins detected lines due to the presence of water vapor in
the spectrum of Mars.

1867. Proctor determined the period of rotation of Mars within 0.1
second.

1877. Hall discovered the two satellites of Mars.

1877. Green made a very excellent series of drawings of the planet,
superior to anything which had preceded them.

1877. Schiaparelli made the first extensive triangulation of the sur-
face of the planet, and added very largely to the number of known
canals.

1879. Schiaparelli detected the gemination of Nilus, the first known
double canal.

1882. Schiaparelli discovered numerous double canals, and announced
that the appearance formed one of the characteristic phenomena of the
planet.

The most reliable confirmation of this phenomenon hitherto reported
has come from Perrotin, of Nice, and A. Stanley Williams, in England.
If Schiaparelli’s theory is correct, that the duplication occurs only
between the spring and autumn equinoxes of the Northern Hemisphere,
the last opportunity to witness it was in 1890, and the next will be in
January and February of 1895, unless the planet proves to be too
remote at that period.

Very few of Schiaparelli’s writings have ever been translated into
English, and none so far as I know, hitherto, without the intervention
of some other language, such as German or French. The following
translation is from Natura ed Arte for February 15, 1893. It gives
the latest expression of his views upon the periodical inundations expe-
rienced by the planet, upon the nature of the seas, the canals, and the
gemination of the latter.

LOWELL OBSERVATORY, FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ., August 26, 1894.

THE PLANET MARS.
By GIOVANNI SCHIAPARELLI.

Many of the first astronomers who studied Mars with the telescope
had noted on the outline of its disk two brilliant white spots of rounded
form and of variable size. In process of time it was observed that
while the ordinary spots upon Mars were displaced rapidly in conse-
quence of its daily rotation, changing in a few hours both their posi-
tion and their perspective, the two white spots remained sensibly
motionless at their posts. It was concluded rightly from this that
116 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

they must occupy the poles of rotation of the planet, or at least must
be found very near to them. Consequently they were given the name
of polar caps or spots. And not without reason is it conjectured that
these represent upon Mars that immense mass of snow and ice which
still to-day prevents navigators from reaching the poles of the earth.
We are led to this conelusion not only by the analogy of aspect and of
place, but also by another important observation. - -— -

As things stand, it is manifest that if the above-mentioned white
polar spots of Mars represent snow and ice they should continue to
decrease in size with the approach of summer in those places and
increase during the winter. Now this very fact is observed in the
most evident manner. In the second half of the year 182 the south-
ern polar cap was in full view; during that interval, and especially in
the months of July and August, its rapid diminution from week to week
was very evident even to those observing with common telescopes.
This snow (for we may well call it so), which in the beginning reached
as far as latitude 70° and formed a cap of over 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) in diameter, progressively diminished, so that two or three months
later little more of it remained than an area of perhaps 300 kilometers
(180 miles) at the most, and still less was seen in the last days of 1892.
In these months the southern hemisphere of Mars had its summer,
the summer solstice occurring upon October 13. Correspondingly the
mass of snow surrounding the northern pole should have increased;
but this fact was not observable, since that pole was situated in the
hemisphere of Mars which was opposite to that facing the earth. The
melting of the northern snow was seen in its turn in the years L882,
1884, and 1886.

These observations of the alternate increase and decrease of the polar
snows are easily made even with telescopes of moderate power, but
they become much more interesting and instructive when we can follow
assiduously the changes in their more minute particulars, using larger
instruments. The snowy regions are then seen to be successively
notched at their edges; black holes and huge fissures are formed in
their interiors; great isolated pieces many miles in extent stand out
from the principal mass and, dissolving, disappear a little later. In
short, the same divisions and movements of these icy fields present
themselves to us at a glance that occur during the summer of our own
arctic regions, according to the descriptions of explorers.

The southern snow, however, presents this peculiarity: The center
of its irregularly rounded figure does not coincide exactly with the pole,
but is situated at another point, which is nearly always the same, and
is distant from the pole about 300 kilometers (180 miles) in the diree-
tion of the Mare Erythreum. From this we conclude that when the
area of the snow is reduced to its smallest extent the south pole of
Mars is uncovered, and therefore, perhaps, the problem of reaching
it upon this planet is easier than upon the earth. The southern snow

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 117

is in the midst of a huge dark spot, which with its branches occupies
nearly one-third of the whole surface of Mars, and is supposed to repre-
sent its principal ocean. Hence the analogy with our arctic and
antarctic snows may be said to be complete, and especially so with the
antarctie one.

The mass of the northern snow cap of Mars is, on the other hand,
centered almost exactly upon its pole. It is located in a region of
yellow color, which we are accustomed to consider as representing the
continent of the planet. rom this arises a singular phenomenon which
has no analogy upon the earth. At the melting of the snows accumu-
lated at that pole during the long night of ten months and more the
liquid mass produced in that operation is diffused around the cireum-
ference of the snowy region, converting a large zone of surrounding
land into a temporary sea and filling all the lower regions. This pro-
duces a gigantic inundation, which has led some observers to suppose
the existence of another ocean in those parts, but which does not really
exist in that place, at least as a permanent sea. We see then (the last
opportunity was in 1884) the white spot of the snow surrounded by a
dark zone, which follows its perimeter in its progressive diminution,
upon a circumference ever more and more narrow. The outer part of
this zone branches out into dark lines, which occupy all the surround-
ing region, and seem to be distributary canals by which the liquid
mass may return to its natural position. This produces in these regions
very extensive lakes, such as that designated upon the map by the name
of Lacus Hyperboreus; the neighboring interior sea called Mare Acida-
lium becomes more black and more conspicuous. And it is to be
remembered as a very probable thing that the flowing of this melted
snow is the cause which determines principally the hydrographic state
of the planet and the variations that are periodically observed in its
aspect. Something similar would be seen upon the earth if one of our
poles came to be located suddenly in the center of Asia or of Africa.
As things stand at present, we may find a miniature image of these
conditions in the flooding that is observed in our streams at the melt-
ing of the Alpine snows.

Travelers in the arctic regions have frequent occasion to observe how
the state of the polar ice at the beginning of the summer, and even at
the beginning of July,is always very unfavorable to their progress.
The best season for exploration is in the month of August, and Sep-
tember is the month in which the trouble from the ice is the least.
Thus in September our Alps are usually more practicable than at any
other season. And the reason for it is clear—the melting of the snow
requires time; a high temperature is not sufficient; it 1s necessary that
it should continue, and its effect will be so much the greater, as 1t is
the more prolonged. Thus, if we could slow down the course of our
season so that each month should last sixty days instead of thirty, in
the summer, in such a lengthened condition, the melting of the ice
118 SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

would progress much further, and perhaps it would not be an exagger-
ation to say that the polar cap at the end of the warm season would
be entirely destroyed. But one can not doubt, in any case, that the
fixed portion of such a cap would be reduced to much smaller size, than
we see it to-day. Now, this is exactly what happens on Mars. The
long year, nearly double our own, permits the ice to accumulate during
the polar night of ten or twelve months, so as to descend in the form of
a continuous layer as far as parallel 70°, or even farther. But in the
day which follows, of twelve or ten months, the sun has time to melt
all, or nearly all, of the snow of recent formation, reducing it to such a
small area that it seems to us no more than a very white point. And
perhaps this snow is entirely destroyed; but of this there is at present
no satisfactory observation.

Other white spots of a transitory character and of a less regular
arrangement are formed in the southern hemisphere upon the islands
near the pole, and also in the opposite hemisphere whitish regions
appear at times surrounding the north pole and reaching to 50° and
55° of latitude. They are, perhaps, transitory snows, similar to those
which are observed in our latitudes. But also in the torrid zone of
Mars are seen some very small white spots more or less persistent;
among others one was seen by me in three consecutive oppositions
(1877-1882) at the point indicated upon our chart by longitude 268°
and latitude 16° north. Perhaps we may be permitted to imagine in
this place the existence of a mountain capable of supporting extensive
ice fields. ‘The existence of such a mountain has also been suggested
by some recent observers upon other grounds.

As has been stated, the polar snows of Mars prove in an incontro-
vertible manner that this planet, like the earth, is surrounded by an
atmosphere capable of transporting vapor from one place to another.
These snows are in fact precipitations of vapor, condensed by the cold,
and carried with it successively. How carried with it if not by atmos-
pheric movement? The existence of an atmosphere charged with
vapor has been confirmed also by spectroscopic observations, princi-
pally those of Vogel, according to which this atmosphere must be of a
composition differing little from our own, and, above all, very rich in
aqueous vapor. This is a fact of the highest importance, because from
it we can rightly affirm with much probability that to water and to no
other liquid is due the seas of Mars and its polar snows. When this
conclusion is assured beyond all doubt, another one may be derived
from it of not less importance—that the temperature of the Arean cli-
mate, notwithstanding the greater distance of that planet from the
sun, is of the same order as the temperature of the terrestrial one.
Because, if it were true, as has been supposed by some investigators,
that the temperature of Mars was on the average very low (from 50°
to 60° below zero), it would not be possible for water vapor to be an
important element in the atmosphere of that planet, nor could water

SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 119

be an important factor in its physical changes, but would give place
to carbonic acid, or to some other liquid whose freezing point was
much lower.

The elements of the meteorology of Mars seem, then, to have a close
analogy to those of the earth. But there are not lacking, as might be
expected, causes of dissimilarity. From circumstances of the smallest
moment nature brings forth an infinite variety in its operations. Of
the greatest influence must be different arrangement of the seas and
the continents upon Mars and upon the earth, regarding which a
glance at the map will say more than would be possible in many words.
We have already emphasized the fact of the extraordinary periodical
flood, which at every revolution of Mars inundates the northern polar
region at the melting of the snow. Let us now add that this inun-
dation is spread out to a great distance by means of a network of
canals, perhaps constituting the principal mechanism (if not the only
one) by which water (and with it organic life) may be diffused over
the arid surface of the planet. Because on Mars it rains very rarely,
or perhaps even it does not rain at all. And this is the proof.

Let us carry ourselves in imagination into celestial space, to a point
so distant from the earth that we may embrace it all at a single glance.
He would be greatly in error who had expected to see reproduced there
upon a great scale the image of our continents with their gulfsS and
islands and with the seas that surround them which are seen upon our
artificial globes. Then without doubt the known forms or part of them
would be seen to appear under a vaporous veil, but a great part (per-
haps one-half) of the surface would he rendered invisible by the
immense fields of cloud, continually varying in density, in form, and
in extent. Such a hindrance, most frequent and continuous in the
polar regions, would still impede nearly half the time the view of the
temperate zones, distributing itself in capricious and ever varying con-
figurations. The seas of the torrid zone would be seen to be arranged
in long parallel layers, corresponding to the zone of equatorial and
tropical calms. For ar observer placed upon the moon the study of
our geography would not be so simple an undertaking as one might at
first imagine.

There is nothing of this sort in Mars. In every climate and under
every zone its atmosphere is nearly perpetually clear and sufficiently
transparent to permit one to recognize at any moment whatever the
contours of the seas and continents and, more than that, even the minor
configurations. Not indeed that vapors of a certain degree of opacity
are lacking, but they offer very little impediment to the study of the
topography of the planet. Here and there we see appear from time to
time a few whitish spots, changing their position and their form, rarely
extending over a very wide area. They frequent by preference a few
regions, such as the islands of the Mare Australe, and on the conti-
nents the regions designated on the map with the names of Elysium
120 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

and Tempe. Their brilliancy generally diminishes and disappears at
the meridian hour of the place, and is reenforced in the morning and
evening with very marked variations. It is possible that they may be
layers of cloud, because the upper portions of terrestrial clouds where
they are illuminated by the sun appear white. But various observa-
tions lead us to think that we are dealing rather with a thin veil of fog
instead of a true nimbus cloud, carrying storms and rain. Indeed, it
may be merely a temporary condensation of vapor under the torm of
dew or hoar frost.

Accordingly, as far as we may be permitted to argue from the
observed facts, the climate of Mars must resemble that of a clear day
upon a high mountain. By day a very strong solar radiation, hardly
mitigated at all by mist or vapor; by night a copious radiation from the
soil toward celestial space, and because of that a very marked refriger-
ation. Hence a climate of extremes, and great changes of temperature
from day to night, and from one season to another. And as on the
earth at altitudes of 5,000 and 6,000 meters (17,000 to 20,000 feet) the
vapor of the atmosphere is condensed only into the solid form, produe-
ing those whitish masses of suspended crystals which we eall cirrus
clouds, so in the atmosphere of Mars it would be rarely possible (or
would even be impossible) to find collections of cloud capable of pro-
ducing rain of any consequence. The variation of the temperature
from one season to another would be notably increased by their long
duration, and thus we can understand the great freezing and melting
of the snow, which is renewed in turn at the poles at each complete
revolution of the planet around the sun.

As our chart demonstrates, in its general topography Mars does not
present any analogy with the earth. A third of its surface is occupied
by the great Mare Australe, which is strewn with many islands, and
the continents are cut up by gulfs and ramifications of various forms.
To the general water system belongs an entire series of small internal
seas, of which the Hadriacum and the Tyrrhenum communicate with it
by wide mouths, whilst the Cimmerium, the Sirenum, and the Solis
Lacus are connected with it only by means of narrow canals. We shall
notice in the first four a parallel arrangement, which certainly is not
accidental, as also not without reason is the corresponding position of
the peninsulas of Ausonia, Hesperia, and Atlantis. The color of the
seas of Mars is generally brown, mixed with gray, but not always of
equal intensity in all places, nor is it the same in the same place at all
times. From an absolute black it may descend to a light-gray or to an
ash color. Such a diversity of colors may have its origin in various
causes, and is not without analogy also upon the earth, where it is noted
that the seas of the warm zone are usually much darker than those
nearer the pole. The water of the Baltic, for example, has a light,
muddy color that is not observed in the Mediterranean. And thus in

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. Lt

the seas of Mars we see the color become darker when the sun approaches
their zenith, and summer begins to rule in that region.

All of the remainder of the planet, as far as the north pole, is occu-
pied by the mass of the continents, in which, save in afew areas of. rel-
atively small extent, an orange color predominates, which sometimes
reaches a dark red tint, and in others descends to yellow and white.
The variety in this coloring is in part of meteorological origin, in part
it may depend on the diverse nature of the soil, but upon its real cause
it is not as yet possible to frame any very well grounded hypothesis.
Nevertheless, the cause of this predominance of the red and yellow
tints upon the surface of ancient Pyrois is well known.' Some have
thought to attribute this coloring to the atmosphere of Mars, through
which the surface of the planet might be seen colored, as any terres-
trial object becomes red when seen through red glass. But many facts
are opposed to this idea, among others that the polar snows appear
always of the purest white, although the rays of light derived from
them traverse twice the atmosphere of Mars under great obliquity.
We must then conclude that the Arean continents appear red and
yellow because they are so in fact.

Besides these dark and light regions, which we have described as
seas and continents, and of whose nature there is at present scarcely
left any room for doubt, some others exist, truly of small extent, of an
amphibious nature, which sometimes appear yellowish like the con-
tinents, and are sometimes clothed in brown (even black in certain
cases), and assume the appearance of seas, whilst in other cases their
color is intermediate in tint, and leaves us in doubt to which class of
regions they may belong. Thus all the islands scattered through the
Mare Australe and the Mare Erythreeum belong to this category; so
too the long peninsula called Deucalionis Regio and Pyrrhe Regio,
and in the vicinity of the Mare Acidalium the regions designated by
the names of Baltia and Nerigos. The most natural idea, and the one
to which we should be led by analogy, is to suppose these regions to
represent huge swamps, in which the variation in depth of the water
produces the diversity of colors. Yellow would predominate in those
parts where the depth of the liquid layer was reduced to little or
nothing, and brown, more or less dark, in those places where the water
was sufficiently deep to absorb more light and to render the bottom
more or less invisible. That the water of the sea, or any other deep
and transparent water, seen from above, appears more dark the greater
the depth of the liquid stratum, and that the land in comparison with
it appears bright under the solar illumination, is known and confirmed
by certain physical reasons. The traveler in the Alps often has occa-
sion to convince himself of it, seeing from the summits the deep lakes

any translation of the name,—Translator.
122 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

with which the region is strewn extending under his feet as black as
ink, whilst in contrast with them even the blackest rocks illumined by
the sunlight appeared brilliant. !

Not without reason, then, have we hitherto attributed to the dark
spots of Mars the part of seas, and that of continents to the reddish
areas which occupy nearly two-thirds of all the planet, and we shall
find later other reasons which confirm this method of reasoning. The
continents form in the northern hemisphere a nearly continuous mass,
the only important exception being the great lake called the Mare
Acidalium, of which the extent may vary according to the time, and
which is connected in some way with the inundations which we have
said were produced by the melting of the snow surrounding the north
pole. To the system of the Mare Acidalium undoubtedly belong the
temporary lake called Lacus Hyperboreus and the Lacus Niliacus.
This last is ordinarily separated from the Mare Acidalium by means of
an isthmus or regular dam, of which the continuity was only seen to
be broken once for a short time in 1888. Other smaller dark spots are
found here and there in the continental area which we may designate
as lakes, but they are certainly not permanent lakes like ours, but are
variable in appearance and size according to the seasons, to the point
of wholly disappearing under certain circumstances. Ismenius Lacus,
Lune Lacus, Trivium Charontis, and Propontis are the most conspicu-
ous and durable ones. There are also smaller ones, such as Lacus
Moeris and Fons Juvente, which at their maximum size do not exceed
100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles) in diameter, and are among the
most difficult objects upon the planet.

All the vast extent of the continents is furrowed upon every side by
a network of numerous lines or fine stripes of a more or less pro-
nounced dark color, whose aspect is very variable. These traverse the
planet for long distances in regular lines that do not at all resemble
the winding courses of our streams. Some of the shorter ones do not
reach 500 kilometers (300 miles), others, on the other hand, extend for
many thousands, occupying a quarter or sometimes even a third of a
circumference of the planet. Some of these are very easy to see,
especially that one which is near the extreme left-hand limit of our
map, and is designated by the name of Nilosyrtis. Others in turn are
extremely difficult, and resemble the finest thread of spider’s web
drawn across the disk. They are subject also to great variations in
their breadth, which may reach 200 or even 300 kilometers (120 to
180 miles) for the Nilosyrtis, whilst some are scarcely 30 kilometers (18
miles) broad.

'This observation of the dark color which deep water exhibits when seen from
above is found already noted by the first author of antique memory, for in the
Iliad (verses 770-771 of Book V) it is described how “the sentinel from the high
sentry box extends his glance over the wine-colored sea, ofvora révrov.” In the
version of Monti the adjective indicating the color is lost,

These lines or stripes are the famous canals of Mars, of which so
much has been said. As far as we have been able to observe them
hitherto, they are certainly fixed configurations upon the planet. The
Nilosyrtis has been seen in that place for nearly one hundred years, and
some of the others for at least thirty years. Their length and arrange-
ment are constant, or vary only between very narrow limits. Each of
them always begins and ends between the same regions. But their
appearance and their degree of visibility vary greatly, for all of them,
from one opposition to another, and even from one week to another,
and these variations do not take place simultaneously and according to
the same laws for all, but in most cases happen apparently capriciously,
‘or at least according to laws not sufficiently simple for us to be able to
unravel. Often one or more become indistinct, or even wholly invisi-
ble, whilst others in their vicinity increase to the point of becoming
conspicuous even in telescopes of moderate power. The first of our
maps shows all those that have been seen in a long series of observa.
tions. This does not at all correspond to the appearance of Mars at any
given period, because generally only a few are visible at once.'

Every canal (for now we shall so call them) opens at its ends either
into a sea, or into a lake, or into another canal, or else into the inter-
section of several other canals. None of them have yet been seen cut
off in the middle of the continent, remaining without beginning or
without end. This fact is of the highest importance. The canals may
intersect among themselves at all possible angles, but by preference
they converge toward the small spots to which we have given the name
of lakes. For example, seven are seen to converge in Lacus Pheenicis,
eight in Trivium Charontis, six in Lune Lacus, and six in Ismenius
Lacus.

The normal appearance of a canal is that of a nearly uniform stripe,
black, or at least of a dark color, similar to that of the seas, in which
the regularity of its general course does not exclude small variations in
its breadth and small sinuosities in its two sides. Often it happens
that such a dark line opening out upon the sea is enlarged into the form
of a trumpet, forming a huge bay, similar to the estuaries of certain
terrestrial streams. The Margaritifer Sinus, the Aonius Sinus, the

1In a footnote the author refers to a drawing of Mars made by himseif, September
15, 1892, and says, - - - ‘At the top of the disk the Mare Erythreum and the
Mare Australe appear divided by a great curved peninsula, shaped like a sickle,
producing an unusual appearance in the area called Deucalionis Regio, which was
prolonged that year so as to reach the islands of Noachis and Argyre. This region
forms with them a continuous whole, but with faint traces of separation occurring
here and there in a length of nearly 6,000 kilometers (4,000 miles). Its color, much
less brilliant than that of the continents, was a mixture of their yellow with the
brownish gray of the neighboring seas.” The interesting feature of this note is
the remark that it was an unusual appearance, the region referred to being that in
which the central branch of the fork of the Y appeared. Since no such branch was
conspicuously visible this year, it would therefore seem from the above that it was
the opposition of 1892 that was peculiar, and not the present oue.—Translator.
124 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

Aurore Sinus, and the two horns of the Sabzeus Sinus are thus formed,
at the mouths of one or more canals, opening into the Mare Erythraeum
or into the Mare Australe. The largest example of such a gulf is the
Syrtis Major, formed by the vast mouth of the Nilosyrtis, so called.
This gulf is not less than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) in breadth, and
attains nearly the same depth in a longitudinal direction. Its surface
is little less than that of the Bay of Bengal. In this case we see clearly
the dark surface of the sea continued without apparent interruption
into that of the canal. Inasmuch as the surfaces called seas are truly a
liquid expanse, we can not doubt that the canals are a simple prolonga-
tion of them, crossing the yellow areas or continents.

Of the remainder, that the lines called canals are truly great furrows
or depressions in the surface of the planet, destined for the passage of
the liquid mass and constituting for it a true hydrographic system, is
demonstrated by the phenomena which are observed during the melt-
ing of the northern snows. We have already remarked that at the
time of melting they appeared surrounded by a dark zone, forming a
species of temporary sea. At that time the canals of the surrounding
region become blacker and wider, increasing to the point of convert-
ing at a certain time all of the yellow region comprised between the
edge of the snow and the parallel of 60° north latitude into numerous
islands of small extent. Such a state of things does not cease until the
snow, reduced to its minimum area, ceases to melt. Then the breadth
of the canals diminishes, the temporary sea disappears, and the yellow
region again returns to its former area. The different phases of these
vast phenomena are renewed at each return of the seasons, and we
were able to observe them in all their particulars very easily during
the oppositions of 1882, 1884, and 1886, when the planet presented its
northern pole to terrestrial spectators. The most natural and the
most simple interpretation is that to which we have referred, of a
great inundation produced by the melting of the snows; it is entirely
logical and is sustained by evident analogy with terrestrial phenomena.
We conclude, therefore, that the canals are such in fact and not only
in name. The network formed by these was probably determined in
its origin in the geological state of the planet, and has come to be
slowly elaborated in the course of centuries. It is not necessary to
suppose them the work of intelligent beings, and, notwithstanding the
almost geometrical appearance of all of their system, we are now
inclined to believe them to be produced by the evolution of the planet,
just as on the earth we have the English Channel and the channel of
Mozambique.

It would be a problem not less curious than complicated and difficult
to study the system of this immense stream of water, upon which per-
haps depends principally the organic life upon the planet, if organic
life is found there. The variations of their appearance demonstrated
that this system is not constant. When they become displaced or

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 125

their outlines become doubtful and ill defined, it is fair to suppose that
the water is getting low or is even entirely dried up. Then, in place
of the canals there remains either nothing or at most stripes of yellowish
color differing little from the surrounding background. Sometimes
they take on a nebulous appearance, for which at present it is not pos-
sible to assign a reason. At other times true enlargements are produced,
expanding to 100, 200 or more kilometers (60 to 120 miles) in breadth,
and this sometimes happens for canals very far from the north pole,
according to laws which are unknown. This occurred in Hydaspes
in 1864, in Simois in 1879, in Ackeron in 1884, and in Triton in 1888.
The diligent and minute study of the transformations of each canal
may lead later to a knowledge of the causes of these effets.

But the most surprising phenomenon pertaining to the canals of Mars
is their gemination, which seems to occur principally in the months
which precede and in those which follow the great northern inunda-
tion—at about the times of the equinoxes. In consequence of a rapid
process, which certainly lasts at most a few days, or even perhaps,
only a few hours, and of which it has not yet been possible to determine
the particulars with certainty, a given canal changes its appearance
and is found transformed through all its length into two lines or uni-
form stripes more or less parallel to one another, and which run straight
and equal with the exact geometrical precision of the two rails of a rail-
road. But this exact course is the only point of resembiance with the
rails, because in dimensions there is no comparison possible, as it is
easy to imagine. The two lines follow very nearly the direction of the
original canal and end in the place where it ended. One of these is
often superposed as exactly as possible upon the former line, the other
being drawn anew; but in this case the original line loses all the small
irregularities and curvature that it may have originally possessed.
But it also happens that both the lines may occupy opposite sides of
the former canal and be located upon entirely new ground. The dis-
tance between the two lines differs in different geminations and varies
from 600 kilometers (360 miles) and more down to the smallest limit at
which two lines may appear separated in large visual telescopes—less
than an interval of 50 kilometers (30 miles). The breadth ot the stripes
themselves may range from the limit of visibility, which we may sup-
pose to be 30 kilometers (18 miles), up to more than 100 kilometers (60
miles). The color of the two lines varies from black to a light red,
which can hardly be distinguished from the general yellow background
of the continental surface. The space between is for the most part
yellow, but in many eases appears whitish. The gemination is not nec-
essarily confined only to the canals, but tends to be produced also in
the lakes. Often one of these is seen transformed into two short, broad,
dark lines parallel to one another and traversed by a yellow line. In
these cases the gemination is naturally short and does not exceed the
limits of the original lake.
126 SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

The gemination is not shown by all at the same time, but when the
season is at hand it begins to be produced here and there, in an isolated,
irregular manner, or at least without any easily recognizable order. In
many canals (such as the Nilosyrtis, for example) the gemination is
lacking entirely, or is scarcely visible. After having lasted for some
months, the markings fade out gradually and disappear until another
season equally favorable for their formation. Thus it happens that in
certain other seasons (especially near the southern solstice of the
planet) few are seen, or even none at all. In different oppositions the
gemination of the same canal may present different appearances as to
width, intensity, and arrangement of the two stripes; also in some
cases the direction of the lines may vary, although by the smallest
quantity, but still deviating by a small amount from the canal with
which they are directly associated. From this important fact it is
immediately understood that the gemination can not be a fixed forma-
tion upon the surface of Mars and of a geographical eharacter like
the canals. The second of our maps will give an approximate idea of
the appearance which these singular formations present. It contains
all the geminations observed since 1882 up to the present time. In
examining it it is necessary to bear in mind that not all of these
appearances were simultaneous, and consequently that the map does
not represent the condition of Mars at any given period; it is only a
sort of topographical register of the observations made of this phe-
nomenon at different times.!

The observation of the geminations is one of the greatest difficulty,
and can only be made by an eye well practiced in such work, added to
a telescope of accurate construction and of great power. This explains
why it is that it was not seen before 1882. In the ten years that have
transpired since that time, it has been seen and described at eight or
ten observatories. Nevertheless, some still deny that these phenomena
are real, and tax with illusion (or even imposture) those who declare
that they have observed it. ’

Their singular aspect, and their being drawn with absolute geomet-
rical precision, as if they were the work of rule or compass, has led
some to see in them the work of intelligent beings, inhabitants of the
planet. lam very careful not to combat this supposition, which includes
nothing impossible. (lo mi guarderd bene dal combattere questa sup-
posizione, la quale nulla include d’ impossibile.) But it will be noticed
that in any case the gemination can not be a work of permanent charae-
ter, it being certain that in a given instance it may change its appearance
and dimensions from one season to another. If we should assume such
a work, a certain variability would not be excluded from it; for exam-
ple, extensive agricultural labor and irrigation upon a large scale. Let
us add, further, that the intervention of intelligent beings might explain

SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 127%

the geometrical appearance of the gemination, but it is not at all neces-
sary for such a purpose. The geometry of nature is manifested in many
other facts from which are excluded the idea of any artificial labor
whatever. The perfect spheroids of the heavenly bodies and the ring
of Saturn were not constructed in a turning lathe, and not with com-
passes has Iris described within the clouds her beautiful and regular
arch. And what shall we say of the infinite variety of those exquisite
and regular polyhedrons in which the world of crystals is sorich? In
the organic world, also, is not that geometry most wonderful which
presides over the distribution of the foliage upon certain plants, which
orders the nearly symmetrical, star-like figures of the flowers of the
field, as well as of the animals of the sea, and which produces in the
shell such an exquisits conical spiral that excels the most beautiful
masterpieces of Gothic architecture? In all these objects the geomet-
rical form is the simple and necessary consequence of the principles
and Jaws which govern the physical and physiological world. That
these principles and these laws are but an indication of a higher intel-
ligent Power we may admit, but this has nothing to de with the present
argument.

Having regard, then, for the principle that in the explanation of
natural phenomena it is universally agreed to begin with the simplest
suppositions, the first hypotheses of the nature and cause of the gemina-
tions have for the most part put in operation only the laws of inorganic
nature. Thus, the gemination is supposed to be due either to the effects
of light in the atmosphere of Mars, or to optical illusions produced by
vapors in various manners, or to glacial phenomena of a perpetual winter,
to which it is known all the planets will be condemned, or to double
cracks in its surface, or to single cracks of which the images are doubled
by the effect of smoke issuing in long lines and blown laterally by the
wind. The examination of these ingenious suppositions leads us to
conclude that none of them seem to correspond entirely with the
observed facts, either in whole or in part. Some of these hypotheses
would not have been proposed had their authors been able to examine
the geminations with their own eyes. Since some of these may ask me
directly, Can you suggest anything better? I must reply candidly, No.

It would be far more easy if we were willing to introduce the forces
pertaining to organic nature. Here the field of plausibte supposition
is immense, being capable of making an infinite number of combina-
tions capable of satisfying the appearances even with the smallest and
simplest ineans. Changes of vegetation over a vast area, and the pro-
duction of animals, also very small, but in enormous multitudes, may
well be rendered visible at such a distance. An observer placed in the
moon would be able to see such an appearance at the times in whic:
agricultural operations are carried out upon one vast plain—the seed-
time and the gathering of the harvest. In such a manner also would
the flowers of the plants of the great steppes of Hurope and Asia be

rendered visible at the distance of Mars—by a variety of coloring. A
similar system of operations produced in that planet may thus certainly
be rendered visible tous. But how difficult for the Lunarians and the
Areans to be able to imagine the true causes of such changes of appear-
ance without having first at least some superficial knowledge of terres-
trial nature! So also for us, who know so little of the physical state
of Mars, and nothing of its organie world, the great liberty of possible
supposition renders arbitrary all explanations of this sort and consti-
tutes the gravest obstacle to the acquisition of well-founded notions.
All that we may hope is that with time the uncertainty of the problem
will gradually diminish, demonstrating if not what the geminations
are, at least what tiey can not be. We may also confide a little in
what Galileo called “the courtesy of nature,” thanks to which a ray
of light from an unexpected source will sometimes illuminate an inves-
tigation at first believed inaccessible to our speculations, and of which
we have a beautiful example in celestial chemistry. Let us therefore
hope and study.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY, ACCORDING TO MAXWELL
AND HERTZ)!

By M. PoIncAaR#.?

It was at the moment when the experiments of Fresnel were foreimg
the scientific world to admit that light consists of the vibrations of a
highly attenuated fluid filling interplanetary spaces that the researches
of Ampere were making known the laws of the mutual action of cur-
rents and were so enunciating the fundamental principles of electro-
dynamics.

It needed but one step to the supposition that that same fluid, the
ether, which is the medium of luminous phenomena, is at the same time
the vehicle of electrical action. In imagination Ampere made this
stride; but the illustrious physicist could not foresee that the seducing
hypothesis with which he was toying, a mere dream for him, was ere
long to take a precise form and become one of the vital concerns of
exact science.

A dream it remained for many years, till one day, after electrical
measurements had become extremely exact, some physicist, turning
over the numerical data, much as a resting pedestrian might idly turn
over a stone, brought to light an odd coincidence. It was that the
factor of transformation between the system of electro statical units
and the system of electro-dynamical units was equal to the velocity
of light. Soon the observations directed to this strange coincidence
became so exact that no sane head could longer hold it a mere ecoinci-
dence. No longer could it be doubted that some occult affinity existed
between optical and electrical phenomena. Perhaps, however, we
might be wondering to this day what this affinity could be were it not
for the genius of Clerk Maxwell.

130 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

DISPLACEMENT CURRENTS.

The reader is aware that solid bodies are divided into two classes,
conductors through which electricity can move in the form of a galvanic
current, and nonconduetors, or dielectrics. The electricians of former
days regarded dielectrics as quite inert, having no part to play but that
of obstinately refusing passage to electricity. Had that been so, any
one nonconductor might be replaced by any other without making any
difference in the phenomena; but Faraday found that that was not the
ease. Two condensers of the same form and dimensions put into con-
nection with the same source of electricity do not take the same charge,
though the thickness of the isolating plate be the same, unless the mat-
ter of that plate be chemically the same. Now Clerk Maxwell had too
deeply studied the researches of Faraday not to comprehend the import
ance of dielectrics and the imperative obligation to recognize their active
part.

Besides, if light is but an electric phenomenon, when it traverses a
thickness of glass electrical events must take place in that glass. And
what can be the nature of those events? Maxwell boldly answers,
they are, and must be, currents.

All the experience of his day seemed to contradict this. Never had
currents been observed except in conductors. How was Maxwell to
reconcile his audacious hypothesis with a fact so well established as
that? Why is it that under certain circumstances those supposed cur-
rents produce manifest effects, While under ordinary conditions they can
not be observed ag all.

The answer was that dielectrics resist the passage of electricity not
so much more than conductors do, but in a different manner. Maxwell’s
idea will best be understood by a comparison.

If we bend a spring, we meet a resistance which increases the more
the spring is bended. So, if we can only dispose of a finite force, a
moment will come when the motion will cease, equilibrium being
reached. Finally, when the force ceases the spring will in flying back
restore the whole of the energy which has been expended in bending it.

Suppose, on the other hand, that we wish to displace a body plunged
into water. Here again a resistance will be experienced, but it will not
go on increasing in proportion as the body advances, supposing it to be
maintained at a constant velocity. So long as the motive force acts,
equilibrium will never, then, be attained; nor when the force is removed
will the body in the least tend to return, nor can any portion of the
energy expended be restored. It will, in fact, have been converted into
heat by the viscosity of the water.

The contrast is plain; and we ought to distinguish elastic resistance
from viscous resistance. Using these terms, we may express Maxwell’s
idea by saying that <ielectrics offer an elastic resistance, conductors a

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 131

viscous resistance, to the movements of electricity. Hence, there are two
kinds of currents; currents of displacement which traverse dielectrics
and ordinary currents of conduction which circulate in conductors.

Currents of the first kind, having to overcome an elastic resistance
which continually increases, naturally can last but a very short time,
since a state of equilibrium will quickly be reached.

Currents of conduction, on the other hand, having only a viscous
resistance to overcome, must continue so long so there is any electro-
motive force.

Let us return to the simile used by M. Cornu in his notice in the
Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes for 1893. Suppose we have in a
reservoir water under pressure. Lead a tube plumb downward into the
reservoir. The water will rise in the tube, but the rise will stop when
hydrostatic equilibrium is attained—that is, when the downward pres-
sure of the water in the tube above the point of application of the first
pressure on the reservoir, and due to the weight of the water, balances
that first pressure. If the pipe is large, there will be no friction or
loss of head, and the water so raised can be used to do work. That
represents acurrent of displacement.

If, on the other hand, the water flows out of the reservoir by a hori-
zontal pipe, the motion will go on till the reservoir is emptied; but if
the tube is small and long there will be a great loss of energy and con-
siderable production of heat by friction. That represents a current of
conduction.

Though it would be vain, not to say idle, to attempt to represent all
details, it may be said that everything happens just as if the currents
of displacement were acting to bend a multitude of little springs.
When the currents cease, electrostatic equilibrium is established, and
the springs are bent the more, the more intense is the electric field.
The accumulated work of the springs—that is, the electrostatic energy—
can be entirely restored as soon as they can unbend, and so it is that
we obtain mechanical work when we leave the conductors to obey the
electrostatic attractions. Those attractions must be due to the pressure
exercised on the conductors by the bent springs. Finally, to pursue
the image to the death, the disruptive discharge may be compared to
the breaking of the springs when they are bent too much.

On the other hand, the energy employed to produce conduction cur-
rents is lost, being wholly converted into heat, like that spent in over-
coming the viscosity of fluids. Hence it is that the conducting wires
become heated.

From Maxwell’s point of view it seems that all currents are in closed
circuits. The older electricians did not so opine. They regarded the
current circulating in a wire joining the two poles of a pile as closed;
but if in place of directly uniting the two poles we place them in com-
munication with the two armatures of a condenser, the momentary
current which lasts while the condenser is getting charged was not
132 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

considered as a current round a closed circuit. It went, they thought,
from one armature through the wire, the battery, the other wire, to the
other armature, and there it stopped. Maxwell, on the contrary, sup-
posed that in the form of a current of displacement it passes through
the nonconducting plate of the condenser, and that precisely what
brings it to cessation is the opposite electromotive force set up by the
displacement of electricity in this dielectric.

Currents become sensible in three ways—by their heating effects, by
their actions on other currents and on magnets, and by the induced
currents to which they give rise. We have seen why currents of con-
duction develop heat and why currents of displacement do not. But
Maxwell’s hypothetical currents ought at any rate to produce electro-
magnetic and inductive effects. Why do these effects not appear?
The answer is, that it is because a current of displacement can not last
long enough. That is to say, they can not last long in one direction.
Consequently in a dielectric no current can long exist without alterna-
tion. But the effects ought to and will become observable if the current
is continually reversed at sufficiently short intervals.

THE NATURE OF LIGHT.

Such, according to Maxwell, is the origin of light. A luminiferous
Wave is a series of alternating currents produced in dielectrics, in air,
or even in the interplanetary void, and reversed in direction a million
of millions of times per second. The enormous induction due to these
frequent alternations sets up other currents in the neighboring parts
of the dielectric, and so the waves are propagated.

Calewation shows that the velocity of propagation would be equal
to the ratio of the units, which we know is the velocity of light.

Those alternative currents are a sort of electrical oscillation, Are
they longitudinal, like those of sound, or are they transversal, like those
of Fresnel’s ether? In the case of sound the air undergoes alterna-
tive condensations and rarefactions. The ether of Fresnel, on the other
hand, behaves as if it were composed of incompressible layers capable
only of slipping over one another. Were these currents in open paths,
the electricity carried from one end to the other would become accu-
mulated at one extremity. It would thus be condensed and rarefied
like air, and its vibrations would be longitudinal. But Maxwell only
admits currents in closed circuits; accumulation is impossible, aud
electricity behaves like the incompressible ether of Fresnel, with its
transversal vibrations.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION.

We thus obtain all the results of the theory of waves. Yet this
was not enough to decide the physicists to adopt the ideas of Max-
well. It was a seductive hypothesis; but physicists consider hypothe-
ses which lead to no distinct observational consequences as beyond

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 133

the borders of their province. That province, so defined, no experi-
mental confirmation of Maxwell’s theory invaded for twenty-five years.

What was wanted was some issue between the two theories not too
delicate for our coarse methods of observation to decide. There was
but one line of research along which any experimentum crucis was to
be met with.

The old electro-dynamics makes electro-magnetic induction take
place instantaneously; but according to Maxwell’s doctrine it propa-
gates itself with the velocity of light.

The point was then to measure, or at least to make certain, a velocity
of propagation of inductive effects. This is what the illustrious Ger-
man physicist Hertz has done by the method of interferences.

The method is well known in its application to optical phenomena.
Two luminous rays from one identical center interfere when they reach
the same point after pursuing paths of different lengths. If the differ-
ence is one, two, or any whole number of wave lengths, the two lights
reenforce one another so that if their intensities are equal, that of their
combination is four times as great. But if the difference is an odd
number of half wave lengths, the two lights extinguish one another.

Luminiferous waves are not peculiar in showing this phenomenon; it
belongs to every periodic change which is propagated with definite
velocity. Sound interferes just as light does, and so must electro-
dynamic induction if it is strictly periodic and has a definite velocity
of propagation. But if the propagation is instantaneous there can be
no interference, since in that ease there is no finite wave length.

The phenomenon, however, could not be observed were the wave
length greater than the distance within which induction is sensible.
It is therefore requisite to make the period of alternation as short as
possible.

ELECTRICAL EXCITERS.

We can obtain such currents by means of an apparatus which con-
stitutes a veritable electrical pendulum. Let two conductors be united
by a wire. If they have not the same electric potential the electrical
equilibrium is disturbed and tends to restore itself, just as the molar
equilibrium is disturbed when a pendulum is carried away from the
position of repose.

A current is set up in the wire, tending to equalize the potential, just
as the pendulum begins to move so as to be carried back to the position
of repose. But the pendulum does not stop when it reachés that posi-
tion. Its inertia carries it farther. Nor, when the two electrical con-
ductors reach the same potential, does the current in the wire cease.
The equilibrium instantaneously existing is at. once destroyed by a
‘ause analogous to inertia, namely self-induction. We know that when
a current is interrupted it gives rise in parallel wires to an induced ecur-
rent in the same direction. The same effect is produced in the circuit
134 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

itself, if that is not broken. In other words, a current will persist after
the cessation of its causes, just aS a moving body does not stop the
instant it is no longer driven forward.

When, then, the two potentials become equal, the current will go on
and give the two conductors relative charges opposite to those they had
at first. In this case, as in that of the pendulum, the position of equi-
librium is passed, and a return motion is inevitable. Equilibrium,
again instantaneously attained, is at once again broken for the same
reason; and so the oscillations pursue one another unceasingly.

Calculation shows that the period depends on the capacity of the con-
ductors in such a way thatitis only necessary to diminish that capacity
sufficiently (which is easily done) to have an electric pendulum capable
of producing an alternating current of extremely short period.

All that was well enough known by the theoretical researches of
Lord Kelvin and by the experimentation of Federsen on the oscillatory
discharge of the Leyden jar. It was not that which constituted the
originality of Hertz.

Fic. 1.—The Hertz exciter.

But it is not enough to construct a pendulum; it is further requisite
to set it into oscillation. For that, it is necessary to carry it off from
equilibrium and to let it go suddenly, that is to say, to release it in a
time short as compared to the period of its oscillation.

For if, having pulled a pendulum to one side by a string, we were to
let go of the string more slowly than the pendulum would have
descended of itself, it would reach the vertical without momentum, and
no oscillation would be set up.

In like manner. with an electric pendulum whose natural period is,
say, a@ hundred-millionth of a second, no mechanical mode of release
would answer the purpose at all, sudden as it might seem to us with
our more than sluggish conceptions of promptitude. How, then, did
Hertz solve the problem? °

To return to our electric pendulum, a gap of a few millimeters is
made in the wire which joins the two conductors. This gap divides our
apparatus into two symmetrical parts, which are connected to the two
poles of a Ruhmkorff coil. The induced current begins to charge the
two conductors, and the difference of their potential increases with
relative slowness.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 135

At first the gap prevents a discharge from the conductors; the air in
it plays the role of insulator and maintains our pendnlum in a position
diverted from that of equilibrium.

But when the difference of potential becomes great enough, a spark
will jump across. If the self-induction is great enough and the capacity
and resistance small enough, there will be an oscillatory discharge
whose period can be brought down to a hundred-millionth of a second.
The oscillatory discharge would not, it is true, last long by itself; but
it is kept up by the Ruhmkorff coil, whose current is itself oscillatory
with a period of about a hundred-thousandth ef a second, and thus
the pendulum gets a new impulse as often as that.

The instrument just described is called a resonance exciter. It pro-
duces oscillations which are reversed from a hundred million to a thou-
sand million times per second. Thanks to this extreme frequency, they
can produce inductive effects at great distances. To make these effects
sensible another electric pendulum is used, called a resonator. In this
the coil is suppressed. It consists simply of two little metallic spheres
very near to one another, with a long wire connecting them in a round-
about way.

The induction due to the exciter will set the resonator in vibration
the more intensely the more nearly the natural periods of vibration are
the same. At certain phases of the vibration the difference of poten-
tial of the two spheres will be just great enough to cause the sparks to
leap across.

PRODUCTION OF THE INTERFERENCES.

- Thus we have an instrument which reveals the inductive waves which
radiate from the exciter. We can study them in two ways. We may
either expose the resonator to the direct induction of the exciter at a
great distance, or else make this induction act at a small distance on a
long conducting wire which the electric wave will follow and which in
its turn will act at a small distance on the resonator.

Whether the wave is propagated along a wire or across the air, inter-
ferences can be produced by retlection. In the first case it will be
reflected at the extremity of the wire, which it will again pass through
in the opposite direction. In the second case it can be reflected on a
metallic leaf which will act as a mirror. In either case the reflected
ray will interfere with the direct ray, and positions will be found in
which the spark of the resonator will be extinguished.

Experiments with a long wire are the easier and furnish much valu-
abie information, but they can not furnish an experimentum crucis,
since in the old theory, as in the new, the velocity of the electric wave
in a wire should be equal to that of light. But experiments on direct
induction at great distances are decisive. They not only show that
the velocity of propagation of induction across air is finite, but also
that it is equal to the velocity of the wave propagated along a wire,
conformably to the ideas of Maxwell.
136 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

SYNTHESIS OF LIGHT.

{ shall insist less on other experiments of Hertz, more. brilliant but
lessinstructive. Concentrating with a parabolic mirror the wave of in-
duction that emanates from the exciter, the German physicist obtained
a true pencil of rays of electric force, susceptible of regular reflection
and refraction. These rays, were the period but one-millionth of what
it is, would not differ from rays of light. We know that the sun sends
us several varieties of radiations, some luminiferous, since they act on
the retina, others dark, infra-red, or ultra-violet, which reveal themselves
in chemical and ealoritic effects. The first owe the qualities which ren-
der them sensible to us to a physiological chance. For the physicist,
the infra-red differs from red only as red differs from green; it simply
has a greater wave length. That of the Hertzian radiations is far greater
still, but they are mere differences of degree, and if the ideas of Clerk
Maxwell are true, the illustrious professor of Bonn has effected a
genuine synthesis of light.

CONCLUSION.

Nevertheless, our admiration for such unhoped-for suecesses must
not let us forget what remains to be accomplished. Let us endeavor to
take exact account of the results definitely acquired,

In the first place, the velocity of direct induction through air is finite;
for otherwise interferences could not exist. Thus the old electrody-
namics is condemned, But what is to be set up in its place? Is it to
be the doctrine of Maxwell, or rather some approximation to that, for
it would be too much to suppose that he had foreseen the truth in all
its details? Though the probabilities are accumulating, no complete
demonstration of that doctrine has ever attained.

Wecan measure the wave length of the Hertzian oscillations. That
length is the product of the period into the velocity of propagation.
We should know the velocity if we knew the period; but this last is so
minute that we can not measure it; we can only calculate it by a for-
mula due to Lord Kelvin. That calculation leads to figures agreeable
to the theory of Maxwell; but the last doubts will only be dissipated
when the velocity of propagation has been directly measured. (See
Note I.)

But this is not all. Matters are far from being as simple as this
brief account of the matter would lead one to think. There are vari-
ous complications.

In the first place, there is around the exciter a true radiation of
induction. The energy of the apparatus radiates abroad, and if no
source feeds it, it quickly dissipates itself and the oscillations are rap-
idly extinguished. Hence arises the phenomenon of multiple reso-
nance, discovered by Messrs. Sarasin and De la Rive. which at first
seemed irreconcilable with the theory.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 137

On the other hand, we know that light does not exactly follow the
laws of geometrical optics, and the discrepancy, due to diffraction,
increases proportionately to the wave length. With the great waves
of the Hertzian undulations these phenomena must assume enormous
importance and derange everything. It is doubtless fortunate, for the
moment at least, that our means of observation are as coarse as they
are, for otherwise the simplicity which struck us would give place
to a dedalian complexity in which we should lose our way. No doubt,
a good many perplexing anomalies have been due to this. For the
same reason the experiments to prove a refraction of the electrical
waves can hardly be considered as demonstrative.

It remains to speak of a difficulty still more grave, though doubtless
not insurmountable. According to Maxwell, the coefficient of eleetro-
static induction of a transparent body ought to be equal to the square
of its index of refraction. Now this is not so.!. The few bodies which
follow Maxwell’s law are exceptions. The phenomena are plainly far
more complex than was at first thought. But we have not yet been
able to make out how matters stand, and the experiments conflict with
one another.

Much, then, remains to be done. The identity of light with a vibra-
tory motion in electricity is henceforth something more than a seductive
hypothesis; it is a probable truth. But it is not yet quite proved.

Nore |I.—Since the above was written another great step has been
taken. M. Blondlot has virtually sueceeded, by ingenious experimental
contrivances, in directly measuring the velocity of a disturbance along
awire. The number found differs little from the ratio of the units;
that is, from the velocity of light, which is 500,000 kilometers per see-
ond. Since the interference experiments made at Geneva by Messrs.
Sarasin and De la Rive have shown, as I said above, that induction is
propagated in air with the same velocity as an electric disturbance
which follows a conducting wire, we must conclude that the velocity of
the induction is the same as that of light, which is a confirmation of
the ideas of Maxwell.

M. Fizeau had formerly found for the velocity of electricity a number —
far smaller, about 180,000 kilometers. But there is no contradiction.
The currents used by M. Fizeau, though intermittent, were of small
frequency and penetrated to the axis of the wire, while the currents of
M. Blondlot, oscillatory and of very short period, remained superficial
and were confined to a layer of less than a hundredth of a millimeter
in thickness. One may readily suppose the laws of propagation are not
the same in the two cases.

Note II.—I have endeavored above to render the explanation of the
electrostatic attractions and of the phenomena of induction comprehen-
sible by means of a simile. Now let us see what Maxwell’s idea is of
the cause which produces the mutual attractions of currents.

'That is, it is not so when we make the calculation with the indexes of refraction
of the waves of visible light.—Translator.
138 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

While the electrostatic attractions are taken to be due to a multitude
of little springs—that is to say, to the elasticity of the ether—it is sup-
posed to be the living force and inertia of the same fluid which produce
the phenomena of induction and electrodynamical effects.

The complete calculation is far too extended for these pages, and I
shall again content myself with a simile. I shall borrow it from a well-
known instrument—the centrifugal governor.

The living force of this apparatus is proportional to the square of the
angular velocity and to the square of the distance of the balls.

According to the hypothesis of Maxwell, the ether is in motion in
galvanic currents, and its living force is proportional to the square of
the intensity of the current, which thus correspond, in the parallel I
am endeavoring to establish, to the angular velocity of rotation.

If we consider two currents in the same direction, the living force,
with equal intensity, will be greater the nearer the currents are to one
another. Ifthe currents have opposite directions, the living force will
be greater the farther they are apart.

In order to increase the angular velocity of the regulator and con-
sequently its living force, it is necessary to supply it with energy and
consequently to overcome a resistance which we call its inertia,

In the same way, in order to increase the intensity of a current, we
must augment the living force of the ether, and it will be necessary to
supply it with energy and to overcome a resistance which is nothing
but the inertia of the ether and which we eall the induction.

The living force will be greater if the currents are in the same diree-
tion and near together. The energy to be furnished the counter electro-
motive force of induction will be greater. This is what we express when
we say that the mutual action of two currents is to be added to their
self-induction. The contrary is the case when their directions are
opposite.

If we separate the balls of the regulator, it will be necessary, in
order to maintain the angular velocity, to furnish energy, because with
equal angular velocity the living force is greater the more the balls are
separated.

In the same way, if two currents have the same direction. and
brought toward one another, if will be necessary, in order to maintain
the intensity to supply energy, because the living force will be aug-
mented. We shall, therefore, have to overcome an electromotive force
of induction which will tend to diminish the intensity of the currents.
It would tend on the contrary to augment it, if the currents had the
same direction and were carried apart, or if they had opposite direc-
tions and were brought together.

Finally, the centrifugal force tends to increase the distance between
the balls which would augment the living force were the angular veloc-
ity to be maintained.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 139

In like manner, when the currents have the same direction, they
attract each other—that is to say, they tend to approach each other,
which would increase the living force if the intensity were maintained.
If their directions are opposed they repel one another and tend to
separate, which would again tend to increase the living force were the
intensity kept constant.

Thus, the electrostatic effects would be due to the elasticity of the
ether and the electrodynamical phenomena to the living force. Now,
ought this elasticity itself to be explained, as Lord Kelvin thinks, by
rotations of small parts of the fluid? Different reasons may render
this hypothesis attractive; but it plays no essential part in the theory
of Maxwell, which is quite independent of it.

In the same wey, I have made comparisons with divers mechanisms.
But they are only similes, and pretty rough ones. A complete mechan-
ical explanation of electrical phenomena is not to be sought in the
volumes of Maxwell, but only a statement of the conditions which any
such explanation has to satisfy. Precisely what will confer long life
on the work of Maxwell is its being unentangled with any special
mechanical hypothesis.
THE HENRY!
By T. C. MENDENHALL.

On the 2ist of August, 1893, there assembled in Chicago an Interna-
tional Congress of Electricians, the transactions of which, while largely
technical and scientific in their character, were in all respects impor-
tant, and in some respects of great interest to the intelligent American
public.

The organization of the congress and preparations for holding it in
connection with the World’s Columbian Exposition were well under way
before the conception, or at least the publication, of the scheme for
a series of so-called ‘*  World’s Congresses,” the proceedings of which
were brought prominently to the attention of the reading public during
the past summer. The American Institute of Klectrical Engineers was
probably the first body to take action in reference to an Electrical Con-
gress. Cordial cooperation existed between it and the Exposition
authorities, and a large and representative advisory committee, embrac-
ing nearly all of the leading American electricians, together with many
of the first rank from foreign countries, was organized, with Dr. Elisha
Gray, of Chicago, as chairman.

It is not inteuded, in this article, to give an account of the congress
and its doings, but to refer to its organization and personnel only so
far as is necessary to throw light upon the full intent and meaning of a
single sentence in its proceedings.

The number of representatives of foreign governments present was
unexpectedly large, and the delegates were of the highest character.
To one who has some familiarity with the literature of electricity it will
suffice to mention the names of Von Helmholtz, Mascart, Preece, Row-
land, Silvanus Thompson, Ferraris, Ayrton, and Hospitalier, among
the many who took part in the deliberations of the congress. The
honorary president was Dr. H. von Helmholtz, whose splendid contri-
butions to science cover so wide a field that he would have been easily
first in congresses devoted to the consideration of several departments
of human knowledge quite distinct and apart from that of electricity.

In its internal constitution the congress differed in some particulars
from all others held in Chicago, and a part of its work had more of an

142 THE HENRY.

official and international character than that of any other. This was
the consideration and official sanction of hames and values of units of
electrical measure.

Notwithstanding the fact that more than a hundred million dollars
are Invested in machines and instruments for the production and con-
sumption of electricity and in their manufacture, little legislation has
been had looking to the protection of producer and consumer through
accurate measurement, as has long been recognized to be imperatively
necessary in other commercial transactions. It is true that the science
of electrical measurement has been thoroughly explored; excellent
methods and instruments have been devised and constructed, and the
most perfect system of units of measure ever conceived has been devel-
oped during the past quarter of a century. These units, being contin-
ually in use among scientific men, had come to be recognized as in some
degree authoritative among those engaged in commercial applications
of electricity, but in general no legal values were attached to these
units, and in reference to two or three of them scientific men were not
yet in entire accord in their nomenclature and definition. One or two
electrical congresses, notably that at Paris in 1881, had previously con-
sidered these questions, and a tentative agreement upon some of the
points at issue had been reached, but not much was accomplished that
was Satisfactory and lasting, except that an incentive was created for
further and more accurate investigation of the values of certain physical
constants in doubt. The results of these investigations and the general
progress of the science of electricity during the past decade were such
as to justify the belief that the time had now arrived when an interna-
tional agreement could be reached upon definitive values of the units
desirable and necessary in electrical measurement, as well as upon the
names they should bear. To this end it was desirable that the consid-
eration of such important questions should be restricted to a smaller,
more deliberative body than the general congress of electricians, the
membership of which reached several hundred. It was therefore agreed
to create what was technically known as the chamber of delegates,
which, as its name implies, consisted of specially commissioned dele-
gates from the several countries represented.

In this chamber the United States, Great Britain, France, and Ger-
many were allowed five delegates each. Some other nations were
allowed three, others two, and some only one.

The members bore commissions from their respective Governments,
and twenty-six were actually in attendance, representing nine different
nations. The four great nations named above had full delegations,
some others were only partly represented, and two or three nations had
appointed delegates who failed to reach Chicago in time for the meet-
ing of the congress. The chamber met in regular session every day
during the week of the International Congress, with Professor Row-
land, of Johns Hopkins University, as its presiding officer. At the end

.

. THE HENRY. 143

it had unanimously agreed upon names and definitions for eight units
of electrical measure, all that are thought to be necessary or desirable
at the present time, and no more are likely to receive consideration for
some years to come. The chamber passed a resolution recommending
the official and authoritative adoption of these units by the several
nations represented in the congress. They are all primarily derived
from the fundamental units of length, mass, and time of the metric
systein, and are thus inter-related in the simplest possible manner.

As already stated, it is not the purpose of this article to discuss the
conclusions reached by the chamber of delegates from a scientific stand-
point, but it will be desirable to name the units selected, and explain
in a general way their technical significance. In the order of their
adoption by the chamber they are as follows: The ohm, the ampere, the
volt, the coulomb, the farad, the joule, the watt, the henry.

These names are derived from those of distinguished scientific men,
all worthy of a place in the front rank of modern physicists, and many
of whom have made signal contributions to the advancement of the
science of electricity and electrical measurement.

The ohm is the unit of resistance. It has been applied by common
consent for many years to one of the three most important characteris-
ties of a circuit conveying a current of electricity. Its use perpetuates
the fame of the author of a simple and beautiful law by which these
three fundamental elements are bound together.

G.S. Ohm was born in Bavaria in 1781, and educated at the Univer-
sity of Erlangen. In 1827 he published a pamphlet, The Galvanic
Circuit Investigated Mathematically, containing what has since been
universally known as “Ohm’s law,” and which has had a most impor-
tant and far-reaching influence on the development of the theory and
applications of electricity. Guided by Fourier’s classic investigation
of the flow of heat in conductors, Ohm, from purely theoretical consid-
erations, arrived at the conclusion that in any circuit through which
an electric current was made to pass the strength of the current—that
is, the quantity of electricity passing a given section of a conductor in
one second of time—was directly proportional to the electro-motive
force (often called the ‘electrical pressure”), and inversely proportional
to its resistance. The importance of Ohim’s investigations was not
recognized at the time of their publication. Had the full meaning of his
conclusions been understood by those who shortly afterwards engaged
in the development of the electro-magnetic telegraph, they would have
been guided to results which were reached only after much loss of time
and money and many vexatious and discouraging disappointments.
In 1825 Barlow, in England, had declared the impossibility of the
telegraph, owing to the difficulty of sending electric currents through
long wires. It was noted that the strength of the current diminished
greatly when the length of the conductor was increased, and this was
properly assumed to be due to the greater resistance offered to the
144 THE HENRY. ,

passage of the current by the increased length. ‘ Barlow suggested
that this could be overcome only by enlarging the dimensions of the
conductor, and that when a current was transmitted through any con-
siderable distance the diameter of the wire must be enormous. For this
reason the electro-magnetic telegraph was an impracticable scheme.
This apparently conclusive argument undoubtedly seriously delayed
the progress of invention along that line.

But, curiously enough, about the time Ohm in Europe was publish-
ing a theoretical investigation which might have furnished the key to
the solution of the problem, in America a young man, not yet 50 years
of age, named Joseph Henry, had begun a series of experimental
researches at Albany, N. Y., which did make the way entirely clear a
few years later. Henry attacked the difficulty both as to cause and
effect. The effect was that when the conductor through which- the
current was passing was increased greatly in length, the strength of
the current was so reduced that it was insuflicient to operate the appa-
ratus necessary for the reproduction of the signal at the receiving end.
To meet this difficulty he investigated electro-magnets, and so improved
upon the original device of Sturgeon that comparatively feeble cur-
rents were capable of producing mechanical effects through long wires.
He also originated the ingenious device known as a “relay,” by means
of which a local battery is put in operation by a main current of little
strength, thus making local effects independent of the strength of the
main-line currents. By his invention of the “intensity magnet” and
use of the “intensity battery” he made the electro-magnetic telegraph
possible, and in 1831 he transmitted signals through a mile of wire,
causing a bell to ring by the action of an electro-magnet. Out of this
has grown the astounding network of wires—overhead, underground,
and across the seas—by which the earth is girdled and the existence
of which has wrought more change in the treatment of social, political,
and commercial problems than any other single fact of the present
century. While many of the conclusions which Henry had experi-
mentally reached were in harmony with and might have been deduced
from Ohm’s law, to Ohm belongs the credit of having first clearly
pointed out the real and exact meaning of “resistance” and its relation
to the other conditions of the circuit. The bestowal of his name upon
the unit by which it is measured is a fitting recognition of the lasting
value of his discovery.

The ampere is the unit of current. André Marie Ampere, born at
Lyons, France, in 1775, must be regarded as the creator of the science
of electro-dynamics. In 1820 Oersted, the Dane, published his mag-
nificent discovery of the effect of an electric current upon a freely sus-
pended magnet, thus establishing the relation between magnetism and
electricity which many of the ablest philosophers had sought in vain
for years. Ampere first heard of what was called the ‘Copenhagen
experiment” on September 11, 1820. On the 18th of the same month

THE HENRY. 145

he presented to the French Academy a paper in which he announced
the fundamental principle of the science of electro-dynamics, together
with a number of capital experiments in extension of Oersted’s princi-
ple. In the incredibly short time of a single week he had gone all over
Oersted’s work, experimentally and theoretically; he had devised a
new and ingenious hypothesis, for the examination of which he had
invented novel forms of apparatus and by means of which he had
brought the whole subject within the domain of mathematical treat-
ment. The history of the science of electricity shows nothing more
brilliant than the work of that memorable week. To him who was first
to show the action and reaction of currents upon each other, and at
the same time furnish a rational and most useful hypothesis upon which
the now rapidly growing theory of electro-magnetism might be con-
structed, has long been freely accorded the high praise which is implied
in calling the unit of current measure an ampere.

The beautifully simple law of Ohm, to which reference has already
been made, and which is as omnipresent and omnipotent in electricity
as is Newton’s law of gravitation in astronomy and mechanics, is
administered by and through a triumvirate. Twoof the triad, namely,
resistance and. current, are presented above. The third, which is
mathematically the product of these two, is the electro-motive force
in the circuit, and its unit of measure is the volt. The appropriateness
of this name will be at once recognized when the services of the dis-
tinguished Italian philosopher, Volta, the contemporary of Galvani,
are remembered. In his early youth Volta was considered dull, and
he showed little promise. of future distinction. His first awakening
to intellectual activity manifested itself in a tendency to compose
poetry, but from this he turned to experimental science; and when
Galvani, in 1786, saw in the twitchings of the legs of a frog the begin-
ning of a series of marvelous discoveries which have made the nine-
teenth century greater than any that have gone before, Volta was in
the prime of life, thoroughly equipped by taste and experience to take
up the subject at a point where his countryman seemed likely to leave
it, and so enlarge and enrich it as almost to make it entirely his own.

Differing from Galvani as to the cause of what was long called
“oalvanism,” he originated what is known as the “contact theory,”
and was the first to have clear ideas of what is now termed “ electro-
motive force.” His theory led him to the construction of the voltaic
pile or battery, which has been of incalculable value in the develop-
ment of the science of electricity and its applications. It happens
that the unit of measure, one volt, is very nearly the electro motive
force of one cell of Volta’s battery, being a little less than that of an
ordinary sulphate of copper (‘‘bluestone”) cell.

These, the ohm, the ampere, and the volt, are the three fundamental
units of electrical measurement. They are related to one another
through Ohm’s law, and, as other units are largely derived from them

10

SM 94
146 THE HENRY.

it will be useful to illustrate this relation before proceeding further. For
this purpose perhaps nothing is better than the well-known and oft-
repeated comparison of the flow of a current of electricity in a conductor
to the flow of a stream of water through a pipe. When water flows
from a reservoir through a pipe the quantity which passes any point in
the pipe in onesecond (current strength) depends on the height of the res-
ervoir above the outlet—that is, on the ‘‘head” or pressure under which
it flows—and also on the resistance which the pipe offers to ifs motion.
The greater the pressure the greater the flow, and the greater the
resistance the less the flow. The strength of the current is therefore
directly proportional to the pressure, and inversely proportional to the
resistance. If in this statement ‘‘electro-motive” force be substituted
for “pressure,” it becomes Ohm’s law. When these elements are
measured in the units given above, the electro-motive force in volts,
the resistance in ohms, and the current in amperes, the law is expressed
very simply by saying that the “current is equal to the electro-motive
force divided by the resistance.”

Thus, if the electro-motive force be 1 volt and the resistance of the
circuit be 1 ohm the current will be 1 ampere. In an ordinary inean-
descent electric lamp the electro-motive force may be about 110 volts,
the resistance of the carbon filament when hot about 175 ohms, and the
current must therefore be about six-tenths of an ampere.

The unit of quantity is the coulomb. Charles Augustus Coulomb
was a French engineer who made important contributions to science
during the latter half of the last century. His character is well shown
by the fact that he submitted to imprisonment rather than make a
favorable report upon a proposed system of canals which he examined
as a royal commissioner and which he could not approve. His ingen-
ious invention, the torsion balance, enabled him to measure exceedingly
small forces with an accuracy hitherto unknown in science; and by its
use he made many brilliant researches in electricity, the first in which
exact measurement played an important part. A coulomb is the quan-
tity of electricity transferred by a current-of 1 ampere in one second.

The unit of capacity is the farad. The name of Faraday might with
propriety have attached to more than one unit of electrical measure.
His remarkable career—as a newsboy, a bookbinder’s apprentice, an
intensely interested listener to the lectures of Sir Humphry Davy,
Davy’s helper, later his assistant, and finally his successor at the head
of the Royal Institution in London—is so generally known that refer-
ence to it is hardly necessary. In the history of electricity three
splendid discoveries stand incomparably above all others. With the
first the names of Galvani and Volta are associated in the discovery
of the new electricity and the means of generating it. In the second,
Oersted and Ampere united in laying the foundation of the science of
electro-magnetism. The third was the discovery of ‘ induction,” in
which Faraday and Joseph Henry made possible the marvelous develop-
ment of the last two decades.

THE HENRY. 147

But every branch of the subject was enriched by Faraday, and
among his most brilliant investigations are those relating to the
“capacity of condensers,” and especially the influence of the dielectric.

If an insulated, conductor is charged with electricity, the quantity
which exists upon it will depend on the potential and the capacity of
the conductor. It is exactly as if one spoke of the quantity of water
in a lake or pond as depending on the depth (pressure, or ‘ poten-
tial”) and the area of the bottom (capacity). If two conductors are
near each other, but separated by a comparatively thin layer of air,
glass, shellac, or other dielectric, the “ capacity” of the combination is
much greater than that of either of the conductors, and it is known as
a “condenser.” The well-known Leyden jar is a common type. In
speaking of the “potential” to which a condenser is charged, the word
is used very much in the same sense as “electro-motive force” in what
has gone before. Potential, therefore, may be, and constantly is,
expressed in volts. The unit of capacity, the farad, is the capacity of
a condenser which is charged to a potential of 1 volt by 1 coulomb of
electricity.

To continue the analogy already used, the unit of capacity (area of
bottom) for vessels holding water might be defined as that which would
require unit depth to hold unit quantity.

The joule is the unit of work. The name of James Prescott Joule
will forever be associated with the most splendid generalization of the
present age, namely, the principle of the conservation of energy.
Through his interest in electro-magnetism, and especially by his inves-
tigation of the efficiency of electric motors, he was led to the consider-
ation of the correlation of the various forces of nature, and associated
with Prof. William Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, he executed a remark-
able series of experiments affording cumulative proof of the indestrue-
tibility of energy. With great apprepriateness his name has been
given to the unit of work. It is related directly and simply to the
“erg,” which is the unit of work of the centimeter-gram-second sys-
tem. Reference has already been made to the fact that when a current
of electricity is passed through a conductor heat is generated, the
ainount depending on the resistance of the conductor and the strength
of the current. This heat is the equivalent of the energy electrically
expended. The joule is the energy expended in one second by a cur-
rent of 1 ampere passing through a resistance of 1 ohm. In the com-
mon incandescent or glow lamp the energy expended as heat in the
carbon filament is about 63 joules in every second.

In addition to the unit of work, 1t 1s also extremely desirable to have
a unit of rate of work, or, as it has been called by many writers,
“activity,” but whichis more commonly expressed by the word “ power.”
It is only natural that the name of one who was the first to recognize
the necessity for a quantitative evaluation of the rate at which energ
was absorbed, and to give numerical expression to it in the definition
148 THE HENRY.

of the horsepower, should be given to the new unit. The watt is also
simply related to the centimeter-gram-second unit of power, and is
defined as work done at the rate of 1 joule per second. The rate of
expenditure of energy in the glow lamp already quoted would be 63
watts. One horsepower is equal toabout 746 watts. When Watt came
to Glasgow he was prevented from securing work as a mathematical-
instrument maker by the action of the trades unions of that time. For-
tunately, the door of the great university was opened to him, and there, |
in the capacity of maker and repairer of instruments and apparatus, his
genius received its first encouragement and development. Although
by education and training rather a practical than a scientific man, he
possessed the true scientific insight to an unusual degree, and is emi-
nently worthy of the associates among whom he is here placed.

The foregoing somewhat lengthy and detailed account of the history
and origin of seven of the eight units of electrical measure recently
adopted by the international congress has been thought desirable, if
not necessary, to a full understanding of their relation, historically and
otherwise, to the eighth and last, the name of which is the title of this
article.

Most Americans are more or less familiar with the name and fame of
Joseph Henry. To many he is known, however, only as the first Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. Giving a broad and liberal inter-
pretation to the somewhat vague language of the will of its founder,
Henry molded the institution, while it was yet plastic and without
traditions, into the form in which it has since essentially existed. He
directed its energies into channels very different trom those that would
have been selected by one whose horizon was narrower than his, and,
by steadfastly adhering to his own splendid conception of its functions
as an instrument “for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men,” he made of it an organization which is, and must perpetually be, a
benefit and a blessing to allmankind. Others, a smaller number, think
of him as the youthftl professor of mathematics and natural philos-
ophy in the Albany Academy, where, in spite of the seven solid hours
of teaching each day required of him, he found time to begin the series
of researches in electro-magnetism which in later years were to make
him famous. Here, and at the College of New Jersey, at Princeton, to
which he was shortly transferred, he is seen pursuing these researches
with that clearness of* vision which characterized his work along all
lines, and with an extraordinary fruitfulness which goes only with great
intellectual activity accompanied by unflinching honesty of purpose.
For fourteen years at Princeton, where he discharged the duties of
professor of natural philosophy with signal success, he continued his
original investigations, which, while touching many of the more impor-
tant branches of physical science, were in general related to his favorite
subjects, electricity and magnetism. At the end of this period, when
at the very highest development of his powers, he was transferred to

THE HENRY. 149

that larger field of activity and usefulness whieh was offered by the
new institution at Washington, to enter which he knowingly, and
against the wishes of many of his friends, abandoned the practicaily
assured prospect of lasting fame as one of the three or four most dis-
tinguished physicists of the present century. During these years the
work was done which justifies and demands the recognition accorded
to it in bestowing upon Henry the high honor of a place in the galaxy
of famous physicists whose names will be perpetuated in the metro-
logical nomenclature of all modern languages. In much of this work
he was running on lines parallel to those followed by an English phi-
losopher who is doubtless justly entitled to be considered as the first
experimental physicist of the present age.

Although older by several years than Henry, Faraday began his series
of memorable investigations in electricity about the time Henry pre-
sented his first papers on the same subject before the Albany Institute,
a local scientific society of which he was a member. From this time
forward they were often “treading upon each other’s heels.” In the
early thirties great scientific discoveries were not announced in all parts
of the world within twenty-four hours of their making, as is done to-day,
thanks to the labor of these same two philosophers who sixty years ago,
owing to infrequent communication across the sea and scanty means of
publication on either side, were often ignorant of an important advance
for some years after it had been made. Henry’s innate modesty made
him slow to recognize, at least: to acknowledge, the value of what he did,
and there is no doubt that he lost much in the way of general recogni-
tion by his failure to bring the results of his investigations promptly
to the attention of the scientific public. Indeed, it was sometimes the
urgency of his friends, more jealous than himself of his scientifie repu-
tation, that secured the tardy publication of important papers. At that
date, far removed both in space and time from the center of scientific
activity, he often contended with the discouraging yet natural and
almost necessary fact that some of his finest work had been anticipated
by those who had the start of him in time and the advantage in facilities
and resources.

On August 30, 1851, Faraday made his splendid discovery of electro-
magnetic induction. Before this time Henry had investigated the con-
ditions necessary to the production of a strong magnetic field, and had
constructed by far the most powerful magnet known up to that day.
Ignorant of Faraday’s work, he planned and began in August, 1851,
a series of experiments with a still more powerful magnet, having in
view the discovery of a method of producing electricity from magnetism
which Faraday was then on the eve of making. But, as already stated,
his duties in the academy were exacting, and, being interrupted, he
was prevented from returning to the subject for nearly a year. In the
meantime news of Faraday’s discovery had crossed the ocean, a meager
account of his results having reached Henry sometime early in the
150 THE HENRY.

@2279)

summer of 1832. He at once took up the subject, and by the aid of his
powerful apparatus was enabled to produce striking verifications and
extensions of Faraday’s conclusions. A description of these experi-
ments was published in Silliman’s American Journal of Science for
July, 1832, and the article contains the first announcement of a most
important discovery, in which he anticipated Faraday by several years.
‘Ik Marvel” wrote a sentence in Dream Life, which has been an
inspiration to many a young man, “ There is no genius in life like the
eenius of energy and industry ;” and if the genius is to develop in the
direction of experimental science he might well have added, “ and the
genius of attention to apparently unimportant, accidental phenomena.”
It was this trait that was so highly developed in his character, this
anxious solicitude that nothing, however trivial it might at the time
seem, should escape without note, that brought to Henry the honor of
the discovery of self-induction.

Faraday had found that when a current of electricity through one cir-
cuit was started, or stopped, or altered in strength, a current would be
induced in a neighboring circuit; but the induction of apart of the ecir-
cuit upon another part, or self-induction, had escaped him. Henry saw
it in the interesting and previously unobserved fact that if the poles of
a battery of no very great power be connected by a long wire, and the
circait be suddenly broken, a spark will be produced at the point of
interruption, while if the connecting wire be short a spark will not be
produced. He also noted that the effeet was increased by coiling the
wire into a helix, and he remarked, at the close of the article deserib-
ing these experiments, “1 can account for these phenomena only by
supposing the long wire to become charged with electricity, which, by
its reaction on itself, projects a spark when the connection is broken.”!

This was a capital observation; but, although published in 1832, it
was apparently unknown to Faraday, who rediscovered the fact a few
years later and announced it as new. AS a matter of fact, it appears
that Faraday did not himself observe the fundamental phenomenon,
but that his attention was called to it by a friend. His announcement
was made in the Philosophical Magazine in 1834, and in a communi-
cation to the Royal Society in 1835 he extended and enlarged upon the
observation.

In much that he had done, however, he had been anticipated by
Henry, who, although greatly interrupted in his original investigations
by his removal from Albany to Princeton, had himself taken up the
phenomenon of self-induction and made an interesting research.

As time and opportunity allowed, Henry continued his electrical inves-
tigations during the years that followed. He was the first to obtain
induction from induced currents, and he made a classic investigation of

| There is good reason for believing that Henry had observed this phenomenon at a
much earlier date than that of publication, and that the observation was really
made before the discovery of induction by Faraday.

THE HENRY. 151

mutual induction and of currents of the second, third, fourth, and
higher orders. In addition to his discovery of self-induction, his
researches on the inductive effects of transient currents, on magnetic
screening, and especially on the oscillations of the electric discharge
were on new lines and of the highest order. The investigation of the
oscillations of an electric discharge, one of the most important of all,
was almost unrecognized until nearly a half century had elapsed. It
was published in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Soci-
ety in 1842. Init he says: ‘‘The phenomena require us to admit the
existence of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several
reflex actions, backward and forward, each more feeble than the pre-
ceding, until the equilibrium is obtained.”

Two years later Helmholtz wrote: ‘*‘ We assume that the discharge is
not a simple motion of the electricity in one direction, but a backward
and forward motion between the coatings, in oscillation, which become
continually smaller, until the entire vis viva is destroyed by the sum
of the resistances;” and in 1853 Prof. W. Thompson published in the
Philosophical Magazine a mathematical investigation of Transient
Electric Currents, developing an equation in which “the whole theory
is packed up.”

Concerning the influence of Henry’s discoveries on the marvelous
progress of electricity during the past five or ten years, it may be well
to rest upon the opinion of one of England’s leading electricians, who,
in the preface to a recent volume on one of the latest phases of electri-
cal development, writes as follows:

“At the head of this long line of illustrious investigators stand pre-
eminent the names of Faraday and Henry. On the foundation stones
of truth laid down by them all subsequent builders have been content
to rest. The experimental researches of the one have been the guide
of the experimentalist no less than the instructor of the student, since
their orderly and detailed statements, alike of triumphant discovery
and of suggestive failure, make them independent of any commentator.
The scientific writings of Henry deserve hardly less careful study, for
in them we have not only the lucid explanations of the discoverer, but
the suggestions and ideas of a most profound and inventive mind, and
which indicate that Henry had early touched levels of discovery only
just recently becoming fully worked.” !

That one whose work is so highly esteemed should have been selected
for honor in the international chamber of delegates is not surprising.
It was also eminently fitting that his name should be given to the unit
of induction,

As already intimated, the strength of the induced current depends
on the rapidity with which that of the inducing current is aitered.
The sudden stopping of a current must be regarded as decrease at a
very rapid rate, and the starting of a current as increase at a rapid

‘Fleming. The Alternate Current Transformer in Theory and Practice, Vol. I,
London, 1889.
152 THE HENRY.

rate. It is during the most rapid changes in the strength of the indue-
ing current that the strength of the induced current is greatest, and
when a current is once established and flowing at a uniform rate no
induction takes place. The unit of induction, the henry, is the induc-
tion in a circuit when the electromotive force induced is 1 volt, while
the inducing current varies at the rate of 1 ampere per second.

It was gratifying to the American delegates in the chamber at Chi.
cago that the motion to adopt “henry” as the name of this unit came
from Professor Mascart, the distinguished leader of the French delega-
tion, for among the French, some years ago, another name, the “ quad-
rant” or “quad,” had been proposed and since that time much used;
that it was seconded by one of the leading delegates from England,
Professor Ayrton, who had himself a few years ago proposed the word
‘“‘sec-ohm” as being a proper name for the unit of induction, a proposi-
tion which for a time found much favor; and, finally, that it received
the unanimous approval of the entire chamber, thus furnishing a testi-
monial of the highest order of the estimation in which the work of
Joseph Henry is held, and a recognition of his rank as a natural phi-
losopher, which some of his own countrymen had been somewhat tardy
to appreciate and acknowledge.

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY :!

President of the French Association for the Advancement of Science.

if

The city of Caen, which so cordially greets us this day, was the
capital of Normandy, and some of the greatest events of our national
jistory are recorded in its annals.

Here was formed the little army that achieved the conquests of
England, a glorious campaign indeed, but one from which, by a cruel
turn of events, sprung along period of struggle and misery when the
heirs of the conquerors, merged in the great nation they had invaded,
returned to enforce ever increasing claims upon the Kingdom of
France.

Few provinces have been the birthplace of so many illustrious sons—
soldiers, sailors, politicians, magistrates, historians, orators, jurists,
poets, artists, men of letters and of science. Your city has long been
a center of learning and it still maintains its intellectual predominance
over the neighboring departments which in former years were part of
its territory. Your literary and scientific societies have been famous
for centuries. You are even now one of the principal headquarters of
the university, and the Palace of the Faculties which you inaugurated
a few days ago shows that your hearts are set upon maintaining that
noble tradition.

The sojourn of the French Association might afford an opportunity
for paying homage to the celebrities of your place, but I am too obvi-
ously unfit to do so. I shall confine myself to recalling, the names of
some of the scientists of whom you may justly be proud.

Unless we go as far back as the celebrated Graindorge family
we must first mention the name of Pierre Varignon, born at Caen in
1654, a geometrician and mechanist, a member of the Academy of
Sciences, whom students still hear mentioned at lectures when care is
taken to Heduainy them with the founders of science. The chemists

touelle and Vauquelin were both born in the suburbs of Caen of the
most lowly families, who, by stubborn labor and struggle with the
difficulties of life, reached the highest station in science. Earnest-
ness in teaching and uncommon skill in experimenting made Rouelle
famous. It is said of him that when before an audience he was not
quite himself until he had doffed his coat and wig. Vauquelin had
received but indifferent instruction in his native village. On the advice
of an intelligent mother he left his home at the age of 14 to makea
living as a laboratory boy in apothecary shops, where he stealthily
learned the chemistry of the times.

On being introduced to Fourcroy he had at last some leisure in which
to perfect his knowledge, adding thereto the ancient languages; became
the collaborator of his master; and occupied in turn the chairs of the
Keole Polytechnique, the Eeole des Mines, the Collége de France,
the Ecole de Pharmacie, the Faculté de Médecine, and the Muséam
d’ Histoire Naturelle.

“After living,” says Cuvier, “in circumstances closely resembling
destitution, and being pushed by others into the possession of quite a
considerable fortune, which increased all the more rapidly, as he never
had any personal cravings, he always held to the habits of his youth.
He would return to his village every year and there meet his old
mother without whom he would accept no invitation, whatever might
be the station and wealth of those who asked his company.”

Dumont-Durville, born in 1790 at Condésur-Noireau (Calvados), has
carried the flag of his country over every sea on the surface of the
globe, striking the seafaring world with amazement at the boldness of
his undertakings and bringing from his travels scientific treasures of
every description, until the end came, after going through the most
daring ventures in safety, by his being burned to death in a railroad
accident. It was no vanity for him to say: ‘An iron will never per-
mitted any obstacle to stand in my way. When I had once made up
my mind to perish or succeed, I was proof against any wavering,
against any uncertainty.”

There is at Beaumont-en-Auge a house which bears on its front an
inscription that begins thus:

“In this humble dwelling Laplace was born.”

I curtail the citation so as not to lay the inspiration of this homely
poetry open to criticism, but it is pleasant to find in it the homage of
his countrymen to one of the greatest minds of the century. In his
oration, delivered before the Academy of Sciences, Fourier said:

“The wonders of heaven, the high questions of philosophy, the
ingenious and profound combinations of mathematical analysis, all the
laws of the universe, have for over sixty years occupied his mind, and
his efforts have been crowned with immortal discoveries. - -  -

‘It can not be asserted that he would have been qualified to create
some entirely new science, as was done by Archimedes and Galileo;

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 155

to infuse, like Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz, original principles into
mathematical doctrines, or, like Newton, to be the first in applying to
the sky and extending to the whole universe the terrestrial dynamics of
Galileo; but Laplace was born to perfect, to search into everything, to
remove all bounds, to solve that which may have seemed insolvable.
He would have completed the science of the heavens if it were possible
to complete it. - - - Science was the object of his life; science has
made his memory imperishable.”

You also may claim as your own one of the founders of geology in
France. Like the author of the Mécanique Celeste, Elie de Beau-
mont was a scion of a great family, whose name was already prominent
in the history of parliaments. He had no sooner graduated from the
Feole des Mines than he was, jointly with Dufrenoy, commissioned
to make a geological map of France. After preparing for their work
by travels abroad, especially to England, the two engineers spent many
years in laboriously exploring every part of the country. The result
of their gigantic work was the publication of a celebrated map which
has served as a model, of which the geologists of to-day can only com-
plete the details. At the same time, Elie de Beaumont soared to the
loftiest conceptions in regard to the structure of the terrestrial strata,
and recognizing no other criterion than that afforded by demonstrated
facts, he did not hesitate to criticise the doctrines of his tutors. In
spite of the dryness of his subjects, he knew how to arrest attention by
his style, from which elegance was not excluded by accuracy, a praise
thatcan seldom be made in our days. Some of his pages on the physi-
ography of the Vosges haye often been cited as bearing the marks of
the sweetest poetry. Allow me to again borrow from it:

“The systems of mountains are at one and the same time the most
delicate and the most general features of the projections on the surface
of the globe. They are at one and the same time the quintessence of
topography, and the most characteristic marks of the upheavals which
the surface of the globe has experienced. They are the mutual bond
that unites the daily operation of the elements as determined by the
present relief of the earth with the events that gave this relief its shape
in the past. When it was sought to coordinate the component parts
of the vast combination of signs with which the hand of time has
engraved the history of the globe on its surface, it was found that the
mountains are the capital letters of the immense manuscript, and that
each system of mountains contains a chapter of its’?

It affords me special pleasure to now recall the name of a modest
savant who might, perhaps, experience the greatest surprise at the
tribute which I desire to pay to his memory. Gaugain, at one time a
student of the Keole Polytechnique, soon gave up industrial pursuits,
in which he had met with but little success, for there was nothing he was
less fitted for than trade, and devoted himself to scientific researches.

There was no luxury in his laboratory; his fond daughter was his
preparator; a bottle and a gold leaf constituted one of the most ingeni-
ous electrometers; a few spools of sewing thread were enough to rep-
resent electric cables. With such a crude outfit he sueceeded in giving
156 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

an experimental demonstration of the laws of the propagation of elec-
tricity through slightly conductive bodies and to verify the correctness
of the formulae that Ohm had merely indicated as being mathemat-
ically analogous to Fourier’s theory on the propagation of heat. With
similar means he disclosed the relations existing between the theorems
of static electricity and the propagation of currents. His investiga-
tions of thermoelectric phenomena and the properties of crystals are
stamped with the same mark of perfection; the methods adopted by
him still stand among the most elegant and correct. The one fault with
his investigations was perhaps that they were too early and could not
be well understood; they were subsequently thrown in’ the shade by
more brilliant discovery, and it was only when nearing the close of his
career that Gaugain enjoyed the well-deserved satisfaction of being
appreciated according to his merits.

Augustin Fresnel was born at Broglie. He is not therefore a citizen
of the Department of Calvados, but he is one of yours asa Low Nor-
man, and a memorable circumstance of his life binds him to you by
even closer ties. At the beginning of the “Hundred days” he was
suspended from his office of engineer for expressing too openly his
partiality to the restoration, and came to enjoy his enforced leisure in
the small village of Mathieu, the elder Rouelle’s home. He undertook
at that place his labors on opties which were to make him famous.
But for that fortunate disgrace, Fresnel would, we fear, never have
found time to give himself up to scientific investigation, by reason of
his extremely delicate health, and to give full seope to his genius.
From that time, and during a period of twelve years, his papers follow
one another with prodigious fecundity, as though he had a presentiment
that his days were numbered. He shattered forever the hypothesis of
emission by showing that all the phenomena of interference and diffrae-
tion are the necessary consequence of the doctrine of undulations; and
he followed up the expansion of that theory in all its details by setting
down tie rules of reflection, refraction, double refraction, ete.

Whenever he found that mathematical analysis or the accepted
notions on the mechanical structure of the mediums did not afford him
adequate resources, he boldly skipped the arduous passages over which
he had no time to tarry and guessed the rest. After eighty years his
work remains intact, confirmed more and more by subsequent investiga-
tions. His papers still constitute the most fruitful reading for physi-
cists. They afford a better comprehension of his mind, and offer a vast
number of disseminated prolific notions which had at first escaped
notice, and which others after him thought they had discovered. New-
ton alone, according to an English savant, is greater than he.

A bust of Fresnel stands on his grave at the Pére-Lachaise ceme-
tery. Some years ago the Société de Physique set about to search
for any memento of this national celebrity. An abandoned grave, hid-
den from view by wild vegetation, was discovered with great difficulty.

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 157

No near or distant relative authorized to maintain its sanctity was in
existence. Being unable to do more for the present, the society had
the unpretending monument repaired and keeps it reverently adorned
with flowers. Lavoisier has been waiting a century for the memorial
he is entitled to, but the oversight will soon be repaired. At a time
like this when the talent of our artists is a sufficient justification for
the number of statues, Fresnel should wait no longer.

You also hold titie to another celebrity in astronomy and celestial
mechanics, Leverrier born at St. Malo de la Cande (Manche), in the
heart of Normandy, and whom it was the pride of the College of Caen
to number among its students. Leverrier is chiefly known for his
discovery of Neptune. The learned astronomer, while yet almost a
beginner, succeeded by a formidable amount of clever and sedulous
‘alculations in determining its existence and its position in the heavens.
The planet Uranus appears every day in the telescope which is set for
it at the meridian, now ahead, and then aback of the anticipated time,
but never by more than a second. These slight differences were, how-
ever, the starting point for which the disturbing celestial body was
looked for and found on the very day when the announcement was made
within a degree of the position given by the reckonings. The expanse
open to observations, within which the planets gravitate around the
sun, has been doubled by the discovery of Neptune. Although the gen-
eral public is less familiar with the works of Leverrier on the stability
of the solar system and on the theory of the several planets, these are,
nevertheless, imperishable monuments.

In a different field Leverrier proved to be a veritable originator.
The hurricane which fell upon the allied fleets in the Black Sea in 1854
and caused the loss of the French ship Henri TV is still remembered.
Gales had been signaled at the same time over the wholeof Europe
with differences of from one to two days. Leverrier instituted an
inquiry among the observatories of the several countries. It was found,
upon a retrospective examination of the perturbation, that it had pro-
eressed from the west to the east, and that through telegraphic warn-
ing our fleets and armies might have been saved from the disaster,
Grasping at once the import of an international service of weather
forecast, he applied his whole diligence to the purpose. As early as
1857 the observatory at Paris was in daily receipt of telegrams from
all parts of Europe and inaugurated the service of notices which has
since been imitated the worid over: “To signal a hurricane,” thought
he, ‘“‘as soon as it may make its appearance in any part of Europe, to
follow it in its advance by means of the telegraph and to give previous
notice to such coasts as it may visit, such is the ultimate end of the
organization we are aiming at.”

Moreover he was looking upon that science from a higher standpoint.
The laws of the atmospheric movements can not be known unless all
the phenomena produced are examined upon a large area, if not over
158 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

the whole surface of the earth. ‘ Better,” said he, ‘ascertain facts in
all parts at one time during the year than to keep up for a whole cen-
tury a few scattered observations.” Besides, these movements undergo
changes in each region according to local conditions, so that the gen-
eral manifestations of the climate, the course of rainfall and of tem-
perature require a system of interdependent observations. Leverrier
leaves nothing undone, He bespeaks the cooperation of foreign obsery-
atories for the forecast service, that of seafaring men for the meteoro-
logical observations on the ocean, that of all willing contributors for a
knowledge of all the particulars of climate in France. We have inher-
ited the responsible duty of continuing this part of his work, and have
hardly anything better to do than to follow up his programme. Would
that we could fulfill it,

In one respect Leverrier is specially entitled to our gratitude. He
founded, in 1864, the Association Scientifique, an efficient organiza-
tion which, after long prosperity, finally consolidated with ours, a new-
comer, So as to constitute a compact union of scientists and of friends
of science from all parts.

[ again find here occasion to speak of one of your fellow-townsmen.
In 1839 an association of men, moved by the spirit of progress, and of
which de Caumont was the most active member, wished to place on the
footing of permanent organization certain scientific congresses that
had already met regularly for a number of years, and drafted the con-
stitution of an institute of the provinces whose object was to include
all men of letters and of science whose long labors had won for them
a well-deserved renown. In the minds of its founders, that society
was to be the soul of the academic movement in France and the depart-
ments. They expected to fulfill that part by multiplying calls for con-
gresses, by establishing closer relations between local societies and
academies, thus leading them to greater uniformity in their work and
publications so as to unite for the same ends the large amount of power
scattered all over the soil of France.

De Caumont was indefatigable. He recklessly spent his time and
his own fortune. The very plan of the undertaking did perhaps con-
tain germs of weakness for the future, but the scheme was a generous
one, and although they never met with any of the encouragement they
might have anticipated, the founders were largely instrumental in
arousing scientific activity in the departments. Their efforts have
been successful, for it can not be denied that the committee of scientific
societies, now a dependency of the ministry of public instruction, the
annual meetings of the Sorbonne, the congresses of the late scientific
association and the sittings of the French Association are carrying
out under various forms the several parts of the vast programme that
the Institute of the Provinces had set up for itself. After holding its
own for thirty-four years, the Institute of the Provinces made way for
the French Association, which aimed at the same ends with better
means of action and better security for the future.

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 159

De Caumont was above all an archwologist, and he has his place
marked among the leading founders of the science, but the part he
took in developing scientific activity in the provinces is liable to sooner
pass from memory. This is a fit occasion on which to pay tribute to
his achievements in intellectual propagation.

It is not only in the scientific domain that you have an abundance of
local celebrities. You have already done justice to the most famous,
but there is still ample material from which to designate your streets and
public squares with names that redound to the glory of your country.

TT;

You will not be surprised if a president who has crossed the Atlantic
and thereby been kept from discharging the duties that fell to him last
year at the Besangon congress, how feels desirous of explaining his
absence and of laying before you some reminiscences of the American
continent. The United States have come to be a fashionable topic.
They have been much talked of in newspapers and publications of all
kinds, in a rather unkind vein at first, we must confess, but publie
opinion has since undergone a perceptible change.

The visitors brought to that country by the Chicago Exposition
are unanimous in confessing their opinion that while the manners
there widely differ from ours, the Americans in the North constitute a
ereat nation, whose influence will be more and more felt on the ancient
continent. ;

Upon first landing in the United States one is not very favorably
impressed, possibly from the effects of prejudice. One sees there rest-
less people who rush through the streets as through the halls of a bank,
with no other care than business; who do away with idle talk and
forms of politeness to save time, and whose only concern seems to be
about the number of dollars that the day will bring in. In that land
of freedom a high price appears to be set on everything, public oftice,
access to the bench, and the stewardship of city funds. ‘The young go

whatever may be the circumstances of their fathers, and launch into

intellectual preparation. The girls, who generally have better instruc-
tion, direct their own course in the world, receive friends of either
sex, and being without the attraction of a dowry, depend upon their
personal gifts and charmis to find husbands who have already been suc-
cessful in business, and whom they are to win for themselves. Outside
of cities, and not remote from the Eastern coast, where civilization has
longer existed, forests have been burned, either for the purpose of
leaching the ashes or simply for making a clearing at small expense,
thus absolutely spurning the wealth wasted in that manner. In
meadows or cultivated fields charred trunks or huge stumps stand here
and there as witnesses of wanton destruction, and have been left on

the spot because they would not yield enough to pay for more com-
plete removal. In the far West settlers are seldom seen without their
revolvers, with which they are armed not only for defense against and,
if need be, the merciless extermination of the aborigines, but also to
fight against newcomers, and thus maintain possession of their fields
or mines.

The multitude of emigrants, who are prone to blend their various
origins and to constitute a peculiar race, comes in like an army of
invaders gifted with unwonted pluck, and bent on making the most of
the country without many scruples or much regard for the future.

I need not say that such a picture, in spite of its foundation of
truth, is no more accurate than a cartoon is like a portrait, but ‘¢ Paris
en Amerique” is also a legend that must be taken with considerable
allowance.

And yet a longer intercourse with the Americans, a more thorough
insight into their private lives and public institutions, a partial depar-
ture from the European standpoint and our historical traditions, will
very soon create in us a genuine sense of admiration for the pro-
digious results they have achieved in a few centuries. The country
has received its true characteristics from its people of Anglo-Saxon
descent; they have imbued it with a spirit of adventure, of profitable
enterprise, of independence and liberty. Those who go there with any
ambition for suecess must perforce conform by degrees to the same
ideas. In most cases the process of assimilation is evidenced by their
rapidly forgetting their mother tongue. Free will is impeded by no
trammels; everyone works for himself and his own, and makes as few
calls as possible on the resources of the community.

Without saying anything of the general departments of the Union
and of the several States which might profitably be considered, I only
wish to call your attention for an instant to the part taken by private
initiative in scientific matters. We all have within us, at different
degrees of development, the notion of a State—Providence—but the
State is not equal to this universal function, and the support that is
too often demanded as of right from it is detrimental to the share that
ach individual might take in matters of public interest.

To be sure there are benefactors left in our country. Several names
are upon your lips, and they would be the first to admit that examples
from the New World are likely to enhance their merits in your opinion.

The foundations of scientific institutions or establishments in the
United States are of two kinds. Some are progressive; others are, so
to speak, extemporaneous.

In the year 1620 a colony of Puritans, persecuted in England on
account of their religious tenets, came to America and founded the
town of Plymouth, on the coast of Massachusetts. In 1630 others of
their faith from Boston and other parts of England settled Boston,
Massachusetts, near Plymouth; their new city has eclipsed the mother

town in a singular manner. In 1636 the general court appropriated a
sum of $2,000 for the foundation of a college, especially denominational
in its character, in a neighboring place, which soon assumed the name
of Cambridge in remembrance of the celebrated university at which
most of the colonists had received their education. Two years there-
after Rev. John Harvard bequeathed one-half of his property and the
whole of his library to the new college. Such was the origin of Har-
vard College, which later became the Harvard University.

That example of private donations has been uninterruptedly followed
ever since. The institution, which had very hard beginnings, refused
no offerings, however modest. The list includes a lot of sheep, 9 shil-
lings’ worth of cotton, a pewter pot, a fruit dish, a sugar spoon, a pitcher
inlaid with silver, ete. The college subsequently received the income
of the ferry which crossed the river.

During many years the history of the college is but a narrative of a
succession of financial difficulties; of strife with the city council, that
sought to maintain its control over the institution; with the govern-
ment of the metropolis, with which the sentiments of the founders
found little favor; and, lastly, with the clergy, to the end that teachers
and students might preserve their religious independence and that the
scope of teaching be enlarged. Some of the buildings were destroyed
by several fires, but in these instances, barring the regret felt for the
loss of the articles destroyed—as, for instance, the library of Harvard,
the founder, which had theretofore been preserved as a relic—the evil
proved a blessing in the end, for private contribution, under the emo-
tion caused by the calamity, supplied means far in excess of the losses
sustained by the disaster.

Even in the midst of the ordeals caused by the Revolutionary and
civil wars, the institution constantly added to its wealth and continued
its onward march. It shakes off at last every outside influence and
acquires absolute autonomy. Harvard University at the present day
constitutes a powerful corporation, which includes faculties of arts,
sciences, theology, law, medicine, dental and veterinary surgery, and
agriculture. In 1891-92 there were 253 teachers of various grades and
2,700 students, who were the recipients of subsidies in various shapes,
prizes, or cost of tuition amounting to $85,000.

In 1891 the aggregate of ordinary receipts, income from various
sources, and money paid for instruction, was $966,000. Over and
above these sums, there was received during the year $100,000 to add
to the capital and $65,000 for immediate use, without taking into ac-
count the donations in kind such as scientific collections or implements.
The greater portion of the capital comes from gifts without any special
application and remains at the disposal of the directors; about one-
fifth consists of special funds destined for the erection of buildings, the
maintenance of certain chairs, laboratories, gymnasiums, lecture halls,
or for special investigations. It is proper to mention at this place the

admirable Museum of Comparative Zoology founded by Louis Agassiz,
as well as the observatory established by Bond in 1840, which com-
mands a revenue of its own such as to enable it to maintain, besides
the mother institution and transient missions, three meteorolgical sta-
tions in the United States, a permanent astronomical observatory at
Arequipa, Peru, 2,600 meters above the level of the sea, and a meteo-
rological station on Mount Chachani, Peru, at an altitude of 5,460
meters.

The university spends its income, but when confronted by some new
requirement it need not be embarrassed. Such is the popularity it
enjoys that all it needs to do is to publish a notice in the daily press
that a sum of $50,000 is deemed necessary for the establishment of a
chair of histology or of the Peruvian language, and in a fortnight the
sum will be subscribed.

It happens that some of the donations cause the directors considera-
ble embarrassment; such, for instance, as the pension applicable to the
maintenance of a pastor of Indian extraction. Not only are the origi-
nal races indifferently adapted to the duties of a Christian pastor, but
the incumbents themselves will fail on the day, that may be near at
hand, when they shall have disappeared before the advance of a civili-
zation they can not withstand.

A number of institutions of learning, charity, or public utility have
had a similar origin in the several States, and have in time grown
always in proportion to the good they have done. But the pace must
be quicker in these days of ours. Cities thrive at a more rapid rate,
and each State strives to do as well as the neighboring States or better. -

Chicago was last year the focus of public attention, and our country-
men have had some share in founding that great city. For these two
reasons we shall refer to it for some examples. The Institute of Fine
Arts of Chicago, incorporated under legal authority in 1879, erected in
1892, after occupying several temporary homes, a palace that cost
$600,000. I give the figures, because everything is measured by them
in America. This institute is nothing more than an association organ-
ized for the public good, and allits revenues are applied to the advance-
ment of art. It receives no subsidy from the State or the city; it has
no other source of income than the tuition fees and private contri-
butions. It has barely made a start and it already owns valuable col-
lections, donated by private citizens, some of which are entitled to the
much coveted name of being the greatest in the United States, pending
the time when they will be the greatest in the world.

The first university of Chicago, begun in 1858, was not a success.
It closed its doors in 1886. In 1889, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, after
taking reliable advice, undertook to resurrect it and began with a dona-
tion of $600,000, subject to that noteworthy condition that $400,000
more be collected by subscription before a certain date, for he wanted
to make sure that the public would approve his undertaking. Encour-

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 163

aged by the success then achieved, he added, in 1890, $1,000,000 to his
original contribution; then, in 1892, one thousand 5 per cent bonds,
representing another million. In the same year Mr. Marshall Field
donated $100,000 for a special purpose, on condition that a million
dollars be secured by subscriptions within ninety days, and all was
subscribed before the appointed day. In the month of December Mr.
Rockefeller again contributed bonds for $1,000,000. The same influx
of liberality occurred in 1893, when again donations are made condition-
ally, and the required complement never fails to realize at a stated
time.

This infant university, which has kept the name of its founder, Mr.
Rockefeller, is almost as wealthy already as its elder, Harvard. It has
teachers in every branch of learning, aud its material equipment is
such as to excite much envy. It is not my object to go into an exami-
nation of the courses, but one may rest assured that, with the command
of such resources, a Supply which is never exhausted, and the facility
thus afforded of calling men of the highest merit to its chairs, the
University of Chicago has a great future in store, and it will make its
mark in scientific advancement.

1 have no desire to continue dazzling you with figures; all I should
have to do would be to quote freely from the documents distributed with
readiness by the Americans.

The Armour Institute bears a name which the trade in food products
has made known over the whole world. ‘This tells for itself where the
dollars come from. This institution now comprises nine departments
for the simultaneous teaching of letters, fine arts, sciences and their
applications, household arts, education, and commerce. ‘The Armour
Institute,” says the programme, ‘aims to help those who are willing to
help themselves and to educate the head, hand, and heart”—the three
“hs”, as they style it over there.

The same methods obtain in all the States, whether young or old. It
would require a volume to convey an idea of the liberality with which
the citizens act toward the institutions of learning, whatever be their
degree.

Astronomy enjoys especial favor. Observatories with greater or less
endowments are erected in all parts; but, save that at Washington,
which is Federal property, nearly all the others are private foundations
with resources which to us are not usual. The largest telescope yet
known, built for the Chicago Observatory, was at the Exposition.

The founder of the Pulkowa Observatory expressed the desire that
it might possess a telescope as powerful as any that was to be found
in the world; the Americans are bent on having the largest. It is the
ancient fable: Bacchus created a wonderful fox that could not be out-
tun; Vulcan, on the other hand, gave to a dog of his own making the
faculty of overtaking any animal that it might chase. ‘Then it came
to pass that both beasts met.” In the present case all the appear-
ances are in favor of the Yankee god coming out best.
164 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

And yet America occupies even now a place of honor in astronomical
discoveries, and her share grows greater every day. Besides, every
science is rapidly progressing there, and her scientists of the first rank
are multiplying. There will soon be nothing except history for which
the United States can envy the nations of the old continents.

You will no doubt hold that it is a grand sight to behold a people
against whom the charge of avarice and of immoderate lust of gain is
readily brought, show themselves so universally considerate of the
public weal and achieve such results either through the continuous
action of the citizens or through princely foundations, whether it be a
question of charitable institutions, model hospitals, fine arts, primary
or trade schools, institutions for the training of engineers or machinists,
or of institutions of learning for the intellectual elevation of the mind,
and all without any design for commercial gain. Men of pluck and
daring make fortunes in a short time. They are not to the same extent
as we are intent on letting their heirs profit by the whole of their
wealth. In the same manner as titles of nobility are sought after else-
where, they have at heart to perpetuate their names by enduring deeds
that will do good to the community or honor to the country.

Are our efforts in that direction to be compared with those, even
though we may take into consideration all the liberal gifts it would be
unfair to ignore? Do not those who are among the foremost favorites
of fortune, either by grace of their ancestors or through personal indus-
try, experience greater difficulty, as I look upon it from some distance,
in putting their wealth to good use than they ever had in coming by it?

Tam well aware of the fact that the greater number of institutions
in our country are under State control and that no one thinks much of
giving to the State, because such donations are merged in the ocean
of appropriations. The French Association is free from such objec-
tions. It is a private institution, founded by men of honest purpose
whose object was the advancement of science for the good name of the
country. It promotes that purpose by calling these meetings, so fraught
with good results, that bring us together at various parts of our terri-
tory. It strives to assist single-handed investigators and applies the
best part of its resourses to such assistance. It lacks none of the requi-
sites that should receive the attention of donors and it deserves to
attractit. We already find great encouragement in our circumstances.
The total receipts from donations, bequests, and founders’ shares exceed
1,000,000 franes at the present time. It is proper to separate therefrom
the legacies of Messrs. Brunet, Legroux, Fontarive, and Girard (this
latter being set apart for the section of anthropology), which aggregate
over 400,000 frances.

If I may be allowed to throw out a hint for those who may be
encouraged by these examples, I would suggest that the nature of the
investigations they intend to further be not defined with too narrow
preciseness. We need not fear that we might be required to maintain

an Indian pastor, but science is making unceasing strides forward;
questions present themselves under altered forms, new ones come up,
and others again unexpectedly command more interest than could have
been anticipated. The board of directors of the association is com-
posed of recognized savants who will manage such funds as may be
intrusted to their care to the best advantage of science and country.

LET.

Tradition requires that the president of your academy should im.
part to you his comments on the advance made in such branch of the
sciences as may have received his greatest attention. My duties might
perhaps lead me to speak of the weather. It is a topic that is always
in order. But electricity has reached so prominent a place in industrial
and social matters that you will readily pardon me for endeavoring to
retrace some of the features of its history.

The science of electricity dates from at least as remote a period as
classic antiquity, but it did not really come into favor until the course
of the eighteenth century. Experiments then began to multiply, in
some contusion at first, for most of the important facts were made
known at the same time. Order was gradually established. The con-
ductibility of various mediums, the two kinds of electricity, and con-
densation, were discovered in turn. The transmission of signals to long
distances was even conceived, while De Romas and Franklin ascertained
the identity of lightning and electrical sparks. There seemed to be
nothing left undone after Coulomb had demonstrated that the reciprocal
action of electrified bodies and magnets was the same as that of uni-
versal gravitation. The mathematical methods, as perfected by the
astronomers, were applied to the new science, and the phenomena, or at
least most of them, were to be deduced by mere calculation.

To be sure Volta made thereupon an unexpected discovery, the voltaic
pile, at the effects of which his contemporaries marveled; but there will
always be shortsighted minds entertaining the notion that human
progress is drawing near the bounds of its course.

In a History of Galvanism, published in 1805 and not extensively
read in our days (who among us can cherish the hope of being read a
century hence?), the author returns a very fit answer to the objection
of those who believe that history should not be published until it is
absolutely complete; but he proceeds thus:

‘“‘Moreover, if fresh material compels us to publish a third part, as
it will consist of new matter distinct from that of the first two, it will
answer as a sequel to those two, and will perhaps make up the conclu-
sion of the History of Galvanism, which may be nearer its end than is
generally believed.”

It was an unfortunate prediction, for he was forthwith compelled to
add a third and even a fourth part; he would have many more addi-
tions to make. The First Consul had better judgment. Four years
166 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

before, on the 16th Brumaire of the year 10, after attending the sitting
of the institute at which Volta’s paper on the pile was read, he was
struck with the idea that it would be a credit to France to open a con-
test to which all the scientists from all countries should be invited, and
to award an extraordinary prize “to the most valuable writing on this
branch of physics which seemed to open the way for great discoveries.”

Progress in science is made by starts, when a felicitous experiment
or a stroke of genius brings a change in its confines. It took over
twenty years after Volta to find whether any perceptible phenomenon
takes place in the copper conductor which connects the two poles in
the pile. The discovery of Oersted and the immortal investigations of
Ampere established a relation between electricity and magnetism; iron
was magnetized by means of currents and electrical telegraphy was the
result.

But what a number of questions then confronted our minds. As long
as the phenomena remained independent of one another, they could be
explained by special theories applying to each one of them. It was the
day of fluids. After the caloric fluid, it cost no greater effort to imagine
the two electric fluids and the two magnetic fluids, to say nothing of
the neutral fluids required to connect them, and the ether with which
the universe was filled to serve as a medium of transmission of light.
No true philosophy can be based on such a multiplicity of independent
entities, for phenomena are not confined in distinct provinces with their
immediate causes. Ampere had already pointed out that it would
undoubtedly be necessary to turn to the intervention of the fluid that
pervades all space in order to explain the forces that operate between
conductors carrying electric currents.

The agent itself remains a mystery, a title that electricity enjoys by
privilege, as it were. Yet we must admit without looking back to the
origin of all things, that science is everywhere face to face with myste-
ries—universal gravitation, heat, constitution of bodies, light, electric-
ity, magmetism, life,—

While habit impels us to accept such of these as come under the
more direct observation of our senses, they remain none the less inex-
plicable, and we must confine ourselves to a study of experimental laws,
more or less connected by other laws of a more general character, with-
out any possibility of penetrating the intimate structure of the universe.
One of the great minds of our age, in whose presence wonder was
expressed at the inexplicability of certain phenomena, remarked with
profound rreaning: “Tell me what electricity is and I will tell you all
the rest.”

After Oersted and Ampére, a great step remained to be made.
“When it is seen,” said Fresnel in 1820, “that an electric current
running through a metallic helix wound around a steel cylinder mag-
netizes the latter, it seems natural to try whether a magnetized bar
is not capable of producing a voltaic current in the surrounding

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 167

helix; not that this be at first sight a natural consequence of the facts
- - - yet I thought it would not be an idle experiment to attempt.”

The result was disappointing, and Fresnel concludes that curious
paper with the following words:

“T must add, in behalf of M. Ampere, that the slight movements
that he had noticed in a magnetic needle when he brought near to it a
circuit of brass wire, a part of which was spirally wound around a
magnet, were not repeated in a constant manner, and besides that
they were so slight that he would not have made that experiment
public had he not felt certain from the success of Iiny own experiment,
of which he entertained no doubt, that these slight motions were also
caused by an electric current produced by the magnet acting upon the
helix wound around it.”

We may rely on the notorious awkwardness of Ampére for an assur-
ance that his helix was not attached to the magnet, that it was thrown
out of shape while a portion of the wire was brought near the needle,
and that he had actually discovered the induction currents; it will
suffice to repeat his experiment without any modification.

Shortly thereafter Daniel Colladon, in whom the last figure of an
illustrious generation has just disappeared, also investigated, by a
more delicate process, whether a very powerful magnet will produce
an electric current in a helix by being brought near it. The helix was
connected with a galvanometer and the latter was kept in a separate
room so as to preclude any direct action of the magnet. After making
all preparations for the experiment and putting the magnet in posi-
tion, Colladon would go and inspect his galvanometer. He probably
did so without great haste, for the index was motionless and at the
same point where it stood before.

“YT had not suspected,” said he, “that induction could only be
instantaneous. If I had had an assistant he would have seen for me
the displacement of the magnetic needle occurring at the instant when
I brought the magnet near the helix.”

It has sometimes been said that the induction currents are the sen-
tries charged with the protection of the principle of the conservation
of energy. Nothing is produced without an expense of labor, and the
failure of the preceding experiments was due to a singular oversight
of that principle.

The discovery by Arago of the effect of copper plates in abating the
oscillations of magnetic bars, and of the attraction of these bars by
conductive mediums in motion was giving there and then the clew
to inductive currents and the energy necessary for their maintenance.
Again they were at hand when Ampere and Colladon went over the
Same experiments by substituting helices conducting a current for the
bars, and when Fresnel, in an experiment that remained unpublished
for a long while, demonstrated that by increasing the weight of the
magnetic bar with a copper bar, the oscillations were modified with
greater rapidity than the increased mass of the whole would lead to
suppose.
168 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

Finally, I have it as a tradition that once Pouillet, showing in a
lecture the properties of an unusually powerful electro-magnet, was so
rash as to break with both his hands the exciting current so as to
show that the magnetic force had instantly, almost wholly, disappeared.
He received a shock which came near striking him down. We now
know that the extra-current of rupture had run through his body.

The experiments made before the days of Faraday show how obscure
is the path that leads to the unknown and how hard it is to put to a
practical use the precepts of philosophers, although their principle may
be excellent. The induction currents had been sought after without
being found; they were found without being seen. The best minds had
a preconceived notion of them which no doubt would have soon taken
the shape of demonstrated facts, but so many failures only enhance the
fame of the true originator of modern electricity. We can thus realize
how bitter were the feelings of Ampere, who had had this signal dis-
covery within his grasp; and after all he left in the history of sciences
a good enough record to preclude envy of his successors.

As to Faraday, he lived in a world of notions that were peculiarly his
own. He had but little regard for old paths and followed the lead of
his genius. He was a skillful experimenter and knew how to interpret
phenomena in accordance with what seemed to him to most closely
conform to nature, heedless of accepted theories and current ideas. To
indiscreet questions on the subject of his present experiments he would
answer with the most sincere modesty: ‘‘Do not ask me; I am seeking
for absurdities.”

It has subsequently been found that the induction currents are a
necessary consequence of the general laws and that they might have
been foreseen; foresight is easy as an afterthought.

It would be superfluous to dwell on the universal applicability of the
inductive currents. They are found in telegraphs, in our house bells,
in that recent wonder the telephone; they are the key to the present
condition of industrial electricity; they are displayed in the indirect
effects of lightning, in those produced upon telegraphic circuits by
the variations of terrestrial magnetism, in the grand apparitions of the
polar auroras; they even seem to respond on our globe to the physical
disturbances which incessantly affect the solar mass, and thus enable
us to perceive through the vacuum of space, if not the celestial har-
mony, at least the echo of the terrific commotions of which the center of
our planetary system is the seat.

At the same time Faraday resumed the study of electrical influence,
a question that was thought to have been solved long ago, and pre-
sented a new interpretation. The conception of the force lines, which
was the fruit of that study, has made it possible to put into physical
Shape, so to speak, the most abstract results of analysis. Faraday
gave prominence to this fruitful conception by a succession of skillfully
conducted experiments and intuitive deductions. It could properly be

THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 169

said of him that, without figuring out any computation and without
writing down an equation, he had proved himself a great geometrician.

Faraday’s mind carried him further. He imagined that the very
notion of action from a distance could not stand, and that in every
instance the intervening medium plays the leading part. To electrify
a body, to produce a magnet, is but to modify the conditions of the
medium by which they are surrounded, and the forces that may be
brought out in the field of action are but a manifestation of the elastic
properties of the intervening medium.

The condition of the fluid theory, then, appears considerably dam-
aged; it was even worse when Faraday discovered after numerous
attempts—the secret of which he kept—that a ray of light is altered
in passing through a magnetic field produced by magnets or currents;
so that there is a connection among them all—electricity, magnetism,
light, and consequently heat. We have no longer before us isolated per-
sonages acting independently of one another, but the several actors in
the great drama of nature which each one renders under a particular
form; whose passions come in conflict and undergo transformations as
the plot progresses; the spectator, human intellect, at first listened to
the several parts in turn; he is aware to-day of a common action and
of a general bond which will probably remain the great mystery.

Universal gravitation itself, which was held to be the type of action
from a distance, must be subject to the common rule and find its true
explanation in the structure of the medium which fills the celestial
space.

One of our best-beloved masters, before whom the example of the sun,
which attracts the earth, was given as an objection to these ideas, said:
“Have you seen hishands? If the sun attracts the earth, he must have
hands and a string.”

The adoption of a system of interdependent measures for electric and
magnetic phenomena which worked invaluable good in industrial appli-
cations had previously been the starting point of immense progress
in the province of pure science. It has been ascertained that if the
same quantity of electricity is measured by Coulomb’s law on recipro-
cal actions or by the magnetic properties of currents the ratio of the
two values is a physical velocity, and it was found by experiment
to be virtually at the same rate as the velocity of the propagation of
light. Such a coincidence could not be the effect of mere accident; it
bespoke a close’ connection between electricity and light.

Clerk Maxwell, who had made a profound study of Faraday’s works
on the action of the mediums, thought that they were the actual seat
of electrical phenomena. Ina learned mathematical analysis he proved
that luminous undulations may be explained by means of currents whose
frequent alternations excite other currents in the adjacent parts and
propagate from place to place, in which case the velocity of propaga-
tion would be nothing else than the celebrated ratio of units of measure-

170 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY.

ment. Light, then, would be a combination of electric currents, char-
acterized by the prodigious frequency of alternations, a billion during
a millionth of a second. Ampere could not foresee that the speculations
of his imagination would so soon be put in so precise a form.

Maxwell’s theory, however, was not accepted without many reserva-
tions; it still lacked the confirmation of experiment, for the properties
of the dielectrics obey but in an imperfect manner the laws as indi-
cated. Hertz’s experiments afforded a memorable confirmation. Thanks
to the discoveries of the inventor and the investigations of the physi-
cists who followed in his footsteps, the demonstration is now made that
the electric oscillations travel with the same velocity as light, that they
produce the same phenomena of interference, that they are subject to
the same laws of reflection and refraction; they could be perceived by
the eye if it were possible to give them the same frequency. That
extreme limit is still far from being reached, since the shortest electric¢
undulations that have been observed are not less than several centi-
meters, that is, one hundred thousand times longer than those of light.

So that all the phenomena which were at first ascribed to various
independent causes must now be explained by means of the mechanical
properties of a single medium which exists in the vacuum of space,
and is more or less modified by ponderable bodies. We have here
a philosophical conception which is not lacking in grandeur, but which
makes the task of the mathematicians a peculiarly hard one, and, may-
be, extends beyond the range of the human mind. As long as it was
only a question of imagining the structure of the medium capable of
transmitting light the problem was comparatively easy, and yet it has
exercised the sagacity of the most eminent men without our being yet
able to affirm that it has been solved. What is it now, when we must
turn for everything to a veritable Proteus? Our successors will not
be idle.

While the alternate currents have taken such a prominent part in the
development of theoretical notions, their importance in practice has
been just as great. All the methods of producing inductive currents
without interruption naturally supply them in the alternating form,
because the organs that are brought into operation must revert to the
same conditions, and that the two halves of each period produce effects
in opposite directions. This alternation of the currents makes them
for the most part unfit for use.

At the beginning an effort was made to utilize them by means of cor-
rectors, whose object was to drive them upon a neighboring circuit in a
constant direction, like a torrent consisting of successive waves. These
commutators, however, were so inconvenient that investigations con-
tinued for forty years after Faraday’s discovery without reaching any
practical solution.

M. Pacinotti had solved the problem in 1864 without imagining that
his laboratory apparatus could be applied to industrial purposes. A

hand-rail maker, M. Gramme, who was working as a joiner in electric
works, made himself acquainted, by uncommon perseverance, with the
machines that came under his observation. In 1869 he devised the ad-
mirable contrivance which justly bears the name of gramme ring, and
accomplished actual industrial machines.

The gramme ring is in the nature of an artifice which makes it pos-
sible to extract from the inductive alternating effects a manner of
rippling stream. Save a few direct applications of the alternating
currents, as to light-houses, for instance, this may be said to have been
the origin of industrial electricity. A few years later, 200-horsepower
dynamos were built. There was a 2,000-horsepower dynamo on exhi-7
bition at Chicago. The power of these machines is boundless. Elec
tricity receives the energy of steam engines or waterfalls, transforms
it, utilizes it, distributes it, transmits it to long distances, again receives
it, and returns it in the most varied forms.

A new revolution is at hand. By a strange vicissitude of human
affairs we are now retracing our steps. Those alternating currents that
seemed so fractious are now tractable. Of easier production, since they
require no correcting device, they are transformed by raising their level,
so that they may cover long distances at small cost, then by bringing
the sluices down for direct application.

These are strange rivers, with no tangible flow, whose waters move
only by oscillation, whose alternating flow and height of fall may be
modified at will, and that are capable of supplying at all times the
same amount of effective power, leaving out leakage on the way and
invisible friction.

It was not easy to imagine that a sort of tide, the ebb and flow of
which follow each other in less than a twenty-fifth of a second of time,
could be made available to operate hydraulic wheels and turbines. We
now know how to do this.

If the receiver moves in the same period as the alternating current,
the effects of the impulsion produced by the successive shocks are
cumulative; the apparatus is a synchronous motor.

If the conductive wires bring several alternating currents, these are
regulated so as to operate at stated intervals during a period, in the
same manner as the two rods of a locomotive; these are the revolving
motors.

Other contrivances occur to our mind, but to dwell upon them would
take up too much time.

The Niagara Falls will, in the near future, furnish a striking illustra-
tion of the application of electricity; 5,000-horsepower turbines, the
most powerful ever built, will produce formidable alternating currents
which will be easily regulated, transformed, transmitted, and availed of
for all purposes.

At this day electricity transmits instantaneously the human thought
through oceans and over continents; it enables us to hear the voice

and sentiments of our loved ones, though we may be separated by hun-
dreds of miles; it finds its use in the details of our household life; it
wins favor for a method of lighting with which oxygen is no longer
consumed, and our dwellings are free from offensive smell; it has made
such inroads into industrial works that it is looked upon as a necessity
wherever the wise step was taken of calling upon its aid. At the same
time it has thrown the notions of natural philosophy into confusion and
put to a severe ordeal the conceptions of the human mind.

All of this progress is of yesterday’s date, and no one can tell what
the future has in store; but whatever wonders may be witnessed by
our successors, if could properly be said that the nineteenth century,
now drawing to its close, will, with good reason, be called the age of
electricity.

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.!

By Prof. A. W. RUCKER, M.A.,F.R.S.

It is impossible for a body of English scientific men to meet in one
of our ancient university towns without contrasting the old ideal of
the pursuit of learning for its own sake with the modern conception
of the organization of science as part of a pushing business concern.

We are, as a nation, convinced that education is essential to national
success. Our modern universities are within earshot of the whirr of
the cotton mill or the roar of Piccadilly. Oxford and Cambridge them-
selves are not content to be centers of attraction to which scholars
gravitate. They have devised schemes by which their influence is
directly exerted on every market town and almost on every village in
the country. University extension is but a part of the extraordinary
multiplication of the machinery of education which is going on all
around us. The British Association, which was once regarded as
bringing light into dark places, is now welcomed in every large provin-
cial town by a group of well-known men of science; and we find ready
for the meetings of our sections, not only the chapels and concert rooms
which have so often and so kindly been placed at our disposal, but all
the appliances of well-designed lecture rooms and laboratories.

Ido not propose, however, to detain you this morning with a dis-
course on the spread of scientific education, but you will forgive me if
I illustrate its progress by two facts, not perhaps the most striking
which could be selected, but especially appropriate to our place of
meeting. It is little more than thirty years since the two branches of
science with which our section deals, mathematics and physics, have
been generally recognized as wide enough to require more than one
teacher to cope with them in an educational institution of high preten-
sions and achievement. In 1860 the authorities of the Owens College,
Manchester, debated whether it was desirable to create a professorship
of natural philosophy in addition to, and independent of, the chair of

mathematics. It was thought necessary to obtain external support for
the opinions of those who advocated this step. An appeal was made
to Professors De Morgan and Stokes. The former reported that a
‘““course of experimental physics is in itself desirable;” the latter, that
‘there would be work enough in a large institution for a mathemati-
cian and a physicist.”

In the end the chair of natural philosophy was established, and the
fact that our host of to-day, Professor Clifton, was its first occupant
reminds us how little we have advanced in time and how far in educa-
tional development from the days when propositions such as those I
have cited were only accepted on the authority of the names of Stokes
and De Morgan.

The other fact to which I would refer is that the Clarendon Labora-
tory, in which the meetings of Section A are to be held, though erected
barely a quarter of a century ago, was the first laboratory in this coun-
try which was specially built and designed for the study of experimen-
tal physics. It has served asa type. Clerk Maxwell visited it while
planning the Cavendish Laboratory, and traces of Professor Clifton’s
designs can be detected in several of our university colleges.

But though our surroundings remind us of the improvement which
has been effected in the equipment of our science, it would not be diffi-
cult to indicate weak points which should forthwith be strengthened.
On these, in so far as they affect education, I will not dwell—and that
for two reasons. In the first place, we meet to-day not as teachers,
but as students; and, secondly, I think that whereas we have as a
nation awoke—though late in the day—to the importance of education,
we are not yet fully awake to the importance of learning. Our attitude
in such matters was exactly expressed by one of the most eminent of
the witnesses who gave evidence before the ‘“‘Gresham Commission.”
In his opinion the advancement of knowledge must in a university in
London be secondary to the higher instruction of the youth of London.
If this be so—and I will not now dispute it—we shall surely all agree
that somewhere or other, in London or out of it, included in our univer-
sities or separate from them, there ought to be institutions in which the
advancement of knowledge is regarded as of primary and fundamental
interest, and not as a mere secondary by-product thrown off in the
course of more important operations.

It is not essential that in such an institution research should be the
only task. Investigation may be combined with the routine work of
an observatory, with teaching, with the care of standards, or with
other similar duties. It is however essential that, if the advancement
of knowledge is seriously regarded as an end worth attaining, it should
not be relegated to a secondary place.

Time and opportunity must be found for investigation, as time and
opportunity are found for other tasks. It is not enough to refer to
research in a prospectus and then to leave it to be accomplished at odd

times and in spare moments not claimed by more urgent demands.

-Those to whom the future of the higher learning in England is dear
must plan and scheme to promote the life-long studies of men, as in the
last quarter of a century they have struggled, with marked success, to
promote the preparatory studies of boys and girls. That the assign-
ment of a secondary position to research is the more popular view, and
that the necessity for encouraging it has as yet hardly been grasped by
many of those who control our modern educational movements is, I fear,
too true. It is therefore a matter for congratulation that within the
last year Oxford has established a research degree, and has thus taken
an important step toward gathering within her fold workers of mature
years who are able and willing, not merely to gain knowledge, but to
add to it.

We may also note, with pleasure and gratitude, that the stream of
private munificence has recently been in part directed to the advance-
ment of learning. Sir Henry Thompson has generously offered a sum
of £5,000 to provide a large photographic telescope for the National
Observatory at Greenwich. The new instrument is to be of 26 inches
aperture and 22 feet 6 inches focal length, or exactly double the linear
dimensions of that which has been previously employed. Mr. Ludwig
Mond, too, has added to his noble gifts to science by the new research
laboratories which he is about to establish in connection with the Royal
Institution. Albemarle street is thronged with memories of great dis-
coveries. The researches of Lord Rayleigh and the remarkable results
of Professor Dewar’s studies of matter at low temperatures are main-
taining the great reputation which the Royal Institution has gained in
the past, and all English physicists will rejoice that prospects of new
and extended usefulness are opening before it.

Another hopeful though very embarrassing fact is that the growth
in the number of scientific workers makes it increasingly difficult to
find the funds which are necessary for the publication of their work.
Up to the present the author of a paper has had to submit it to eriti-
cism, but when it has been approved by competent judges it has been
published without ado and without expense to himself. This is as it
Should be. It is right that due care should be exercised to prune away
all unnecessary matter, to reduce as far as may be the necessary cost.
It will, however, be a great misfortune if judgment as to what curtail-
ment is necessary is in future passed, not with the object of removing
what is really superfluous but in obedience to the iron rule of poverty.
Apart from all other disadvantages, such a course would add to the
barriers which are dividing the students of different sciences. A few
lines and a rough diagram may suffice to show to experts what has
been attempted and what achieved; but there is no paper so difficult
to master as that which assumes that the reader starts from the point
of vantage which months or years of study have enabled the author to
attain. Undue pruning will not make the tree of knowledge more
fruitful, and will certainly make it harder to climb.
176 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

Connected also with the vast increase of scientific literature is a
growing necessity for the publication of volumes of abstracts, in which
the main results of recent investigations are presented in a concen-
trated form. English chemists have long been supplied with these by
the Chemical Society. The Physical Society, though far less wealthy
than its elder sister, has determined to undertake a similar task. We
are compelled to begin cautiously, but in January next the first number
of a monthly pamphlet will be issued containing abstracts of all the
papers which appear in the principal foreign journals of physies. In
this venture the society will incur grave responsibilities, and I avail
myself of this opportunity to appeal to all British physicists to sup-
port us in a work the scope of which will be rapidly extended if our
first efforts succeed.

From this brief glance at what has been or is about to be done to
promote the study of physics I must now turn to the discussion of nar- -
rower but more definite problems, and I presume that I shall be most
likely to deserve your attention if I select a subject in which I am
myself especially interested.

During the last ten years my friend Dr. Thorp and I have been
engaged upon a minute magnetic survey of the United Kingdom. The
main conclusions at which we have arrived are about to be published,
and I do not propose to recount them now. It is, however, impossible
to give so long a time to a single research without having one’s atten-
tion drawn to a number of points which require further investigation,
and I shall perhaps be making the best use of this opportunity if I
bring to your notice some matters in the practical and theoretical study
of terrestrial magnetism which deserve a fuller consideration than has
yet been given to them.

In the first place, then, there is little doubt that the instruments at
present used for measuring declination and horizontal force are attected
with errors far greater than the error of observation.

We employed four magnetometers by Elliott Brothers, which were
frequently compared with the standard instrument at Kew. These
measurements proved that the instrumental differences which affect the
accuracy of the declination and horizontal force measurements are from
five to ten times as great as the error of a single field observation. The
dip circle which two generations ago was so untrustworthy, is, in our
experience, the most satisfactory of the absolute instruments.

In most cases these comparisons extended over several days, but the
astronomer royal has described in his recent report observations made
at Greenwich for two years and a half with two horizontal force instru-
ments. These differ between themselves, and the discrepancy is of the
same order of magnitude as those we have detected.

If such differences exist befween instruments of the Kew pattern, it
is probable that they will be still greater when the magnetometers
under investigation are of different types,

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. UTE

This point has been investigated by Dr. Van Rijckevorsel, who five
years ago visited Kew, Pare St. Maur, Wilhelmshaven, and Utrecht,
and, using his own instruments at each place, compared the values of
the magnetic elements determined by himself with those deduced from
the self-registering apparatus of the observatory.

The discrepancies between the so-called standards which were thus
brought to light were quite startling and prove the necessity for an
investigation as to their causes.

Magneticians had long been aware that the instruments used by
travelers should be compared at the beginning and end of a journey
with those at some fixed observatory to make sure that the compara-
tively rough usage to which they are subjected has not affected their
indications. But Dr. Van Rijckevorsel’s expedition first drew general
attention to the fact that there are serious differences between the
standard observatory instruments themselves.

The importance of a careful comparison between them was at once
recognized. The magnetic subcommittee of the International Meteor-
ological Conference held at Munich in the autumn of 1891 resolved
that it is “necessary that the instruments employed for absolute meas-
urements at the different observatories should be compared with each
other and the results published.” As far as I am aware nothing has
been done to ‘give effect to this resolution, but the necessity for such
an international comparison is urgent. The last few years have been
a period of unexampled activity in the conduct of local magnetic sur-
veys. To cite instances from the northwest of Europe only, observa-
tions have recently been made on a more or less extended scale in the
United Kingdom, France, Holland, North Germany, and Denmark.

It will be absurd if these surveys can not be collated and welded into
a homogeneous whole, because we are in doubt whether the indications
of our standard instruments for the measurement of declination and
dip differ by five or six minutes of are.

If, however, an official international comparison of the magnetic
standards in use in different countries is instituted it is probable that
only one observatory in each country will take part in it.

It may fairly be left to each nation to determine for itself the rela-
tions between the results of measurements made in its own institutions:
Apart, therefore, from all other reasons, we in England would only be
able to make the best use of an international comparison if we had
beforehand set our own house in order and were able at once to extend
the results of experiments made at Kew or Greenwich to Stonyhurst,
Valentia, and Falmouth.

This we are not at the present moment in a position to do. As far
as I know nobody has ever carried a magnetometer backward and
forward between Kew and Greenwich to test the concordance of the
published results. During the recent survey single or double sets of
observations have been made at Stonyhurst, Falmouth, and Valentia,

178 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

with instruments which have been compared with Kew, but these meas-
urements, though amply sufficient for the purposes of our research, were
not numerous enough to serve as a firm basis for determining the dis-
crepancies between the various standards, so that the exact relations
between these important sets of apparatus are still unknown.

The first point, therefore, to which I wish to draw the attention of
the section is the necessity for a full primary comparison between the
standard magnetic instruments in use at our different observatories.

But if this were satisfactorily accomplished the question would arise
as to whether it should be repeated at regular intervals. We have at
present only a presumption in favor of the view that the standards
which we know are discordant are nevertheless constant. A single
instance may suflice to show how necessary it may be—at all events in
the case of outlying and isolated observatories—to put this belief to the
test.

In the most recent account of the work of the observatory of the
Bombay government at Colaba, the dips are discussed for the period
of twenty years between 1872 and 1892. During this interval the
adjustment of the agate plates upon which the dip needle rolls has
thrice been modified. In 1877 the plates were renewed. In 1881 and
1887 the dip circle was taken to pieces and rebuilt. In the intervals
the dip as determined by several needles, but always with this circle,
remained approximately constant, but after each overhauling it sud-
denly altered, increasing by 12 minutes on the first occasion, by 23 min-
utes on the second, and by 20 minutes on the third. Mr. Chambers.
states that he ‘‘can give no satisfactory account of this behavior of
the instrument,” but suggests that ‘“‘the needle gradually hollows out
a depression in the agate plates on which it rolls, and that this charac-
teristic of the dip circle” has not before been discovered owing to the
reluctance of magnetic observers to interfere with the adjustment of
instruments which are apparently working well.

IT do not think that this explanation will suffice. Dr. Thorpe and I
employed a new dip circle in the earliest part of our survey work, which
has remained in accord with Kew for ten years. During that time the
dip has been measured some seven hundred times with it. This cor-
responds, I believe, to more than the amount of work done with the
circle at Colaba in six years, which in turn is longer than some of the
intervals in which the Colaba instruments gave results erroneous to the
extent of 20 minutes. I feel, therefore, quite sure that the difficulties
which have been experienced at Bombay are not due to any “ charac-
teristic defect of the dip circle.” But whatever the cause may have
been, surely the lesson is that, if such things can happen in so well-
known an institution, it is desirable that we should take the moderate
pains required to assure ourselves whether smaller—but, possibly, not
unimportant—errors are gradually affecting the results at any of our
observatories,

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 179

This brings me to my next point, namely, that if we are to draw con-
clusions from the minor differences between measurements of secular
or diurnal change made in the observatories, it is not only necessary
that we should know whether the instruments are strictly comparable
and constant, but the observations must be reduced by precisely the
same methods.

In 1886 the late Mr. Whipple drew the attention of the British Asso-
ciation to the fact that there was a systematic difference between the
diurnal ranges of declination at Greenwich and Kew. His results were
based on the three years 1870-1872. In 1890 two of my students, Messrs.
Robson. and 8. W. J. Smith, extended the comparison to three more
recent years (1883, 1856, 1887), and obtained results in complete accord
with those of Mr. Whipple.

It is well known that the average daily oscillation of the magnet is
affected by the magnetic weather. Sabine showed that magnetic
storms do not merely buffet the needle now in this direction and now
in that—they affect its average behavior, so that the mean swing east
and west is different according as we deduce it only from days of mag-
netic calm or include those of storm.

Mr. Whipple reduced the Kew observations by two methods,! one of
which depended on the calmest days only, while the other included
those which were moderately disturbed. Neither agreed exactly with
the method in use at Greenwich, but the difference between the
results deduced from them was so small when compared with the differ-
ence between either and that obtained at Greenwich, that it seemed
possible that the diurnal variations, even at these closely neighboring
places, might differ appreciably. The question whether this is so has
now been answered. In 1890, at the request of the Kew committee,
the astronomer royal undertook to select early in each year five quiet
days in each of the preceding twelve months. It was also agreed that,
whether they adopted other methcds or not, the chief English magnetic
observatories should determine the diurnal variations from these days
alone. The Greenwich? and Kew observations for 1890 have therefore
been worked up in exactly the same way, with the result that the dis-
crepancy, which had persisted for twenty years, has entirely disap-
peared, and that the two diurnal ranges at the two observatories are
in as close accord as could be expected.

If, therefore, we may judge from a single year, the cause of the dif-
ference lay in the choice of days. Greenwich will in future give us two
diurnal variations, one obtained from the most quiet days only, the
other from all days except those of violent storm, and in these we shall
have most valuable data for studying the mean effect of disturbances
on the diurnal variation. ;

To this satisfactory conclusion I have only one suggestion to add.
The astronomer royal and M. Mascart now publish for the same stormy

days the photographie traces by which the history of a magnetic storm
is mapped. Is it possible for Greenwich and Paris also to agree in
their choice of calm days for the calculation of the diurnal variation
so that a precise similarity of method may obtain not only between
the Enghsh observatories but between England and France?

The importance of cooperation between institutions engaged on the
same tasks having been illustrated, I am glad to be able to announce
that another step is about to be taken in the same direction. For some
years, in spite, I believe, of great financial difficulties, the Cornwall
Royal Polytechnic Society has maintained a magnetic observatory at
Falmouth. The results of the observations have hitherto been printed
in the journal of the society only, but the Royal Society has now con-
sented to publish them in the Proceedings. Before long, therefore, the
Kew and Falmouth records, which are already worked up in the same
way, will be given to the world side by side. Is it too much to hope
that this may be the first step toward the production of a British
Magnetic Year Book, in which observations whose chief interest lies in
their comparison may be so published as to be easily compared?

We owe to private enterprise another advance of the same kind.
The managers of the new journal Science Progress have made arrange-
ments with the Kew committee for the yearly publication of a table
showing the mean annual values of the magnetic elements as deter-
mined at the various magnetic observatories of the world. It will
therefore in future be possible to get a general idea of the rate of
secular change in different localities without searching through a
number of reports in different languages, which can only be consulted
in the rooms of the few societies or institutions to which they are
annually sent. The present state of our knowledge of the secular
change in the magnetic elements affords, indeed, very strong support
to the arguments I have already adduced in favor of a comparison
between the instruments of our magnetic observatories.

The whole question of the cause of this phenomenon has entered on
anew stage. It has long been recognized that the earth is not a simple
magnet, but that there are in each hemisphere one pole or point at which
the dip needle is vertical and two foci of maximum intensity. A com-
parison of earlier with later magnetic observations led to the conclusion
that one or both of the foci in each hemisphere is in motion, and that to
this motion, however caused, the secular change in the values of the
magnetic element is due. Thus the late Prof. Balfour Stewart, writing
in 1883, says: “* While there is no well-established evidence to show that
either the pole of verticity or the center of force to the north of Amer-
ica has perceptibly changed its place, there is on the other hand very
strong evidence to show that we have a change of place on the part of
the Siberian focus.”! The facts in favor of this conclusion are there dis-
cussed. The arguments are based, not on the results of any actual

koe ati

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 181

observations near to the focus in question, but on the behavior of the
magnet at points far distant from it in Europe and Asia. The westerly
march of the declination needle, which lasted in England up to 1818,
and the easterly movement which has since replaced it, are connected
with a supposed easterly motion of the Siberian focus, which, it is
added, ‘‘there is some reason to believe - - - has recently been
reversed.” In opposition, therefore, to the idea of the rotation of a
magnetic focus round the geographical poles which the earlier magne-
ticians adopted, Stewart seems to have regarded the motion of the
Siberian focus as oscillatory.

A very different aspect is put upon the matter by a comparison of
the magnetic maps of the world prepared by Sabine and Creak for the
epochs 1840 and 1880, respectively. Captain Creak, having undertaken
to report on the magnetic observations made during the voyage of the
Challenger, supplemented them with the unrivaled wealth of recorded
facts at the disposal of the hydrographic department of the Admiralty.
He was thus able, by a comparison with Sabine’s map, to trace the gen-
eral course of the secular changes all over the world for forty years.
The negative results may be shortly stated. There is no evidence of
any motion either of magnetic pole or focus. The positive conclusions
are still more curious. There are certain lines on the surface of the
earth toward which in the interval under consideration the north pole
of the needle was attracted. From each side the compass veered or
backed toward them. Above them the north pole of dip needle moved
steadily down.

There are other lines from which, as tested by compass and dip circle,
a north pole was in like manner repelled. The two principal points
of increasing attraction are in China and near Cape Horn; the chief
points of growing repulsion are in the north of Canada and the Gulf of
Guinea.

Tam sure that my friend Captain Creak would be the first to urge
that we should not generalize too hastily from this mode of present-
ing the facts, but there can be no doubt that they can not be explained.
by any simple theory of a rotating or oscillating pair of poles. Prima
facie they suggest that the secular change is due not so much to changes
at the principal magnetic points as to the waxing and waning of the
forces apparently exerted by secondary lines or points of attraction or
repulsion. :

All down the west coast of America, close, be it noted, to one of the
great lines of volcanic activity, north hemisphere magnetism has since
1840 been growing in relative importance. Near Cape Horn a weak
embryonic pole is developing of the same kind as the well-known pole
at the other end of the continent near Hudson Bay. Along a line which
joins Newfoundland to the Cape of Good Hope precisely the reverse
effects have been experienced; while in the Gulf of Guinea a south
hemisphere pole is growing within the Tropics. Of course I do not
182 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

suggest that these secondary systems can ever determine the principal
phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, or reverse the magnetic states of
the hemispheres in which they oceur. These are no doubt fixed by the
rotation of the earth. I do, however, wish to emphasize the fact that
they show that either secular change is due to the conjoint action of
local causes, or that if some single agent such as a current system within
the earth, or a change of magnetic conditions outside it, be the primary
cause, the effects of this cause are modified and complicated by local
peculiarities.

Mr. Henry Wilde has succeeded in representing with approximate
accuracy the secular change at many points on. the surface of the earth
by placing two systems of currents within a globe, and imparting to
the axis of one of them a motion of rotation about the polar axis of the
earth. But he has had to supplement this comparitively simple arrange-
ment by local features. He has coated the seas with thin sheet iron.
The ratio between the two currents which serves to depict the secular
change near the meridian of Greenwich fails in the West Indies. ‘Thus
this ingenious attempt to imitate the secular change by a simple rota-
tion of the magnetic pole supports the view that local peculiarities
play a powerful part in modifying the action of a simple first cause, if
such exist. I need hardly say that I think the proper attitude of mind
on this difficult subject is that of suspended judgment, but there is no
doubt that recent investigation has, at all events, definitely raised the
question how far secular change is either due to, or modified by, special
magnete features of different parts of the earth.

It is possible that light may be thrown upon this point by observa-
tions on asmaller scale. Assuming for the moment that the difference
in the secular changes on opposite sides of the Atlantic is due to a dif-
ference of local causes, it is conceivable that similar causes, though
less powerful and acting through smaller ranges, might produce similar
though less obvious differences between places only a few miles apart.
For testing this Greenwich and Kew are in many respects most favora-
bly situated. Nowhere else are two first-class observatories so near
together. Differences in the methods of publishing the results have
made it somewhat difficult to compare them, but the late Mr. Whipple
furnished me with figures for several years, which made comparison
easy. Without entering into details it may be sufficient to say that
the declination needles at the two places do not from year to year run
parallel courses. Between 1880 and 1882 Kew outstripped its rival;
between 1885 and 1889 it lost, so that the gain was rather more than
compensated. The difference of the declination of the two places
appears to increase and diminish through a range of 5 minutes of are.

This evidence can be supplemented by other equally significant
examples. No fact connected with terrestrial magnetism is more cer-
tain than that at present the rate of secular change of declination in
this part of Europe increases as we go north. This is shown by a com-

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 183

parison of our survey with those of our predecessors fifty and thirty
years ago, by M. Moureaux’s results in France, and by Captain Creak’s
collation of previous observations. Yet, in spite of this, Stonyhurst,
which is some 200 miles north of Greenwich and Kew, and should there-
fore outrun them, sometimes lags behind and then makes up for lost
time by prodigious bounds. Between 1882 and 1886 the total secular
change of declination at Stonyhurst was about 5.5 minutes less than
that at Greenwich and Kew, whereas in the two years, 1890-92, it
reached at Stonyhurst the enormous amount of 28 minutes, just doub-
ling the corresponding alteration registered in the same time at Kew.
If these fluctuations are caused by the instruments or methods of re-
duction, my argument in favor of frequent comparisons and uniform
treatment would be much strengthened, but, apart from the inherent
improbability of such large differences being due to the methods of
observation, the probability of their physical reality is increased by
the work of the magnetic survey.

The large number of observations at our disposal has enabled us to
calculate the secular change in a new way, by taking the means of
observations made about five years apart at numerous though not iden-
tical stations scattered over districts about 150 miles square. The
result thus obtained should be free from mere local variations, but as
calculated for the soutaeast of England for the five years 1886-91, it
differs by nearly 5 minutes from the change actually observed at Kew.

We have also determined the secular change at twenty-five stations
by double sets of observations made as nearly as possible on the same
spot at intervals of several years. The results must be interpreted
with caution. In districts such as Scotland, where strong local dis-
turbances are frequent, a change of a few yards in the position of the
observer might introduce errors far larger than the fluctuations of
secular change. But when all such changes are eliminated, when all
allowance is made for the possible inaccuracy of field observations,
there are outstanding variations which can hardly be due to anything
but a real difference in the rate of change of the magnetic elements.

A single example will suffice. St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells
are about 30 miles apart. Both are situated on the Hastings Sand for-
mation, and on good noninagnetic observing ground. At them, as at
the stations immediately around them—Lewes, Eastbourne, Appledore,
Etchingham, Heathfield, and Maidstone—the local disturbing forces
are very small. All these places lie within a district about 40 miles
square, at no point of which has the magnet been found to deviate by
5 minutes from the true magnetic meridian. No region could be more
favorably situated for the determination of the secular change, yet
according to our observations the alteration in the declination at St.
Leonards in six years was practically equal to that at Tunbridge Wells
in five. It is difficult to assign so great a variation to an accumulation
of errors, and this is only one among several instances of the same
kind which might be quoted.
184. TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

We find, then, when we consider the earth as a whole, grave reason
to question the old idea of a secular change caused by a magnetic pole
or focus pursuing an orderly orbit around the geographical axis of the
earth, or oscillating in some regular period in its neighborhood. It
would of course be absurd to admit the possibility of change in the
Tropics and to deny that possibility in the Arctic circle, but the new
facts lead us to look upon the earth not as magnetically inert, but as
itself—at the equator as well as at the pole—producing or profoundly
modifying the influences which give rise to secular change. And
then, when we push our inquiry further, accumulating experience tells
the same tale. The earth seems, as it were, alive with magnetic forces,
be they due to electric currents or to variations in the state of magnet-
ized matter. We need not now consider the sudden jerks which dis-
turb the diurnal sweep of the magnet, which are simultaneous at
places far apart, and probably originate in causes outside our globe. °
But the slower secular change, of which the small part that has been
observed has taken centuries to accomplish, is apparently also inter-
fered with by some slower agency the action of which is confined
within narrow limits of space. Between Kew, Greenwich, and Stony-
hurst, between St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells, and I may add,
between Mablethorpe and Lincoln, Enniskillen and Sligo, Charleville
and Bantry, the measured differences of secular variation are so large
as to suggest that we are dealing not with an unruffled tide of change,
which, unaltered by its passage over continent or ocean, sweeps slowly
round the earth, but with a current fed by local springs or impeded by
local obstacles, furrowed on the surface by billows and eddies, from
which the magnetician, if he will but study them, may learn much as
to the position and meaning of the deeps and the shallows below.
But if this is the view which the facts I have quoted suggest, much
remains to be done before it can be finally accepted; and in the first
place—to come back to the point from which I started—we want, for
some years at all-events, a systematic and repeated comparison of the
standard instruments in use at the different observatories. That they
are not in accord is certain; whether the relations between them are
constant or variable is doubtful. If constant, the suggestions I have
outlined are probably correct; if variable, then the whole or part of
the apparent fluctuations of secular change may be nothing more than
the irregular shiftings of inconstant standards.

I can not myself believe that this is the true explanation, but in any
case it is important that the doubt should be set at rest, and that if
the apparent fluctuations of secular change are not merely instru-
mental, the inquiry as to their cause should be undertaken in good
earnest.

The question is interesting from another point of view. It is now
fully established that even where the surface soil is nonmagnetic, and
even where geologists have every reason to believe that it lies upon

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 185

nonmagnetic strata of great thickness, there are clearly defined lines
and centers toward which the north-seeking pole of a magnet is
attracted, or from which it is repelled. To the magnetic surveyor flue-
tuations in secular change would appear as variations in the positions
of these lines, or as changes in the forces in play in their neighborhood.

Greenwich and Kew are both under the influence of a widespread
local disturbance which culminates near Reading. At both places the
needle is deviated to the west of the normal magnetic meridian, and if
the westerly declination diminishes sometimes faster and sometimes
more slowly at one observatory than at the other, this must be, or, at
all events, would in the first instance appear to be, due to local changes
in the regional disturbing forces. The questions of the nature of the
irregularities of secular change and of the causes of local disturbances
are therefore intermingled, and information gained on these points may
in turn be useful in solving the more difficult problem of world-wide
secular variations.

Two causes of regional and local disturbances have been suggested,
viz, earth currents and the presence of visible or concealed magnetic
rocks. The two theories are not mutually exclusive. Both causes of
the observed effects may, and probably do, coexist. I have, however,
elsewhere explained my reasons for believing that the presence of
magnetic matter, magnetized by induction in the earth’s field, is the
principal cause of the existence of the magnetic ridge-lines and foci
of attraction which for so many years we have been carefully tracing.
I will only now mention what appears to me to be the final and conclu-
Sive argument, which, since it was first enunciated, has been strength-
ened by the results of our more recent work. We find that every great
mass of basic rock, by which the needle is affected at considerable dis-
tances, attracts the north-seeking pole. Captain Creak some years ago
showed that the same statement is true of those islands in the Northern
Hemisphere which disturb the lines of equal declination, while islands
in the Southern Hemisphere repel the north pole and attract the south.
In other words, these disturbances are immediately explained if we
suppose that they are due to magnetic matter magnetized by induction.
The theory of earth currents would, on the other hand, require that
round the masses of visible basalt, and round the island investigated
by Captain Creak, currents, or eddies in currents, should cireulate in
directions which are always the same in the same hemisphere, and
always opposed on opposite sides of the equator. For this supposition
no satisfactory explanation is forthcoming, and, therefore, with all
reserve and a full consciousness that in such matters hypothesis differs
but little from speculation, it appears to me that the theory that
induced magnetism is the main cause of the disturbance has the greater
weight of evidence in its favor.

If this be granted, it is evident that the positions of the main lines
and centers of attraction would be approximately constant, and, so far
186 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

as it is possible to form an opinion, these conditions seem to be satisfied,
There has certainly been no noticeable change in the chief loci of attrae-
tion in the five years which have elapsed between the epochs of our two
surveys. Mr. Welsh’s observations made in Scotland in 1857-58 fit in
well with our own. Such evidence is not, however, inconsistent with
minor changes, and it is certain that as the directions and magnitude of
the inducing forces alter, the disturbing induced orces must alter also.
But this change would be slow, and as the horizontal force is in these
latitudes comparatively weak, the change in the disturbing forces
would also be small, unless the vertical force altered greatly. It is at
all eventsimpossible to attribute to this cause oscillations which occupy
at most eight or ten years. It is possible to suggest other changes
in the state of the concealed magnetic matter, alterations of pressure,
temperature, and the like, to which the oscillations of secular change
might be due, but probably there will be a general consensus of opinion
that if the slowly changing terms in the disturbance function are due
to magnetic matter, the more rapid fluctuations of a few years’ period
are more likely to be connected with earth currents. It becomes there-
fore a matter of interest to disentangle the two constituents of local
disturbances; and there is one question to which I think an answer
might be obtained without a greater expenditure than the importance
of the investigation warrants. Are the local variations in secular
change waves which move from place to place, or are they stationary
fluctuations, each of which is confined to a limited area beyond which
it never travels? Thus if the annual decrease in the declination is at
one time more rapid at Greenwich than at Kew, and five years after-
wards more rapid at Kew than at Greenwich, has the maximum of
rapidity passed in the interval through all intervening places, or has
there been a dividing line of no change which has separated two dis-
triets which have perhaps been the scenes of independent variations?
The answer to this question is, I take it, outside the range of our
knowledge now, but if the declination could be determined several
times annually at each of a limited number of stations in the neighbor-
hood of London, to this inquiry, at all events, a definite answer would
soon be furnished.

There are two other lines of investigation which I hope will be taken
up sooner or later, for one of which it is doubtful whether the United
Kingdom is the best site, while the other is of uncertain issue.

If, however, it be granted that the principal cause of local and regional
magnetic disturbances is the magnetization by the earth’s field of mag-
netic matter concealed below its surface, the question as to the nature
of this material still remains to be solved. Is it virgin iron or pure
magnetite, or is it merely a magnetic rock of the same nature and prop-
erties as the basalts which are found in Skye and Mull? There is of
course no 4 priori reason why all these different materials should not
be active, some in one place and some in another.

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 187

As regards the United Kingdom I have, both in a paper on the
“Permeability of magnetic rocks” and in the description of the recent
survey, made calculations which tend to prove that if we suppose that
the temperature of the interior of the earth is, at a depth of 12 miles,
such as to deprive matter of its magnetic properties, and if we further
make the unfavorable assumption that down to that limit the suscepti-
bility is constant, the forces which are observed on the surface are of
the same order of magnitude as those which could be produced by
large masses of ordinary basalt or gabbro. It would not, however, be
wise to generalize this result and to assume that in all places regional
disturbances are due to basic rocks alone.

We know that local effects are produced by iron ore, for the Swedish
miners seek for iron with the aid of the magnet, and in some other
cases magnetic disturbances of considerable range are so intense as to
suggest that material of very high magnetic permeability must be
present.

If the concealed magnetic matter were iron, and if it were present in
large quantity, it is evident that the results of experiments with the
magnetometer and dip circle might be supplemented by observations
made with the plumb line or pendulum. In such a case the region of
magnetic disturbance would also be a region of abnormal gravitational
attraction. An account of a suggested connection between anomalies
of these two kinds occurring in the same district has lately been pub-
lished by Dr. Fritsche.!

Observations made about thirty years ago by a former director of
the Astronomical Observatory in Moscow led to the conclusion that
throughout two large districts to the north and south of that city the
plumb line is deviated in opposite directions. The deflections from
the vertical are very considerable, and indicate a relative defect in the
attraction exerted by the rocks in the neighborhood of Moscow itself,
and the suggestion has been made that there is either a huge cavity—
a bubble in the earth crust—under the town, or that the matter beneath
it is less dense than that which underlies the surface strata on either
side at a distance of 10 or 12 miles.

As long ago as 1853 Captain Meyen made magnetic observations in
order to determine whether the same district is also the seat of any
magnetic irregularity. His stations were hardly sufficiently numerous
to lead to decisive results, but the magnetic elements have recently
been measured by Dr. Fritsche at thirty-one places within 50 miles of
Moscow. The experiments were all made within eleven days, so that
no correction for secular change is required. They indicate a locus of
magnetic attraction running through Moscow itself. South of the
town the disturbance again changes in direction so as to show either

dortigen Local-Attraction,” Bulletin de la Société Impér. des Naturalistes de Moscou,
1894, No. 4.
188 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

that repulsive forces are in play, or that there is another magnetic
ridge line still farther to the south. Dr. Fritsche thinks that these
observations explain the gravitational anomalies without recourse to
the somewhat forced hypothesis of a vast subterranean cave. He
assumes that there is a concealed mass of iron which approaches near to
the surface at Moscow and also along two loci to the south and north of
the city. He attributes the magnetic irregularities to the attraction
of the central iron hill, the deflections of the plumb line to the flanking
masses. It is perhaps not inconceivable that such results might follow
in a special case, but without the support of calculation it certainly
appears that the magnetic experiments point to the existence of the
principal attracting mass under the town. ‘This is in fact the arrange-
ment shown in the figure with which Dr. Fritsche illustrates his
hypothesis. If this is so, the theory would prima facie seem to require
that the bob of a plumb line should be attracted toward and not, as
is actually the case, away from the center of the magnetic disturbance.
On the whole, then, though the coexistence of large magnetic and
gravitational disturbances in the same place is suggestive, I do not
think that they have as yet been proved to be different effects of the
same hidden mass of magnetic matter.

In a few weeks an international geodetic conference will meet at
Innspruck, at which the Royal Society will be represented. | It is, I
believe, intended to extend the detailed investigation of the relations
between the nature of the earth’s crust and the gravitational and
magnetic forces to which it gives rise. We may therefore hope that
special attention will before long be given to localities where both
may combine to give information as to facts outside the range of the
ordinary methods of geology.

The second phenomenon on which more light is desirable is the per-
manent magnetization of magnetic rocks. It is known that fragments
of these are strongly but irregularly magnetized, but that the effect of
very large masses at a distance appears to be due to induced rather
than to permanent magnetism. There are three questions to which I
should like an answer: Are underground masses of magnetite ever
permanently magnetized? Are large areas of surface masses—say a few
hundred square yards in extent—ever permanently and approximately
uniformly magnetized in the same sense? Is there any relation between
the geological age and the direction of the permanent magnetism of
magnetic rocks?

Inquiries such as these can only be taken up by individual workers,
but I venture to think that the comparison of the observatory instru-
ments and the fluctuations of secular change outside the observato-
ries could best be investigated under the auspices of a great scientific
society. The cooperation of the authorities of the observatories will
no doubt be secured, but it is most important that the comparison

- TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 189

should in all cases be made with one set of instruments and by the
same methods. Whether the British Association, which for so long
managed a magnetic observatory, may think that it could usefully inau-
gurate the work it would be improper for me in a presidential address to
forecast. Who does it is of less importance than that it should be done,
and I can not but hope that the arguments and instances which I have
to-day adduced may help to bring about not only the doing of the work,
but the doing of it quickly.
PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY.!
By M. J. JANSSEN.

A dozen years ago I undertook to lay the foundations of a science
of photographic photometry, with special reference to its application
to astronomical physics. I applied the fundamental principle of my
researches—a principle to be restated below—to the measurement of
the comparative intensities of solar and lunar light, to that of the earth
light on the moon, to the radiating activity of the sun as compared
with several stars, notably Sirius, and finally to the law of decrement
of the light in passing away from the head along the tail of the comet
C of 1881, which had been photographed at Meudon, the first among
such bodies.

Perhaps these researches were not as energetically followed up by
me as they ought to have been, for their astronomical importance is
great, and they might have furnished valuable terms of comparison for
the future. But Ihave had the satisfaction of seeing the principle
adopted by the International Congress of Photometry for the measures
of photometric order for which they laid down the rules. In order
to renew attention to the subject, I here reproduce a résumé of my
researches, wishing that it may become the starting point of new inves-
tigations.

Photometry has to determine the ratio of intensities of two lights.
For example, to determine the ratio of luminosity of a candle and a
Carcel lamp is one problem of photometry, and to evaluate in Carcel
lamps the power of an electric source of luminous radiation is another.

We often have to make comparisons of this sort in the heavens. They
are always highly interesting and sometimes lead to beautiful discov-
eries. Thus, we know that the moon is an opaque ball not self-luminous,
but shining because lit up by the sun’s rays. Now, we may ask what
proportion of the incident light it remits, in what measure the surface
Shows specular reflection, and what is the relative amount of light of
the full moon as compared with that of the luminary from which its
rays are borrowed. Independent of the curiosity of such data in them-
Selves, it is clear that if the study of them is carried deep enough it
may lead to important conclusions relative to the nature of materials at
the surface of the moon.

So, also, the study of the planets would be advanced by photometric
observations which should afford a knowledge of the relations of their
surfaces and atmospheres to light.

A special importance attaches to photographic photometry in its
application to the fixed stars. The quantity of light a star sends us
depends chiefly on its distance and its radiating power, so that either
of these two factors being known the apparent light will determine the
other. Thus, if the parallax of a star and the amount of light which it
sends to us are known, we can deduce the intrinsic amount of its radia-
tion—that is to say, its rank among the hosts of suns with which the
spaces of heaven are sown. Add to this knowledge that of the qualities
of its light, and you will have a total from which the magnitude, the
constitution, and the activity of the luminary in question may be almost
completely defined.

Similar remarks apply to comets and nebule. Thus, celestial pho-
tometry constitutes one of the most important methods of astronomy;
and it is very interesting to see what aid it can derive from photog-
raphy. For this purpose I have employed a method which I proceed
to deseribe.! We know that in the common photometric method the
ratio of emission of the two sources of light is obtained by removing
the brighter of them until they each illuminate the shadow due to the
other equally. This is one of numerous methods not hitherto used in
photographic photometry. In a photograph, in order to judge of the
brightness of a luminous or illuminated body, we have nothing but
its photographic action, or the greater or less opacity of the metallic
deposit which it occasions on the sensitive film. Now, the blackness
of this deposit is very far from being proportional to the time of action
of the light. Could we see the deposit increase, and could we measure
its amount while the action of a steady light was going on, we should
find that it increased rapidly at first, and afterwards slower and slower,
until it became practically stationary. Thus, we can not take as meas-
ure of the intensity of a source of light the degree of opacity of the
metallic deposit which it occasions, since that opacity is not propor-
tional to its action during a determinate time. But if, in place of con-
sidering the different degrees of opacity in relation to equality of the
time of action, we consider on the contrary the variable time necessary
to obtain a deposit of one fixed opacity, we shall have a sure basis for
the comparisons, and this, in fact, appears from experiment.

The fact is, that to produce in a sensitive film a metallic deposit of
given blackness a certain sum of radiant action is needed, and whether
this sum is brought into existence in a longer or shorter time makes no
difference. Hence it follows that the energy of a source is increased
by the time necessary to effect the given degree of blackness—that is to
say, according to this principle, two sources are to one another inversely

1Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences, XCII, 1881, April 4. Annuaire du
Bureau des Longitudes for 1882.

PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY. 193

as the times they occupy in producing a given shade upon the same
sensitive film, or in other words, to produce equal photographic effects.

This is the principle I have adopted in my investigations into photo-
graphie photometry. I have assured myself experimentally of the
legitimacy of this principle by ascertaining the relative amounts of
time necessary to obtain tints of the same opacity on one sensitive film
placed at increasing distances of the source of light. It is found that
these times increase as the squares of the distances. Thus, for dis-
tances 1, 2,3, 4 - - - 8, ete., the times are in the ratio of 1, 4, 9,
16 - - - 64, ete. It is necessary to work with one and the same
film, to avoid all stray light, to develop the plates in one bath, and,
in a word, to use all precautions possible in order to establish this law.
We may also mention that to obtain the best results possible it is need-
ful to take care to choose the opacity which corresponds to the most
rapid variation which happens toward the beginning of the action.

Let us see how this method can be applied to the photometric study
of the heavenly bodies.

For a long time astronomers and physicists have sought to determine
the luminous intensity of the moon relatively to that of the sun.
Bouguer appears to be the one who came nearest to the truth. Employ-
ing a candle as middle term of the comparison, he found the light of
the full moon at its mean distance to be about 5595 of that of the
sun. The employment of a candle is open to criticism, because its light
is of a hue much warmer than that of the sun and still more so than
that of the moon—a circumstance which must have introduced peculiar
difficulties in making the photometric matchings of shades. Bouguer
would bave much improved his method had he subjected the candle-
light to the sifting action of a suitable blue glass, so as to brings its
color nearer to that of the lunar rays.

However that may be, it is remarkable that that old determination
agrees closely with the photographic measures which I obtained in
taking series of solar and lunar images and comparing the times of
exposure to which correspond photographs of the same intensity.' It
is to be further noticed that Bouguer’s determination refers to the
integral of visible rays, while the photographs are caused by more
refrangible rays.

One could only infer that the lunar rays are highly photographie and
have great intensity in the blue and violet. The hue of moonlight
might have enabled us to foresee that result.

The comparison of the light of the sun and moon speaks volumes in
regard to the admirable elasticity of our visual organ. When a country
is lit up by the full moon it only receives gz5s00 of the light of noon-

‘Instead of taking photographs of the luminaries themselves, we can also, as I
did at the time, avail ourselves of bands of successive intensity obtained by sun_
light and moonlight. Thus, for the moon, we exposed to its ight a holder whose
curtain uncovered successively and at equal intervals of time the different parts of
a sensitive plate, giving, after development, a series of bands of increasing opacity,
which were compared with a plate exposed to sunlight for 35; second.

day. One might suppose that such a prodigious lowering of the illumi-
nation would produce apparently total darkness. Yet our organ takes
on such increased sensibility under those circumstances that we can
not only find our way about, but distinguish objects, make out details,
and even enjoy the landscape. Nay, in some fine tropical regions bright
nights seem almost like day.

Before quitting the subject of the moon let us say a word about the
earth light. Everybody knows the appearance of ‘‘the new moon in
the old moon’s arms.” It is a faint light on the darker side of the moon
showing the main features, 1.e., the great ‘‘seas” or dark patches, to the
naked eye, and in a large telescope showing almost everything that can
be seen at full moon, though not so well as at other phases.

The genius of Lionardo (less correctly Leonardo) da Vinei divined
that the cause of this was the light reflected from the earth. Photo-
graphic photometry can give us the relative brightness of this light.
In an experiment made with a telescope of 0.50 meter aperture and 1.60
meters focal length I obtained an image of the lunar ball, rendered
visible by earth light in sixty seconds, showing the great accidents of
its surface. On the other hand, from a series of photographs of the full
moon it was found that one obtained by an exposure of one-eightieth
of a second had the same intensity. We infer that the ratio of intensity
of full earth light to sunlight at the moon’s surface is 55455. Arago had
found ;,55 In one observation, 559 in a subsequent one. The value
sop Seems probably nearer the truth. These determinations are to be
regarded as merely preliminary to a thorough study in which the situa-
tions of the three luminaries are to be taken account of and the specular
distinguished from irregular reflection from the earth.

Fixed stars in the focus of a telescope appear nearly like points, not
lending themselves advantageously to photometric comparisons, least
of all by the photographic method. Accordingly I have proposed,
instead of putting the sensitive plate in the focal plane of the instru-
ment to place it a little forward of that plane. In this way, instead of
a point each star makes a little disk bounded by the section of the
cone of rays from the objective by the plane of the film. With a well-
corrected lens this disk will be uniformly illuminated. I term this disk
the ‘stellar circle.” With first-magnitude stars and a telescope of mod-
erate size a few seconds suftice for obtaining such a photograph as is
most suitable. We can obtain on one and the same plate a series of
such circles of graduated exposures.

Forming a similar series with a second comparison star, the differ-
ences in the times off exposure being constant in each series, though
not quite equal in the two, it will only remain, after the development, to
pick out two circles, one from each series of equal intensities, just as
in reading a vernier we find two coincident lines. The photographie
luminosities of the two stars will be inversely as the times of exposure.

When the problem is to compare a.star with the sun a special device
is required on account of the enormous light of the latter, We cap

PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY. 195

then make use of the photographic photometer. Suppose we have a
holder fitting a sensitive plate, and over the latter a metallic shutter
pierced with holes of the size of the ‘stellar circles.” Before this plate
let a second plate move by virtue of a spring, this second plate having
a triangular window. When the window, in consequence of the action
of the spring, passes before the holes of the shutter it will determine
for each of them a photographic action, which will be measured by the
width of the triangular window at that point and by the velocity of
the slide, which can be evaluated by a tuning fork. Thus a series of
circles of graduated intensity will be obtained comparable with the
‘stellar circles.” These circles are due to direct sunlight. But to ren-
der the results more strictly comparable it will be proper to lay the tele-
scope objective down on the plate, so that the effects of absorption and
reflection may be the same as when the stars were photographed.

By this method, the results of which were duly reported to the
Academy of Sciences,' the radiating powers of several stars were inves-
tigated. In particular it was used to compare the light of our sun
with that of the brightest star in the heavens, the Dog Star, or Sirius.
It showed that that colossal orb had an intrinsic radiation in the pho-
tographic spectrum ten times that of the center of our planetary
system.

But it is especially when we wish to measure the luminosity of special
parts of an object, and are not content with knowing the total radia-
tion, that the advantages of the photographic method are manifested.
We have, for example, been able to evaluate the light of different parts
of the tail of comet 1881 b, and to give quite closely the law of the
decrease of that light as the distance from the nucleus increases.

The arrangement employed was as follows: On the photographic
plate, fitted into a holder, was placed a screen with an opening represent-
ing the comet’s tail. Before the apparatus was a shutter in which a trian-
gle had been cut out, having its base rectilinear, but its sides curved.
When this triangular window moved in the direction of the line of its
base the times of exposure of the different parts depended on the forms
of the curved sides. The whole base moved along that point of the
opening in the screen that represented the nucleus, while the vertex of
the triangle passed over the part of the opening representing the
extreme and evanescent portions of the tail. Here the time of exposure
vanished. In intermediate parts, say, at distance « from the base, the
time of exposure was proportional to the distance, 2y, from one side of
the triangle to the other along aline parallel to the base and to the motion.
A number of such shutters were constructed, the curves of the sides
being determined by one of the equations Ay=.2™, m having a constant
value for each shutter, but different values for different shutters. The
whole being exposed to uniform illumination and the shutter moved by
a spring an artificial figure of a comet was obtained with each shutter—

196 PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY.

that is, with each value of m. When m=2 the photographic action
would be inversely as the second power of the distance from the nucleus.
With m=3, it would be inversely as the third power, ete.

Now, the different pictures so obtained being compared with the
photograph of the real comet, it was found that the intensities could
best be matched in all parts by taking m between 4 and 6, so that the
result was that the intensity of the light in the comet’s tail, in the
photographic part of the spectrum, varied inversely as the fourth to
sixth power of the distance from the nucleus.' At such enormous rate
does the light diminish as we pass away from the nucleus.

The method of ‘stellar circles” comes into play again when we wish
to reproduce the conditions under which any celestial photograph has
been taken, especially in the study of nebule. A nebula is not an
object having a definite outline, like the sun, the moon, etc. Its image
is rather like a nimbus cloud, its different parts differing greatly in
brightness. The consequence is that differences in the power of the
telescope, the time of exposure, the sensitiveness of the film, the trans-
parency of the atmosphere, etc., result in pictures so different that they
sometimes would not be supposed to possibly represent the same thing.
If, for instance, a nebula has brilliant parts scattered in it, a photo-
graph with short exposure will show these parts only as isolated from
one another, while with a long exposure the intervening places will be
all filled up with little variation of intensity. In 1881 we obtained at
Meudon a series of photographs of the great nebula in Orion, which
show how surprisingly the aspect of that object may change with
greater or less exposure.

Nevertheless, if we wish to hand down to posterity monuments which
shall allow changes in the nebula to be put out of doubt, we must
contrive some way in which the photographs of future ages shall be
rendered comparable with those of to-day. Here the “stellar circles”
afford valuable assistance. Suppose that on the plate which has just
received the photographie impression of the nebula we form stellar
circles of some five stars, well chosen, not variable, and situated in the
neighborhood. Then we shall obtain, after the development, along
with the image of the nebula those of the stellar circles of comparison.
The ratios of the times of exposure of the nebula and the circles will
be carefully noted. Later, then, when the time comes to make a com-
parable photograph, we have only to ascertain the time of exposure
which, with a new telescope and a new photographic preparation, is
rane to produce stellar circles of the same diameter from the same
stars of equal intensity, and we find by the rule of three the time of
exposure requisite to obtain an equivalent photograph of the nebula.

It 1s remarkable that we can, by such device, obtain, after any lapse
of time, no matter how different all the conditions may have become, a
photeerepiies image altogether comparable with that of times gone by.

THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA.!

By Prof. A. M. WoRTHINGTON, M. A., F. B.S.

The splash of a drop is a transaction which is accomplished in the
twinkling of an eye, and it may seem to some that a man who proposes
to discourse on the matter for an hour must have lost all sense of pro-
portion. If that opinion exists, I hope this evening to be able to
remove it and to convince you that we have to deal with an exquisitely
regulated phenomenon, and one which very happily illustrates some
of the fundamental properties of fluids. It may be mentioned also
that the recent researches of Lenard, in Germany, and J. J. Thomson,
at Cambridge, on the curious development of electrical charges that
accompanies certain kinds of splashes have invested with a new
interest any examination of the mechanics of the phenomenon. It is
to the mechanical and not to the electrical side of the question that I
shali call your attention this evening.

The first well-directed and deliberate observations on the subject
that Iam acquainted with were made by a schoolboy at Rugby some
twenty years ago, and were reported by him to the Rugby Natural
History Society. He had observed that the marks of accidental
splashes of ink drops that had fallen on some smoked glasses with
which he was experimenting, presented an appearance not easy to
account for. Drops of the same size falling from the same height had
made always the same kind of mark, which when carefully examined
with a lens showed that the smoke had been swept away in a system
of minute concentric rings and fine strive. Specimens of such pat-
terns, obtained by letting drops of mercury, alcohol, and water fall onto
smoked glass, are thrown on the screen, and the main characteristics
are easily recognized. Such a pattern corresponds to the footprints of
the dance that has been performed on the surface, and though the
drop may be lying unbroken on the plate, it has evidently been taking
violent exercise, and were our vision acute enough we might observe
that it was still palpitating after its exertions.

A careful examination of a large number of such footprints showed
that any opinion that could be formed therefrom of the nature of the

motion of the drop must be largely conjectural, and it occurred to me
about eighteen years ago to endeavor by means of the illumination of
a suitably timed eleetrie spark to watch a drop through its various
changes on impact.

The reason that with ordinary continuous light nothing can be satis-
factorily seen of the splash is not that the phenomenon is of such short
duration, but because the changes are so rapid that before the image of
one stage has faded from the eye the image of a later and quite differ-
ent stage is superposed upon it. Thus the resulting impression is a con-
fused assemblage of all the stages, as in the photograph of a person
who has not sat still while the camera was looking at him. The prob-
jem to be solved experimentally was therefore this: To let a drop of
definite size fall from a definite height in comparative darkness onto a
surface, and to illuminate it by a flash of exceedingly short duration at
any desired stage, so as to exclude all the stages previous and sub-
sequent to the one thus picked out. The flash must be bright enough
for the image of what is seen to remain long enough on the eye for
the observer to be able to attend to it, even to shift his attention from
one part to another, and thus to make a drawing of what is seen. If
necessary the experiment must be capable of repetition, with an
exactly similar drop falling from exactly the same height, and illumi-
nated at exactly the same stage. Then, when this stage has been
sufficiently studied, we must be able to arrange with another similar
drop to illuminate it at a rather later stage, say one one-thousandth
second later, and in this way to follow step by step the course of the
whole phenomenon.

The apparatus by which. this has been accomplished is on the table
before you. Time will not suffice to explain how it grew out of earlier
arrangements very different in appearance, but its action is very simple
and easy to follow by reference to the diagram (fig. 1).

A A‘ isa light wooden rod rather longer and thicker than an ordi:
nary lead pencil, and pivoted on a horizontal axle, O. The rod bears
at the end A asmall deep watch glass, or segment of a watch glass,
whose surface has been smoked, so that a drop even of water will lie
on it without adhesion. The end A/ carries a small strip of tinned iron,
which can be pressed against and held down by an electro-magnet, CC’.
When the current of the electro-magnet is cut off the iron is released,
and the end A‘ of the rod is tossed up by the action of a piece of india
rubber stretched catapult-wise across two pegs at E, and by this means
the drop resting on the watch glass is left in mid-air free to fall from
rest.

B B’ is a precisely similar rod worked in just the same way, but car-
rying at B a small horizontal metal ring, on which an ivory timing
sphere of the size of a child’s marble can be supported. On cutting off
the current of the electro-magnet the ends A‘ and B’ of the two levers
are simultaneously tossed up by the catapults, and thus drop and sphere

begin to fall at the same moment. Before, however, the drop reaches
the surface on which it is to impinge, the timing sphere strikes a plate,
D, attached to one end of a third lever pivoted at Q, and thus breaks
the contact between a platinum wire bound to the underside of this
lever and another wire crossing the first at right angles. This action
breaks an electric current which has traversed a second electro-magnet,

F (fig. 2), and releases the iron armature N of the lever N P, pivoted
at P, thus enabling a strong spiral spring, G, to lift a stout Bice wire,
L, out of mereury, and to break at the surface of the mercury a strong
current that has cireulated round the primary circuit of a Ruhmkorft’s
induction coil; this produces at the surface of the mercury a bright

flash that the splash is viewed. The illumination is greatly helped by
surrounding the place where the splash and flash are produced by a
white cardboard inclosure, seen in fig. 2, from whose walls the light is
diffused.

It will be observed that the time at which the spark is made will
depend on the distance that the sphere has to fall before striking the
plate D, for the subsequent action of demagnetizing F and pulling the
wire L out of the mercury in the cup H is the same on each occasion.
The modus operandi is consequently as follows: The observer, sitting
in comparative but by no means complete darkness, faces the appa-
ratus as it appears in fig. 2, presses down the ends A’ B’ of the levers
first described, so that they are held by the electro-magnet C (fig. 1).

Then he presses the lever N P down on the electro-magnet F, sets the
timing sphere and drop in place, and then, by means of a bridge
between two mercury cups, short-circuits and thus cuts off the current
of the electro-magnet C. This lets off drop and sphere, and produces
the flash. The stage of the phenomenon that is thus revealed having
been sufficiently studied by repetition of the experiment as often as
may be necessary, he lowers the plate D a fraction of an inch, and
thus obtains a later stage. Not only is any desired stage of the phe-

nomenon thus easily brought under examination, but the apparatus
also affords the means of measuring the time interval between any two
stages. All that 1s necessary is to know the distance that the timing
sphere falls in the two cases. Elementary dynamics then give us the
interval required. Thus,if the sphere falls 1 foot and we then lower D
one-fourth of an inch, the interval between the corresponding stages
will be about 0.0026 second.

Having thus described the apparatus, which I hope shortly to show
you in action, I pass to the information that has been obtained by it.

This is contained in a long series of drawings, of which a selection will
be presented on the screen. The first series that I have to show repre-
sents the splash of a drop of mercury 0.15 inch in diameter that has
fallen 3 inches onto a smooth glass plate. (Plates II, III.) It will be
noticed that very soon after the first moment of impact minute rays are
shot out in all directions on the surface. These are afterwards over-
flowed or united, until, as in fig. 8, the outline is only slightly rippled.
Then (fig. 9) main rays shoot out, from the ends of which in some cases
minute droplets of liquid would spht off, to be left lying in a cirele on
the plate, and visible in all subsequent stages. By counting these drop-
lets when they were thus left, the number of rays was ascertained to
have been generally about twenty-four. This exquisite shell-hke con-
figuration shown in fig. 9, marks about the maximum spread of the
liquid, which, subsiding in the middle, afterwards flows into an annulus
or rim with a very thin central film, so thin, in fact, as often to tear
more or less irregularly. This annular rim then divides or segments
(figs. 14, 15, 16) in such a manner as to join up the rays in pairs, and
thus passes into the twelve-lobed annulus of fig.16. Then the whole
contracts, bat contracts most rapidly between the lobes, the liquid then
being driven into and feeding the arms, which follow more slowly. In
fig. 21 the end of this stage is reached, and now the arms continuing to
come in, the liquid rises in the center; this is, in fact, the beginning of
the rebound of the drop from the plate. In the case before us the drops
at the ends of the arms now break off (fig. 25), while the central mass
rises in a column which just fails itself to break up into drops, and falls
back into the middle of the circle of satellites which, it will be under-
_ stood, may in some cases again be surrounded by a second circle of the
still smaller and more numerous droplets that split off the ends of the
rays in fig. 9. The whole of the thirty stages described are accom-
plished in about one-twentieth of a second, so that the average interval
between them is about one six-hundredth of a second.

It should be mentioned that it is only in rare cases that the subordi-
nate drops, seen in the last six figures, are found lyimg in a very com-
plete circle after all is over, for there is generally some slight disturbing
lateral velocity which causes many to mingle again with the central
drop, or with each other. But even if only half or a quarter of the
circle is left, it is easy to estimate how many drops and therefore how
202 THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA.

many arms there have been. It may be mentioned that sometimes the
surface of the central lake of liquid (figs. 14, 15, 16, 17) was seen to be
covered with beautiful concentric ripples, not shown in the figures.

The question now naturally presents itself, Why should the drop
behave in this manner? In seeking the answer it will be useful to ask
ourselves another question. What should we have expected the drop
todo? Well, to this Ll suppose most people would be inclined, arguing
from analogy with a solid, to reply that it would be reasonable to expect
the drop to flatten itself, and even very considerably flatten itself, and
then, collecting itself together again, to rebound, perhaps as a column
such as we have seen, but not to form this regular system of rays and
arms and subordinate drops.

Now this argument from analogy with a solid is rather misleading,
for the forces that operate in the case of a solid sphere that flattens
itself and rebounds, are due to the bodily elasticity which enables it
not only to resist, but also to recover from any distortion of shape or
shearing of its internal parts past each other. But a liquid has no
power of recovering from such internal shear, and the only force that
checks the spread, and ultimately causes the recovery of shape is the
surface tension, which arises from the fact that the surface layers are
always in a state of extension and always endeavoring to contract.
Thus we are at liberty when dealing with the motions of the drop to
think of the interior liquid as not coherent, provided we furnish it with
a suitable elastic skin. Where the surface skin is sharply curved out-
ward, as it is at the sharp edge of the flattened disk, there the interior
liquid will be strongly pressed back. In fact the process of flattening
and recoil is one in which energy of motion is first expended in creat-
ing fresh liquid surface and subsequently recovered as the surface
contracts. The transformation is, however, at ail moments accom-
panied by a great loss of energy as heat. Moreover, it must be remem-
bered that the energy expended in creating the surface of the satellite
drops is not restored if these remain permanently separate. Thus the
surface tension explains the recoil, and it is also closely connected with
the formation of the subordinate rays and arms. To explain this it is
only necessary to remind you that a liquid cylinder is an unstable con-
figuration. As you know, any fine jet becomes beaded and breaks into
drops, but it is not necessary that there should be any flow of liquid
along the jet; if, for example, we could realize a rod of liquid of the
shape and size of this ruler and liberate it in the air, it would not retain
its cylindrical shape, but would segment or divide itself up into a row
of drops regularly disposed according to a definite and very simple
numerical law, viz, that the distances between the centers of contigu-
ous drops would be equal to the circumference of the cylinder. This
can be shown by calculation to be a consequence of the surface tension,
and the calculation has been closely verified by experiment. If the
liquid cylinder were liberated on a plate, it would still topple into a

SERIES |I—CONTINUED.

THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA. 203

regular row of drops, but they would be farther apart; this was shown
by Plateau. Now imagine the cylinder bent into an annulus. It will
still tollow the same law,! i. e., it will topple into drops just as if it were
straight. This I can show you by a direct experiment. I have here a
small thick disk of iron, with an accurately planed face and a handle
at the back. In the face is cut a circular groove, whose cross section
isa semicircle. I now lay this disk face downward on the horizontal
face of the lantern condenser, and through one of two small holes
bored through to the back of the disk I fill the groove with quick-
silver. Now, suddenly lifting the disk from the plate I release an annu-
lus of liquid, which splits into the circle of very equal drops which you
see projected on the screen. You will notice that the main drops have
between them still smaller ones, which have come from the splitting up
of the thin cylindrical necks of liquid which connected the larger drops
at the last moment.

Now, this tendency to segment or topple into drops, whether of a
straight cylinder or of an annulus, is the key to the formation of the
arms and satellites, and indeed to much that happens in all the splashes
that we shall examine. Thus in fig. 12 we have an annular rim, which
in figs. 13 and 14 is seen to topple into lobes by which the rays are
united in pairs, and even the special rays that are seen in fig. 9 owe
their origin to the segmentation of the rim of the thin disk into whieh
the liquid has spread. ‘The proceeding is probably exactly analogous
to what takes place in a sea wave that curls over in calm weather on
a slightly sloping shore. Anyone may notice how, as it curls over, the
wave presents a long smooth edge, from which at a given instant a
a multitude of jets suddenly shoot out, and at once the back of the
wave, hitherto smooth, is seen to be furrowed or **combed.” Phere can
be no doubt that the cylindrical edge topples into alternate convexities
and concavities; at the former the flow is helped, at the latter hin-
dered, and thus the jets begin, and special lines of flow are determined.
In precisely the same way the previously smooth circular edge of fig. 8
topples, and determines the rays and lines of flow of fig. 9.

Before going on to other splashes [ will now endeaver to reproduce
a mercury splash of the kind f have described, in a manner that shall
be visible to all. For this purpose I have reduplicated the apparatus
which you have seen, and have it here so arranged that I can let the
drop fall onto the horizontal condenser plate of the lantern, through
which the light passes upward, to be afterwards thrown upon this
screen. The illuminating flash will be made inside the lantern, where
the are light would ordinarily be placed. I have now set a drop of
mercury in readiness and put the timing sphere in place, and now if
you will look intently at the middle of the screen I will darken the
room and let off the splash. |The experiment was repeated four or

five times, and the figures seen were like those of Series X.| Of course
all that can be shown in this way is the outline, or rather a horizontal
section of the splash; but you are able to recognize some of the con-
figurations already described, and will be the more willing to believe
that a momentary view is after all sufficient to give much information
if one is on the alert and has acquired skill by practice. :

The general features of the splash that we have examined are not
merely characteristic of the liquid mercury, but belong to all splashes
of a liquid falling onto a surface which it does not wet, provided the
height of fall or size of the drop are not so great as to cause complete
disruption,' in which case there is no recovery and rebound. Thus a
drop of milk falling onto a smoked glass will, if the height of fall and
size of drop are properly adjusted, give forms very similar to those
presented by a drop of mercury. The whole course of the phenomenon
depends, in fact, mainly on four quantities only: (1) The size of the
drop; (2) the height of fall; (3) the value of the surface tension; (4)
the viscosity of the liquid.

The next series of drawings illustrates the splash of a drop of water
falling into water.

In order the better to distinguish the liquid of the original drop
from that into which it falls, the latter was colored with ink or with an
aniline dye, and the drop itself was of water rendered turbid with
finely divided matter in suspension. Finally, drops of milk were found
to be very suitable for the purpose, the substitution of milk for water
not producing any observable change in the phenomenon.

In Series If the drop fell 35 inches, and was one-fifth of an inch in
diameter. (Plate IV.)

[In most of the figures of this and of succeeding series the central
white patch represents the original drop, and the white parts round it
represent those raised portions of the liquid which catch the light.
The numbers at the side of each figure give the time interval in sec-
onds from the occurrence of the first figure, or of the figure marked
TT;

It will be observed that the drop flattens itself out somewhat, and
descends at the bottom of a hollow with a raised beaded edge (fig. 2).
This edge would be smooth and circular but for the mstability which
causes it to topple into drops. As the drop descends the hollow
becomes wider and deeper, and finally closes over the drop (fig. 3),
which, however, soon again emerges as the hollow flattens out, appear-
ing first near, but still below the surface (fig. 4),in a flattened, lobed
form, afterward rising as a column somewhat mixed with adherent
water, in which traces of the lobes are at first very visible.

The rising column, which is nearly eylindrical, breaks up into drops
before or during its subsequent descent into the liquid. As it disap-
pears below the surface the outward and downward flow causes a hollow
to be again formed, up the sides of which an annulus of milk is carried,
while the remainder descends to be torn again a second time into a
yortex ring, which, however, is liable to disturbance from the falling
in of the drops which once formed the upper part of the rebounding
column.

It is not difficult to recognize some features of this splash without any
apparatus beyona a cup of tea and a spoonfulof milk. Any drinker of
afternoon tea, after the tea is poured out and before the milk is put in,
may let the milk fall into it drop by drop from 1 or 2 inches above it.
The rebounding column will be seen to consist almost entirely of milk,
and to break up into drops in the manner described, while the vortex
ring, whose core is of milk, may be seen to shoot down into the liquid.
But this is better observed by dropping ink into a tumbler of clear
water.

Let us now increase the height of fall to 17 inches. Series HI
exhibits the result (Plate V). All the characteristics of the last splash
are more strongly marked. In fig. 1 we have caught sight of the little
‘aised rim of the hollow before it has beaded, but in fig. 2 special
channels of easiest flow have been already determined. The number
of ribs and rays in this basket-shaped hollow seemed to vary a good
deal with different drops, as also did the number of arms and lobes
seen in later figures, in a Somewhat puzzling manner, and I have made
no attempt to select drawings which are in agreement in this respect.
It will be understood that these rays contain little or none of the
liquid of the drop which remains collected together in the middle.
Drops from these rays or from the larger arms and lobes of subsequent
figures are often thrown off high into the air. In figs. 3 and 4 the drop
is clean gone below the surface of the hollow, which is now deeper and
larger than before. The beautiful beaded annular edge then subsides,
and in fig. 5 we see the drop again, and in fig. 6 it begins to emerge.
But although the drop has fallen from a greater height than in the
previous splash, the energy of the impact, instead of being expended
in raising the same amount of liquid to a greater height, is now spent
in lifting a much thicker adherent column to about the same height
asin the last splash. There was sometimes noticed, as is seen in fig. 9,
a tendency in the water to flow up past the milk, which, still compara-
tively unmixed with water, rides triumphant on the top of the emer-
gent column. The greater relative thickness of this column prevents
its splitting into drops, and figs. 10 and 11 show it descending below
the surface to form the hollow of fig. 12, up the sides of which an annu-
Jar film of milk is carried (figs. 12 and 13), having been detatched from
the central mass, which descends to be torn again, this time centrally
into a well-marked yortex ring. |
206 THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA.

If we keep to the same size of drop and increase the fall to some-
thing over a yard no great cbange occurs in the nature of the splash
but the emergent column is rather higher and thinner and shows a ten-
dency to split into drops.

When, however, we double the volume of the drop and raise the
height of fall to 52 inches, the splash of Series LV is obtained (Plate V1),
which is beginning to assume quite a different character. The raised
rim of the previous series is now developed into a hollow shell of con- |
siderable height, which tends to close over the drop. This shell or {
dome is a characteristic feature of all splashes made by large drops |}
falling from a considerable height, and is extremely beautiful. In the }
splash at present under consideration it does notalways succeed in closing
permanently, but opens out as it subsides, and is followed by the emer-
gence of the drop (fig. 8). In fig. 9 the return wave overwhelms the drop
for an instant, but itis again seen at the summit of the column in fig. 10.

But on other occasions the sheil or dome of figs. 4 and 5 closes per-
manently over the imprisoned air, the liquid then flowing down the sides,
which become thinner and thinner, till at length we are left with a large
bubble floating on the water (see Series V, Plate VII). It will be
observed that the flow of liquid down the sides is chiefly along definite
channels, which are probably determined by the arms thrown up at
an earlier stage. The bubble is generally creased by the weight of
the liquid along these channels. It must be remembered that the base |
of the bubble is in a state of oscillation, and that the whole is liable to
burst at any moment, when such figures as 6 and 7 of the previous series
will be seen.

Such is the history of the building of the bubbles which big rain-
drops leave on the smooth water of a lake, or pond, or puddle. It is
only the bigger drops that can do it, and reference to the number at
the side of fig. 5 of Series IV (Plate VI) shows that the dome is raised
in about two-hundredths of asecond. Should the domes fail to close, or
should they open again, we have the emergent columns which any
-attentive observer will readily recognize, and which have never been
better described than by Mr. R. L. Stevenson, who, in his delightful
Inland Voyage, speaks of the surface of the Belgian canals along which
he was canoeing, as thrown up by the rain into ‘an infinity of little
crystal fountains.”

Very beautiful forms of the same type indeed, but different in detail,
are those produced by a drop of water falling into the lighter and
more mobile liquid, petroleum.

It will now be interesting to turn to the splash that is produced
when a solid sphere, such as a child’s marble, fails into water.

I found to my great surprise that the character of the splash, at any
rate up to a height of fall of 4 or 5 feet, depends entirely on the state
of the surface of the sphere. A polished sphere of marble about 0.6 of
an inch in diameter, rubbed very dry with a cloth just beforehand and

dropped from a height of 2 feet into water, gave the figures of Series
VI (Plate VIII), in which it is seen that the water spreads over the
sphere so rapidly that it is sheathed with the liquid even before it has
passed below the general level of the surface. The splash is insignifi-
cantly small and of very short duration. If the drying and polishing
pe not so perfect, the configurations of Series VII (Plate VIII) are pro-
duced; while if the sphere be roughened with sandpaper, or left wet,
Series VIII (Plate VIII) is obtained, in which it will be perceived that,
as was the ease with a liquid drop, the water is driven away laterally,
forming the ribbed basket-shaped hollow, which, however, is now
prolonged to a great depth, the drop being followed by a cone of air,
while the water seems to find great difficulty in wetting the surface
completely. Part of this column of air was carried down at least 16
inches, and then only detached when the sphere struck the bottom of
the vessel.

Figs. 6 and 7 show the crater falling in, but this did not always hap-
pen, for the walls often closed over the hollow exactly as in figs. 4 and
5 of Series IV. Meanwhile the long and nearly cylindrical portion
below breaks up into bubbles which rise quickly to the surface.

By increasing the fall to 5 feet we obtain the figures of Series LX
(Plate 1X). The tube of fig. 1 corresponds to the dome of Series IV
and V, and is not only elevated to a surprising height, but is also in the
act of cleaving (the outline being approximately that of the unduloid
of M. Plateau). Figs. 2 and 3 show the bubble formed by the closing
up of this tube, weighed down in the center as in figs. 5 and 6 of Series
V. Similar results were obtained with other liquids, such as petroleum
and alcohol.

It is easy to show in a very striking manner the paramount influence
of the condition of the solid surface. I have here a number of similar
marbles. This set has been well polished by rubbing with wash leather.
I drop them one by one through a space of about 1 foot into this deep,
wide, cylindrical glass vessel, lighted up by a lamp placed behind it.
You see each marble enters noiselessly and with hardly a visible trace
of splash. Now I pick them out and drop them in again (or to save
trouble, I drop in these other wet ones) ; everything is changed. You
see how the air is carried to the very bottom of the vessel, and you
hear the “ giorafos” of the bubbles as they rise to the surface and burst.
These dry but rough marbles behave in much the same way.

Such are the main features of the natural history of splashes, as I
made it out between thirteen and eighteen years ago. Before passing
on to the photographs that I have since obtained, I desire to add a few
words of comment. I have not till now alluded to any imperfections
in the timing apparatus. But no apparatus of the kind can be abso-
lutely perfect, and, as a matter of fact, when everything is adjusted se
as to display a particular stage, it will happen that in a suecession of
observations there is a certain variation in what is seen, Thus the

configuration viewed may be said to oscillate slightly about the mean _
for which the apparatus is adjusted. Now this is due both to small |

imperfections in the timing apparatus and to the fact that the splashes
themselves do actually vary within certain limits. The reasons are not
very far to seek. In the first place the rate of demagnetization of the
electro-magnets varies slightly, being partly dependent on the varying
resistance of the contacts of crossed wires and partly on the tempera-
ture of the magnet, which is affected by the length of time for which
the current has been running. But a much more important reason igs
the variation of the slight adhesion of the drop to the smoked watch
glass that has supported it, and consequently of the oscillations to
which, as we shali see, the drop is subjected as it descends. Thus the
drop will sometimes strike the surface in a flattened form, at others in
an elongated form, and there will be a difference, not only in the time
of impact, but in the nature of the ensuing splash; consequently some
judgment is required in selecting a consecutive series of drawings.
The only way is to make a considerable number of drawings of each
stage and then to pick out a consecutive series. Now, whenever judg-
ment has to be used there is room for error of judgment, and moreover
it is impossible to put together the drawings so as to tell a consecutive
story, without being guided by some theory, such as I have already
sketched, as to the nature of the motion and the conditions that
govern it. You will therefore be good enough to remember that this
chronicle of the events of a tenth of a second is presented by a fallible
human historian, whose account, like that of any other contemporary
observer, will be none the worse for independent confirmation. That
confirmation I am fortunately able in some measure to supply. When
I endeavored eighteen years ago to photograph the splash of a drop
of mercury, I was unable to obtain plates sufficiently sensitive to
respond to the very short exposures that were required, and conse-
quently abandoned the attempt. But in recent years plates of exqui-
site sensitiveness have been produced, and such photographs as those
taken by Mr. Boys! of a flying rifle bullet have shown that difficulties
on the score of sensitiveness have been practically overcome. Within
the last few weeks, with the valuable assistance of my colleague at
Devonport, Mr. Rh. S. Cole, I have sueceeded in obtaining photographs
of various splashes. Following Professor bBoys’s suggestion, we
employed Thomas’s cyclist plates, or occasionally the less sensitive
“extra-rapid” plates of the same makers, and as a developer, eikono-
gen solution of triple strength, in which the plates were kept for about
forty minutes, the development being conducted in complete darkness.

A few preliminary trials with the self-induction spark produced at
the surface of mercury by the apparatus that you have seen at work
showed that the illumination, though ample for direct vision, was not

"sufficient for photography. When the current strength was inereased,
_ so as to make the illumination bright enough for the camera, then the
; Fepark became of too great duration, for it lasted for between four and
five thousandths of a second, within which time there was very per-
ceptible motion of the drop and consequent blurring. It was therefore
necessary to modify the apparatus so as to employ a Leyden-jar spark
whose duration was probably less than ten-millionths of a second. A
| very slight change in the apparatus rendered it suitable for the new
_eonditions, but time does not permit me to describe the arrangements
in detail. It is, however, less necessary to do so as the method is in
all essentials the same as that described in this room two years ago by
} Lord Rayleigh in connection with the photography of a breaking soap-
‘film. 1 I therefore pass at once to the photographs themselves.

The first two series (Plates X, XI) may be described as shadow photo-
_ graphs. They were obtained be allowing a drop of mercury to fall
onto the naked photographic plate itself, Fae illuminating spark being
produced vertically above it, and they give only a horizontal section of
the drop in various stages. The first series corresponds to a mercury
splash very similar to that first described, and the second to the splash
of alarger drop such as was not described. In each series the tearing
of the thin central film to which allusion was made is well illustrated.
a think the first comment that anyone would make is that the photo-
‘s graphs, while they bear out the drawings in many details, show greater
gt regularity than the drawings would have led one to expect. On this
point I shall presently have something to say.

_ Comparing the first set of drawings with the photographs of Series
X, it will be seen that photograph 2 corresponds to drawing 4 or 5
photograph 3 to that of 9; photograph 4 to that of 18; photograph 6
to that of 20, and photograph 7 to that of 24, but the irregularity of
the last photograph almost masks the resemblance.

Series XII (Plate XII) gives an objective view of a mercury splash as
taken by the camera. Only the first of this series shows any detail in the
interior. The polished surface of the mercury is, in fact, very trouble-
“some to illuminate, and this splash proved the most diffieult of all to
‘photograph.

' Series XIII (Plate XIII) shows the splash of a drop of milk falling
ato a smoked-glass plate, on which it runs about without adhesion,
just as mercury would. Here there is much more of detail. In fig. 4
the central film is so thin in the middle that the black plate beneath it
is seen through the liquid. In fig. 8 this film has been torn.

_ Series XIV (Plates XIV, XV) exhibits the splash of a water drop
falling into milk. The first four photographs show the oscillations of
the drop about a mean apher ical figure as it approaches the surface.

In the subsequent figures it will be noticed that the arms which are
thrown up at first afterward segment into drops which fly off and sub-
side (fig. 8), to be followed by a second series which again subside
(fig. 11), to be again succeeded by a third set. In fact, so long as there
is any downward momentum the drop and the air behind it are pene-
trating the liquid, and so long must there be an upward flow of dis- |
placed liquid. Much of this flow is seen to be directed into the arms |
along the channels determined by the segmentation of the annular.
rim. This reproduction of the lobes and arms time after time, on a/
varying scale, goes far to explain the puzzling variations in their}
number which I mentioned in connection with the drawings. I had |
not, indeed, suspected this, which is one of the few new points that the }
photographs have so far revealed. |

With respect to these photographs,! the credit of which I hope you |
will attribute, first, to the inventors of the sensitive plates, and, second, |
to the skill and experience of Mr. Cole, I desire to add that they are, as |
far as we know, the first really detailed objective views that have been |
obtained with anything approaching so short an exposure.

Even Mr. Boys’s wonderful photographs of flying bullets were after |
all but shadow photographs, and did not so strikingly illustrate the |
extreme sensitiveness of the plates, and I want you to distinguish
between such and what (to borrow Mr. F. J. Smith’s phrase) I call an |
‘“objective view.”

It remains only to speak of the greater irregularity in the arms and |
rays as shown by the photographs. The point is a curious and inter- |
esting one. In the first place, I have to confess that in looking over,
my original drawings I find records of many irregular or unsymmet-
rical figures, yet in compiling the history it has been inevitable that
these should be rejected, if only because identical irregularities never
recur. Thus the mind of the observer is filled with an ideal splash— !
an ‘“auto-splash”—whose perfection may never be actually realized.

But in the second place, when the splash is nearly regular it is very |
difficult to detect irregularity. This is easily proved by projecting on)
the screen with instantaneous illumination such a photograph as that |
of Series X, fig.6. My experience is that most persons pronounce what {
they have seen to be a regular and symmetrical star-shaped figure, and |
they are surprised when they come to examine it by detail in continuous |
light to find how far this is from the truth. Especially is this the case:
if no irregularity is suspected beforehand. I believe that the observer,
usually finding himself unable to attend to more than a portion of the
rays in the system, is liable instinctively to pick out for attention a part |

idea than can be gathered from the engravings of the amount of detail actually !

lampblack carried down by the drop from the smoked surface on which it rested,

of the circumference where they are regularly spaced and to fill up the
rest in imagination, and that where a ray may be really absent he prefers
to consider that it has been imperfectly viewed.

This opinion is confirmed by the fact that in several cases I have been
able to observe with the naked eye a splash that was also simultaneously
photographed, and have made the memorandum “ quite regular,” though
the photograph subsequently showed irregularity. It must, however,
be observed that the absolute darkness and other conditions necessary
for photography are not very favorable for direct vision.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.!

By HARVEY W. WILEY.

One of the greatest of the practical problems presented for solution
by agricultural chemistry is the conservation of plant food. With an
abundance of plant food and a favoring climate, it is difficult to place a
limit to the power of the earth for supporting life. We have read much
in political economy of the limit of subsistence, and one bold philoso-
pher has based a theory of the limitation of the number of human
beings upon the earth on the insufficiency of the earth to support a
greater number. Happily, however, the Malthusian philosophy was
promulgated before the days of that great agricultural renaissance
which has been brought about chiefly through the efforts of experimen-
tal agricultural chemistry. Iam not so blinded by the achievements
of agricultural chemistry as to deny to many other branches of science
an important and, in many cases, necessary influence in this develop-
ment of agricultural science; but [ think every candid man will admit
that in this development chemistry has always taken the front rank
and led the way. This is preeminently true of the investigations into
the nature and extent of the plant food available on the surface of the
earth. :

In this country, owing to the great stores of wealth which the past
had accumulated in the soil, it is only within recent years that the
question of the supply of plant food has assumed any practical impor-
tance. As long as there were virgin fields at the disposal of the agri-
cultural rapist, the conservation and restoration of exhausted fields
were of little consequence. The result has been that the wealth of
hundreds or perhaps thousands of years slowly stored in the soil has
been poured forth in a century, not only for the enrichment of this
country but for the benefit of all countries. Unfortunately, or fortu-
nately, these stores are now practically explored and there is little left.
in this land of virgin fertility to tempt the farmer to new conquests.
Not only have these stores of plant food been utilized but, much to the
discredit of the American farmer, they have been wasted. The mark
of good agriculture is to see fields yielding annually good returns and

increasing, or at least not lessening, in fertility. This being true, the
history of American agriculture to within a few years must be the his-
tory of bad farming, for everywhere we have seen fertile fields losing
their fertility and farms once productive abandoned. No difference
how great the store may be, if it be continually drawn upon and never
replenished the day will sometime come when it will be exhausted.
This day has come to a large portion of the agricultural lands of this
country, and to-day there is an awakening everywhere in regard to the
best methods of checking the waste and of restoring what has been
lost.

1 desire for a brief period, on this occasion, to call the attention of
the chemists of this country to some of the methods by which plant
food is removed from the fields and some of the direct and indireet ways
in which it is and may be returned. On a former occasion! I have dis-
cussed the extent to which plant food is removed from the soil direetly
in the crops and the dangers which arise to an agricultural community
which continually exports its agricultural products. On that occasion
1 pointed out the amount of potash, phosphorie acid, and nitrogen per
acre annually removed by the crops of the United States, and showed
that the only safe agricultural products to send out of a country were
sugar, oil, and cotton. It is true that with native, unexhausted soils a
country may acquire great wealth by agricultural exports, but the his-
tory of the world shows that a country which depends for its wealth
and its commerce on agricultural exportation is in the end reduced to
pauperism. A single example may serve to accentuate this remark; I
refer to the island of Cyprus, which two thousand years ago was the
granary of many cities bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. Supply-
ing hundreds of thousands of people with corn, it gradually became
impoverished, and to-day its soils are perhaps the poorest of any known.

The waste to which I desire to call your attention to-day is not that
which normally takes place in the production of a crop, but that which
is incidental to the cultivation of the soil and to a certain extent
unavoidable. My purpose is to develop, if it be possible, the relations
of agricultural chemistry to this waste, with the purpose of pointing out
a course by which it ean be returned and in what way we may at least
reduce to a minimum the unavoidable removal of valuable plant food.
You have all, perhaps, surmised the character of this waste; I refer to
the denudation of fields by water and to the removal of soluble plant
food by the percolation of water through the soil.

The losses due to the denudation of fields are purely of a mechanical
character. The natural forest, or the natural covering of grass over an
area of soil, prevents to a large extent the denudation due to heavy
downpours of rain. The removal of the forest and the destruction of
the grass by cultivation leave the soil in a condition in whieh it is

unable to resist the action of flowing surface water. The muddy
character of the water in all streams bordering on cultivated hilly fields
after a heavy rain storm is a familiar instance of the tremendous
energies which are exerted by a heavy downpour of rain in the carrying
of the soil into the streams and its transportation toward the sea.

It is not necessary to emphasize the fact that the agricultural chemist
is practically powerless to prevent the surface erosion due to heavy
rains, but afew practical lessons derived from the application of chemical
discoveries to the soils show how, in a certain measure, even surface
erosion may be controlled, or at least reduced to a minimum by the
application of the principles of culture founded upon the facts disclosed
by advanced science.

The observing agriculturist will have noticed that even in a hilly
country a soil in situ underlaid by limestone is less likely to be eut up
by gullies than a soil similarly situated and deficient in carbonate of
lime. The reason of this is plain. In a soil deficient in lime the clays
when once brought into suspension by moving water assume a semi-
colloid state and remain indefinitely in suspension. Clays, on the other
hand, which are heavily impregnated with lime salts are in a floceu-
lated state, and the larger aggregates thus produced settle quickly.
The result of this is that such a soil is less easily moved by water, and
a field thus treated less exposed to washing by heavy rains.

Our knowledge of flocculation and its physical and chemical results
is due largely to the investigations of Shulze, Schloesing, and Hilgard,
and the results of their researches have shown in a most emphatic way
the beneficial changes which take place, especially in stiff clay soils, by
the application of lime.

It is thus an incontrovertible fact that the surface washing of eulti-
vated fields, especially if they be naturally deficient in lime, could be
greatly diminished and has been greatly diminished by the free appli-
eation of this substance.

The change in the physical condition of the soil, which is produced
by the lime, is also another important factor worthy of consideration.
A stiff clay soil is almost impervious to the penetration of surface
water and thus the amount which is carried off is raised to a maximum.
A well-limed soil, on the contrary, in which the particles are perfectly
flocculated, is much more pervious and the amount of water which will
be retained and delivered gradually to vegetable growth is much
greater. Thus the beneficial effects of lime are manifested in both
ways—in the better retention of the flocculated clays and in increas-
ing the capacity of the soil for holding a given amount of water in its
interstitial spaces.

There are many other salts which also have the same properties as
those of lime, but I have spoken of lime salts chiefly because they are
cheaper and therefore more economically applied. Perhaps next to
lime, common salt would be the most efficient in producing the results
already described; but common salt being extremely soluble would
216 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.

soon be leached out of a soil. On the other hand, lime, even when sup-
plied as hydrate, in which case it is somewhat soluble, quickly becomes
converted into a carbonate which is practically insolubie in water which
does not contain an excess of carbon dioxide.

I am aware of the fact that liming to prevent erosion by surface
drainage has not been emphasized as an example of the benetit of the
proper chemical treatment of soils, yet I feel sure that all who will give
the subject a thoughtful consideration will agree with me in saying that
this aspect of the subject is one of no small importance, especially
when considered in respect of hilly fields, and even of fields of more
level surface.

Without dwelling long upon this point, itis only necessary to call
your attention to the immense quantities of soil material annually con-
veyed to the sea by the causes of erosion already mentioned to show
what an active and powerful foe the farmer has in this source of loss.
Anyone who watches, even for a short time, the volume of water carried
by the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico will have a most effective
object lesson in regard to this source of loss.

A more striking lesson may be seen in the hill regions bordering
both banks of the Ohio River. Hundreds of fields once covered with
sturdy forests of oak, maple, and walnut, and afterward bearing large
crops of maize, tobacco, and wheat, may now be seen furrowed with
gullies, as with the wrinkles of age, and abandoned to brush and briers.
The same is doubtless true of other hill regions, but I speak the more
advisedly of those which have come under my personal observation.

Great, however, as the mechanical loss of plant food is, it is by no
means as dangerous as the loss of the soluble materials caused by the
percolation of the water through the soil, The study of the nature of
the loss of these soluble materials, together with the estimation of
their amount, forms the subject of lysimetry. Agricultural chemists
have used many devices for the purpose of determining the character
and amount of the natural drainage of soils. Evidently the treatment
of a specially prepared portion of soil by any solvent, although giving
interesting results, does not indicate the natural course of solution.
The only way in which this can be determined is to be able to collect,
measure, and study the character of the drainage from a given portion
of the arable surface of the earth in situ and under normal conditions.
Various methods of lysimetric investigation have been proposed and
used, all of them possessing many points of value.

An excellent system of such observation has been established, for
instance, at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Indiana. It is not
my purpose, however, to discuss the mechanical details of lysimetry,
but only to eall your attention to the main principles which underlie it.
The movement of water near the earth’s surface is a matter of especial
interest to agriculturists. Whitney! has clearly pointed out that the

No. 4.

little excess or deficiency of water is of far more importance to the
growing crop than the quantity of the excess or deficiency of its other
foods. Soils richest in plant food will produce a small harvest if there
be a great excess or deficiency of water, while soils which are poor in
plant food will produce an abundant crop if the water be present in
proper amounts and have proper and timely access to the rootlets of
the plant. The study, therefore, of the water movement in the soil,
whether laterally, upward, or downward, is of the utmost practical
importance. The methods of a study of this kind have been well estab-
lished by King.!

The plant food of the soil, it is well understood, only has access to
the absorbent organs of the plant when presented in a proper soluble
or semisoluble form in connection with water. From a chemical stand-
point, in connection with the subject under discussion, the movement
of water in the soil should be considered in connection, not alone with
its power of dissolving plant foods, but with especial reference to its
power of carrying them not only away from the reach of the roots of the
plant, but even out of the field and into the streams and rivers and
eventually into the sea. For our present purpose, therefore, we have
only need to examine lysimetric observations for the purpose of deter-
mining the kinds of plant food which are most exposed to waste. It
is not my purpose to take your time here with a vast array of figures,
but I desire only to call your attention to the fact that of the chief
plant foods potash and the nitrates are the ones which are most
exposed to loss.

The earliest systematic investigations of the quantity and composi-
tion of drainage were commenced at the Rethamsted Station by Lawes
and Gilbert,” in 1870. Lysimeters were constructed for the collection
of the drainage water from 30, 40, and 60 inches depth of soil, respect-
ively, the soil and subsoil being kept in the natural state of aggregation.

Lawes and. Gilbert call attention to the fact that probably at the
Rothamsted Station not more than 5 pounds of nitrogen are secured
per acre each year from the atmosphere and the rain water, while the
average loss of nitrogen through the drainage water is over 30 pounds
per acre. The quantity of course varies with the amount of rainfall
and the activity of nitrification. They speak of the possible exaggera-
tion of the loss of nitrogen on account of the fact that the air had
access to the soil both from below and above, and therefore the process
of nitrification where the lysimeters were placed might have been
intensified.

Among the latest researches on this subject are those of Deherain.*
It is pointed out by this author that the character of the crop grown
upon the cultivated field has much to do with the determination of the

218 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.

loss of nitrogen per acre. Those crops which require an immense
amount of moisture for their growth, such as the sugar beet, would
tend thereby to prevent the loss of nitrogen in the drainage waters, the
nitrates being stored in the beet instead of being given up to percola-
tion. In general, it may be said that it is the quantity of the drainage
water rather than its richness in nitrates which determines the total
loss Cue to percolation, and from this it may be inferred that the loss
by drainage is directly proportional to the rainfall and inversely pro-
portional to the magnitude of the harvest. The season at which the
greatest loss takes place is also, therefore, the one in which the growth
of the plant is the least vigorous, provided that the vigor of nitrifiea-
tion and quantity of rainfall remain the same. When plants grow
vigorously and when they occupy the soil for a long time, the losses
due to drainage are reduced to a minimum. On the other hand, with
plants which rapidly ripen, so that the harvest follows soon after the
sowing, the losses are greater. The farmer, therefore, who suffers a fail-
ure of his crop, not only loses from the smallness of the harvest, but
also by the percolation of the water through the soil. For this reason
it is obvious that leaving fields fallow is a very dangerous proceeding.
Deherain found that fallow fields during the season lost as high as 50
kilograms of nitrogen per hectare, corresponding to 330 kilograms of
nitrate of soda, worth 76 franes. These figures show plainly the mag-
nitude of the losses which take place in the one item of nitrogen alone,
due to the percolation of rain water through the soil.

In this connection it may be of interest again to refer to the favorable
action of lime in a great many soils in regard to its power of increas-
ing the ability of a soil to hold the soluble plant foods against their
removal by water. This favorable action is particularly manifested in
many soils in the power of lime to increase their capacity for holding
potash.

Warington explains this action of the lime salts, especially the ear-
bonate, by suggesting that by combining with the acids of certain salts,
as the carbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates, they allow the
bases of these salts to unite with the hydrated metallic oxides. The
carbonate of lime also converts the soluble acid phosphates, applied in
manure, to the sparingly soluble calcium phosphates, which, as they
gradually enter into solution, are converted into ferric and aluminic
phosphates. An admirable description of the absorptive power of soils
has been given by Warington,! and many other authors have also dis-
cussed this matter in detail.

We can see from the data given above how’water continually acts
upon a soil in the removal of certain soluble plant foods. It might be
inferred from this that all arable soils exposed continually to rains
would soon be exhausted of all valuable soluble plant food. But it has
also been pointed out how certain constituents of the soil have a faculty

'Practice with Science, page 2.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 219

of absorbing and retaining materials which are soluble in water under
ordinary conditions. It must not be forgotten also that the rain water
which descends upon the earth is not pure. Rain water brings to the
earth a certain amount of valuable plant food. Not only does it absorb
and hold in solution ammonia and nitric acid, which may be formed by
the electrical discharges in the air, but it also collects and brings to
the surface of the earth vast quantities of meteoric dust containing
valuable fertilizing principles. Thus we have constantly entering the
soil water which contains more or less of the materials necessary to
plant growth. Even the drainage waters, which leave an arable field,
may not reach the sea without giving up much of this material. The
drainage waters in passing underneath the earth’s surface take devious
courses and are often brought near to the surface again or are poured
upon soils which are quite different in their texture from those fur-
nishing the materials in solution. Sterry Hunt! has pointed out how
such waters sooner or later come upon permeable strata by which they
are absorbed and in their subterranean circulation undergo impor-
tant changes. Especially when these waters reach argillaceous strata
their content of neutral, soluble salts may suffer great changes. Such
waters, charged with organic and mineral materials, contain, usually,
large amounts of potassium salts and notable quantities of silica and
phosphates and in many cases ammoniated salts and nitrites or nitrates.

The experiments of Way, Voelcker, and others have shown that in
contact with argillaceous sediments these waters give up their potash,
ammonia, Silica, phosphoric acid, and organic matter, which remain in
combination with the soil; on the other hand, soda, magnesia, sulphuric
acid, and chlorine are not removed from the drainage waters. Eichorn
attributes this power of selective absorption in the soil chiefly to the
action of hydrated double aluminum silicates, and supposes that the
process is one of double exchange, equivalents of lime or soda being
given up for the potash retained. By this power of selective absorption
the mineral matters required for the growth of plants tend to be retained
in most soils, while those not required for the growth of plants are
removed. Nevertheless, much of the valuable mineral material i solu-
tion must escape absorption and finally find its way into the streams,
rivers, and seas.

From the foregoing summary of the methods of waste of plant food
it has been seen that in spite of all the precautions of the farmer and
the chemist, and in spite of the selective absorption of the soil, immense
quantities of valuable plant food are carried into the sea, where appar-
ently they are lost to agriculture forever. But this is only an apparent
loss. The economies of nature are so happily adjusted as to provide a
means of gradually returning in some form or other to the power of the
farmer the plant food which has been apparently destroyed. It is true
that this return will probably not be to the locality where the waste

originally occurred, and it may not take place until after the lapse of
thousands of years, but this is of no consequence. Provided arable
lands in general receive in some way and at some time a certain return
for the plant food removed, it is entirely immaterial whether this be
the original plant food removed or other equally as good.

The sea is the great sorting ground into which all this waste material
is poured. The roller processes of nature, like the mills of the gods,
grind exceedingly slow and small, and the sea becomes the bolting
cloth by which the products of milling are separated and sorted out.
As soon as this waste material is poured into the sea, the process of sort-
ing at once begins. The carbonate of lime becomes deposited in vast
layers, or by organic life is transformed into immense coral formations
or into shells. Phosphoric acid is likewise sifted out into phosphatic
deposits or passes into the organic life of the sea. Even the potash,
soluble as it is, becomes collected into mineral aggregates or passes
into animal or vegetable growth. All these valuable materials are thus
conserved and put into a shape in which they may be returned sooner
or later to the use of man. In the great cosmic economy there is no
such thing as escape from usefulness of any valuable material.

Sterry Hunt! has called especial attention to this sifting and sorting
power of water and the important part it plays in the formation of
crystalline rocks. ‘Igneous fusion,” he says, ‘destroys the mineral
species of the crystalline and brings them back as nearly as possible to
the great primary and undifferentiated material. This is the great
destroyer and disorganizer of mineral as well as of organic matter. Sub-
terranean heat in our time, acting on buried aqueous sediments, destroys
carbonates, sulphates, and chlorides with the evolution of acidic gases
and the generation of basic silicates, and thus repeats in miniature the
conditions of the anteneptunian chaos. On the other hand, each mass
of cooling igneous rock in contact with water begins anew the form-
ative process. The hydrated amorphous product palagonite is, if we
may be allowed the expression, a sort of silicated protoplasm, and by
its differentiation yields to the solvent action of water the crystalline
silicates which are the constituent elements of the crenitic rocks, leay-
ing at the same time a more basic residuum abounding in magnesia
and iron oxide and soluble not by crenitic but subaerial action.”

Let me call attention, for a few moments, to some of the more impor-
tant ways, pointed out through the researches of agricultural chemists,
in which these waste products are restored. We are inclined to look
upon the sea as devoid of vegetable growth, but the gardens of the sea
are no less fully stocked with economic plants than the gardens of the
land, The seaweeds of all genera and species are constantly separat-
ing valuable materials from the waters of the ocean and placing them
again in organic form. Many yearsago Forchhammer? pointed out the

agricultural value of certain fucoids. Many chemists have contrib-
uted important data in regard to the composition of these bodies.
Jenkins! gives analyses of several varieties of seaweed, showing that
in the green state it is quite equal to stall manure. The farmers are
said to pay as high as 5 cents a bushel for it. Goessmann? also gives
analyses of several varieties of seaweed. We are indebted, however,
to the reports of Wheeler and Hartwell*® for the fullest and most sys-
tematic discussion of the agricultural value of seaweeds which has
been published. Their interesting and elaborate report was published
in January, 1893. Those who are interested in the details of this work
can find all known publications on the subject properly arranged, elas-
sified, and studied in the publication mentioned. We learn from this
publication that seaweed was used as a fertilizer as early as the fourth
century, and its importance for this purpose has been recognized more
and more in modern days, especially since chemical investigations
have shown the great value of the food materials contained therein.

To show the commercial importance of seaweed as a fertilizer it is
only necessary to call attention to the fact that in 1885 its value for
use in the State of Rhode Island was $65,044, while the value of all
other commercial fertilizers was only $164,133. While seaweed, in a
sense, can only be successfully applied to littoral agriculture, yet the
extent of agricultural lands bordering on the sea is so great as to ren-
der the commercial importance of the matter of the highest degree of
interest.

It is not my intention here to enter into the discussion of the meth-
ods of preparing the seaweed, the times at which it should be gath-
ered, and the best means of applying it to the soil. These matters are
all thoroughly discussed by Wheeler and Hartwell in the publication
mentioned. As an instance of the value of seaweed at a point far
removed from the Rhode Island coast, I may be permitted to say that
near the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River, at the town of Fort Mey-
ers, I saw the most happy effects produced in intensive culture by the
application of seaweed alone to the sandy soils bordering on this arm
of the sea. Dr. Washburn, of the Florida Experiment Station, was
conducting the experiments to which I refer, and he spoke in the high-
est terms of the value of the seaweed in his work. Thousands of tons
of this seaweed are allowed to go to waste annually along these shores,
simply because the agriculturist has not been informed in regard to its
fertilizing value.

There are many other uses for seaweed besides the agricultural one,
but in these we are not much interested except incidentally. Many of
the varieties of sea grass are used for filling mattresses, cushions, ete.
Other varieties are burned and their ashes used for the manufacture

of soda, iodine, and bromine. ‘The gelatinous portions of seaweeds
become exceedingly hard and elastic upon being dried, and have been
moulded into various forms as substitutes for horn and shells in making
handles for knives, files, and other tools. In the Techno-Chemical
Receipt Book, on page 177, may be found receipts for making artificial
ebony from the charcoal obtained from seaweeds, also for making
leather, soap, and glue. For the latter purpose the plants are dried
and powdered, extracted with warm water, with or without the addition
of aleohol. The solution is allowed to settle at a temperature of 120° F.
When cool it forms a jelly, which is used for various purposes. The
direction is then given for making transparent seaweed leather, opaque
seaweed leather, seaweed soap, and seaweed glue. «

No attempt can be made to give the quantities of seaweed which are
annually cast upon the shores of the different continents. Perhaps
Rhode Island is no more favored in this respect than any other locality,
and we have seen the value of the seaweed which was gathered for
agricultural purposes in that State alone. The amount gathered rep-
resents only a very small fraction of the amount which was thrown
upon the shores. It is easy therefore to conclude that the quantities
of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash annually removed from the
seas by the plants living therein are no less great in magnitude than
those removed from the land by crops and plants of all kinds.

But seaweed and other vegetable products of the sea are not the
only vehicles in which the plant food in solution in the waters of the
ocean may be returned to the uses of man. ‘The animal life of the ocean
is not less important than that of the land. In the animal economy of
the ocean are gathered, therefore, immense quantities of valuable food
material which are thus placed in a condition to be at least in part
restored in the form of food. Relatively, phosphoric acid and nitrogen
are restored in much greater quantities than potash. The composition
of fish in general shows that relatively larger quantities of phosphoric
acid and nitrogen are found than of fat and potash. ‘The chemical
composition of the nutritive portion of fishes has been thoroughly
investigated by Atwater.!

The percentage of phosphoric acid in the flesh of American fishes in
its fresh state is about one-half of 1 per cent. In one instance, that of
smelt, Atwater found 0.81 per cent in the flesh of the fish. In the water-
free substance of the flesh the percentage of phosphoric acid in round
numbers is 2.5. In the case of the smelt, above mentioned, it amounted
to 5.49 per cent. When it is considered that the bones and other refuse
of the fish, presumably richer in phosphoric acid than the flesh, were
not included in this investigation, the quantity of phosphoric acid in
fish is distinctly brought to view.

1¢’The chemical composition and nutritive values of food fish and acquatic Ver-
tebrates,” by W. O. Atwater. Report of the United States Commissioner of Fish
and Fisheries 1888, pages 679-868.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 223

The quantity of albuminoids in the water-free substance of the flesh
of fish is enormously high as compared with that of ordinary foods. In
round numbers it may be said to be about 75 per cent of the total water-
free substance. In some cases the albuminous matter, or in other words
the protein, makes up almost the whole of the water-free substance, as
in the case of a brook trout, quoted by Atwater, in which the percent-
age of protein in the dry flesh was 93.25; and of a perch,in which it
was 93.33; and of asea bass, in which it was 95.88; and a red snapper,
in which it was 95.38, and others in which even a higher percentage
was reported,

It is thus seen that the ordinary fishes of the ocean collect especially
the two great elements of plant food, phosphorus and nitrogen.

Oysters and other shellfishes collect not only large quantities of
phosphorus and nitrogen, but also larger quantities of carbonate of
lime. As has been intimated in another place, it is entirely probable
that in earlier times, when the sea was richer in phosphorie acid than
at present, considerable quantities of phosphate of lime may have been
secreted with the carbonate of lime in the,shell. At the present. time,
however, the phosphate of lime has almost or quite disappeared from
the matters of which shells are composed.

While the art of fishing is practiced chiefly for the purpose of gaining
human food, yet in many large fishing districts the fish waste becomes
valuable fertilizing material. Some kinds of fish, as the menhaden, are,
however, collected chiefly for their fertilizing value. The use of fish
for fertilizing purposes is not new. A most interesting description of
the use of agricultural fertilizers by the American Indians is given by
Goode.' Aslong agoas 1875 the value of the nitrogen derived from the
menhaden was estimated to be about $2,000,000. In the year 1878 it is
estimated that 200,000 tons of menhaden were captured between Cape
Henry and the Bay of Fundy. The oilis first extracted from the fish for
commercial purposes and afterward the residue is dried and ground and
sold to farmers and fertilizer manufacturers. For a complete history
of the menhaden the articles of Prof.G. Brown Goode in the Report of
the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for 1877 and 1879
may be consulted.

The honor of teaching the American colonists the use of artificial
fertilizers belongs, without doubt, to an Indian named Squanto. In
Governor Bradford’s History of Plimouth Plantation is given an
account of the early agricultural experiences of the Plymouth colo-
nists. In April, 1621, at the close of the first long, dreary winter, “they
(as many as were able) began to plant their corne, in which service
Squanto (an Indian) stood them in great stead, showing them both ye
manner how to set it, and after how to dress and tend it. Also he tould
them, axcepte they got fish and set with it (in these old grounds) it
would come to nothing; and he showed them yt in ye middle of ae

24 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.

they should have store enough come up ye brooke by which they begane
to build and taught them how to take it.”!

Another account mentioned by Goode of the practice of the Indians
in this respect may be found in George Mourt’s Relation or Journal
of the Beginning and Proceedings of the English Plantation Settled at
Plimouth in New England, by Certain English Adventurers, both Mer-
chants and others, London, 1622, ‘* We set the last spring some twenty
acres of Indian corn, and sowed some six acres of barley and pease, and,
according to the manner of the Indians, we manured our ground with
herrings, or rather shads, which we have in great abundance and take
with great ease at our doors. Our corn did prove well, and God be
praised, we had a good increase of Indian corn, and our barley indif-
ferent good.” ”

Thomas Morton, in his New England Canaan, London, 1632, wrote
of Virginia: ‘‘There is a fish (by some called shadds, by some, allizes,)
that at the spring of the yeare passe up the rivers to spawn in the
pond, and are taken in such multitudes in every river that hath a pond
at the end that the inhabitants doung their ground with them. You
may See in one township a hundred acres together, set with these fish,
every acre taking 1,000 of them, and an acre thus dressed will produce
and yield so much corn as three acres without fish; and (least any
Virginea man would infere hereupon that the ground of New England
was barren, because they use more fish in setting their corne, I desire
them to be remembered, the cause is plaine in Virginea) they have it
not to sett. But this practice is onely for the Indian maize (which
must be set by hands), not for English grain; and this is, therefore, a
commodity there.”

The following amusing study quoted by Goode is taken from the
records of the town of Ipswich, May 11, 1644: “It is ordered that all
the doggs for the space of three weeks from the publishing hereof,
shall have one legg tyed up, and if such a dog shall break loose and be
found doing harm the owner of the dogg shall pay damage. If a man
refuse to tye up his doge’s legg, and hee bee tound scraping up fish in
a cornfield, the owner thereof shall pay twelve pence damage beside
whatever damage the dogg doth. But if any fish their house lotts and
receive damage by doggs, the owners of these house lotts shall bear the
damage themselves.”

The practice of using fish, therefore, for fertilizing purposes is many
centuries old, but until recent years the farmers residing along the
coast were the only ones who received any benefit therefrom; but since
the more careful scientific study of the value of fish fertilization, the
nitrogenous elements taken from the sea by the fish now find their way
not only to the gardens and truck farms along the New England and
New Jersey coasts but also to the ey fields of Ohio and the cotton

fields of North Carolina.

CONSERVATION OF NITROGEN.

Attention has been called to the manner in which the nitrogen ecar-
ried into the ocean by the waste of the land is returned in great part
through the marine, vegetable, and animal:life. Immense quantities
of waste nitrogen, however, are further secured, both from sea and
land, by the various genera of birds. The well-known habits of birds
in congregating in rookeries during the nights, and at certain seasons
of the year, tends to bring into a common receptacle the nitrogenous
matters which they have gathered and which are deposited in their
excrement and in the decay of their bodies. The feathers of birds are
particularly rich in nitrogen, and the nitrogenous content of the flesh
of fowls is also high. The decay, therefore, of remains of birds,
especially if it take place largely excluded from the leaching of water,
tends to accumulate vast deposits of nitrogenous matter. If the con-
ditions in such deposits are favorable to the processes of nitrification
the whole of the nitrogen, or at least the larger part of it, which has
been collected in this débris, becomes finally converted into nitric acid
and is found combined with appropriate bases as deposits of nitrates.
The nitrates of the guano deposits and of the deposits in caves arise
in this way. If these deposits are subject to moderate leaching the
nitrate may become infiltered into the surrounding soil, making it very
rich in this form of nitrogen. The beds and surrounding soils of caves
are often found highly impregnated with nitrates.

While for our purpose deposits of nitrates only are to be considered
which are of sufficient value to bear transportation, yet much interest
attaches to the formation of nitrates in the soil, even when they are
not of commercial importance.

In many soils of tropical regions not subject to heavy rainfalls the
accumulation of these nitrates is very great. Miintz and Marcano!
have investigated many of these soils to which attention was called
first by Humboldt and Boussingault. They state that these soils are
incomparably more rich in nitrates than the most fertile soils of Europe.
The samples which they examined were collected from different parts
of Venezuela and from the valleys of the Orinoco as well as on the
shore of the Sea of Antilles. The nitrated soils are very abundant in
this region of South America, where they cover large surfaces. Their
composition is variable, but in all of them carbonate and phosphate of
lime are met with and organic nitrogenous material. The nitric acid is
found always combined with lime. In some of the soils as high as 30
per cent of nitrate of lime has been found. Nitrification of organic
material takes place very rapidly the year round in this tropical region.
These nitrated soils are everywhere abundant around eaves, as described
by Humboldt, caves which serve as the refuge of birds and bats. The

‘Compt. Rend., 101, 1885, page 65 et seq.

226 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.

nitrogenous matters which come from the decay of the remains of these
animals form true deposits of guano, which are ¢ ‘adually spread around,
and which, in contact with the limestone and with access of air, suffer
complete nitrification with the fixation of the nitric acid by the lime.

Large quantities of thig guano are also due to the débris of insects,
fragments of elytra, scales of the wings of butterflies, etc., which are
brought together in those places by the millions of cubie meters. The
nitrification which takes place in these deposits has been found to
extend its products to a distance of several kilometers through the soil.
In some places the quantity of the nitrate of lime is so great in the soils
that they are converted into a plastic paste by this deliquescent salt.

It is suggested by the authors that the coexistence of the nitrate and
phosphate of lime is sufficient in all cases to demonstrate the organie
origin of the nitric acid. It would not be possible to attribute such
an origin to the nitrate present in these soils if it could not be deter-
mined that it was thus associated with phosphate and other remains,
the last witnesses of a former animal life.

As a result of the observations of Miintz and Mareano, they conclude
that it is not proper to accredit to the electrical discharges in the atmos-
phere the origin of the nitric acid forming these deposits, although they
admit primarily the source of the nitric acid may have been due to elec-
tricity, but that it first was passed through the organism of the plant
and thence into that of the animal, whence it is accumulated in the
deposits referred to.

The theory of Miintz and Marcano in regard to the nitrates of soils,
especially in the neighborhood of caves, is probably a correct one, but
there are many objections to accepting it to explain the great deposits
of nitrate of soda which occur in many parts of Chile. Another point
which must be considered also is this: That the processes of nitrifica-
tion can not now be considered as going on with the same vigor as for-
merly. Some moisture is necessary to nitrification, as the nitrifying
ferment does not act in perfectly dry soil, and in many localities in
Chile where the nitrates are found it is too dry to suppose that any
‘active nitrification could now take place.

The existence of these nitrate deposits has long been known.'! The
old Indian laws originally prohibited the collection of the salt, but ney-
ertheless it was secretly collected and sold. Up to the year 1821 soda
saltpeter was not known in Europe except as a laboratory product.
About this time the naturalist Mariano de Rivero found on the Pacifie
Coast, in the province of Tarapaca, immense new deposits of the salt.
Later the salt was found in equal abundance in the Territory of Anto-
fagasta and farther to the south in the desert of Atacama, which forms
the Bogen of Taltal.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 227

At the present time the collection and export of saltpeter from Chile
iS a business of great importance. The largest export which has ever
taken place in one year was in 1890, when the amount exported was
927,290,430 kilograms; of this quantity 642,506,985 kilograms were sent
to England and 86,124,870 kilograms to the United States. Since
that time the imports of this salt into the United States have largely
increased.

According to Pissis! these deposits are of very ancient origin. This
geologist is of the opinion that the nitrate deposits are the result of the
decomposition of feldspathic rocks; the bases thus produced gradually
becoming united with the nitric acid provided from the air.

According to the theory of Néllner2 the deposits are of more modern
origin and due to the decomposition of marine vegetation. Continuous
Solution of soils beneath the sea gives rise to the formation of great
lakes of saturated water, in which occurs the development of much
marine vegetation. On the evaporation of this water, due to geologic
isolation, the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter causes gen-
eration of nitric acid, which, coming in contact with the calcareous
rocks, attacks them, forming nitrate of calcium, which, in presence of
sulphate of sodium, gives rise to a double decomposition into nitrate of
soda and sulphate of calcium.

The fact that iodine 1s found in greater or less quantity in Chile salt-
peter is one of the chief supports of this hypothesis of marine origin,
inasmuch as iodine is always found in sea plants and not in terrestrial
plants. Further than this, it must be taken into consideration that
these deposits of nitrate of soda contain neither shells nor fossils, nor
do they contain any phosphate of lime. The theory, therefore, that
they were due to animal origin is scarcely tenable.

Lately extensive nitrate deposits have been discovered in the United
States of Colombia.’ These deposits have been found extending over
30 square miles, and vary in thickness from 1 to 10 feet. The visible
Supply 1s estimated at 7,3 2,800,000 tons, containing from 1 to 13.5
per cent of nitrate. The deposits consist of a mixture of nitrate of
soda, chloride of soda, sulphate of calcium, sulphate of alumina, and
insoluble silica. It is thought that the amount of these deposits will
almost equal those in Chile and Peru.

PHOSPHATIC DEPOSITS.

Gautier‘ calls attention to the fact that the oldest phosphates are
met with in the igneous rocks, such as basalt, trachyte, etc., and even
in granite and gneiss. It is from these inorganic sources, therefore,
that all phosphatic plant food must have been drawn. In the second

order in age Gautier places the phosphates of hydro-mineral origin.
This class not only embraces the crystalline apatites, but also those
phosphates of later formation formed from hot mineral waters in the
Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary deposits.

These deposits are not directly suited to nourish plants.

The third group of phosphates in order of age and assimilability
embraces the true phosphorites containing, generally, some organic
matter. They are all of organic origin. In caves where animal remains
are deposited there is an accumulation of nitrates and phosphates.

Not only do the bones of animals furnish phosphates, but they are
also formed in considerable quantities by the decomposition of substi-
tuted glycerides, such as lecithin.

The ammonia produced by the nitrification of the albuminoid bodies
combines with the free phosphoric acid thus produced, forming ammo-
nium or diammonium phosphates.

The presence of ammonium phosphates in guanos was first noticed
by Chevreul more than half a century ago.

If such deposits overlay a pervious stratum of calcium carbonate,
such as chalk, and are subject to leaching, a double decomposition
takes place as the lye percolates through the chalk. Acid calcium
phosphate, and ammonium carbonate are produced. By further nitrifi-
cation the latter becomes finally converted into calcium nitrate. In
like manner aluminum phosphates are formed by the action of decom-
posing organic watter on clay.

Davidson! explains the origin of the Florida phosphates by sug-
gesting that they arose chiefly through the influx of animals driven
southward by the Glacial period. According to his supposition the
waters of the ocean, during the Cenozoic period contained more phos-
phorus than at the present time. ‘The waters of the ocean over Florida
were shallow, and the sheilfish existing therein may have secreted
phosphate as well as carbonate of lime. This supposition is supported
by an analysis of a shell of Lingula ovalis, quoted by Dana, in which
there was .85.79 per cent of lime phosphate. In these waters were
also many fishes of all kinds, and their débris served to increase the
amount of this substance. As the land emerged from the sea, came
the great Glacial epoch driving all terrestrial animals southward.
There was therefore a great mammal horde in the swamps and estua-
ries of Florida. ‘The bones of these animals contributed largely to the
phosphatic deposits. In addition to this, the shallow sea contained
innumerable sharks, manatees, whales, and other inhabitants of trop-
ical waters, and the remains of these animals added to the phosphatic
store.

While these changes were taking place in the Quaternary period,
the Florida peninsula was gradually rising, and, as soon as it reached

‘Engineering and Mining Journal, quoted in the Phosphates of America, by
Wyatt, page 66 et seq.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 229

a considerable height, the process of denudation by the action of water
commenced. Then there was a subsidence, and the peninsula again
passed under the sea and was covered with successive layers of sand.
The limestones during this process had been leached by rain water,
containing an excess of carbonic acid. In this way the limestones
were gradually dissolved, while the insoluble phosphate of lime was
left in suspension. During this time the bones of the animals before
mentioned, by their decomposition, added to the phosphate of lime
present in the underlying strata, while some were transformed into
fossils of phosphate of lime, just as they are found to-day in vast
quantities.

Wyatt! explains the phosphate deposits somewhat differently. Ac-
cording to him, during the Miocene submergence there was deposited
upon the Upper Eocene limestones, more especially in the cracks and
fissures resulting from their drying up, a soft, finely disintegrated cal-
careous sediment or mud. The estuaries formed during this period
were Swarming with animal and vegetable life, and from this organic
life the phosphates were formed by decomposition aud metamorphism
due to the gases and acids with which the waters were charged.

After the disappearance of the Miocene sea there were great disturb-
ances of the strata. Then followed the Pliocene and Tertiary periods
and Quaternary seas with their deposits and drifts of shells, sands,
clays, marls, bowlders and other transported materials, supervening in
an era when there were great fluctuations of cold and heat.

By reason of these disturbances the masses of the phosphate deposits
which had been infiltrated in the limestones became broken up and
mingled with the other débris and were thus deposited in various
mounds or depressions. The general result of the forces which have
been briefly outlined was the formation of bowlders, phosphatic débris,
ete. Wyatt therefore classifies the deposits as follows:

(1) Original pockets or cavities in the limestone filled with hard and
soft rock phosphates and débris.

(2) Mounds or beaches, rolled up on the elevated points, and chiefly
consisting of huge bowlders of phosphate rock.

(3) Drift or disintegrated rock, covering immense areas, chiefly in
Polk and Hillsboro counties, and underlying Peace River and its tribu-
taries.

N. H. Darton, of the United States Geological Survey, ascribes the
phosphate beds of Florida to the transformation of guano.? According
to this author two processes of decomposition have taken place; one of
these is the more or less complete replacement of the carbonate by the
phosphate of lime; the other is a general stalactitic coating of phos-
phatic material. Darton further calls attention to the relation of the
distribution of the phosphate deposits as affecting the theory of their

origin, but does not find any peculiar significance in the restriction
of these deposits to the western ridge of the Florida Peninsula.

As this region evidently constituted a long, narrow peninsula during
early Miocene times it is a reasonable tentative hypothesis that dur-
ing this period guanos were deposited from which was derived the
material for the phosphatization of the limestone either at the same
time or soon after.

Darton closes his paper by saying that the phosphate deposits in
Florida will require careful, detailed geologic exploration before their
relations and history will be fully understood.

According to Dr. N. A. Pratt the rock or bowlder phosphate had its
immediate origin in animal life, and the phosphate bowlder is a true
fossil. He supposes the existence of some species in former times in
which the shell excreted was chiefly phosphate of lime. The fossil bowl-
der therefore becomes the remains of a huge foraminifer which had
identical composition in its skeleton with true bone deposits or of
organic matter.

Perhaps the most complete exposition of the theory of the recovery
of waste phosphates, with especial reference to their deposition in
Florida, has been given by Eldridge,' of the United States Geological
Survey. Eldridge calls attention to the universal presence of phos-
phates in sea water and to the probability that in earlier times, as during
the Miocene and Eocene geologic periods, the waters of the ocean con-
tained a great deal more phosphate in solution than at the present time.
He cites the observations of Bischof, which show the solubility of dif-
ferent phosphates in waters saturated with carbon dioxide. According
to these observations apatite is the most insoluble form of lime phos-
phate, while artificial basic slag phosphate is the most soluble. Among
the very soluble phosphates, however, are the bones of animals, both
fresh and old. Burnt bones, however, are more soluble than bones
still containing organic matter. Not only are the organic phosphates
extremely soluble in water saturated with carbon dioxide but also in
water which contains common salt or chloride of ammonium. The pres-
ence of large quantities of common salt in sea water would, therefore,
tend to increase its power of absorbing lime phosphates of organic
origin. It is not at all incredible, therefore, to suppose that at some
remote period the waters of the ocean, as indicated by these theories,
were much more highly charged with phosphates than at the present
time.

According to Eldridge, the formation of the hard rock and_ soft
phosphates may be ascribed to three periods: First, that in which the
primary rock was formed; second, that of secondary deposition in the
cavities of the primary rock; third, that in which the deposits thus
formed were broken up and the resufting fragments and comminuted
material were redone as they now occur.

“The first of these stages began probably not later than the close of
the older Miocene, and within the Eocene area it may have begun much
earlier. Whether the primary phosphate resulted from a supertici: ul
and heavy deposit of soluble guanos, covering the limestones, or from
the concentration of phosphate of lime already widely and uniformly
distributed throughout the mass of the original rock, or from both, is
a difficult question. In any event, the evidence indicates the effect of
the percolation of surface waters, highly charged with carbonie and
earth acids, and thus enabled to carry down into the mass of the lime-
stone dissolved phosphate of lime, to be redeposited under conditions
favorable to its separation. Such conditions might have been brought
about by the simple interchange of bases between the phosphate and
carbonate of lime thus brought together, or by the lowering of the
solvent power of the waters through loss of carbonic acid. The latter
would happen whenever the acid was required for the solution of
additional carbonate of lime, or when, through aeration, it should escape
from the water. The zone of phosphate deposition was evidently one
of double concentration, resulting from the removal of the soluble car-
bonate thus raising the percentage of the less soluble phosphate, and
from the acquirement of additional phosphate of lime from the over-
lying portions of the deposit.

“The thickness of the zone of phosphatization in the Eocene area is
unknown, but it is doubtful if it was over 20 feet. In the Miocene area
the depth has been proved from the phosphates in situ to have been
between 6 and 12 feet.”

The deposits of the secondary origin, according to Eldridge, are due
chiefly to sedimentation, although some of them may have been due to
precipitation from water. This secondary deposition was kept up fora
long period, until stopped by some climatic or geologic change. The
deposits of phosphates thus formed in the Florida peninsula are
remarkably free from iron and aluminum, in comparison with many
of the phosphates of the West Indies.

The third period in the genesis of the hard-rock deposits embraces
the period of formation of the original deposits and their transporta-
tion and storage as they are found at the present time. The geologic
time at which this occurred is somewhat uncertain, but it was probably
during the last submergence of the peninsula.

In all cases the peculiar formation of the Florida limestone must be
considered. This limestone is extremely porous and, therefore, easily
penetrated by the waters of percolation. A good illustration of this is
seen on the southwestern and southern edges of Lake Okeechobee. In
following down a drainage canal which had been cut into the southwest
shore of the lake I saw the edge of the basin, which is composed of
this porous material. The appearance of the limestone would indicate
that large portions of it had already given way to the process of solu-
tion. The remaining portions were extremely friable, easily crushed,
and much of it could be removed by the ordinary dredging machines.
Such a limestone as this is peculiarly suited to the accumulation of
phosphatic materials, due to the percolation of the water containing
them. The solution of the limestone and consequent deposit of the
232 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.

phosphate of lime is easily understood when the character of this lime-
stone is considered.

Shaler, as quoted by Eldridge in the work already referred to, refers
to this characteristic of the limestone and says that the best conditions
for the accumulation of valuable deposits of lime phosphate in residual
débris appear to occur where the phosphatic lime marls are of a rather
soft character; the separate beds having no such solidity as will resist
the percolation of water through innumerable incipient joints such as
commonly pervade stratified materials, even when they are of a very
soft nature.

Eldridge is also of the opinion that the remains of birds are not
sufficient to account for the whole of the phosphatic deposits in Florida.
He ascribes them to the joint action of the remains of birds, of land
and marine animals, and to the deposition of the phosphatic materials
in the waters in the successive subsidences of the surface below the
water line.!

POTASH DEPOSITS.

In the foregoing pages I have tried to set clearly before you the dif-
ferent ways in which the waste of nitrogen and phosphorie acid has
been recovered by nature in a form suitable for restoration to arable
fields. In the case of potash, however, we have seen that this element
is not restored by the processes already mentioned, in amounts pro-
portionate to nitrogen and phosphorus. Potash salts, being extremely
soluble, are likely to be held longest in solution. Some of them, of
course, are recovered in the animal and vegetable life of which we have
spoken, but the great mass of potash carried into the sea still remains
unaccounted for. The recovery of the waste of potash is chiefly secured
by the isolation of sea waters containing large quantities of this salt
and their subsequent evaporation. Such isolation of sea waters takes
place by means of geologic changes in the level of the land and sea.
In the raising of an area above the sea level there is almost certain to
be an inclosure, of greater or less extent, of the sea. water in the form
of alake. This inclosure may be complete or only partial, the inclosed
water area being still in communication with the main body of the sea
by means of small estuaries. If this body of water be exposed to rapid
evaporation, as was doubtless the case in past geologic ages, there will
be a continual influx of additional sea water through these estuaries to
take the place of that evaporated. The waters may thus become more
and more charged with saline constituents. Finally a point is reached
in the evaporation when the less soluble of the saline constituents
begin to be deposited. In this way the various formations of mineral
matter, produced by the drying up of inclosed waters, take place.

Fuchs et DeLauny, page 309 et seq.

The most extensive deposits of potash known are those in the neigh-
borhood of Stassfurt,in Germany. The following description probably
represents the method of formation of these deposits:

“The Stassfurt salt and potash deposits had their origin thousands
of years ago, in a sea or ocean, the waters of which gradually receded,
leaving near the coast, lakes which still retained communication with
the ereat ocean by means of small channels. In that part of Europe
the climate was still tropical, and the waters of these lakes rapidly
evaporated, but were constantly replenished through these small chan-
nels connecting them with the main body. Decade after decade this
continued, until, by evaporation and crystallization, the various salts
present in the sea water were deposited in solid form. The less soluble
material, such as sulphate of lime or ‘anhydrite,’ solidified first and
formed the lowest stratum. Then came common rock salt with a slowly
thickening layer which ultimately reached 3,000 feet, and is estimated
to have been thirteen thousand years in formation. This rock-salt
deposit is interspersed with lamellar deposits of ‘anhydrite, which
gradually diminish toward the top and are finally replaced by the
mineral ‘ polyhalite,’ which is composed of sulphate of lime, sulphate of
potash, and sulphate of magnesia. The situation in which this polyha-
lite predominates is called the ‘polyhalite region’ and after it comes the
‘kieserite region,’ in which, between the roc k- salt strata, kieserite (sul-
phate of magnesia) i sembedded. Above the kieserite lies the ‘potash
region,’ consisting mainly of deposits of carnallite, a mineral compound
of muriate of pot ‘ash and chloride of magnesia. The carnallite deposit
is from 50 to 130 feet thick and yields the most important of the crude
‘potash salts and that from which are manufactured most of the concen-
trated articles, including muriate of potash.

“Overlyitig this region is a layer of impervious clay which acts as a

water- tight root to protect and preserve the very soluble potash and

magnesia salts which, had it not been for the very protection of this
overlying stratum, would have been long ages ago washed away and
lost by the action of the water percolating from above. Above this
clay roof is a stratum of varying thickness of anhydrite (sulphate of
lime), and still above this a second salt deposit, probably formed under
more recent climatic and atmospherie influences or possibly by chemical
changes in dissolving and subsequent precipitation. This salt deposit
contains 98 per cent (often more) of pure salt, a degree of purity rarely
elsewhere found. Finally, above this are strata of gypsum, tenacious
clay, sand, and limestone, which crop out at the surface.

“The perpendicular distance from the lowest to the upper surface of
the Stassfurt salt deposits is about 5,000 feet (a little less than a mile),
while the horizontal extent of the bed is from the Harz Mountains to
the Elbe River in one direction, and from the city of Magdeburg to the
town of Bernburg in the other.”

According to Fuchs and De Launy? the saline formation near Stass-
furt is situated at the bottom of a vast Triassic deposit surrounding
the city of Magdeburg. The quantity of sea water which evaporated
to produce saline deposits of more than 500 meters in thickness must
have been enormous and the rate of evaporation great. It appears
that a temperature of 100° would have been quite necessary, acting
for a long time, to produce this result.

These authors therefore admit that all the theories so far advanced
to explain the magnitude of these deposits are attended with certain
difficulties. What, for instance, could have caused a temperature of
100°2 The most reasonable source of this high temperature must be
sought for in the violent chemical action produced by the double
decompositions of such vast quantities of salts of different kinds.
There may also have been at the bottom of this basin some subter-
ranean heat such as is found in certain localities where boric acid is
deposited.

Whatever be the explanation of the source of the heat it will be
admitted that at the end of the Permian period there was thrown up
to the northeast of the present saline deposits a ridge extending from
Helgoland to Westphalia. This dam established throughout the whole
of North Germany saline lagoons in which evaporation was at once
established, and these lagoons were constantly fed from the sea.

There was then deposited by evaporation first of all a layer of gyp-
sum and afterwards rock salt, covering with a few exceptions the whole
of the area of North Germany.

But around Stassfurt there occurred at this time geologic displace-
ments, the saline basin was permanently closed, and then by continued
evaporation the more deliquescent salts, such as polyhalite, kieserite,
and ecarnallite, were deposited.

These theories account with sufficient ease for the deposition of the-

saline masses, but do not explain why in those days the sea water was
so rich in potash and why potash is not found in other localities where
vast quantities of gypsum and common salt have been deposited. It
may be that the rocks composing the shores of these lagoons were
exceptionally rich in potash and that this salt was, therefore, in a cer-
tain degree, a local contribution to the products of concentration.

Through the ages of the past the rich stores of plant food have been
steadily removed from arable fields and apparently forever lost. But
in point of fact no particle of it has been destroyed. Even the denitri-
fying ferments described by Springer, Gayon and Dupetit, and Miintz
reduce only to a lower stage of oxidation or restore to a gaseous form
the nitric nitrogen on which alone vegetables can feed. But electricity,
combustion, and the activity of certain anaerobic ferments herding in
the rootlets of legumes and other orders of plants are able to recover
and again make available this loss.

Lately Winogradsky and Waringten have shown that an organism
can be grown in a sugar solution containing certain salts and exclud-
ing all nitrogenous matter save the free nitrogen of the atmosphere,
which is capable of oxidizing and assimilating this inert gas. Ina
solution containing 7 grams of sugar as high as 14 milligrams of nitrogen
have been fixed.

Warington says in speaking of this phenomenon:

“That a vegetable organism should be able to acquire from the air
the whole of the nitrogen which it needs is certainly very remarkable,
and is an extraordinary fact both to the physiologist and the chemist.” '

The fact that a few million years may supervene before the particle
that is carried off to-day as waste may return to organic life shows
the patience rather than the wastefulness of nature.

As a result of this general review of the migrations of plant food, the
reassuring conclusion is reached that there is no danger whatever of the
ultimate consumption or waste of the materials on which plants live.
Cireumscribed localities, through carelessness or ignorance, where
once luxuriant crops grew, may become sterile, but the great source of
supply is not exhausted. In fact, as the rocks decay and nitrifying
organisms increase, the total store of plant food at the disposal of vege-
tation may continue to grow. When we join with this the fact that the
skill of man in growing crops is rapidly increasing, we find no danger
ahead in respect of the quantity of human food which may be produced.

Only the novelist might be able, by the aid of an unfettered imagina-
tion, to say how many human beings the United States alone will be
able to feed in comfort. With the aid of scientific agriculture, with the
help of the agricultural chemist, we may safely say that a thousand
million people will not so crowd our means of subsistence as to make

‘Malthus more than a pleasing theorist. <As I pointed out in my vice-

presidential address at Buffalo, the death of humanity is not to come
from starvation but from freezing, and many a geologic epoch will come
and go before this planet dies of cold.

FOUR DAYS’ OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT
BLANC)!

By M. J. JANSSEN.

On Friday, the 22d of August, in the year 1890, about noon, a sleigh
driven, or rather hoisted, by twelve men of extraordinary vigor and
resolution, attained the summit of Mont Blane.

It was the first time an ascent had been accomplished in this novel
Style and that a traveler had reached the very top of the renowned
pile hardly having set foot to the ground.

The journey had called for heroic efforts. Slopes of extreme steep-
ness had been climbed, broad crevasses had been crossed or turned,
ridges like knife edges, with abysses on either hand, had been followed.
But triumph had crowned their efforts; and, the feat accomplished,
there had been an explosion of enthusiasm—congratulations, and even
kisses.

The traveler, having paid his debt of praise and thanks to his com-
panions, glanced at the scene unrolled before his eyes and seemed ray-
ished with a sort of ecstacy.

The weather was splendid, and the celestial vault appeared of a dark
and somewhat violet blue; but quite unexpectedly, however rationally,
that vault seemed continued below the horizon, as if the heaven had
wished to draw its strings and inclose the observer in an azure sphere.

The plains, the cities, the valleys, and all the fields which were spread
out within the immense circle of that horizon looked as if they were
sunk to the bottom of an ocean of heavenly blue. It was as if the
kingdom of the mermen were revealed at the bottom of the ocean.

However, from the bottom of that ocean rose here and there huge
reefs, whose tops of dazzling whiteness emerged from the surface and
rose toward the horizon. These were the mountain chains at the center
of which Mont Blane presides.

The traveler did not permit himself to be completely absorbed by that
memorable picture. He directed his attention to the conditions offered
by this station for astronomical and physical observations, and after
this scrutiny and rapidly taken notes were completed he gave the sig-
nal of retreat and the band descended.

238 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC.

The success of this journey proved that those glaciers which present
to the scientific man such novel and important subjects of research,
and to the artist and the poet such sublime scenes, are henceforth not
inaccessible to those whose physical forces play the traitor to their
wills. ,

We may add that a mode of ascent which spares the traveler the
extraordinary fatigues of an ascent om foot alone permits him fully to
enjoy the beauty of those regions.

A month later the traveler in question, he who has the honor of
addressing you, reported to the Academy of Sciences the circumstances
of the ascent and the observations he had made, calling attention to
the advantages which meteorology, terrestrial physics, and astronomy
would find in this incomparable station, at which he proposed to estab-
lish an observatory.

Scarcely was his reading done when one of his colleagues, the
Mecenas of contemporary French astronomy, enthusiastic for the proj-
ect, desired immediately to inscribe himself as principal cooperator.
Shortly after, the project received the spontaneous cooperation of a
prince friendly to science, the bearer of a great historic name, and one
of the most generous financiers of our age.

To these supports were soon added others whose importance was due
particularly to the high situations of the persons bringing their adhe-
sion to the plan.

A society was then formed. The President of the Republic conde-
scended to be an honorary member; M. Leon Say, honorary president;
M. Janssen, president; M. Bischoffsheim, secretary; M. Ed. Delessert,
treasurer; MM. Prince Roland Bonaparte, Baron Alph. de Rothschild,
Count Greffuthe, members.

The scheme was thus incorporated and its realization now only
depended upon the good fortune with which natural obstacles might
be surmounted. Yet it could not be denied that the difficulties of the
enterprise were great, as I had myself foreseen and emphatically stated.

Indeed, the people who were the best acquainted with the glaciers of
the great mountain deemed the establishment at the summit of a con-
struction of some importance, capable of affording lodging to the
observers, to be impossible. On the one hand, it was said, and with
great appearance of reason, the icy crust of the summit must have a
great thickness, forbidding the establishment of foundations on the
rock, and on the other hand the possibility of founding on the snow
was denied. In fact, the general opinion was unfavorable.

On the other hand, M. J. Vallot had just established on the rock of
the Bosses, about 400 meters from the summit, a refuge of great utility
and an observatory which was to be considerably enlarged and would
permit a variety of extremely valuable observations at a high altitude.
But those considerations, notwithstanding their weightiness, could not
aryest US.

OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 239

The summit alone by its commanding situation and the immense hori-
zon that it embraces is adapted to the investigations which we propose.

An experience of thirty-five years of travel and research in the dif-
ferent parts of the world, especially my sojourns on the summit of the
Faulhorn, on that of Etna, on the Pic du Midi, and on the highlands of
the Himalaya had shown imme the imperfections of observations made
on the flanks of mountains, by reason of all the disturbing causes
which go to derange them, and the incontestible superiority from that
point of view of the culminating points.

I considered that, France having the good fortune to possess the
better part of the great pile of Mont Blane and to have access to its
summit, we had not the right to stop so near our end, and in order to
spare ourselves a last effort to deprive ourselves of the incomparable
advantages attached to the possession of the peak which commands
three countries and permits the study of a layer of air of 5 kilometers
thickness and 100 diameter the conquest should be made at any cost.
Hence, aS soon as the soundings, due in great part to the generosity of
M. Hiftel, had shown that the thickness of the snow at the top appeared
to negative a foundation on the rock, I thought we ought not to hesi-
tate to seek all means of obtaining an installation on the snow itself.
But, as I said, this novel plan met with almost universal incredulity,
and nothing but the conviction due to a thorough examination of the
question prevented its author from being shaken by those criticisms.

Two principal questions had first to be cleared up: In the first place,
What resistance could the snow of the summit offer to support the
weight of an important construction? Next, What movements were to
be feared in the snoweap?

In order to answer the first question experiments upon the resistance
of snow were instituted at the observatory of Meudon. They gave sur-
prising results for the force of the resistance. A column of lead of 360
kilograms and only 30 centimeters diameter sunk only a few millimeters
in settled snow brought to the density of that at the summit of Mont
Blane. Later the experiment was repeated with still more surprising
results.

As to the question of movement, it was studied and solved by the
putting in place, in the year 1891, of a little building of wood sunk in
the snow by a determinate amount and carefully leveled. This little
building has now been on the summit for two years and still answers
for a storehouse.

All these encouraging results having been acquired, the execution
of the plan was vigorously begun. :

The shape of the observatory and its internal arrangement had to
be adapted to the novel conditions of its erection.

The construction, which was to have two stories and a terrace, took
the form of a truncated quadrangular pyramid, a form which gives :
large base and offers little hold to winds on account of the slanting
surfaces.
240 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC.

The lower story was to be three-quarters sunk under the snow in
order to insure to the edifice a solid seat and to give the sleeping
chambers of this story a relatively mild temperature.

Moreover, the whole construction would be so bound together in all
its parts that it would form a rigid whole, which with the aid of
proper jackscrews could be brought back into place in case motions of
the snows of its foundations should take place.

It was necessary also to take into account the weight and dimensions
of the materials by reason of the difficulties of transport over the
glacier. It was decided to make the beams in different parts hollowed
out in the interior, so as to limit the weight of them and to obtain
lightness combined with rigidity.

Such were the general arrangements adopted.

For their realization and the drawing up of plans I was greatly
aided by my friend, M. Vandremer, the eminent architect, member of
the Academy of Vine Arts, who had fully approved my ideas and my
plan.

The observatory was constructed at Meudon under our direction. It
was then taken apart and transported to Chamonix, where the materials
were divided for the ascent. The weight of the materials amounted to
nearly 15 tons and formed the matter of seven or eight hundred por-
ters’ loads. Accordingly, to avoid confusion and diminish the chances
of accident, the road was divided into four sections and huts of deposit
and refuge were constructed at the two principal stations.

The first section comprised the road from Chamonix to the entrance
of the glacier. This road, new made in its upper part, could be traveled
on the backs of mules. The second station embraced the part from
the entrance of the glacier to the rocks ealled the Gr ands Mulets, where
there is an inn belonging to the commune.

At this important station in the midst of the glacier and at about
3,000 meters elevation—that is, half way up—a rude hut for porters
was built, for the transportation across this part of the glacier, which
is highly diversified, can only be effected on men’s backs.

The course from the station of Grands Mulets to that of the Grand
Rocher Rouge, about 300 meters below the summit, formed the third
section.

This station of the Grand Rocher Rouge was valuable owing to its
proximity tothe summit. We there built a living hut, which was of the
greatest service to our workers. They came there to pass the night
and to take refuge in bad weather.

The whole summer of 1892 was spent in the construction of the obser-
vatory, its transportation to Chamonix, the organization of the stations,
and the building of the huts and nent ts.

Business had been pushed, for at the end of the campaign all the sta-
tions had been organized, a quarter of the materials had been carried
to the Grand Rocher Rouge, and the rest was on deposit at the Grands
Mulets.

OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 241

The campaign of 1893 was to be employed in finishing the transpor-

‘tation of materials to the summit and to the building.

An accident such as often happens on Mont Blane came near com-
promising the whole thing. A large deposit of materials placed at the
Grand Rocher Rouge at the beginning of winter was nowhere to be
found in the spring. After hunting everywhere it was discovered
buried beneath some 8 or 9 meters of snow, and it was a great labor to
get it out.

To facilitate the transportation of the heavier pieces I had invented
and caused to be constructed a number of very light winches or wind-
lasses, formed of a simple frame inclosing the drum and gearing and
furnished with rings which allowed them to be solidly fixed in the
snow by the aid of ice axes or stakes.

These windlasses, placed from stretch to stretch on the great slopes,
served to tug the sledges bearing materials.

Thus the workmen were much relieved, and they could mount the
greatest slopes, the ascent of which is so laborious and even danger-
ous for heavily loaded porters.

It was a novel thing, and curious, too, to see the great glacier of
Mont Blanc, whose successive projections looked like the steps of some
gigantic staircase, marked with the line of laborers working these
machines, which slowly but surely dragged along the heavy loads
toward the summit. It was a new kind of undertaking, whose object
was not search for material wealth, but the conquest of a station which
was to endow science with new truths. ;

Meantime materials were accumulating on the top, and the critical
moment was approaching when the final effort was to crown all these
labors; I mean the moment of building.

Then a gang of the strongest men was chosen—the most habituated
to these high elevations. To them were joined the very carpenters
who had put the house together at Meudon, and the summit was
attacked.

We were much afraid of the gales and the hurricanes that are so
frequent on Mont Blanc; but by an unhoped-for piece of good luck,
like a favor accorded to such perseverance and such efforts, there was
a whole fortnight perfectly calin with a temperature relatively mild.

So the work went on with astonishing celerity, and on the 8th of
September the observatory was built, walled in, floored, and its stair-
case up. A part of the terrace alone remained in abeyance. It was
necessary to go back to finish it.

Meantime, impatient to see our observatory in place and to make
observations there, | organized my ascent. In this second journey to
the top we employed windlasses for hoisting the travelers’ sleigh.
The line being attached to the sleigh, the guides carrying the windlass
stretched out the rope and fixed the windlass at a good distance. The
windlass, put in place on pickets and solidly bound to ice axes deeply

buried in the snow, was set in motion and the sleigh advanced. But,
as it approached the machine, two guides took the line which had
passed the drum, and, furnished with a second windlass, went to
establish a new hauling station. As soon as the sleigh had reached
the first windlass, the latter was disengaged and carried in its turn to
a higher station, and this maneuver continued without interruption to
the summit of the side to be climbed.

Thus we climbed the steep slopes of the Cerisier, of the Petit-Platean,
of the Grand Plateau, of the wall of the Corridor, and of the wall of the
Cote.

The glacier this year, after the long and hot summer, was stripped
of its snow and crevassed everywhere; so that it would in the opinion
of the guides have been impossible to accomplish the ascent by men’s
arms alone, as was done in 1890,

We left Chamonix Friday, the 8th of September, and we reached the
summit Monday, the 11th, at haif past 2 in the afternoon.

The ascent had been so difficult that we had to press into serv-
ice, besides the men detailed to the sleigh, all the porters of provisions
and instruments.

I had only taken with me the instruments required for the principal
observation that Ll had in view, and the provisions had been left at the
Rocher Rouge where they were to be sent for the next day.

But the weather suddenly became bad, and we remained without
provisions for the two days the gale lasted.

Thursday at 1 o’clock the wind fell, the sky cleared up, and about 6
I witnessed a magnificent sunset. The top of Mont Blanc emerged
froma sea of clouds extending on all sides to the horizon. The rounded
forms of this surface looked like the waves of an ocean. Here and
there fragments of cloud rising above the general level looked like
isolated high mountains with strange outlines. The rays of the set-
ting sun lit up the scene with reddish fires and made of it a world too
fantastic for Gustave Doré to dare to dream. However, little by little
the cooling of the atmosphere produced a gradual descent of the
cloudy layer, and the great peaks of the chain of Monte Rosa and of
the Oberland began to emerge, sowing that sea with new archipelagoes
whose glaciers glittered with redder and redder fires as the sun sank.
The disk of this sun of blood red broke into sinister fragments whose
tatters were soon lost in that sea.

Then a glacial wind came up from the east and breathed upon the
surface of the deep, and the shadows descended.

Nothing can convey the impression such scenes produce on those
who love the sublime beauties of nature.

For my part, in face of this scene which reealled those pictures which
show the first ages of the world when the continents first began to rise
above the boundless surface of the waters, I was as one turning to
stone. My emotions were too strong; to take notes would have been

impossible ; but of that there was no need, since the succession of these
scenes remained engraved ineffaceably upon my mind.

Why are the emotions so lively? Why, in particular, during the
four nights | passed at the summit did I experience a feeling of such
delicious buoyancy throughout my being? Why did it seem that I
was relieved of a great weight which till then had fettered and weighed
down my mind, and that it was now to take its flight and open in full
liberty and love the questions the hardest and the finest of a higher
moral order?

Is it the simple effect of the small specific gravity of the air of those
high altitudes? Do there not enter other causes still unknown which
shall be investigated in the future?

Be this as it may, it seems that nature, which does nothing in vain,
and which is full of these harmonies, wishes to prepare us by the very
effect of these high altitudes to better feel the greatness and the sub-

-limity of the scenes that it presents to us.'

But the sun rose brightly the next morning, while I was present as
spectator of an event less dramatic than the setting of the previous
evening, but still of a grandeur unparalleled. { could give it, however,
but a few moments’ attention. I wished to profit by the presence of
this fine sun to execute the long and delicate observations which I had
not been able to make with my large instruments at the time of my
ascent of 1890.

Those observations related, as is known, to the vexed question of the
presence of oxygen in the gaseous elements of the sun.

The eminent American physicist, Draper, thought himself able to
conclude from observations of spectral photography that oxygen wasa
part of the solar atmosphere. Now this question of solar oxygen has
an importance which transcends the purely scientific horizon.

If the sun is so constituted as to fill for long ages its office of dis-
penser of heat and light to the worlds it enchains around it, science
foresees, nevertheless, that by the inevitable effect of time its radiating
powers will diminish and more and more decline. Now if, during the
ages which shall witness this lowering of temperature, the gaseous
envelopes so rich in hydrogen surrounding the incandescent orb were
to contain oxygen besides, a moment would necessarily be reached in
which a combination of the two bodies would take place, and then enor-
mous quantities of aqueous vapor would appear in the solaratmosphere.

Now, we know that the vapor of water is that one of the elastic
fluids that is endowed with the most energetic power of absorption
for radiant heat. This aqueous atmosphere would, then, form a veil, a

1T here repeat what I have already said apropos of the ascent of 1890, that this
state of mind supposes that one has nothing to do in the way of physical effort. In
my opinion, it is the mode of going up I employed and the care I took to preserve
all the forces of my intellectual life which put me into the state of mind shown in
the above passages.
244 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC.

sereen which would diminish in an enormous proportion the power of

the already declining sun.

At the surface of the earth one would quickly enough perceive the
terrible phenomenon (supposing, at the low temperature the air would
have, there were any living beings to perceive it, which is improbable).
Temperature would everywhere fall, the climate of the poles would
advance toward the equator (already far more frigid than the poles
are now), and the conditions of vegetation and of animation would be
still more remote from fulfillment.

It is true that by reason of the enormous mass of our central orb
and of the conditions which have presided over its constitution, we
still have at all events a long future before us before we shall witness
any such catastrophe. But let us not selfishly ferget that the earth is
not alone over against the sun, that the happy family of the planets
counts sister planets whose mass is incomparably greater than ours,
the evolution of the phenomena of animation there being correspond-
ingly much slower, and that those planets need long futures to assure
their healthy and normal development. Such is the case with Jupiter
and Saturn, whose masses are so vast, and which appear to have passed
through as yet but a small fraction of their evolution.

We have thus an interest, not for the moment, but in the future, for
our planetary world, in the atmosphere of the sun being so constituted
as to have a long future before it; that is to say, in its being free from
oxygen.

But how shall we obtain intelligence as to the state of our interests
in this matter?

If we could transport ourselves without inconvenience to the limit
of our atmosphere, where it is on the border of the celestial void, the
solution of the question would be simple enough. We should receive
in a spectroscope a solar ray, and, by our knowledge of all the special
and characteristic modifications which oxygen gas produces in the
spectrum, should decide the question in an instant.

But the problem is not so simple and easy. As things are, the
atmospheric air consists one-fifth of oxygen, to which we mainly owe
the presence of animal life on our globe, and when we wish to analyze
a ray, it has already traversed an almost infinite thickness of oxygen.
How, then, shall we distinguish between the spectroscopic effect on the
sun’s atmosphere and that of the earth?

Here it is that the high stations become useful.

Imagine that, with our eyes fixed upon the solar spectrum, we could
be buoyed up higher and higher in the air. We should see the oxygen
lines pale as we approached the limits of our atmosphere; and since
these rays have not all the same intensity, but become weaker the less
their refrangibility, we should see the feebler lines disappear one after
another. If, then, it were made out that the decrement in the intensity
and number of lines corresponded strictly to the quantity of oxygen

left below us, we should have a right to infer that in rising still more
and approaching the atmospheric limits all the oxygen-rays of the
spectrum would disappear, and that, consequently, the sun has nothing
to do with the phenomenon, and contains no oxygen in its atmosphere.

We come now to the observation made on Mont Blane on Thursday,
the 14th, and Friday, the 15th, of September, 1893.

We have been able to aver that as a matter of fact the number and
enfeebling of the oxygen lines of the solar spectrum seemed to cor-
respond to an atmospheric thickness of 4,800 meters, precisely the
amount which was underfoot, and that consequently the oxygen lines
in the solar spectrum are entirely due to the oxygen of our atmosphere.

To make sure of this is a delicate matter. On the’ one hand the
heavens must be very pure, and on the other hand a large apparatus
must be mounted with care and protected from the wind and from stray
light. That is to say, the observation can only be properly made in a
closed room sufficiently spacious Those are the conditions which the
Mont Blane Observatory offered. It was inaugurated by that study.!
This absence of oxygen in the atmospheres of the central orb not

they have been effected upon the summit of Mont Blanc, and especially that the
instrument employed was infinitely superior to that of the two previous ascents.
The first was a spectroscope by Duboscq, incapable of separating the B group into
distinct lines, while the second was a spectroscope with a Rowland grating (pre-
sented by Professor Rowland), with telescopes of 0.75 meters focal length, showing,
it is needless to say, all known details of B.

A special importance attaches to this, because there may be found in the constitu-
tion of this B group valuable elements for measuring in some sort the effects of the
decrement of the action of our atmosphere as we rise in it, and consequently for
judging whether that decrement corresponds to a total extinction at the limit of the
atmosphere. In fact we know that the double lines, whose aggregate constitutes the
B group, diminish in intensity as their refrangibility diminishes, or, if you choose,
with their increased wave length.

We can avail ourselves of this circumstance, if not to measure, at least to esti-
mate the diminution of the action of selective absorption of our atmosphere. In
fact, we find that the feeblest doublets vanish successively in the atmosphere—that is
to say, according as the action of absorption diminishes. For example, in ordinary
circumstances, on the surface of seas or plains, the maps of the B group show,
besides what we call the head of B, thirteen or fourteen doublets. Already at
Chamonix, at 1,050 meters, the thirteenth doublet is difficult to make sure of. At
the Grands Mulets (3,050 meters) it is only from the tenth to the twelfth that sure
observations can be made. At the summit of Mont Blanc I could hardly go beyond
the eighth.

But is it not remarkable that, taking the ratio of atmospheric pressures on Mont
Blane and in the plain, or

and multiplying this by the number of doublets generally quite visible in the plain,
or say thirteen to fourteen, we get 7.4 or about the number (8) seen by me at the
summit? :
246 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC.

that belong to it, but it has another bearing of a still more lofty
order. It reveals to us a new harmony in the constitution of. the
system.

We already know the grand outlines of the sun’s constitution and
the admirable conditions realized to assure both the abundance and
the duration of the radiation with which it supplies the planets. We
know how, as M. Faye’s fine theory teaches, the incandescent surface
of excessive thinness in which resides its radiating virtue is itself
regenerated by the vast reserves of heat of the great central mass.

We know too, that this radiating surface is protected from rubbing
against the icy void of space by a number of gaseous envelopes. Of
these envelopes, or atmospheres, the highest, and doubtless the most
efficacious, is the coronal atmosphere, which, during total eclipses, pro-
duces the splendid phenomenon of the glory of the corona.

This atmosphere is principally composed of hydrogen, the lightest
and most transparent of known gases. The capital function of radia-
tion, which is the rational end of the central luminary, is then assured
by that transparent and protecting atmosphere. But we now see that,
by an arrangement no less admirable, the body which could in a moment
compromise this function has been removed with care.

Thus it is that science as she advances reveals to us at every step
unknown laws and harmonies in the constitution of the world.

The observatory which now rears its head above the summit of Mont
Blane has just contributed a little part to this work. It promises in
the future much larger results. The building is the realization of the
thought and the desire of numbers of distinguished men of science
who have worked on the renowned mountain. Since the memorable
ascent of De Saussure, Mont Blane has formed acquaintance with the

But though this is striking, it is the comparison with tubes placed under optical
conditions as identical as possible which alone can lead to any certain conclusion.
These comparative experiments have been commenced in the laboratory of the
Observatory of Meudon. They lead to the same result, to wit, the disappearance of
the groups A, a, and B at the limits of the atmosphere. But because of the impor-
tance of the question they will be taken up anew and completed.

It might be asked whether the elevated temperatures to which are submitted the
gases and vapors of the solar atmospheres are not capable of modifying their power
of selective absorption, and in particular whether oxygen, which might be in those
atmospheres, would not have a spectrum quite different from that which we recog-
nize in our experiments at ordinary temperatures.

Ihave already instituted experiments with a view to meeting this objection. I
shall report them to the Academy, but I wish to say that the absorption spectra of
oxygen, whether that with irresolvable bands or that with lines, do not appear to
be appreciably modified when the oxygen is carried to 400° or 500°. *

On the whole I may say that the observations which have been made at the sum.
mit of Mont Blane put the question of the telluric origin of the oxygen groups of
the solar spectrum upon a new footing much more precise and lead to the answer
indicated.
OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 247

various methods of investigation of Martins, Bravais, and Le Pileur,
of Tyndall, Hodgkinson, Soret, Violle, and, more recently, M. Vallot.

But it must be confessed that those researches would have given
results still more important, in view of the science and talents of their
authors, if the latter had had a better installation for their instruments.
Now that the observatory is built, and that it will soon offer a com-
fortable sojourn, nothing will any longer prevent all the results that
are to be expected at this station from being reached.

A fine and copious scientific harvest is to be reaped. Let us invite
to it the scientific men of all countries, and we shall thus adhere to the
constant tradition of France, who has always loved to take the nations
into partnership in her endeavors after progress and light.

WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN|!

By MARK W. HARRINGTON.

The subject of ancient and modern weather making is a very large
one—too large to be treated with entire generality. I shall discuss it
rather from the American standpoint, and shall use cases in the Old
World simply for the purpose of illustration and for completeness.

Three distinct sorts of weather making have been employed. The
first depends on superstitious and religious methods; then follows on
this the degradation of these religious ideas into folklore remnants,
which have a curious persistency in civilized countries. Both these
are psychic. Opposed to them is the third method, mainly American
and intensely practical, with which some history and literature are
connected.

I.—SUPERSTITIOUS AND RELIGIOUS METHODS.
RAIN MAKING AND STOPPING.’

Many Indian tribes have attempted to produce rainy or dry weather,
according to requirements. Among these may be mentioned the
Mandan, the Muskingum, the Moqui, the Natchez, Zuni, Choctaws,
and others. For this purpose pipes were smoked, tobacco was burned,
prayers and incantations were offered, arrows were discharged toward
the clouds, charms were used, and various other methods were employed.
Classifying by tribes the processes employed, we turn first to the
Troquois.

Mrs. E. A. Smith, in her Myths of the Iroquois, says:

“In a dry season, the horizon being filled with distant thunder heads,
it was customary to burn what is called by the Indians real tobacco as
an offering to bring rain.

“On oceasions of this nature the people were notified by swift-footed

heralds that the children, or sons, of Thunder were in the horizon, and
that tobacco must be burned in order to get some rain.” ®

1From the National Geographic Magazine, Vol. VI, pages 35-62, April 25, 1894.
?These cases of weather making among the North American Indians were collected

for me by Dr. Fuller Walker, of the Weather Bureau, who searched through the

literature available in Washington.

250 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

As to the Muskingum, Heckewelder, in his Account of the Indians
of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1819, p. 229), says:

“There are jugglers, generally old men and women, who get their
living by pretending to bring down rain when wanted, and to impart
good | luck to bad hunters. In the summer of 1799 a most uncommon
drought happened in the Muskingum country (Ohio). An old man
was ‘applied to by the women to bring down rain, and, after various
ceremonies, declared that they should have rain enough. The sky had
been clear for nearly five weeks, and was equally clear when the Indian
made this declaration; but about 4 o’clock in the afternoon the horizon
became overcast, and, without any thunder or wind, it began to rain,
and continued to do so until the ground became thoroughly soaked.”
- Heckewelder adds that “experience had doubtless taught the jug-
gler to observe that certain signs in the sky and in the water were the
forerunners of rain.”

Among the Natchez, according to Father Charlevoix,! jugglers not
only pretended to cure the sick, but also professed to procure rain and
seasons favorable for the fruits of the earth. Their incantations were
often directed to the dispersion of clouds and the expulsion of evil
spirits from the bodies of the afflicted.

In the third report of the Bureau of Ethnology it is stated by J. Owen
Dorsey that ‘“* when the first thunder is heard in the spring of the year
the Elk people (among the Omaha Indians) call to their servants, the
Bear people, who proceed to the sacred tent of the Elk gens. When
the Bear people arrive one of them opens the sacred bag and, after
removing the sacred pipe, hands it to one of the Elk men, with some
of the tobacco from the elk bladder. Before the pipe is smoked it is
held toward the sky, and the thunder god is addressed. - - - ‘At
the conclusion of this ceremony the rain always ceases, and the Bear
people return to their homes.’”?

Catlin, in his “Life among the Indians” (p. 78), says that he found
that the Mandan had ‘rain makers” and also “rain stoppers,” who
were respected medicine men “from the astonishing facts of their
having made it rain in an extraordinary drought, and for having
stopped it raining when the rain was continuing to an inconvenient
length.” He adds:

“Tor this purpose, in a very dry time, the medicine men assembled
in the medicine lodge, and sitting around a fire in the center, from day
to day smoking and praying to the Great Spirit for rain, while a requi-
site number of young men volunteered to make it rain. Each one of
these, by ballot, takes his turn to mount to the top of the wigwam at
sunrise in the morning, with his bow and arrows in his hand and shield
on his arm, talking to the clouds and asking for rain, or ranting and
threatening the clouds with his bow, commanding it to rain. After
several day s of unsuccessful attempts have passed off in this way with

a clear sky, Someone more lucky than the rest happens to take his
stand on a day on which a black cloud will be seen moving up. When

he sees the rain actually falling he lets his arrow fly, and pointing says:
‘There! my friends, you have seen my arrow go. There is a hole in
that cloud. We shall soon have rain enough.’ When he comes down
he is a medicine man. The doctors give him a feast and a great cere-
mony and the doctor’s rattle. When the doctors commence rain mak-
ing they never fail to succeed, for they keep up the ceremony until the
rain begins to fall. Those who have once succeeded in making it rain
in the presence of the whole village never undertake it a second time.
They would rather give other young men a chance.”

A similar account of the Mandan ceremony is given by Mr. John
Frost in his book, ‘The Indians of North America” (New York, 1845,
p. 109). He says:

“Tt was inatimeof great drought that I once arrived at the Mandan
village on the Upper Missouri. The young and the old were crying out
that they should have no green corn. After a day or two the sky grew
a little cloudy in the west, when the medicine men assembled together
in great haste to make it rain. The tops of the wigwams were on
crowded. In the mystery lodge a fire was kindled, around which sa
the rain makers, burning Sw eet- smelling herbs, smoking the ioe
pipe, and calling on the Great Spirit to open the door of ‘the skies to let
out the rain. ‘At last one of the rain makers came out of the mystery
lodge and stood on the top of it with a spear in his hand, which he
prandished about in a commanding and threatening manner, lifting it
up as though he were about to hurl it at the heavens. He t: ilked loud
of the power of his medicine, holding up his medicine bag in one hand
and his spear in the other; but it was of no use, and he came down in
disgrace. For several days the same ceremony continued, uitil a rain

maker with a headdress of the skins of birds ascended the top of the
mystery lodge, with a bow in his hand and a quiver at his back. He
made a long speech, for the sky was growing dark, and it required no
great knowledge of the weather to foretell rain. He shot arrows to the
sunrise and sundown points of the heavens and also to the north and
south, in honor of the Great Spirit, who could send rain from all parts
of the sky. A fifth arrow he retained until it was almost certain that
rain was at hand. Then sending up the shaft from his bow with all his
might to make a hole in the dark cloud over his head, he cried aloud
for - the waters to pour down at his bidding and to drench him to the
skin. He was brandishing his bow in one hand and his medicine in
the other, when the rain came down in torrents.”

Among the Blackfeet Indians, according to W. P. Clark. in his
“Indian Sign Language” (Philadelphia, 1885, p. 72)—

“The medicine man has a separate lodge, which faces the east. He
fasts and dances to the sun, blowing his whistle. He is painted in dif-
ferent colors, and he must have no water, and only after dark can he
eat, and then only the inner bark of the cottonwood tree. A picture
of the sun is painted on his forehead, the moon, Ursa Major, ete., on his
body. The dance continues for four days, and should this medicine
man drink it is sure to cause rain, and if it [does not] rains no other
evidence of his weakness is wanted or taken. He is deposed as high
priest at once.” s

Mr. W. Noble, of Indian Territory, says that ‘the Choctaws, during
a severe drought, will fasten a fish to one of their number, who then
goes into the water and remains there every day for two weeks in order
252 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

to cause it to rain.” He adds that “in wet weather, if they wish the
rain to cease, they go to asand bank, put sand in a pan, and dry it over
a fire.”

Among the Moqui, according to Schooleraft—

‘‘There is a charm used for calling down rain. It consists of a small

quantity of wild honey wrapped up in the inner fold of the husk of the

maize. ‘To produce the effect desired it is necessary to take a piece of
the shuck which contained the wild honey, chew it, and spit it upon the
ground which needs the rain.”!

Capt. J.G. Bourke, in his “Snake dance of the Moqui” (p. 120), says:

“There was painted on the east wall a symbolical design, or ‘prayer,’
representing three rows of clouds in red and blue, from which depended
long, narrow, black and white stripes, typical of rain, while from right
and left issued long red and blue snakes, emblematic of lightning. This

yas a prayer to the god of clouds to send refreshing rains upon the

Moqui crops. - - - Yellow was used in all prayers for pumpkins, -

green for corn, and red for peaches.”

Among the Zuni, according to Stevenson, medicine sticks were
supposed to influence rain. These little sticks are found hidden
beneath the rafters of nearly every house in Zuni.’

Passing a little farther from home we find, in Acosta’s “ History of

the Indies,”* some accounts of rain producing and weather making
among the Peruvian natives. According to him a Peruvian king in his
lifetime caused a figure to be made wherein he was represented, which
they called Huaugue, which signifies brother. They carried this inage
to the wars and in procession for rain or fair weather, making sundry
feasts and sacrifices to it. They also pursued other methods. ‘In
matters of importance they offered up alpacas, hanging the beast by
the right fore leg, turning his eyes to the sun, speaking certain words
according to the quality of the sacrifice they slew, for if it were of
color their words were addressed to the god of thunder and lightning,
that they might want no water” (p. 341). If they wanted water, to
procure rain they set a black sheep tied in the middle of a plain,
pouring much chica about it, and giving it nothing to eat until it rained
(p. 376). This is practiced (says Acosta, 1571-1588) at this day in
many places in the month of October.

OTHER WEATHER MAKING.

What precedes relates to rain making or stopping. A somewhat
similar series of facts occur among the American Indians concerning
other elements of the weather, but their energies in this direction seem
to be expended chiefly in the control of the winds.

It appears that the Kansas gens of the Omaha are Wind people, and
to them is cape ially intrusted the control of the wind. Mr. J. Owen

Dorsey says the Kanze (Kansa or Kaw) gens of the Omaha tribe, being
Wind people, ‘flap their blankets to start a breeze.”! He adds that
when there is a blizzard the other Kansa tribe of Indian Territory beg
the members of the Wind gens to interpose, saying, ““O grandfather,
I wish good weather. Cause one of your children to be decorated.”
Then the youngest son of a Kanze man, say one about 4 feet high, is
chosen for the purpose, and painted with red paint. The youth rolls
over and over in the snow, reddening it for some distance all around
him. This is supposed to stop the blizzard.

The following account is from a book entitled The Fourteen loway
Indians (London, 1844), and relates to raising wind:

See eS.

“A packet ship with Indians on board, was becalmed for several days
near the English coast. It was decided to call upon the medicine man
to try the efficacy of his magical powers with the endeavor to raise
the wind. After the usual ceremony of a mystery feast, and various
invocations to the spirit of the wind and ocean, both were conciliated
by the sacrifice of many plugs of tobacco thrown into the sea, and ina
little time the wind began to blow, the sails were filled, and the vessel
soon wafted into port.”

The Indians also have many associations with thunder. Madam
Lucy Elliot Keeler, in a paper recently contributed to the American
Agriculturist for December, 1892, says:

“The Dakotas used to have a company of men who claimed the
exclusive power and privilege of fighting the thunder. Whenever a
storm which they wished to avert threatened, the thunder fighters
would take their bows and arrows, their magic drum, and a sort of
whistle made of the wing bone of a war eagle, and, thus armed, run out
and fire at the rising cloud, whooping, yelling, whistling, and beating
their drum to frighten it down again. One afternoon a heavy black
cloud came up, and they repaired to the top of a hill, where they
brought all their magic artillery into play against it; but the undaunted
thunder darted out a bright flash which struck one of the party dead
as he was in the very act of shaking his long-pointed lance against it.
After that they decided that no human power could quell the thunder.”

In the Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk-tales, published by George
Bird Grinnell, we find the following:

‘An old Pawnee Indian said: ‘Up north where we worshipped at the
time of the first thunder we never had cyclones. Down here [Indian
Territory|, now that this worship has been given up, we have them.’ ”

The Indians in some cases have ideas of controlling the weather more
generally, and Dablin, in his Relation of the Voyages, Discoveries, and
Death of Father James Marquette,” writing in 1671-1675, says:

: “Tt now only remains for me to speak of the calumet, than which
there is nothing among the Indians [i. e., the Illinois] more mysterious
_ ormore esteemed. - - - They esteem it particularly because they
‘regard it as the calumet of the sun, and in fact they present it to him
FE to smoke when they wish to obtain calm, or rain, or fair weather.”

254 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

Even the control of fog has been attempted, as shown by the follow-
ing quotation from Dorsey’s account of the Turtle subgens of the
Omaha: !

“In the time of a fog the men of this subgens drew the figure of a
turtle on the ground with its face to the south. On the head, tail,
middle of the back, and on each leg were placed small pieces of a (red)
breech cloth, with some tobacco. This they imagined would make the
fog disappear very soon.”

But it is not only the pagan Indians who have tried their hand at
weather making. Their Christianized descendants have also tried to
control these operations of nature. In the transition times between
paganism and Christianity occurred some events which throw a curious
and instructive side light on this question, and two of these I will now
give. ;

Mr. Parkman says that while the Jesuits labored with the Hurons a
severe drought came upon the fields. The sorcerers put forth their
utmost power, and from the tops of the houses yelled incessant invoca-
tions to the spirits. All was in vain. A renowned ‘rain maker,”
seeing his reputation tottering under his repeated failures, bethought
hin of accusing the Jesuits, and gave out that the red color of the cross
which stood before their house seared away the bird of thunder and
caused him to fly another way. On this a clamor arose. The popular
ire turned against the priests, and the obnoxious cross was condemned
to be cut down. The Jesuits said: “If the red color of the cross
frightens the bird of thunder, paint it white.” This was done, but the
clouds still kept aloof. The Jesuits followed up their advantage.
‘Your spirits can not help you. Now ask the aid ot Him who made the
world.” Heavy rains occurring soon after, it is said that many Indians
believed in the white man’s Great Spirit and presented themselves to
the priests for baptism (Alice Elliot Keeler).

A somewhat similar story is told of Peru by Acosta. It appears
that the Santa Cruz Indians became Christians because of the success
of a renegade soldier in making rain. This soldier, seeing the native
Indians ‘in a great extremity for water, and that to procure rain they
used many superstitious ceremonies, according to their usual manner,”
said to them that if they would do as he said they should presently
have rain, which they willingly offered to perform. ‘Then the soldier
made a great cross, which he placed on a high and eminent place, com-
manding them to worship 1t and to demand water, which they did. A
wonderful thing to see, there presently fell such an abundance of rain,
as the Indians took so great devotion to the holy cross as they fled
unto it in all their necessities, and obtained all they demanded, so as
they broke down their idols.”?

The quotation from Acosta indicates the attitude of the Indians of
middle latitudes on this subject. This attitude, as is well known to

those familiar with the Latin-American countries, is preserved
unchanged among their descendants. Interesting illustrations of it can
be picked up any day even as far north as Arizona and New Mexico,
and every traveler in Latin-America has several at his disposal. As
the quintessence of them all I present a clipping from the New York
Tribune, to which my attention was called by Dr. T. C. Mendenhall. Se
non é vero é ben trovato. The extract runs as follows:

‘In the department of Castafas there had been no rain for nearly a
year, and the people were brought to such a pass that they were actu-
ally dying for thirst, to say nothing of the total destruction of all crops
and other agricultural industries.

‘““K1 Pueblo Catolico, of New San Savaldor, prints a number of reso-
lutions promulgated by the prineipalalealde of the town and department
of Castanas.. They are as follows:

‘¢¢Considering that the Supreme Creator has not behaved well in this
province, as in the whole of last year only one shower of rain fell; that
in this summer, notwithstanding all the processions, prayers, and
praises, it has not rained at all, and consequently the crops of Castanas,
on which depend the prosperity of the whole department, are entirely
ruined, it is decreed:

“Article 1. If within the peremptory period of eight days from the
date of this decree rain does not fall abundantly, no one will go to mass
or Say prayers.

“<sArt, 2. If the drought continues eight days more the churches and
chapels shall be burned, and missals, rosaries, and other objects of
devotion will be destroyed.

“Art, 3. If, finally, in a third period of eight days it shall not rain,
all the priests, friars, nuns, and saints, male and female, will be beheaded.
And for the present permission is given for the commission of all sorts
of sin in order that the Supreme Creator may understand with whom
he has to deal.’

‘‘The most remarkable feature of this affair is the fact that four days
after these resolutions were passed the heaviest rainfall known for years
was precipitated on the burning community.”

II.—FoLKLORE REMNANTsS.!

Among the many curious remnants of folklore which we find in con-
nection with the snbject of weather making none is more curious than
the idea that birds “call for rain.” Whenever this expression is used
the evident intention is,as is well known to those who are familiar
with this mode of speech, to express the idea that they demand the
rain, and that rain is likely to follow because of this demand. For
instance, the cali of the robin, heard so frequently, is interpreted to
mean, ‘“ Bring out your skillet, bring out your skillet, the rain will fill
it.” In popular estimation this is a “call for rain.” This association
with our American robin is very general. In Maine and Massachu-
setts they are said to “sing for rain” (Miss F. D. Bergen). The

‘This series of associations of natural objects with weather making in the sense
of a weather fetich—a weather maker, not simply a weather forecaster—is taken

from the collections of weather proverbs made by the Signal Service and Weather
Bureau.
256 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

American quail is also said to “call for rain,” and its cry is inter-
preted to be, ‘“‘ More wet, more wet” (Dr. Robert Fletcher). The call
of the loon is given the same meaning in so widely separated localities
as Cape Breton, the State of Washington, and Florida (Mr. C. A.
Smith). The same power is attributed, generally in the Old World,
to many other birds, as ducks, geese, crows, and ravens. From Penn-
sylvania (William Schrock) comes the quaint conception expressed in
the following rhyme:

The goose and the gander

Begin to meander ;

The matter is plain,

They are dancing for rain.

But the birds are not only effective in making rain; they can exert
still greater influence. The kildee, or killdeer plover, is said, in Mary-
land, to call up the wind by his ery of ‘ Kildee! kildee!” while to kill
him would cause a violent storm (Dr. Fletcher). The Kiowa of Indian
Territory attributes to the killdeer the bringing of spring (James
Mooney, Washington).

Another popular association between animals and rain is the idea
that by certain treatment of some animals definite results in the way
of rain making can be obtained. For instance, on Santee River, in
South Carolina, it is believed that if you catch an alligator, tie him to a
tree, and whip him to death it will be certain to bring rain (Dr. W. W.
Anderson). This seems to be a fragment of negro folklore. In Massa-
chusetts it is said that if you see or step on a frog it is a sure sign of
rain, while in Maine they say, “ Kill a frog and it will rain before
morning” (Miss F. D. Bergen). This association of rain with the toad
is general over the United States. Still another folklore remnant of
the same sort relates to snakes. It is a curious fact that among many
races the snake is supposed to have some relations with the weather.
Mr. James Mooney says, ‘“‘ The belief in a connection between rain and
snakes is quite general among Indian tribes. The snake dance is
intended to bring rain. The Indians of Indian Territory turn a dead
snake on its back to bring rain.” It is a piece of negro folklore that
hanging a dead snake on a tree will bring rain ina few hours. Farther
northward it runs, “Hang up asnake skin and it will bring rain.”
This refers to the cast-off skin. In northern Illinois the expression is,
‘Hang up a snake’s cast-off skin on the crab-apple tree and it will
bring rain.” The snake has played a very important part in weather
making, and to it has been attributed many other magical powers.

An interesting series of superstitions with reference to weather
making are those which are common to sailors, who have a well-known
half-serious belief that one can raise wind by whistling. In New-
foundland they say, ‘Stick a knife in the mainmast and whistle, and
it must produce wind.” In Newfoundland, also, they have an idea
that if a vessel is becalmed wind can be produced by throwing over-

|
;
WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 257

board a half-penny. Another notion, common also to the same sailors,
is that if you put the end of the sheet overboard it will produce wind,
and that if you hit it three times across the thwarts it will stop the
rain. Mr. Kinahan, illustrating the sincerity of the belief in the

| power of whistling in raising wind, says: “In a dead calm you may
whistle for wind, except in a dangerous place. Crossing from Skib-
bereen to Clear Island, County Cork, a friend of mine was very nearly
getting into a row for inadvertently whistling.” This belief is very
general. In California sailors say that one may whistle softly for a
breeze, but that it is dangerous to indulge in loud or thoughtless whist-
ling as it may bring a gale. Here the skipper scratches the mizzen-
mast for a fair wind.

Sailors profess great confidence in the ability of the cat to raise the
wind, and are accustomed to say that the cat carries the wind in her
tail. Cats have the general reputation of being very weatherwise. On

_ shipboard, especially, it is considered imprudent to provoke a eat,
because she is assumed to have a certain share in the arrangement of
_ the weather. Imprudence of this sort appears, however, to have no
terrors for the Soudanese in western Java, for, when rain is needed,
they form in procession with gongs and clappers, take their cats to the
nearest streams, where the animals are sprinkled and bathed.

Many sailors also have a very curious notion that hens’ eggs on board
ship produce contrary winds, and on the occurrence of such winds they ,
are likely to insist that the eggs must be thrown overboard.

_ Another of these folklore remnants of sailors is the idea that there
} is a distinct relation between the albatross and wind. This superstition
:

has been embalmed in most attractive form by Coleridge in his Lay
of the Ancient Mariner. One stanza runs as follows:

That made the breeze to blow.
Oh, wretch! said they, the bird to slay

: For all averred I had killed the bird
%
4 That made the breeze to blow.

In addition to the above folklore remnants there are some methods
which are purely magical. The earliest reference of this sort which I
have found is the case of Sdpater. He is said to have caused a horrible
famine in Asia Minor by “chaining the winds.” He was put to death
by Constantine—probably for this reason, as this crime was forbidden
by the laws of the Twelve Tables, as well as later in the Theodosian
code.

The association of weather making with the witches in Finland is
familiar. Steele, in his Medieval Lore, from Bartholomew Anglicus
(about 1260), referring to the people in Finland, says:

it
"

“The men - - - occupy themselves with witchcraft, and so to
men that sail by their coasts, and also to men that abide with them
for default of wind; they prefer wind to sailing, and so they sell wind.

They used to make a clue [skein] of thread, and they make divers knots
to be knit therein, and then they command to draw out of the clue to
three knots, more or less, as they will have the wind more soft or strong;
and for their misbelief fiends move the air and arise strong tempests,
or soft, as they draweth of the clue more or less knots; and sometimes
they move the wind so strongly that the wretches that believe in such
doings are drowned by the rightful doom of God.”

The elder bush is especially associated with weather making. The
witches were thought to make bad weather by stirring water with
branches of the elder.

Still another remnant of ancient superstition is, according to Aubrey
(1696), to the effect that ““On Malvern Hills, in Worcestershire, and
thereabouts, when they farm their corn and want wind they ery ‘Youle!
youle! youle!’ to invite it, which word, no doubt, is a corruption of
AXolus, the god of the winds.” (Dr. R. Fletcher.)

IJJ.—PHYSICAL METHODS.
WEATHER MAKERS.

What precedes relates to purely psychic methods of controlling the
weather or the elements. The collection which it presents has been
made in no spirit of disrespect, but solely in that of the collection and
scientific comparison of facts. I have great respect for all sincere reli-
gious belief and great interest in folklore remnants—fragments of what

‘have once been great psychic structures—ruins about the tombs of the
ancients. What follows is intensely fin de siécle and treats of the par-
adoxer in a well-developed stage. The paradoxer deserves a respect to
be measured by the sufficiency of his information and the correctness
of his logic. He is a possible benefactor of the world, a potential great
man. Galileo was a paradoxer—very unwelcome to the Aristotelians
of his time. Kepler was a rank paradoxer to his contemporaries, and
Newton was a paradoxer to the Cartesians of his day.

Time will net be spent on rash paradoxers in the field of weather
making. We shall only consider those who have some such guarantee
as a patent, an appropriation, or genuine learning. As an illustration
of the rash paradoxers, I will simply mention two, one the man who
proposed to destroy blizzards by a line of coal stoves along our northern
boundary from Red River to the Continental Divide, and the other a
man who proposed to ameliorate the weather of New England and the
Canadian provinces by damming the Strait of Belle Isle.

WEATHER MAKING.

We pass first to the treatment for tornadoes. M. Weyher has made
laboratory tornadoes of a mild and gentle character, but they contain
no suggestion as to how to treat this pathologic phenomenon of the
weather.

A treatment has been suggested, which is heroic and may possibly be
effective. It is, however, a local application, and the chief difficulty is
to have itready when and where wanted. The method proposed is that
of a great explosion in the tornado itself. Many plans have been sug-
gested, and two patents have been granted. I will consider the first,
that of Mr. J. B. Atwater, of Chicago (No. 370845, 1887). A strong
box with a double bottom is firmly supported on a pole erected at a
suitable point, probably a mile or so southwest of the village to be pro-
tected. The upper bottom is fixed, and the space above it is filled with
an explosive and firmly closed. In holes in the upper bottom are
inserted fulminating caps, and these project below its lower surface.
The lower bottom slides up and down. Then, if a high wind drives the
lower bottom against the upper with such force as to flash the caps,
the explosion follows, and the tornado (if present) suffers the effects
which a tornado will suffer when a powerful explosion occurs in its
immediate vicinity.

What these effects will be we do not yet know. It is said, with
enough repetition to make it fairly worthy of credence, that a cannon
fired into a waterspout destroys the latter. If such a disturbance
destroys the gentler waterspout, it may be worth while to try a larger
one on the more intense tornado. Perhaps it will be effective; we can
be more positive when it has been tried.

Many other schemes have been proposed for the control of the ele-
ments of the weather. Most of them have an objectionable side, notably
in rain making, which can be pointed out here as well as elsewhere.
It is this: The phenomenon to be produced probably can not be con-
trolled as to area covered, and may occur where it is not wanted. If
we are clothing merchants and I carry over too large a stock of winter
clothing into late spring, [ may order a cold wave to help me reduce
my stock. But you may have exhausted your winter stock and wish to
have warm weather to start your summer stock. My cold wave affects
your trade seriously; I may be sued for damages. Such a state of
things is said to have actually happened in Kansas, where arain maker
was refused payment by lis employer because of failure of contract,
and was sued by a neighbor of the employer because his crops were
washed out of the ground. Should the weather maker prosper he will
often find himself very much embarrassed until our lawmakers have
caught up with our advance in the arts, and the volume of the statute
books has been materially enlarged.

RAIN MAKING.

We come now to the subject of rain making, which has attracted
more attention, been more tried, and has more history than any other

one method of weather making. It has attained the dignity of at least

ee

two patents and two Congressional appropriations. A bibliography of
the subject is appended, containing sixty-four titles, two of which refer

to books devoted to this subject, by Power and Gathman, respectively.
260 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

First method.—To clear the way for the American history we may

note here as method No. 1 a French method reported in the Comptes
tendus for October 23, 1893. M. Baudouin sent a note to the French

Academy of Sciences in which he wrote that in Algeria, earlier in that
year, he used a kite to obtain electric connection with a cloud at the
height of about 4,000 feet. As soon as this connection was made a
few drops of rain fell and a local fog formed. These disappeared on
breaking the connection, presumably by withdrawing the kite from the
cloud. M. Baudouin had obtained some rain in Algeria in 1876 by the
same method. I know of no other experiments in this direction, nor do
they involve anything in opposition to knowledge already acquired.
It is a fair field for experiment, and it is remarkable that M. Baudouin’s
experiments have not attracted more attention in the United States.

Second method.—A second proposed method of obtaining rain is by
means of great fires. With this proposal the name of a Pennsylvania
meteorologist, James P. Espy, is inseparably connected. In 1841 he
published a Philosophy of Storms, in which he enlarged on this idea
previously propounded by him in oceasional articles dating from 1838,
The idea was not new, for Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit missionary in South
America, in his Account of the Abipones (first published in 1784),
says that these Indians produced rain by setting fire to the plains.
Indeed the idea has been and is generally entertained, and in the West
has crystallized into the weather proverb, “A very large prairie fire will
cause rain.” To show something of the character of the testimony on
which Espy relied we shall quote the story of George Mackay as given
in a letter to Espy and printed by him in his Fourth Meteorological
Report (pp. 32-34). Mr. Mackay says:

“In 1845 I was engaged in the public survey on the Atlantic coast
of Florida. Sometime in April (the time of the dry season there,
which lasts up to June) I was running a township line between lati-
tudes 26° and 27°, about 5 miles from the sea. The weather was
oppressively warm that day. There was not air enough stirring to
move anaspen leaf. We found our line must pass through a@ Saw-grass
pond, containing about 500 acres. In ponds of this description the
green grass at the top shoots up from 5 to 6 feetin height. and when the
region has not been for some years swept clear by fires the dead and
dry growths of preceding seasons accumulate under the latest growth,
and are often found there from 2 to 4 feet in depth. They are exceed-
ingly inflammable. When lighted in dry weather they burn with fright-
ful rapidity and violence. Whenever, in our explorations, we came upon
a place of this description we could only pass our line by cutting away
the lofty fresh grass and wading (or rather wallowing) through the
mud and the underrubbish. On the day in question we determined,
as it was so hot, that to save ourselves trouble we would burn our way
through. I had then no thought of your theory. In order to prevent
the flames from running over the woods, through which we were
obliged to pass, we communicated them at once to both sides of the
spot we desired to open, that they might converge and combine in its
center and not scatter latterally. In a very few minutes an awful blaze
swept over the entire surface which we had marked out for our purpose.

ae ee

We then crossed our line. Ere we had proceeded over 40 chains a
delightful breeze sprang up and cooled the atmosphere, and presently
a refreshing shower sparkled in the bright rays of the sun. <All this
excited no further observation than that it had not rained there before
for along time. I myself did not observe any smoke nor the formation
of any cloud.

‘‘Our work went on for some days without a repetition of our short
cut at pioneering, some objection having been made when another burn-
ing was proposed, because the first one had rendered it difficult, after
crossing the lines, to distinguish the white men from the negroes. At
length, however, the pleasant breezes ceased, which had made the
weather for a while endurable, and the still air and intense heat
returned, and with them constant murmurs from the men, especially the
negroes, whose duty it was to cut lines and mark trees. We were now
on the contines of a saw-grass pond, and a much more formidable one
than any we had yet encountered. Being surrounded by a cypress
swamp, we concluded that it had never yet been burned. My assistant,
Capt. Alexander Mackay, who was standing by my side, mentioned his
having, in our late contlagration, observed the formation of a cloud at
the apex of thesmoke. Headded that it had frequently since brought
to his mind some account which he had read of Professor Espy’s theory.
He suggested that there could not be a better opportunity than this to
put the theory to the test, and being fond of a joke, he said he would
like to astonish the superstitious negroes and to make them believe
that he could call together the clouds and bring down rain. So we
determined to make the experiment.

“When our party was all gathered at the halting place complaints
of the extreme heat went around, and all unanimously agreed that a
more confined and oppressive day had never been known to them. To
these complaints the usual wishes for ‘a little breath of air’ and ‘a few
drops of rain’ succeeded. ‘Cut through this pond,’ exclaimed the Cap-
tain, ‘and I will bring you more than a few drops of rain; Vl give you
a plentiful shower and a breeze, too, that shall wake you up. Come,
boys, cut away, and when you’ve done you shall wash off the dust in a
cold bath from the skies.’ They stared up and around; not a cloud as
large as a man’s hand was to be seen, and they looked back at the Cap-
tain with a good-natured grin of incredulity. ‘Ho, ho! ha, ha! Cap-
tain make cloud out o’ nuffin’; he, he! Captain bring water all dis way
from desea? Ho, ho! ha, ha! he, he!? Whereupon the Captain affected
to be very indignant. To hasten his victory I ordered the grass to be
Set on fire. The flames soared forthwith above the tallest trees; a
dense volume of smoke mounted upward spirally; the grass soon dis-
appeared; we crossed over. As thesmoky column broke and the cloud
began to form, the Captain traced a large circle in the sand around
him, and placed himself in its center, making fantastic figures and
forming cabalistic phrases out of broken French. Still was the cloud
unnoticed. All eyes were riveted upon the Captain, who stood gazing
at the earth and shaping outlines of devils there. At this juncture
came aroll of distant thunder. Every glance instantly turned upward;
a cloud was spreading there; the thunders increased; the lightnings
flashed more vividly; the knees of the negroes shook together with
alarm, Already was the rain descending, and in torrents, though the
clear sky could be seen in all directions under the cloud. The Captain
meanwhile maintained his mystical attitude and continued his wild and
extraordinary evolutions. Some of the whites, who were in the secret
of the hoax, fell upon their knees, and were imitated by the negroes,
262 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

whose fears augmenting as the storm grew fiercer, with clasped hands
fastened upon the Captain a stare of awe and deprecation. In short,
the scene presented a more complete triumph of philosophy over igno-
rance than I could have supposed it possible to have been produced
anywhere in the nineteenth century, and most especially anywhere in —
our enlightened Republic. %

“We often fired the saw-grass marshes afterwards, and whenever —
there was no wind stirring we were sure to get a shower; and I say —
with perfect confidence that we never had a shower in April or Mayat
any other time. Sometimes when there was a breeze it would carry
the smoke toward the horizon, where there would seem to be a fall of
rain.” }

Espy dwelt on this theory with great devotion, and in 1845 pub-
lished a special letter addressed “‘To the friends of science,” in which
he proposed a plan for practical rain production. As the paper in
question is now very rare and his plan possesses some features of inter-
est, I quote it here:

‘¢ Let masses of timber to the amount of 40 acres for every 20 miles
be prepared and fired simultaneously every seven days in the summer
on the west of the United States, in a line of 600 or 700 miles long from
north to south; then the following results seem highly probable, but
not certain until the experiment is made: A rain of greac length north
and south will commence near or on the line of fire; this rain will
travel eastward; it will not break up till it reaches far into the
Atlantic Ocean; it will rain over the whole country east of the place of
beginning; it will rain only a short time in any one place; it will not
rain again until the next seventh day; it will rain enough and not too
much in any one place; it will not be attended with violent wind,
neither on land nor on the Atlantic Ocean; there will be no hail nor tor-
nadoes at the time of the general rain nor intermediate; there will be
no destructive floods, nor will the waters ever become very low; there
will be no more oppressive heats nor injurious colds; the farmers and
mariners will always know before the rains when they will commence
and when they will terminate; all epidemic diseases originating from
floods and subsequent droughts will cease; the proceeds of agriculture
will be greatly increased, and the health and happiness of the citizens
will be much promoted. These, I say, are the probable—not certain—
results of the plan proposed—a plan which could be carried into oper-
ation for a sum which would not amount to half a cent a year to each
individual in the United States; a plan, which, if successful, would
benefit in a high degree not merely the landsman, but every mariner
that plies the Atlantic. If this scheme should appear too gigantic to
commence with let the trial be first made along the Alleghany Moun-
tains; and let 40 acres of ‘four 10-acre lots be fired every seven days
through the summer in each of the counties of McKean, Clearfield,
Cambria, and Somerset, in Pennsylvania; Allegany, in Maryland, and
Hardy, Pendleton, Bath, Alleghany, and Montgomery, in Virginia.
The 10-acre lots should be, as nearly as convenient, from 1 to 4 miles
apart, in the form of a square, so that the up-moving column of air
which shall be formed over them may have a wide base, and thus may
ascend to a considerable height before it may be leaned out of the per-
pendicular by any wind which may exist at the time.”

Espy’s theory was practically the modern convective theory of storms,
and to this most worthy student of science is due the credit of calling

- effective attention to the part which the condensation of aqueous vapor
plays in the mechanism of storms.

Third method.—Another proposed method of making rain artificially
is that of L. Gathman, of Chicago, patented in 1891 (No. 462795). His
method is to “suddenly chill the atmosphere by rapid evaporation, and
it is also advisable to produce a heavy concussion in connection with
the cooling in order to set the different air currents in motion. It is
obvious that sudden and rapid evaporation in the upper regions of
the atmosphere could be accomplished in various ways by the evapora-
tion of various highly compressed gases; but the evaporation conse-
quent upon the release of liquefied carbonic acid gas is thought to be
the most efficient.” He proceeds:

‘¢In accordance, therefore, with my invention, liquefied carbonic acid
gas is liberated in the upper regions of the atmosphere and will, of
course, instantly evaporate and spread out in a sheet of vapor of an
extremely low temperature and produce a cloud. The surrounding
atmosphere will be chilled by its proximity to the cold vapor, and the
moisture in the atmosphere will be condensed thereby. The condensa-
tion takes place in large quantities and with great rapidity, so that a

a ° ete . > =
cloud 1s formed that will precipitate a rainfall upon the earth.

‘The liquefied carbonic acid gas can be confined in a suitable shell
. or casing, said casing also to contain an explosive—gunpowder, dyna-
mite, ete.—which is thrown or shot into the upper regions of the atmos-
| phere and there exploded by a time fuse. A balloon, moreover, could
be employed to elevate the shell or casing containing the liquefied
carbonic acid gas, and the explosion to liberate the gas could be made
by an electric current controlled by persons upon the earth.”

F Mr. Gathman also published a little book in which were reproduced,
with approval, Professor Newcomb’s article entitled, “Can we make it
— rain?” and Professor Houston’s “Artificial rain making.” In this book
we learn that Mr. Gathman has been occupied with the use of con-
densed carbon anhydride to cooi heavy guns, and was led to his theory
by the results of his experiments with ordnance. He also experimented
on his method of rain making, and says (p. 38):

‘“‘In making some experiments last year, a shell filled with liquefied
carbonic acid gas was exploded at a height of 600 feet; a cloud was
produced in the clear sky at once, and, floating along on a current of
air, was visible for miles. This experiment was made in July, 1890,
and since that time I have made sufficient other experiments to satisfy
myself that I can produce rain whenever necessary, or at will. Exper-
iments made in my astronomical observatory, at a height of only 75
feet, have proven that bythe evaporation of liquefied carbonic acid gas
a rain shower on a small scale can be produced with but a small quan-
tity of the gas. When completed arrangements have been made, the
experiments mentioned will be seen to be but a step to the practical
illustration on a grand seale.”

It appears that in Gathman’s method the explosion plays a very sub-
ordinate part; but in the method to follow the explosion is the main, if
not the only, thing.

Fourth method.—The concussion theory is probably an old one,
though it is not correct to refer it to Plutarch, as is sometimes done.

264 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

In his life of Marius, referring to the battle with the Teutons near Aix,
in July, 102 B.C., Plutarch says: “Extraordinary rains pretty gen-
erally fall after great battles; whether it be that some divine power
thus washes and cleanses the polluted earth with showers from above,
or that moist and heavy evaporations steaming forth from the blood
and corruption thicken the air, which naturally is subject to alteration
from the smallest causes.”! Here are two distinct suggestions for rain
making, but not that of concussion. ;

The first elaborate treatment of the concussion theory appears to
have been by Edward Powers, civil engineer, who published in 1890 a
book on the relations of battles to rainfall. The first edition was
printed in Chicago in 1871, but most of the edition was destroyed by
the great fire in that city, which also destroyed the stereotype plates.
The latest issue seen by me contains an inset of 15 pages devoted to
a criticism of Professor Newcomb’s article already mentioned. The
aim of this book is to prove that great battles or heavy cannonading
are usually soon followed by rainfall. A fair criticism of the book is

that such phenomena are not invariably followed by rain. The coinci-

dences could be explained by the fact that in the season of military
operations rain is usually falling somewhere in eastern United States;
that in fact it is not clear but that the rain is a pure coincidence. The
argument is not conclusive. Indeed, it is only fair to say that under
the conditions involved it could not be made conclusive. Mr. Powers,
however, did not despond, but used his utmost endeavors to bring the
matter to a test. For this purpose he persuaded Senator Farwell, in
1874, to present a petition to Congress asking that the theory be tried.
This, with a previous petition to which he refers, seems to have been
without response on the part of Congress.

Later, and apparently independently, the matter was taken up by
Gen. Daniel Ruggles, of Fredericksburg, Va., who obtained a patent
in 1880 (No. 230067) on making rain by explosions in the clouds. His
claim runs:

“The nature of my invention consists in sending one or more balloons
into the cloud realms, said balloon or balloons carrying torpedoes and
cartridges charged with explosives, and there to explode or detonate
them by magneto-electric or electric force through metallic wire, tex-
tile cordage, or by the fuse, or by mechanical force, in order to precipt-
tate rainfall by concussion or vibration of the atmosphere.”

General Ruggles succeeded in bringing the matter before Congress,
but did not succeed in getting an appropriation. His plan was much
discussed in the newspapers at the time, but does not seem to have
reached the experimental stage. _

Senator Farwell, however, continued his interest in the matter, and
in 1890 finally succeeded in obtaining an appropriation, first of $2,000,

then of $7,000, for carrying on the experiments, some of which he had
already had made at his own expense. The appropriation assigned the
conduct of the experiments to the Department of Agriculture, and the
Secretary selected R. G. Dyrenforth for the work. The experiments
were carried on in the vicinity of Washington and in Texas. <A report
from Mr. Dyrenforth was published by Congress in 1892. At the next
session of Congress another appropriation of $10,000 was made for this
purpose, of which the sum of $4,913.59 was expended, as before, under
Dyrenforth’s direction, the remainder having been covered back into
the Treasury.

Mr. Dyrenforth’s methods were highly ingenious. He used a variety
of explosives, on the ground and in the air, by great single explosions
and by volleys. He introduced many novelties, among them that of
exploding the gas in the balloon itself when high in the air. His con-
clusions, as stated by himself in his first report, were (p. 59):

“First. That when a moist cloud is present, which, if undisturbed,
would pass away without precipitating its moisture, the jarring of the
cloud by concussions will cause the particles of moisture in suspension to
agglomerate and fall in greater or less quantity, according to the degree
of moistuess of the air in and beneath the cloud.

“Second. That by taking advantage of those periods which frequently
occur in droughts, and in most if not in all sections of the United States
where precipitation is insufficient for vegetation, and during which
atmospheric conditions favor rainfall, without there being actual rain,
precipitation may be caused by concussion.

“Third. That under the most unfavorable conditions for precipita-
tion, conditions which need never be taken in operations to produce
rain, storm conditions may be generated and rain be induced, there
being, however, a wasteful expenditure of both time and material in
overcoming unfavorable conditions.”

His second report has not been published, but I infer that his second
series of observations were believed by him to confirm the results of the
first.

Mr. Dyrenforth generally omitted one check which he might well
have employed, and which I personally urged him to employ. Experi-

‘ments of this sort, made in the free air, with the accompanying condi-

tions not under control, should be accompanied with every possible
check; and one self-evident and very necessary one is the observation
of a physicist familiar with the meteorologic side of physics. Such an
expert (Mz. G. E. Curtis) accompanied the party in its first experiments.
His report (except the bare meteorologic record made during the exper-
iments) does not accompany Dyrenforth’s document. It was pre-
sented, however, to the Philosophical Society of Washington, and was
printed elsewhere. Mr. Curtis says, substantially, that an explosion in
a cloud brings down a few scattering drops of rain, and this may
happen even with an explosion on the ground, if heavy. Otherwise he
says there was norain making. It is but fair to say that with Mr.
Dyrenforth’s report are given the reports of his assistants, Mr. John
266 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.

T. Ellis, Lieut.S. A. Dyer, and Mr. Eugene Fairchild, and they were
stronger in the expression of a belief that rain was successfully made
than is Mr. Dyrenforth; and there are also many favorable quotations
from spectators.

Prof. A. Macfarlane, ef the University of Texas, was present as an
uninvited guest during the elaborate experiments near San Antonio on
Friday, November 25, 1892, beginning at 4 p.m. The sky was from
time to time overcast, and the natural conditions were not unfavorable
for rain. Many explosions were made without rain until late in the
evening, from which point I will take up the story in Professor Macfar-
lane’s own words, as given in a letter to the New York World Decem-
ber 4, 1892:

‘‘ At 10.15 a balloon was sent up and was lost in the darkness; when
it exploded a very large area of light was seen, as if the explosion had
occurred inside a cloud. There was no fall of rain at the camp, and
nobody was stationed below the spot where the balloon exploded.

““T consider this the only experiment that was worth making, yet no

care was taken to observe whether rain did fall. It is conceivable that
the explosion of a 12-foot balloon inside acloud ready to precipitate may
jar the particles so as to quicken the dropping of the rain. This was
the idea of Ruggles. But to test whether some rain can be drawn down
in this manner from a rain cloud does not suit the ideas of cranks who
wish to get a large something out of an absolute nothing.

“At 10.45 a mist became just perceptible. The General issued an
order to get ready the rain gauge. The boys hurried up a balloon,
which was nearly ready, but it had no effect on that mist.

‘At 11.40 the mist ceased, and the stars appeared in places nearly
overhead, The General apparently felt that things were going against
him, for he suggested to the Doctor to put a small. piece of dynamite in
the shells, and also to try the ettect of an explosion down at the springs.

“* At 12.30 a 12-foot balloon went well into the cloud, but no rain
effect.

‘“‘At 1 o’clock, the time when operations were to be suspended for the
night, it was fair, with some stars visible, and the boys were preparing
one more balloon. Colonel King remarked that it would be necessary
to keep up the operations for forty-eight hours. I retired to a room in
the hotel, from which I could see the operations.

“At 1.30 I heard a slight shout from the balloon boys, and I could
hear the rain pattering on the roof. The General, who had also retired
to the hotel, threw open the window and called out: ‘Hurry up, boys.’
After ten minutes the balloon was exploded, and the rain almost
immediately diminished so as to be scarcely perceptible. When the
explosion occurred I had my head out of the window. The hotel, a
frame house, shook considerably, but there was no breaking of glass
or any of the effects produced by a powerful explosion on “the solid

earth.

‘At 1.50 the General went out to observe, and I heard him say:
‘There is a beautiful rain to the north of us and to the west of us.’

‘“At 2 the rain had entirely ceased, and the last of the operations
consisted of two shells fired in succession at 2.05,”

Professor Macfarlane is a competent physicist. He was trained in
Edinburgh, and has, I believe, no such appreciation of humor as to

make him unconsciously color his report. His conclusions were adverse
to the rain makers.

Referring in general to the experiments in Texas, one fact has been
generally overlooked. The rainfall in western Texas is always small,
but it is subject to its maxima and minima, dike other regions. Now,
there is a rainfall season in July and August in Arizona and New
Mexico, and this reaches western Texas. Thirty per cent of the annual
rainfall descends in these two months along the eastern border of New
Mexico and in the western angle of Texas. At El Paso this percentage
is 40. This maximum passes gradually eastward and is found in the
southeastern part n September. The experiments in the western part
of Texas in 1891 were in September, fairly in the time of this maxi-
mum. There is another maximum of rainfall in Texas in November.
This is in the northeastern part of the State. The second series of
rainfall experiments in Texas was in November, 1892, at San Antonio.
The maximum here occurs in September, but there is in November an
average (for twenty-four years) of 2.5 inches, or one-twelfth of the
annual 30.6 inches. There is a high relative probability of rain nat-
urally in September in the region of the experiments in 1891, and there
is an even chance of it in the region of 1892. To test the theory of
rain making in Texas the months might have been better chosen; yet
it is but fair to say that the rainfall in western Texas is very fluctu-
ating, aS it comes generally in local storms.

Fifth method.—There is another method of rain making which is still
a mystery, but which deserves mention because it has been submitted
to actual test. I have not been given permission to use names in this
case, and will only guarantee that the letter which I quote came from
a high official of a railway company and is worthy of the credence
which an official business letter of this sort should carry with it. This
gentleman, under date of August 22, 1893, wrote to me as follows:

“DEAR Sir: Your letter, August 10, - - - has been referred to
me. In reply thereto, we have no published reports concerning rain-
making experiments such as mentioned by you. Whiie these experi-
ments have been made by a couple of employees of this company, we
can say but little about them ourselves. These parties claimed to be
able to cause rainfall by artificial means, and we have furnished them
with materials, together with transportation facilities, more or less all
the time since the early part of May, they having experimented in some
eighteen or twenty different locations, and in each case we have had
more or less rainfall. In nearly every instance we can but feel there is
something in their claim. We have had from one-half to 3 or 3§ inch
falls of rain, covering a section of country from 25 to 90 miles in length
and 10 to 30 miles wide, all owing to the direction of the wind, and in
some cases at times when there was no moisture in sight or known until
they began operations, and then only throughout the section over which
their own rainfall extended.

‘““T presume the operators themselves have kept a record of their
work, and results of same, at each of the different points where they
have been located, and should you desire I will have them make a state-

ment showing what they themselves feel they. have accomplished. We
have been slow to believe there was anything in this business, but at
the same time must admit that they are either very fortunate in reach-
ing the different points where they have experimented just in time to
have rain storms, or they have certainly hit upon the right thing in the
way of rain making.”

The process [ do not know, but a humorous railway man, personally
cognizant of the matter, told me that the operators kept themselves
carefully secluded in a freight car with a hole in the roof, and when
occasional glimpses were caught of them they seemed to be cooking
over a red-hot coal stove. Probably the method employed was that of
Frank Melbourne, the Australian, who has most reputation in the
West, and who has carefully kept his secret. It is proposed by the
company in question to continue the experiments in another field and
with competent experts accompanying, and another railroad company
is seriously considering the propriety of entering the field.

CONCLUSIONS.

Finally, permit me to complete this sketch by some remarks; and, to
make them as specific as they can be made, permit me to put them in
the form of questions and answers. The answers are my own.

Q. Will a noise make rain?—A. No; there is no reason in theory or
practice to make us think it will.

@. Will a concussion make rain?—A. It will probably jostle the
droplets in a cloud and may bring a few together, which may coalesce
and become large enough to cause them to fall to the ground—a few
scattering drops only.

. Will smoke or dust released in great quantities produce rain ?—
A. Floating particles of spongy texture will absorb the moisture hygro-
scopically. If the air is dry this will make it drier, and prevent rain.
If the air is very moist and near saturation, any solid particles in the
air will facilitate the condensation; witness the experiments of Aitken
and Barus. Thus, when other conditions are very favorable, an addi-
tion of much dust or smoke to the air might determine a fall of rain.

@. Will the expansion of carbon anhydride produce rain?—A. Mr.
Gathman says he has tried it and with success. Experiments should
be made systematically.

Q. Will electric connection with a cloud aid in rain formation ?—A.
M. Baudouin says it does.

. Will a conflagration produce rain?—A. Quite probably, under
favorable circumstances. It acts in the line in which nature acts,
according to the best of our knowledge. Condensation is the result of
chilling the air. The theory of chilling by mixture, the Huttonian
theory, a century old, is now known to be inefficient. The chilling in
nature seems to be due either to the ascent of air and its consequent
expansion and loss of heat, or the chilling of one cloud by having the
shadow of a higher cloud fall on itin sunlight. The chilling by ascent

—-

is the method evoked in the Espy plan, and appears to be by all odds
the most effective rain producer in nature.

Q. If rain can be made, how much will it cost?—A. This is truly an
American question, and quite appropriate to the fin de siécle. Mr.
Powers, who, by the way, says that Mr. Dyrenforth did not after all
really try his experiment, put the cost of one experiment with Govern-
ment aid at $80,000. Gathman says he can sprinkle the earth at a cost
of from $30 to $90 a square mile. Espy proposed to fire the low forest
growths at regular intervals at a cost less than 5 mills per citizen per
year. The method of concussion costs the comfort and peace of all
within hearing, a cost which a much more certain result would not
justify.

VARIATION OF LATITUDE!

By J. K. REEs.

The question is frequently asked, ‘‘How can latitude change?”
There are two ways, obviously. First, we may imagine that a portion
of the earth slips on the surface of the globe, due, say, to earthquake
shock. Then if the movement of the mass has been toward the
equator the latitude of that place is decreased; if toward the pole of
the earth the latitude is increased. But suppose that some forces at
work on the earth cause it to revolve about a new axis, then we
have at once a new equator, and the latitudes of all points on the
earth’s surface change except at those places where the old and new
equator intersect.

If, for example, the earth’s axis of revolution should be changed so
as to pass through this hall, the latitude would be changed from a
little over 40°, as it now is, to 90°. There are changes no doubt pro-
duced by the slipping of portions of the earth’s strata, but we know
that these causes are insignificant and local. The only way that lati-
tudes could be made to change throughout the world would be by
changes in the axis of rotation of the earth, thus changing the position
of the equator.

Are there any undisputed evidences of a variation in the latitude of
a place, and is it large?

To-day the evidence is overwhelming, but the amount is small; so
small, in fact, that only the refined instruments of the present day
have been able to discover it; though now, that it is discovered, older
observations show it.

Laplace, in his Mécanique Céleste (Tome V, p. 22), says: ‘All astron-
omy depends upon the invariability of the earth’s axis of rotation and
upon the uniformity of this rotation.”

He considered that down to the beginning of this century astrom-
jeal instruments had not been able to show any variation of latitudes.

in Science, new series, Vol. I, No. 21.

212 VARIATION OF LATITUDE.

There were differences, but these he thought could be accounted for as
errors of observation.! ,

To-day, however, we feel certain that small variations in latitude are
taking place, but so small that practically, in map making, for example,
and in navigation, they are of no importance, though scientifically very
important.

It might also, in this connection, be stated that there are theoretical
reasons which seem to indicate that the earth’s rotation time is not
only changing, but also is not altogether uniform. The effect of the
tide wave as it moves west over the earth is to act as a friction brake
on the revolving earth, and so slow up the rotation time; and as this
tide effect is not always the same the retarding effects differ, and theo-
retically produce a nonuniformity in the rotation time. But the shrink-
age of the earth, due to loss of heat, would tend to make it revolve
more rapidly. These effects may work against each other. However,
observations and calculations to-day do not furnish us with any certain
evidence that the rotation time is longer or shorter than it was ten
centuries ago.

It no doubt will happen that, when observations and instruments
are much improved, astronomers will discover these slight changes in
rotation time that theory seems to require.

The idea that the latitudes of places change is not a new one.

Down to about the time that the telescope was invented there were
many learned persons who believed that the latitudes of places changed
several degrees in the course of centuries. These ideas were based on
a comparison of maps made at different times.

A disciple of the illustrious Copernicus considered that the evidence
was conclusive, and was satisfied that the pole of the earth was chang-
ing its position in a progressive manner; he considered that in time
the torrid and frigid zones would change places.

However, these views of Dominique Maria de Ferrare were founded
on poor data. The latitudes of a few places had been determined, by
very imperfect means, in the best way they had, viz, from the shadow
cast by a gnomon; but the latitudes of many places on the maps were
put in from the accounts of travelers, the time it took to travel from
one point to another being used as the basis of calculation.

Even in these enlightened days, as we like to consider them, there is
no good map of our own Empire State. The latitudes of a few points
only in New York State have been determined -with accuracy. But
there are many places in the State whose positions are not known
within more than a mile.

In the latter part of the sixteenth century Tycho Brahe, of Denmark,
improved the instruments in use (without the telescope), and later,
about 1610, the telescope was discovered and applied to astronomical
instruments. Then new and more accurate methods were used to

of latitude,” read before the A. A. A. S., at Madison, Wis., August, 1893.

determine latitude, and the large discrepancies disappeared. Some
observers found differences between latitudes determined in winter
and in summer, and they supposed those differences to be due to
changes of the pole.

In the latter part of the seventeenth century J. D. Cassini summed
up the state of the problem in his day, and arrived at the conclusion
that, notwithstanding the apparent variations in the latitudes, the
pole of the earth did not change to any large extent; that most.of the
apparent changes in latitude were due to errors of observation and
defects in theory; but he thought it probable that small changes did
occur in the position of the pole; he thought the changes were peri-
odic, and did not amount to more than 2 minutes of are, equal to about
12,000 feet. ‘Thus, instead of several degrees which were conceded
by the astronomers of previous centuries, but a paltry 2 minutes was
now allowed; but with improved instruments, with the discovery of
aberration and nutation and the perfection of the theory of refraction
even this modest allowance was gradually reduced to a vanishing
quantity.”

The geologists in their investigations have found fossil remains in
the cold regions of the North belonging to the Miocene, Upper and
Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, and other geological periods, which seem
to indicate a former temperature much higher than the present. In
1876 Dr. John Evans, then president of the British Geological Society,
discussed the problem, and concluded that the amount of polar light
and heat in the past must have been much greater than it is now. He
invited the attention of the mathematicians to this problem, and
asked: ‘“* Would a considerable elevation and depression of the sea
bottoms and continents produce a change of 15 to 20 degrees in the
position of the pole?”

Sir William Thomson discussed this problem and gave his conclu-
sions in 1876 to the British Association for Advancement of Science.
He said: ‘Consider the great facts of the Himalayas and Andes and
Africa, and the depths of the Atlantic, and America and the depths of
the Pacific, and Australia; and consider further the ellipticity of the
equatorial section of the sea level, estimated by Colonel Clarke at about
one-tenth of the mean ellipticity of the meridianal sections of the sea
level. We need no brush from a comet’s tail to account for a change
in the earth’s axis; we need no violent convulsions producing a sudden
distortion on a great scale, with change of axis of maximum moment
of inertia, followed by gigantic deluges; and we may not merely admit,
but assert as highly probable, that the axis of maximum inertia and
the axis of rotation, always near one another, may have been in ancient
times very far from their present geographical position, and may have
gradually shifted through 10, 20, 30, or 40 or more degrees without at
any time any perceptible sudden disturbance of either land or water.”

Sir William Thomson gave no account of the calculations made by
him as the basis of these conclusions.

274 VARIATION OF LATITUDE.

In 1877 Mr. G. H. Darwin made a careful and elaborate mathematical
discussion of the problem. He showed that in a perfectly rigid globe
the pole could not have wandered more than 3 degrees from its orig-
inal position as the result of the continents and oceans changing places.
“If, however, the earth is sufficiently plastic to admit of readjustment
to new forms of equilibrium, by earthquakes and otherwise, possible
changes of 10 or 15 degrees may have occurred. This would require,
however, such a complete changing about of the continents and oceans,
with maximum elevations and depressions in precisely the most favor-
able places, as has certainly never occurred in geologic times.”

The evidence indicates in fact that the continental areas have always
occupied about the same positions as now.

Thus it would seem that the geologists must abandon the hypothesis
of great changes in latitude as a factor in the earth’s development,
unless a new cause can be found that will move the pole to the extent
required by the geologists.

In an address made before Section A, of the British Association in
1892, Professor Shuster stated that he believed the evidence at hand
was in favor of the view that there was sufficient matter in interplan-
etary space to make it a conductor of electricity. This conductivity,
however, must be small, for if it were not, he said, the earth woul
gradually set itself to revolve about its magnetic poles. However,
changes in the position of the magnetic poles would tend to prevent
this result. Perhaps the investigator in the near future, working on
the suggestion of Dr. Shuster, may find some connection between the
earth’s magnetism, rotation time, and position of rotation axis.

The evidence then, at this phase of the discussion, is in favor of the
view that there is no adequate reason for believing that any large
changes of latitude, amounting to several degrees, have occurred in
geologic times. The evidence shows, however, that there are small
changes. Are they progressive; does the north pole of the earth wan-
der slowly but surely farther and farther away from its positions of
ages gone by?

At the International Geodetic Congress held in 1883 at Rome, Sig.
Fergola, of the Royal Observatory, Cappodimonti, Naples, gave a
tabular statement which seemed to show that small but progressive
changes had taken place in Europe and America. This table showed,
for example, that the latitude of Washington, D. C., had decreased
from 1845 to 1865, 0.47"; at Paris, from 1825 to 1853, the decrease was
1.8’; at Milan in sixty years, 1.5’; at Rome during fifty-six years,
0.17/’; at Naples in fifty-one years, 0.22’; at Kénigsberg in twenty-
three years, 0.15"; at Greenwich in nineteen years, 0.51’... Fergola, at
the congress mentioned, suggested a plan for making systematic obser-
vations, and he pointed out the favorable location of several observa-
tories that were on nearly the same circle of latitude, but differing
widely in longitude. Unfortunately this suggestion of Fergola’s was
not carried out in any way until 1892, when the Columbia College
4 eee

VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 275

Observatory arranged to work in conjunction with the Naples Observa-
tory on the problem. This series of observations was begun in the
spring of 1893, and will be continued several years.

The data given by Fergola at Rome in 1883 showed a diminution of
latitude in every case; other data showed a similar diminution; how-
ever there were exceptions, where the latitudes seemed to increase.

The investigations that have been going on since 1883 throw doubt
on the progressive changes in latitude, or at least such changes are
masked by proved periodic changes.

For a long time, since 1765, periodic changes have been looked for,
because the theory of a rotating earth, an earth having the form of a
sphere flattened at the poles, or, more accurately, an ellipsoid of revo-
lution, demanded such changes; but the theory did not furnish any
clue to the amount of changes, except that they must be very small.
This theory shows that.if the earth were absolutely rigid and revolved
about its shortest axis (called the axis of figure) at any time it would
continue to revolve about such axis forever, unless disturbed by some
outside force. If so disturbed, then the axis of rotation would no longer
coincide with the axis of figure—the axis of rotation would intersect
the earth’s surface at points away from the points where the axis of
figure comes out. But the theory also showed that the new axis of
rotation would revolve about the old one in a period of 304.8 days.
This period comes from the knowledge of the magnitude of precession
and nutation, and is known very accurately.

We would expect therefore that changes in latitude would show this
305-day period.

Several attempts have been made to determine the distance between
the two axes (figure and rotation axis) from changes in latitudes.

The celebrated astronomer Bessel made the first attempt, and was
unsuecessful it was supposed until recently.!

' Tisserand says in Ann. Bur. Long., 1895 (p. 42, B. 11), that there is a letter of April
7, 1846, in which Humboldt replies to Gauss that Bessel had told him in 1844 that his
observations showed that his latitude had decreased 0.3’ in two years. Bessel
attributed this variation to changes accomplished in the interior of the globe. See
also Hagan’s letter in Astr. Nach., September, 1894.

Tn this connection it ought to be noted also that Prof. J. C. Maxwell read a paper
April 20, 1857, before the Royal Society of Edinburgh (see Transactions Roy. Soe.
Edinburgh, Vol. XXI, Part IV, pp. 559-571), ‘‘On a dynamical top for exhibiting the
phenomena of the motion of a system of invariable form about a fixed point, with
some suggestions as to the earth’s motion.” He deduced a period of 325.6 solar days.
He examined the observations of Polaris made with the Greenwich transit circle in
the years 1851-1854. He found the apparent colatitude of Greenwich for each month
of the four years specified.

There appeared a very slight indication of a maximum belonging to the set of
months, March, 1851; February, 1852; December, 1852; November, 1853; September,
1854. ‘This result,” he says, ‘‘is to be regarded as very doubtful, as there did not
appear to be evidence for any variation exceeding half a second of space, and more
observations would be required to establish the existence of so small a variation
at all,”
276 VARIATION OF LATITUDE.

Observations were also made at Pulkova, Russia, Greenwich, and
Washington. The Washington observations were made between 1862
and 1867, and included six complete periods of 305 days each. <A rig-
orous discussion by Newcomb gave the separation of the axes as 3 feet,
or 0.03”,

C. A. F. Peters, of Pulkova, had in 1842, obtained 0.079’ = 8 feet.

These figures are small, but fairly accordant. <A reinvestigation,

however, showed that the various calculations did not agree in showing .

the same displacement at the same time. This made the whole result
doubtful, so that Newcomb (in 1892, March, Mon. Not. R. A.S.) remarked
that “the observations showed beyond doubt there could be no inequal-
ity of the kind looked for.”

It was while investigations of this kind, to determine the separation
of the axis of rotation and axis of figure, were going on that Sir Wil-
liam Thomson (now Lord Kelvin) announced, at the congress of the
British Association at Glasgow in 1874, that the meteorological phe-
nomena, the fall of rain and snow, the changes which occur in the cir-
culation of the air and of the sea waters, would modify a little the
mechanical constitution of the globe, and displace a little the axis of
figure, i.e., the form of the earth would be changed by the causes men-
tioned, and so a new shortest axis would be made. The effect of this
would be to produce a change in the latitudes of places, evidently. He
thought that it might amount to 0.50’, which would correspond to a
movement of the old axis (at the pole) of 50 feet on the earth’s surface.
Sir William Thomson did not publish his calculation, but the authority
of the great English mathematician and physicist was such as to make
scientific men give the statement great attention. These meteorologic
phenomena of which Sir William Thomson spoke are annual in charae-
ter. When this annual period is combined with the 305-day or ten-
month period of Euler we see that complexity results. This was the
state of the investigation when Dr. Kiistner, of the Berlin Observatory,
published the results of his observations made in 1884-85, Dr. Kiist-
ner undertook some observations for the trial of a new method for the
determination of the constant of aberration. On reducing his obser-
vations he obtained results which were not at all satisfactory. A care-
ful examination of his work led him to make the announcement that
the unsatisfactory value for the aberration constant was due to a com-
paratively rapid, though very small, change in the latitude of the Berlin
Observatory—‘ that from August to November, 1884, the latitude of
Berlin had been from 0.2’ to 0.5’ greater than from March to May in
1884 and 1885,”

This would indicate that from August to November, 1854, the pole of
the earth had approached Berlin more closely by 20 to 30 feet than in
the time from March to May.

This conclusion was fortified by the examination of other data,
obtained from the observations made at Pulkova by Nyrén.

VARIATION OF LATITUDE. VALU

Here, then, was evidence of a comparatively rapid change in lati-
tude. New observations were undertaken at Berlin, Potsdam, Prague,
and Bethlehem, Pa. (all by Talcott’s method), and all agreed in show-
ing plus and minus changes in latitude for the years 1888-1890.

There were still some doubters. Moreover, it was decided to crit-
ically test the matter by sending an expedition to the Sandwich
Islands, which is 180 degrees (nearly) in longitude from Berlin. If it
were known the latitude of Berlin increased, then a point in the
Northern Hemisphere 180 degrees away from Berlin should simuita-
neously show a decrease in latitude, for if the pole move toward Berlin
it must move from the point on the other side of the earth.

Our own Government joined in the effort. Marcuse, of Berlin, and
Preston, of Washington, spent more than a year on the Sandwich
Islands observing for latitude, while at the same time observations
were continued at Berlin, Prague, and Strasburg in Europe, and at
Rockville, Bethlehem, and San Francisco in the United States. The
results of all these observations have been published, and show, with-
out a chance of error, that the earth’s axis is moving, that the lati-
tudes at the Sandwich Islands increased when the latitudes in
Germany diminished, and vice versa.

The law of the change was eagerly and industriously sought for by
some of the ablest mathematical astronomers of the world. They
first worked on the idea that the changes must conform to the 505-day
period of Euler, combined with an annual change due to causes set
forth by Sir W Thon Thomson, and which I have previously mentioned.
None of these investigations have given a satisfactory formula for the
prediction of the latitude of any place.

In 1891 Dr. S. C: Chandler, of Cambridge, Mass., began his investi-
gation of the problem. He remarks:

““T deliberately put aside all teaching of theory, because it seemed to
me high time that the facts should be examined by a purely inductive
process; that the nugatory results of all attempts to detect the existence
of the Eulerian period (of 305 days) probably arose from a defect of
the theory itself, and that the entangled condition of the whole subject
required that it should be examined afresh by processes unfettered by
any preconceived notions whatever. The problem which I therefore
proposed to myself was to see whether it would not be possible to lay
the numerous ghosts in the shape of various discordant, residual phe-
nomena pertaining to deterininations of aberration, parallaxes, latitudes,
and the like, which have heretofore flitted elusively about the astronomy
of precision during the century, or to reduce them to some tangible form
by some simple consistent hypothesis. It was thought that if this could
be done astudy of the nature of the forces as thus indicated, by which
the earth’s rotation is influenced, might tend to a physical explanation
of them.”

Dr. Chandler proceeded to examine his own work with the Almucan-
tar at Cambridge, the observations of Kiistner, Gyldén Nyrén, the
Washington observations, and others. He found that they all seemed
278 VARIATION OF LATITUDE.

to indicate that the pole of the rotation axis was moving from west to
east about the axis of figure of the earth in a period of 427 days.
Other observations did not seem to confirm this period. Finally he
made an elaborate analysis of 33,000 observations between 1837 and
1891, and the result was an empirical law which can be announced as
follows:

The pole of the rotation axis of the earth moved with its greatest
velocity about the pole of the axis of figure about the year 1774; the
period then was 348 days. The velocity has diminished with an accel-
erated rate since then. In 1890 the period was 443 days. The distance
of one pole from the other was about 22 feet, equal to 0.22”,

Further elaborate examination of this material developed the exceed-
ingly important and interesting result that the changes in latitude
were the sum of two periodic fluctuations superposed on. each other.
One had a period of about 427 days and an amplitude of 0.12’; the
second had a period of a year, with an amplitude that was variable
between 0.04 and 0.20”,

Sometimes these two fluctuations worked together, giving a total
range of 0,33/’, and at times they conspired against each other, reduc-
ing the range to a minimum of a few hundredths of a second. He
compared his theory with the observations, and the result was, in the
main, exceedingly satisfactory.

His conclusions were attacked as to the 427-day term. The annual
term could be explained as due to meteorologic causes.

Professor Newcomb, however, in March, 1892, explained, in a paper
communicated to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society, that in deducting the Eulerian period of 305 days the earth, as
we have remarked, was considered absolutely rigid; that- when the
effect of the mobility of the oceans and of the lack of perfect rigidity
of the earth were taken into account, the mathematics required a time
of rotation of the true pole about the axis of figure longer than the
previously accepted 305 days. Making certain assumptions, Newcomb
obtained a period of 443 days.!

An additional interesting conclusion which Dr. Chandler has lately
published is that the fluctuation with a period of 427-428 days is a eir-
cular one, as theory seems to demand, while the annual fluctuations
appear elliptical in character.

An exceedingly interesting and important confirmation of the Chand-
lerian period of 427 days, or about 14 months, was lately announced by
M. Tisserand. Examination has been made of the tide records of the
Helder in Holland. These are kept with great accuracy. It has been
found that between 1851 and 1893 these tide records show a variation
in the average sea level indicating a 14-month period. The greatest

' Prof. R. 8S. Woodward has lately obtained, by a new discussion of the theoretical
problem, a formula that seems to indicate the correctness of Chandler’s empirical
formula.

divergencies are very small, only 14 millimeters, equal to one-half
inch about, but they appear unmistakably and are what theory would
demand.

In a letter, recently received from Dr. Chandler, he states that he
finds that the annual part of the polar motion is an ellipse three or four
times as long as broad, and he expresses the law of the motion of the
pole in this ellipse as that the areas described from the center are pro-
portional to the times.

We can conclude safely, therefore, that no large changes of latitude
have taken place for many thousands of years; in fact, in geologic
times, that there is no adequate proof of progressive changes in the
latitude of any place; but, finally, thatvery small periodic changes have
occurred, and they are such as can be and are observed.

The feeling is growing in the minds of those who have given the sub-
ject close attention that we shall find that many and various causes
enter into the problem of determining the law of changes. It will no
doubt take many years of careful observation to obtain the data neces-
sary to fully test Dr. Chandler’s, or any other hypothesis.

The scientific men abroad are discussing the advisability of estab-
lishing several observatories at various places on the earth’s surface
for the purpose of collecting the data.

Ultimately Dr. Chandler’s formula, or a slight modification of it, may
be proved correct, and with it we may be able to state what the lati-
tude of any place will be at any time.

.

The lecture was followed by some illustrations showing that revolving
bodies preferred to revolve about their shortest axis or around the axis
about which the moment of inertia was a maximum.

Charts and diagrams were exhibited showing the results of obser-
vations made at Pulkova, Prague, Berlin, Strasburg, Bethlehem, the
Sandwich Islands, ete.

These results were compared with the deductions from Chandler’s
formula and shown to agree therewith to a remarkable extent.

The preliminary results of the observations made at Columbia Col-
lege from May, 1893, to July, 1894, were exhibited.

The lecturer threw on the screen illustrations of several forms of
zenith telescopes, and described the new form made by Wanschaff, of
Berlin.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA
UP 10 THE YEAR 15702

By Dr. SopHUs RUGE.

The discovery of America and the geographical researches on that
continent may be regarded as the initial period of the era of discovery.
In order to intelligently trace the gradual dawning of a new world
upon the geographical chart and, at the same time, to compare the
discoveries made by the several pilots and to estimate briefly their
value from a scientific point of view, I have selected the medium of a
collection of thirty-two maps, upon which are represented the progress
of discovery from decade to decade.

This cartographical evolution ends with the year 1570, for in that
year first appeared Ortelius’s Theatrum Orbis, the earliest modern
atlas, by which, in numerous editions and in various languages, we
have an easily accessible collection of new charts. Previous to that
publication, exclusive of the rare collection of Lafreris, the maps of the
several engravers, through successive years combined, were printed
only in single sheets or introduced as such in scientific works of the
most dissimilar character.

The present maps contain four series of illustrations. The first series
(Pls. XVII-XX) exhibits, on modern charts, the coasts and inland
regions that have been discovered. The second series (Pls. XXI-
XXIV) presents to our view the results of the observations of the pilots
to whom we are indebted for the production of these maps.

Naturally, with the exception of the Cosa chart, no original surveys
could be represented, but they are, on the contrary, copies and tran
scripts of copies which are extant, a compilation gathered from different
sources, So that only the general impression of the ideas promulgated a
the time are shown to us. In details, however, and. specially in local
names, numerous inaccuracies occur.

Finally, the third and fourth series (Pls. XX V-—XLV) introduce to us
the scientific conclusions of geographers and the inductions of scien-
tists together with established theories in regard to the positions of

the new, relatively to the known world. Here the originals are, almost
without exception, modified typographically, and they are either wood-
cuts or copper engravings. Copies, however, are introduced of manu-
scripts and of painted globes. Where single charts, simply marine
charts, have been struck off, which, however, but seldom occurs, they
are given uncolored and without doctrinal reasoning or scientific signifi-
cance. For the information of the scholar, which it was necessary to
express in the third or fourth series, two series were requisite, partly
in order to give an indication of the abundance of the theories, that

often changed as suddenly as they arose, and partly with a view to intro-

duce into this history all prominent or representative names.

In order to subjoin to the discoveries as well as to the charts the
necessary explanations, inasmuch as they could only be given curso-
rily and summarily in a map, the second and special part of this paper
comprises a history of the voyages of discovery and exploration, and the
necessary material for charts, all of which is chronologically arranged.!
The important points in a history of discoveries are not alone to clearly
set forth the more prominent incidents of the earlier voyages, and espe-
cially those of Colon, as also the names giveu to the discovered local-
jties, but likewise to give the sources of evidence, and opportunely,
works of critical research. In the course of the sixteenth century the
more real discoveries cease, and the more brief, generally speaking, are
communications and critical observations. The chronological series of
charts that are accessible, in so far as they are geographical, possess a
certain value and are given with the utmost completeness possible.
Among them the principal works of Harrisse offer the most valid claims
to ourrecognition. I confidently believe that although this series is far
from being exhaustive, it will nevertheless be acceptable to those who
are interested in the too-little-cultivated history of cartography. ‘The
works, too, are cited, as far as known to me, in which the respective
charts are to be found, either in facsimile or imitation.

For a critical analysis and appreciation of the charts themselves, and
an understanding of their relation one to another, synoptical tables of
all the names and legends were requisite, the laborious preparation of
which may not appear in a brief statement, but the value of which
may be recognized from the few critical observations upon them.

In the third series, charts 1 and 2 revert to a period anterior even to
the discovery of America by Columbus, in 1492, These are shown for
the purpose of giving expression to ideas and theories on the lines of
demarcation of countries which have had decided influence on poster-
ity, such, for example as the Zamoiski codex of 1468 for Northern, and
Behaim’s Globus of 1492, for Eastern Asia. The questionable Zeno

chart of 1380(?) is included in the appended list,! for the reason that
after its publication in the year 1558, not merely did the Italian Ptole-
miius editions, but even Mercator, as well, follow its delineation of the
northern regions.

THE MARINE CHARTS.

The art of designing marine charts originated with the Italians.
When the Portuguese Prince Henry began his discoveries he sought
to obtain Italians for his enterprises. So likewise in chart design, or
drafts, Italians became the instructors of the Portuguese, and with the
latter the Basques appeared as skillful mariners and cartographers.
Not until toward the middle of the sixteenth century did nautical car-
tography find its entrance into France. It did not reach either Eng-
land or Germany at the epoch of the great discoveries. But in Spain,
to which is due the most ancient cartography of the most important
regions in America, guidance and enlightenment were derived from
Italians, Basques, and Portuguese. And thus the material for Ameri-
ean cartography consists of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and more
recently of French charts, or coast pilots. The language of these charts
is exclusively Romanish.

But, unfortunately, original drafts are hardly accessible. Unfortu-
nately, also, most of the track charts no longer exist. ‘What, in the
lapse of time, has been preserved from shipwreck, or the hands of the
gold-beaters, is as yet not fully ascertained, and very little indeed has
been described” (Harrisse, Cabot, p. 139). As often as pictures of the
uprising New World vary in the first decades, just so often do the charts
become antiquated and dangerous as guides. It therefore became
necessary from considerations of prudence or utility to discard or
destroy the more ancient. Thus it happens that neither in Spain nor
in Portugal is there to be found a chart of America for the first fifteen
years of the sixteenth century, with the exception of that oldest map
of the world, which was recovered from France, and on which the New
World is represented—the noted chart of the Basque pilot Juan de
la Cosa. The earliest charts that have been preserved, next to that of
Cosa, the marine charts of Canario and Cantero, and that of Kunst-
mann in his atlas of published sheets, Nos. 2 and 3, are to be found in
the collections of Italy, France, and Germany. And even these, col-
lectively, are no longer original, but imitations and compilations
collected from various State archives. And although Cosa, in the
delineation of America, has prongunced his work as original, his chart
upon the whole is merely a compilation.

The elaborate, and in many respects incisive criticism which Har-
risse? above all others, has. devoted to the subject, has enabled us, in

284 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.

special instances to determine what originals were used in drawing
some of the chart copies, but it is impossible to say how far original
and copy agree with each other. So, also, the oldest manuscripts for
a cartographic history of America are not originals, but merely arbi-
trary combinations of various copies, not drawn from originals of
equivalent value, for the value of a first impression on the mind is
always dependent upon the intelligence of the pilot. Every copyist
is subjected to the risk of committing errors, through a misappre-
hension, or perhaps through careless haste. And here no connected
text is employed, as in the transcript of a literary composition, but
individual names without connection or correlation are strung along,
like beads, upon the water line of a seacoast. Cosmographers, too,
avail themselves in numerous instances of abbreviations in favor at
the time, and employed in manuscripts. The points designated along
the coast are in some localities so crowded together that errors may
readily occur in their repetition, not alone through the misinterpreta-
tion of a name badly or illegibly written, but in some cases from its
entire omission. And thus the correct reduplication of a series of
appellations, so closely written, would be rendered almost impracti-
cable. Besides, if copperplates or woodcuts were designed for charts
written upon parchment, the brittle character of the material on which
it must be printed would doubtless make necessary a reduction in the
number of the local names. It could not be assumed, moreover, that
due discrimination had been exercised in the topography of these
sheets, and only the less unimportant particulars omitted.

The principal share in the explorations made along the American
seacoast unquestionably belongs to the Spanish pilots, or to those
employed in the service of Spain. But it must in no wise be supposed
from this that Spanish influence in the development of the cartography
of America has been very considerable. The reverse, indeed, is the
case. Spanish cartography, it is true, begins immediately after the
first voyage of Colon, and innumerable traces in the literature of the
country, and the manuscripts contained in their archives, afford ample
evidence of the rapid development among them of the art of sketching
and designing marine charts. But despite this fact, the dissemination
of this art throughout Spain, and its progress toward northern regions,
and consequent influence upon the cartographic conceptions of middle
Europe during the first quarter of the sixteenth century, can not be
established. Columbus had promised to draw up a chart of the dis-
coveries of his first voyage, and he had held out to their majesties an
assurance of its execution on his return home. On the 5th of Septem-
ber, 1493, he was again reminded of his engagement by Queen Isabella
(Navarr. I., p. 122., 2d edition, 1859). Meanwhile the court records
communicate nothing to us, in respect either to the dispatch of the
chart or its receipt. It is proved in several ways that a chart of his
third voyage was in existence. Hojeda saw it first at Bishop Fon-

Or

seca’s, and obtained a copy of the chart for his own first voyage (Navarr.
IL, pp. 539, 586). But of all his charts, not one has been preserved.

The restored chart of Juan de la Cosa, 1500, is, then, the earliest car-
tographic memorial handed down to us; and in this map the skillful
Basque mariner has combined in one exhibit the various Spanish dis-
coveries, and, possibly also, the discoveries of John Cabot in North
America.

The incidents of the fourth voyage of the Admiral in 1502-1504 were
rapidly disseminated throughout Europe, for not only Columbus him-
self and his brother Bartholomew, but likewise the other mariners had
each designed charts. It might therefore be readily inferred that not
merely facts but names themselves might vary in many important par-
ticulars. Charts were no mystery, and they might be indiscriminately
reproduced, or even acquired by purchase. In Portugal there was a
chart industry, and there was an open traffic in them under the restric-
tion, however, that it was forbidden, under a heavy penalty, to draw
plans of the route by sea to the Molucca Islands. We thus find that
later on an Italian draftsman, Baptista Agnese, contributed, as a sup-
plement to his finely executed collection of maps, a chart of the world,
upon which the Molucca route was clearly traced, and it was recognized
as such.

When, in 1500, the Portuguese Indian fleet under Cabral discovered
Brazil, and when in succeeding years Portuguese vessels had coasted
along a considerable portion of the eastern coast of South America, it
appears that in Portugal they encouraged the publication of these
facts. This was naturally in the highest degree obnoxious to the
Spaniards, for at Lisbon copies of the charts were willingly accorded
to Italians. It appears further that charts of Cabot’s voyages were
brought to Lisbon earlier than to Spain. At all events, the explora-
tions of Cortoreal and the earliest received charts of Cantino and
Canario had their origin in Portugal. To a wide diffusion of the
incidents of his own voyages in Portuguese ships, Vespucci himself
contributed, as they were accustomed to say, through picture and nar-
rative; and thus the influence of Portuguese charts, copied by Italians,
upon the ideas of Middle Europe was already inaugurated before
Spanish cartography was directed into: regular channels. The first
foundation for the system was laid in the establishment of the Indian
office at Seville in 1503. The lead in all transmarine enterprises
emanated from the Casa de Contratacion for the Indies. Here were
necessarily collected charts of all recent discoveries. But it would
necessarily scon become evident that such charts, based upon charts
often widely deviating from each other and giving imperfect or errone-
ous delineations of the coasts in the new hemisplere, would rather
expose mariners to danger than afford them security. It became nec-
essary, therefore, to exercise a many-sided critique and careful investi-
gation of the charts accessible, and care be taken that seamen were
286 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.

furnished with the most accurate maps obtainable and designed upon
uniform principles.

The progress here indicated was associated with the nomination of
Amerigo Vespucci in 1508 to be chief pilot in Spain. The plan was
then first conceived of drawing under his supervision an official gen-
eral map of the regions discovered (Navarr. III, p. 300), Juan Diaz
de Solis and Vincencio Yanez Pinzon were associated with him. Of all
the charts then in existence that of Andres de Morales was declared
to be the best, and it was raised to the grade of an official chart, or
royal padron. No mariner was permitted to have on board his ship,
under a penalty of 50 doubloons ($240), any other chart. But it was
more easy to issue than to enforce such an order.

When Amerigo Vespucci died, on the 22d of February, 1512, Diaz
de Solis succeeded him as chief pilot. In the same year, the latter,
together with the nephew of Amerigo, Juan Vespucci, received a com-
mission to draw up an official chart. In consideration of this they
were each to receive the privilege of copying and selling the royal
padron. But other cartographers did not trouble themselves about

this privilege. During subsequent years, and up to the period of Diaz

de Solis’s death, we are informed of several convocations of a junta
through which the preparation of an official chart might be expedited,
but it seems that many impediments were encountered in its execution.
And, in fact, no trace has been preserved of any similarly authorized
charts. The question here was an exact determination of the longitude
of Cape St. Augustine, in Brazil, according to which it was hoped that
the line of demarcation of the Portuguese claims in South America
might be definitely adjusted, for the Portuguese were determined to
imprison every Spaniard who overstepped the boundary. Incorrect
charts, moreover, exposed seamen to imminent peril in that locality. _
It has been supposed that Sheets IV and V in Kunstmann’s Atlas
were promulgated as results of the junta of 1515 (Kohl, Generalkar-
ten, p. 30), for these charts must have appeared subsequent to 1513,
inasmuch as Balboa’s South Sea is indicated upon them. But these
two charts represent two different standpoints. No. LV represents
the Portuguese claim in Brazil as proved by the line of demarcation
through that country and the long legend upon the Portuguese side,
while No. V defends Spanish pretensions, according to which the
boundary line recognizes as valid, in behalf of the claims of Portugal,
only the extreme projection of Brazil. The first chart employs the
medium of the Portuguese tongue; the second of the Italian. The
uncertainty as to a comprehensive idea of the new regions lasted only
a few years; that is to say, until the shores of the Mexican Gulf were
taken up by Pinedo or until Sebastian d’Eleano, of Magellan’s squad-
ron, brought home the earliest charts of the southern extremity of
South America. Moreover, not until about 1522 er 1523 was the Span-
ish coast line in America fully determined in the west, through their
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 287

researches on the broad ocean, as furnished by the surveys of Cortez
and Pizarro. And now the idea of a universal official map or ‘‘ padron”
was once more reverted to.

In the year 1526 Ferdinand Columbus received an order to prepare
an accurate chart, and this, by a later imperial decree, was to be
entitled the ‘general padron.” But when, after the lapse of nine
years, a reiterated command was dispatched to the son of the Admiral
to complete the work, it must not be concluded that up to that period
he had not executed the commission or supplied any map whatever.
Nor does this entirely justify the assumption that the Weimaraner
general chart of 1527, the first general map, originated with him. The
second, designed by Ribero, and the general map of 1527, and that of
1529, essentially altered, have both likewise been preserved. ‘The
approved type exhibited in each of these charts was henceforth as a
general rule steadily adhered to.

Though the Portuguese occupy a subordinate rank as regards the
‘extent of their contributions to the cartography of America, tbe dis-
tinction is assuredly due them of having first conceived and portrayed
the continent of North America in its correct and proper contour,
exclusive, of course, of the polar regions. They were able pilots and
expert draftsmen, and not only by their labors, but by their methods,
they have exercised a vast influence, especially upon geographical
works in Germany. Many of their pilots and draftsmen emigrated
secretly from Portugal into Spain and entered into the service of
Charles V. Such, for example, were Francisco and Ruy Faliero, Jorge
and Pedro Reinel, and Simon de Alcazaba de Sotomayor. Along with
these, and even to a greater extent than the latter, Italians emigrated
to Spain. Only Columbus, however, with Amerigo and Juan Vespucci,
are here mentioned (Harrisse, Cabot, p. 219). Two of the earliest and
most important cartographic records, the charts of Cantino and Cane-
rio, although supplied or drawn by Italians, are copies of Portuguese
originals. Both of these, as also the surveys of the coasts of the New
World sent to the Duke Réné of Lothringen, had a far-reaching influ-
ence upon scientific cosmography.

This influence, however, emanates from Italians residing abroad.
Harrisse calls attention to the’ fact (Discovery of North America,
p. 270) that cartographers living in Italy only recently, comparatively,
took notice of the discoveries of Spaniards and Portuguese in the New
World, and with the exception of Johann Ruysch, a German, who copied
in its essential details a Portuguese map of the New World for the
Roman Ptolemius of 1508, the Viscount di Maggiolo was the first who
brought to Naples a representation of the newly discovered regions, in
1511. Cartographic activity in Italy, up to the year 1527, remained
dependent upon Portuguese exemplars. Spanish influence is first
detected in Maggiolo’s chart of 1527. The French took part in these
nautical and cartographic enterprises much later than the three south-
288 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.

ern Romanish nations—the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Here,
too, an Italian, Giov. Verrazzano, in 1524, was the pioneer. The voy-
age of the first Frenchman, Jacques Cartier, followed ten years later,
and although none of his original drawings have been preserved, the
results of his first voyages of discovery shown upon the chart of the
world by Nicolas Deslien of Dieppe, 1541, constitute the oldest French
cartographic publications known to us. The latter is preserved in the
Royal Library at Dresden.

But it was no longer possible for French cartography to exert a
decided influence; on the contrary, their cosmographers showed them-
selves dependent, in many respects, upon Germany. The earliest
marine chart, in a modern sense, in nautical use, the celebrated map
of the world by Mercator, appeared in 1569, and consequently at the
close of the period here under discussion. The uncertainty which pre-
vailed for a decade in the delineation of the newly discovered coasts
was chiefly due to inexact astronomical calculations. Calculations of
latitude were naturally more easily determined than those of longi-
tude. And when it is remarked that in the middle of the New World
and in West Indian waters, where alone the Spaniard was enterpris-
ing, vacillation prevailed longest, while north and south, in New-
foundland and Brazil, whither in the same year, 1500, came Portuguese
vessels, long before the geographical latitude was clearly determined,
we necessarily reach the conclusion that the Portuguese were greatly
in advance of the Spaniards in their nautical skill and ability.

Columbus himself did not rise above the companions of his voyages
in knowledge and address. Information which comes to us, second-
hand, of his observations of latitude betrays a vacillation and hesi-
tancy between his own tendencies and the chart of Toscanelli, which
he blindly followed. H. Harrisse in his latest work (Discovery of
North America, p. 401), adopts, however, the conclusion of Humboldt,
that Columbus did not have on board a chart of Toscanelli, for he
would otherwise have crossed the ocean under the parallel of Lisbon.
I consider, however, this assumption as untenable, for the rich terri-
tories of Eastern Asia, the goal of his western voyages, must first be
sought in the torrid zone, or in the vicinity of that zone; and it is ques-
tionable whether it would not have been more advisable to navigate
seas that were known, those for example, from Spain to the Canaries,
on the borders of the Tropics, than to seek a fresh route thither on the
unknown waters of Eastern Asia. In the second place, according to
the chart, as may be seen on Behaim’s copy, two very desirable anchor-
ages were to be anticipated at Antilia and Zipangu, on the western
route, from the Canaries to Zayton, under rather similar conditions,
whereby a sea voyage of indefinite length was broken in a very wel-
come manner. In the third place, it is manifest from the daybook of
the Admiral that he hoped to reach these points. Antilia he desired to
visit upon his return voyage, since he did not find it precisely where he

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 289

supposed from his chart he ought to have found it, and Zipangu he
believed he had discovered on reaching Haiti. All the observations
of the discoverer respecting his ideas of the division of land and water
are intelligible through this chart. And lastly, due weight should be
given to the highly important testimony of Bishop Las Casas, which,
in view of its manifold repetitions, should not be treated as a common
error, aS is Sometimes the case with his statements.

Las Casas (Lib. I, chap. 12, Bd. I, p. 96) having referred to the geo-
graphical error of Toscanelli, through which, in a western voyage, the
territories of the ‘“‘Grosschans” were first touched upon (remarks which,
in an abbreviated form and in part also verbally, are again met with
in the histories, Chap. VIIL') the Bishop adds some significant para-
graphs to this, which are omitted in the histories, being somewhat
equivocal as affecting the reputation of the Genoese: ‘La carta de
marear (Toscanelli) que le invi6, yo, que esta historia escribo, tengo en
mi poder, y della se hara mas mencion abajo.” (The marine chart which
I sent to him, I, who am writing this history, hold in my custody, and
about which further mention will be made below.) And a few lines
farther on he adds: “Y ansi creo que todo su viaje sobre esta carta
fund6.” (I believe also that his [Columbus’s| entire voyage was based
upon this chart.) Then Las Casas again returns to the chart in his
narrative of the first passage across the ocean, when Columbus, on Sep-
tember 25, 1492, withheld the marine chart of Martin Alfonso Pinzon,
while borne onward upon the ocean waters which they were then navi-
gating. It was a question of the precise situation of Antilia. Here
Las Casas remarks, in chapter 38 (p. 279): “Esta carta es la, que envio
Paulo, fisico, el Florentin, la cual tengo en mi poder.” (This is the chart
which the Florentine physician [Toscanelli] sent, whom I hold in my
power.) Toscanelli’s chart was held in high estimation by Columbus.
Of this there can exist no doubt, for no other chart was obtainable that
exhibited the entire ocean as far as the coast of Asia. He must have
had the Toseanelli chart on board, for he could have guided himself by
none other, and he piloted his course solely by this chart.

The uncertainty of the latitudes, which I ascribe to the influence of
Toscanelli, can even be recognized in a chart handed down from very
early times. It is Table II in Kunstmann’s Atlas. Here the shores
of the Greater Antilles extend from Puerto Rico to Cuba, and directly
onward to the northwest, so that the northwestern extremity of Cuba
reaches the fiftieth parallel of latitude. Such errors disappear grad-
ually, and not until after the death of Colon, and by degrees only,
does the tropical circle assume its proper position relatively to the
Greater Antilles. The correct delineation of the chart does not come
to us until it is first exhibited in the general map of 1527. On the
other hand, the mouth of the Amazon was correctly placed, from the

1T say designedly ‘‘again met with,” for I consider here Las Casas as the original
and the one upon which the historians have drawn.

first, under the equator. The eastern projection of Brazil, Cape St.
Augustine, appears early in its proper situation. Far more difficult
than the latitude was the determination of the longitude. They could
not then reckon astronomically. It was much easier to ascertain the
dangerous character of the coast through an estimate of the rapidity
of the passage. But that even here opinions differed may be per-
ceived from the varying estimates of pilots on the occasion of the first
voyage of Colon. His own observations or calculations of latitude are
no better than those of his contemporaries. Nor do I believe that the
few astronomical efforts that were made to determine the longitude on
American soil have had any influence upon the maps. It is therefore
not to be wondered at that the eastern shores of the New World,
namely, South and Central America, should be removed 3 to 5 degrees
too far toward the east. Things were even in a worse state in the
beginning in the case of North America. The insular-like appearance
of the shores of Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland (7?) scarcely
permit us, at first, to devine their actual character. The eastern coast
of the present United States was quite delusive, extending horizontally
from west to east, as if the ocean were quite dammed off on the north.
As a necessary sequence, Newfoundland lay about 40 degrees too far
to the east. These errors had undergone hardly any correction during
the sixteenth century.

The line of demareation, decided upon since 1494, frequently served
on the general charts as an initial meridian. We first meet with it on
Sheet IV, in Kunstmann’s Atlas, and consequently somewhere about
the year 1518. It here lies 21 to 22 degrees westward from the Cape
Verde Island Santo Antonio, and hence 370 leagues remote from it, as
was settled in the convention of Tordesillas in 1494. But Spanish
cosmographers wished to remove it as far as possible to the east, in
order to lessen the domains of Portugal. They were unable to come
to a full settlement of this point. The old charts, whether of land or
sea, track charts, or maps multiplied by typography, could alone supply
a scientific desideratum where the date of restoration is clearly indi-
cated by the compiler, and when, moreover, an exact computation of
the time is made, or where this date may be ascertained with reasonable
probability from the text. The greater portion of the old cartographic
records that have been preserved are without date.

Of the twelve oldest sheets that we possess from the year 1500 to
1509, four are dated and eight are without date. We may regard it as
a great piece of good fortune that the oldest chart of Juan de la Cosa
that has been preserved bears a precise date, and that to the so-called
Cantino chart a definite year may be ascribed with confidence through
the letter that accompanies it. In other cases a determination of the
time of a chart without date is always an extremely difficult problem.

It is true that in many instances it is possible to verify which are the
most recent discoveries recorded, but it follows necessarily from this

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 291

that the chart could not have been delineated previous to the fact of
its discovery. On the other hand, it can not be perceived after how
long a space of time later on the cartographer executed the draft. If
no one of the cartographers who were residing in Italy prior to 1508,
or, more correctly speaking, anterior to 1511, take any note of America,
such a fact should only counsel the exercise of extreme caution.
Inasmuch as with but few exceptions none of the original drafts
have descended to us from remote times, and since the labors of sue-
cessive pilots have been collected, for various years, into one general
map, the difficulty of ascertaining the exact dates has been greatly
increased. And yet, in the case of the port entry records, which were
made up in the seaport towns, it is more easily established than through
the sheets subsequently printed. The execution or engraving of the
Sheets required considerable time, the printing was often retarded a
year or more, and all this must be weighed with the possibility that
the latest designs were not always at the disposal of the scientist from
whom these charts emanated. It thus happens that such sheets, with-

out any date, were begun too prematurely. It is well ascertained that

designs for the Ptolemiius charts (Strasburg, 1503) were six years at
least in the hands of the college authorities at St. Dié before they were
issued. And, moreover, Duke Renatus (deceased in 1505) had come
into possession of the new marine charts of South America and South
Africa, which, at a later period, are said to have embellished the
Ptolemiius editions, although only in woodeut; and Martin Waldsee-
miiller announced, in 1507, in a letter to Amerbach, St. Dié, of the 5th
of April, that the charts would very soon appear in print.

The first known globe executed by Nordenskjéld presents another
illustration of this (facsimile atlas, Table X XXVIII). The origin of
this globe, Nordenskj6ld thinks, may be traced to the years 1510 to
1515, while Harrisse has proven by an inscription discovered in Haiti
that we should not assign a date earlier than 1518 to the appearance of
the globe.

In the same way the date of a chart of the world, designed by Des-
calier, the so-called chart of Henry LI, was antedated by a year, until
the inscription with the date itself was discovered upon the original.
If, in the catalogue! of known charts, the figures of the year, in the
case of charts without date, are definitely or approximately given, these
figures should always be received with reserve, though I have always
endeavored to follow only the most approved authorities.

In the study of marine charts another difficulty arises, where it is a
question of identification or determination definitely of the old names
and reconciling them with the existing local appellations, for only a
portion of the names given by the discoverers themselves have been
retained up to the present time. Many of them likewise have been
modified, mutilated, or supplanted by other appellations even during

‘ Catalogue not translated.
292 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.

the lifetime of their sponsors. The Spaniards ignored the distinctions
of the Portuguese, and vice versa. Nay, more than this, of one and
the same marine expedition varying or widely differing charts might
be brought home by different pilots, and if upon these originals the
names were abbreviated or illegibly written not inconsiderable discrep-
ancies would necessarily arise in the first copies. The interpretation
of the names, moreover, is fraught with the difficulty that discoverers
have rarely given an exact description of the coasts in their written
reports, for only very seldom indeed, as in the case of Columbus, are the
ships’ logbooks or even an epitome of them accessible. The reports,
also, are not infrequently too vaguely or generally recorded—as, for
example, in the four voyages of the two Vespuccis—to afford any medium
for their correct interpretation. The description of the localities also
often presents wide divergencies. As the signification or correct inter-
pretation of the local names is often obscure or unintelligible, it is
natural that to fresh inquiries an elucidation of these details is often
embarrassing.

According to H. A. Schumacher’s communication (Kohl’s American
Studies, in the German geographical sheets, Bd. XI, p. 106, Bremen,
1888), J. G. Kohl writes concerning the old charts, in which he had for
years earnestly interested himself: ‘“‘One is to be cautioned against a
too indiscriminate use of these things. As a matter of course the
charts assume to give a correct representation of the countries in their
more prominent features, as the author proposes to himself at the
moment of their execution; but the operation of delineating charts,
which should properly have been the work of only cultivated and
learned minds, was often confided to very inexperienced hands, and was
conducted in part in an extremely negligent manner, while the draft
of a chart, correct in all its details, presupposes so extraordinary a
mass of information, that it was impossible to meet all its requirements
until in more recent times; and not until in more recent times was all
this knowledge combined and attainable in due form.”

Now all this may be readily conceded, and yet we are constrained,
where it is a question of the development of cartography, as in the
case of America, to consult and investigate closely the most insignifi-
cant sheet, and we must at all events endeavor to obtain a clear eluci-
dation of each of the names. But unfortunately it is hardly practicable
to determine with confidence, in the case of many of the important
voyages of discovery—as, for example, those of B. Gomez, Ayllons (in
spite of the Spanish chart of a Ribero)—what points of the coast are
indicated under the old designations, or in what locality a landing, or
possibly a settlement, has been effected.

If not for the determination of the local names, at all events for that
of the dates of discovery, the saints of the Catholic Church are of
great utility. The day of the discovery is hereby conclusively estab-
lished, and in accordance with this it may not infrequently be demon-

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 2938

strated that a discovery should not be credited to a sea captain whose
voyage harmonizes with the year but not with the month to which it is
accredited.

It may be profitable and useful in investigations relating to this sub-
ject to annex here an alphabetical list of the saintly names most fre-

quently in use.

Besides these saintly names, which for the most part fall upon their
feast days, though occasionally on a proximate date, the nomenclature
of the old maps consists only of characteristic symbols of the coasts
visited and first taken possession of. The usual names are as follows:

Similar general distinctions in reference to the character of the
coast, singularly enough, may be found upon charts, engraved or wood-
cut; that is to say, where they are true copies of marine charts.

The woodcut is the most brittle of all the substances employed, but
it came in use in all German charts. And here distortions of names
most readily occur, as well as limitations in the manner of representing
the prominent local features. The woodcuts fronting the marine
charts are inferior and rough, and reflect only imperfectly the informa-
tion obtained. Yetsuch a merely general index as bahia has become
a symbol of recognition for a whole collection of maps. The well-
known Bay of All Saints, on the coast of Brazil, was converted into
Abatia of the Saints, through the general distortion of names, and
afterwards into Abbey of all the Saints. It was in the German cos-

mography, beginning with the Waldseemiiller charts of 1513, that the.

remarkable error first appeared, which was more widely spread by
Schoner (Harrisse, Discovery of North America, p. 275).

THE TERRESTRIAL CHARTS AND GLOBES.

It deserves to be particularly emphasized that in those countries to
which we are chiefly indebted for discoveries in the New World, no
cosmographie science existed; that in Spain and Portugal no globe has
been produced, and only very rarely has a woodcut come to light.

What position the newly discovered islands—for of such the North
American regions apparently consisted—and also what situation the
great continent occupied on both sides of the equator relatively to all
other parts of the known world; whether the new country was to be
included with Asia in a broad signification, or whether connected with
Asia at all; whether what is now called North and South America
stand in any correlation to each other—all these questions were dis-
cussed in Germany and Italy, and more recently in France, but neither
in Spain nor Portugal. Various opinions and doctrines in reference to
these points arose and environed the gradual evolution of the new
hemisphere.

This first geographical development of scientific inquiry had gone
forth from Italy with the resuscitation of the “ Ptolemiius.” German
astronomers and mathematicians were once more seated at the feet of
the ancient Alexandrine geographers. For this reason the charts first
printed are, almost without exception, closely allied with the rapidly
succeeding editions of the Ptolemius. In accuracy of drawing and
copiousness of nomenclature, the Italian editions far exceeded the Ger-
man, for here we find the copperplate. In Germany, on the other

hand, the woodcut predominated in the restoration of the charts. It
was indeed a unique apparition that in the Romish edition of the
Ptolemiéus of 1508 a map of the New World by Johann: Ruysch should
present itself. Five years later on appeared the Strasburg Ptolemiius,
that being the earliest chart of the new coutinent executed beyond the
Alps. In the interim, however, globes carved in wood had made their
first appearance.

Notwithstanding the inferiority and brittle nature of the materials
used in the reduplication of charts, Germany won from the first an
acknowledged supremacy in the delineation of the contours of trans-
atlantic regions, and it continued to exercise this influence, uncon-
tested, for a full half century. The reason for this is avery remarkable
one. A small Vosges town, St. Die, the seat of the Lothringen Duke
Renatus, who died in 1508, acquired the foremost prominence in the
development of the cartography of America. Portuguese marine charts
and the reports of the four sea voyages of Amerigo Vespucci possibly
gave the first impulse to this art in 1506, The news brought to the
Duke was quickly appreciated in the halls of the Gymnasium College,
to which Walther Lud, Ringmann, and Waldseemiiller were attached.
The four marine voyages, in a Latin version, soon appeared, accom-
panied by a ‘“ Cosmographiz introductio,” or preliminary initiation in
the principles of cosmographic science, by Waldseemiiller, in which
the author, as is well known, in 1507 proposed the name America tor
the new continent. At the same time it was decided to convert the
marine charts, which had just reached the Duke, into a fresh edition of
the Ptolemius. The restoration of the charts was placed in the hands
of Waldseemiiller, but after many delays the work at length appeared
in 1513. How well this edition succeeded may be recognized from the
fact that in 1520 a second impression became necessary, and the
editions of 1522 and 1525, imitations of the charts of the same locality,
and even the Ptolemiius editions of Lyons in 1535, and of Vienna in
1541, were reproductions of the charts of Waldseemiiller.

St. Die, however, soon lost its prominence after the departure of
Waldseemiiller. His Ptolemius certainly appeared in Strasburg.
Nuremberg succeeded Strasburg with the globe of Schéner, and thus
an interest in cosmographie works extended more and more over Ger-
man territory until its acme was reached at the close of the era in the
Netherlands and on the Lower Rhine in the writings of Mereator.

If we now take a retrospective glance at the period when German
cosmographers dominated in cartographic designs, from 1508 to 1569,
several types, partly contemporary and partly subsequent, reveal
themselves, and acquire prominence in the representation of the
newly discovered regions of the globe.

In the interval of time here indicated seven different types may be
distinguished :

(1) Johann Ruysch, 1508. In North America the well-known coun-
tries of Greenland, Labrador, and Bacealaos (Newfoundland) are
296 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA.

regarded as the eastern coasts of Asia, whose farther extension south-
ward is given entirely in accordance with Behaim-Toscanelli. South
America has no connection with it.

(2) Waldseemiiller, 1509. The ‘‘Globustypus,” or globe type, with
the designation nee . The New World does not belong to Asia,
but consists of two parts or divisions intersected by the ocean. The
Central American straits are a characteristic feature. This impression
is adopted by Boulenger, Schoéner, the so-called Leonardo da Vinci,
and Nordenskjéld’s globe (Table 37), together with Apian, Gryniius,
and Honterus.

(3) America constitutes an homologous body of land, lying at a con-
venient distance from Eastern Asia and Western Africa. Stobnecza,
1512; Waldsemiiller, 1513.

(4) North America, for a considerable extent of territory, is connected
with Asia. Itis, in part, a tendency toward the first type. Accord-
ing to Harrisse (Discovery of North America, p. 284), the idea is to be
referred to Peter Martyr’s Enchiridion (De nuper sub D. Cardo repertis
insulis, simulque incolarum moribus. Basel, 1521). Perhaps Johann

Schoner likewise has given credit to these views in his obsolete globe of

1523, as he has doubtless done in his Opusculum Geographicum (Niirn-
berg, 1533), in which he writes, “‘Unde longissimo tractu occidentem
versus ab Hitspali terra est quae Mexico et Temistitan vocatur, in superiori
India, quam priores vocavere Quinsay (thence for a considerable extent
toward the west from Hispali is a country which is called Mexico and
Temistitan, which in Upper India our predecessors named Quinsay).
Apparently before Schoner’s little treatise this idea had been promul-
gated by the Hollander Franciscus Monachus, 1526, upon the hemi-
sphere drawn by him. This opinion was sissermuened by Oronce Finé,
and particularly in the Italian Ptolemius editions (Venice, 1548, 1561,
1562), and for a long while it found approval in Germany also.

(5) North America is not united to Asia, but is separated from it by
acontinuous sea, which becomes narrower and narrower from the north
to the east, and is almost reduced to a strait. The western coast
extends in a semicircular configuration toward the North Atlantic
Ocean. The marine route formerly traced in the middle of the New
World, is placed toward the north, and, in polar latitudes, is bounded
by Asia. This extends throughout the whole of America as far as
Greenland.

(6) Type of Sebastian Miinster, in which the influence of the chart
of Verrazzano and of Maggiolo in the north, especially through the
isthmus south of Newfoundland becomes apparent. South America
assumes al uncouth, fantastic form.

(7) North America and northern Asia lie east and west, and not
north and south, relatively to each other as in (5). A marine strait, in
Shape and location reminding us of Bering Straits separates the two
continents and is called Fretum Anian. This view is first met with in
Zaltieri’s chart of 1566. Mercator follows it in 1569 and Ortelius in 1570.

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.!
By HENRY O. FORBES.

The student of the general fauna and flora of the different countries
of the world soon finds himself faced by this remarkable fact, that the
same species of a genus or the same genera of a family often oecur at
spots on the earth’s surface separated by enormous distances, in the
interval between which there is to be found not a single specimen of
any of them. Before the Darwinian era we were taught that those
similar isolated forms originated where they are now found by the fiat
and at the incomprehensible will of the Creator; an explanation, how-
ever unsatisfying, which there was no going behind. The purpose and
design in this distribution may have appeared strangely erratic and
arbitrary, yet our longing to ‘know why” had to be stifled before this
ultimate fact that the power that willed it so was inscrutable; nor
dared one to question further without incurring the charge of sacrile-
giously prying into the unknowable. The light from laborious embry-
ological investigation, however, revealed no fact more clearly than this,
that the individuals of the same family, however far separated on the
globe, had arisen from the same progenitors by ordinary generation,
and that the cause of this random distribution of the same forms of life
in distant regions might, without impiety, be investigated, and with
some hope of success. Having once, therefore, all had a common
ancestry, how did they reach their present habitats, which are half the
circumference of the globe apart, and separated by wide and deep
oceans, impassable to them unless they flew, swam, sailed over on fioats,
or marched across by bridges that have disappeared between their
present and their former homes? For instance, the members of that
curious family of animals with something of the horse and the elephant
in their composition, the tapirs, are now found only in the southern
parts of South America on the one side of the globe, and in the center
of the islands of Sumatra and Borneo of the Malay Archipelago on the
other, and nowhere else. Their bizarre appearance and their close sim-

ilarity in form and structure render it absolutely certain that they have
had a common parentage, and that, though now living so widely sun-
dered from each other, they radiated from one ancestral home.

To trace out the migration of the varied forms of life, both animal
and vegetable, to their present habitats forms one of the most absorb-
ing of zoo-geographical investigations—a “study,” as Mr, Wallace well
remarks, “which will surely lead - - - to a fuller comprehension
of the complex relations and mutual interdependence which link every
animal and vegetable form with the ever-changing earth which sup-
ports them into one grand organic whoie,” and which, besides, will
enable the investigator to demark with increasing certainty, as his
labors progress, the changes in fluctuation of land and water which
the globe has from age to age restlessly experienced. As soon as our
knowledge of the fauna and flora of the continents and islands of the
elobe had advanced sufficiently far to enable fairly accurate system-
atic catalogues of the animals and plants inhabiting them to be drawn
up, many singular anomalies came to light, some of which have been
apparently sufficiently explained, while of others the causes are still
as inexplicable as ever.

In the year 1861 those distinguished paleontologists, Professors Herr
and Unger, pointed out that the present vegetation of the Eastern
States of America exhibited remarkable resemblances to that which
flourished in Europe during the Miocene age, and they suggested the
hypothesis that during the Miocene period Europe and America were
united by a land bridge (long celebrated as the Atlantis continent),
which stretched across the Atlantic Ocean. By the perusal of the
essay of these botanists, Recherches sur le Climat et la Végétation du
Pays Tertiare, Professor Oliver, of Kew, having been induced to inves-
tigate ‘‘carefully the relations between the Tertiary and some existing
floras,” was led to the conclusion that the intercommunity of “types
in the Tertiary beds of Europe and the present flora of the eastern
States of the North American continent took place, not over an Atlan-
tis, but over land probably in a comparatively high latitude to the
north of the Pacific Ocean” '—that is to say, that the flora of Kurope
followed the climate as, in that epoch, it became more and more genial
into the circumpolar regions, and thence it dispersed southward again
on the advent of the cold, into such parts of Asia and America as it
could obtain foothold in. That a genial climate and a vegetation of
very temperate character did exist to within nearly 8° of the North
Pole, was proved in a most conclusive manner by the officers of the
Arctic expedition of 1876, who discovered, in those now ice-bound
latitudes, fossil plants which now grow not farther north than mid-
Europe.

Perhaps nothing in natural history surprised naturalists more than
the distributional facts—both of the fauna and the flora—first indicated

1862, page 149.

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 299

by Mr. A. R. Wallace on the east and west sides of what is known as
Wallace’s Line, which separates the two Malayan islands of Bali and
Lombock. The strait that separates these islands is so narrow that,
standing on the vessel’s deck, the voyager to the southward has an
excellent view of the land on both sides, and can admire the richly
forest-clad and shapely voleanic cones of Agong and Rinjani that
tower into the blue on his right hand and on his left. To “the eastern
side of this line,” Mr. Wallace writes, “the fauna and the flora, and
even the people, are essentially Australian; to the western side, as
essentially Asiatic.” On crossing this narrow passage from west to
east “we at once meet with those singular birds, the mound builders
(Megapodide), as well as friar birds and other honeysuckers, cockatoos,
and many other groups found only in the Australian regions; while a
large number of animals found in every one of the Asiatic islands sud-
denly disappear. We have no longer any elephants, rhinoceroses, or
tigers; none of the carnivora but a common civet cat (probably intro-
duced); none of the insectivora but a small shrew; none of the num-
erous rodents but one or two squirrels.” Yet in the island of Timor,
farther to the east and near to Australia, one is surprised to discover
that, as Mr. Wallace points out, the characteristic mammals of Aus-
tralia are quite as much wanting as those of Asia. “ Birds,” he
remarks, ‘ however, having the means of passing freely over narrow
arms of the sea, have not been excluded, and, notwithstanding the sim-
ilarity in climate and vegetation to Australia, the birds and insects of
Timor more resemble those of Java, Celebes, and the Moluccas.” These
islands are hundreds of miles apart, and yet have an interchange,
according to Mr. Wallace, of many birds and insects; while from Bali
and Lombock, which gaze on each other across a narrow arm of the
sea, there has been, when the distances apart of the two localities are
compared, only a slight interchange. In South America again we have
genera of monkeys and birds living in abundance along one bank of a
river, which apparently find this comparatively narrow line of water
an impassable barrier.

In a paper contributed to The Fortnightly Review in May last I
referred to the discovery in the Chatham Islands (near New Zealand)
of the subfossil remains of birds which were up to that time known to
have lived only a few hundred years since in the Mascarene Islands
as confirming the belief that there must have existed in the southern
seas an extensive continuous land similar to that in the Northern
Hemisphere, on which the common ancestors of the forms unknown
north of the equator, but confined to one or more of the southern
extremities of the great continents, lived and multiplied, and whence
they could disperse in all directions. ‘This lost continent,” I observed
then, ‘“‘I am constrained to believe from evidence which space does
not on the present occasion permit me to adduce, lies in part beneath
the southern ice cap, and it approached to or included the Antarctic
300 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

islands as well as extended northward to unite with the southern
extremities of South America, perhaps with Africa, and with the
Mascarene, the Australian, and the New Zealand continental islands.”
The larger evidence to which I then referred I purpose now to lay
before the readers of this Review.

We find either still living or preserved fossil in the strata of their
Tertiary formations in regions of the Southern Hemisphere so widely
apart as the south of South America, the Madagascar region, Austra-
lia, and New Zealand many forms of plants and animals unknown in
the Northern Hemisphere possessing so many characters in common
as to show at onee that they are descended from the same stock.

To commence with birds, the distribution of the ostrich group is
very remarkable. New Zealand, as it is scarcely necessary to remind
the reader, is celebrated for the remains of those extinct giants of the
family known as moas. Their bones are found all over the two main
islands of which that colony consists, and they might have been gath-
ered in the early years of its settlement by Europeans in vast numbers
from off the surface of the ground, especially in the interior of the prov-
inces of Canterbury and Otago, or from the sandy flats of the larger
rivers where they had become exposed by the action of the wind.
They have also been found in caves, under rock shelters, and in the
ancient kitchen middens of the natives, as well as exhumed in enor-
mous quantities from the peat bogs of both islands, where they have
been discovered huddled together in crowds of many hundreds. These
birds varied very greatly in size, the larger specimens attaining a stat-
ure of from 10 to 12 feet. They had bones of herculean proportions, and,
needless to say, they were quite unable to fly, being, indeed, devoid of
wings. Their feathers, which, singularly enough, have been preserved
to us in considerable numbers, show that each had an after shaft equal
in length to the primary plumes of their contour feathers—forming, as
it were, a double feather—a characteristic mark of the ostriches of the
Australian region, the emus and cassowaries; and they all possessed,
on the metatarsal bone, articular pulleys for three toes instead of two,
as the African ostrich has. Australia also included in its bird fauna
of ancient days a giant ostrich, the Dromornis, and now possesses the
emu, while New Guinea reckons at the present time the cassowary—of
which one species crosses into Australia—among its wonderful bird
inhabitants. In the distant island of Madagascar also there flourished
once, though now extinct, a member of the same family, the Zpyornis,
a giant, if not in height, at all events in the bulk and dimensions of its
limbs, which appear to have exceeded those of even the most elephan-
tine of the moas. Yet another stately member, the Brontornis, lived
in early ages in southern Patagonia, a necessarily flightless bird,
which, as we know from its fossil remains, far excelled in stature even
the tallest of its New Zealand relatives. This remarkable group of
birds, therefore, we find occupied New Zealand, Australia, Madagas-

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 301

ear, and South America—that is, their distribution extended right
round, and was practically confined to the lands of the Southern Hem-
isphere, in which the area that each occupies is seen from a study of
the map to be separated from the other by vast stretches of unbridged
ocean. Yet a comparison of their skeletons—for of the moa, the
Hpyornis, and the Brontornis we have only their fossil bones to judge
from—leaves little doubt that they are all ramifications of one branch
of the same genealogical tree which flourished in a region which I hope
to indicate in the course of this paper, and that they wandered in
all directions from a common land by roads which I shall presently
attempt to trace.

The traveler interested in bird life who has spent some time either in
South Africa, or in South Australia, or has had the good fortune to
land on the shores of Terra del Fuego, or of one of the Antarctic
islands, can scarcely have failed to watch those quaint fishlike birds,
the penguins, which are far more at home under the water than they
are on the land. They breed in enormous rookeries on some of the
more unfrequented southern islands, but they are met with in all parts
of the Southern Hemisphere south of 40 degrees of south latitude,
each island or continent having some species peculiar to itself. One
important point in their history is that none of the family have ever
been found on the northern side of the equator, a distribution which
has probably been always equally circumscribed within these latitudes,
for their earliest fossil remains—osteologically identical throughout the
enormous period separating the Eocene from to-day—are known only
from, and are, so far as I am aware, confined to the older Tertiary
formations of New Zealand and Patagonia. More interesting still,
perhaps, and very important from the point of view of the subject of
this paper, is the distribution of the Chionide, a family of beautiful,
pure white birds related to the plovers. These sheath bills, as they are
named, from a conspicuous horny sheath at the base of their bills, are
not marine but land birds. They would be incapable of undertaking a
journey of any great duration across the sea where they could find
nothing to support them; yet they are found, so far as known, in
Fuegia and the neighboring Falkland Islands, but not elsewhere till
the far-off Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Land are reached.

The well-known and brilliantly plumaged family of the parrots have
their chief development in the Australian and Papuan regions and in
South America (with a few stragglers extending up into North Amer-
ica), while in South Africa and in India they are but feebly represented.
Now, the curious owl parrots and the keas of New Zealand have a
near relationship with the macaws of South America. Mr. Wallace
has pointed out that an unusual style of coloration occurs among the
parrots living both in Australia and the Masearene Islands; and that
though in Australia alone species adorned with crests now live, yet
within the historical period, such forms occurred in the. Mascarene
302 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

region also—characters, he observes, ‘too well marked to be considered
accidental.”

In the May number of The Fortnightly Review I have already drawn
attention to the fact that what now constitutes New Zealand was but
a small portion of a once far greater continental island—which I have
designated Antipodea—stretching south as far at least as the Mac-
quarie Islands, and embracing all those lying between .them and the
Chatham Islands, as well as those to the northward as far as New Cale-
donia, the Fiji, the Friendly, and the Kermadec islands—a fact de-
duced from the occurrence on these separated specks of land of a
common flora and fauna which could not have arrived there without a
land connection. On that occasion also, | spoke of the discovery in
the Chatham Islands—an unsubmerged portion of a once larger
region—of the remains of two birds, a tall coot (fulica) and a giant
wood hen (Aphanapteryx), which had been previously known only from
Mauritius, which is also an unsubmerged portion of a greater conti-
nental island, comprising Bourbon, Rodriguez, Madagascar, and the
Seychelles. The wood hens, a group of rails entirely unknown in the
Northern Hemisphere, are in the Southern Hemisphere absolutely con-
fined to the islands of the Mascarene and of the New Zealand archi-
pelagoes, which are separated from each other by nearly half the cir-
cumference of the globe. Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, speaking not long
ago on the ** Geographical distribution of birds,” at the Royal Institu-
tion, pointed out additional relationships (so far as their birds are con-
cerned) between these same widely disconnected areas. In the Island
of Bourbon there lived, till exterminated in comparatively recent times
by incursive Europeans, a very peculiar starling with a long, slightly
eurved bill, the Fregilupus, the sole species of its genus, of which
one of the very few examples that have been preserved may be
seen mounted in the bird gallery of the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington. It has. no near relatives except in New Zealand,
where the huia (Heteralocha gouldi), a bird equally peculiar and the
solitary representative of its genus, forms one of the most interesting
species of one of the most peculiar bird faunas of the world. The
huia is remarkable in that the shapeof the beak differs in the two
sexes in a most surprising manner in association with habits unique, I
believe so far as yet known, among the feathered tribes. The bill of
the male is straight, powerful, and sharp; that oft the female is in com-
parison exceedingly slender and strongly curved. ‘The straight-beaked
bird breaks up and chips off the bark and wood of trees, in quest of
the tunnels of the grubs and insects that form their food; while the
closely attendant female is keenly on the alert to thrust in its slender,
curved forceps—where the beak of its mate is useless—to extract each
nutritious morsel when discovered. Both are aberrant forms of their
family, and both are on excellent authority considered to be descend-
ants of the same ancestor. In the same two regions also, alone of all

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 303

the globe, there lived down to recent times, but now extinct (though
ornithologists still cling to the hope that a few survivors may yet be
holding out in the dense forests of southwest New Zealand), giant and
flightless forms of blue water hens of two species, the Aptornis and
the Notornis, of which as yet no remains have come to light in the
Mascarenes, but are still found in some abundance in the caves and
swamps of New Zealand.

The late Mr. W. A. Forbes (who at the time of his death held the post
of prosector to the Zoological Society of London, and had already be-
come distinguished as one of the best anatomists who had filled that
most coveted position), a man remarkable for the keenness of his
observational powers, for the amount and accuracy of his knowledge,
and for the tenacity of his memory in regard to details of structure,
investigated shortly before his death the relationships of Acanthido-
sitta and NXenicus, lively little birds which are year by year becoming
rarer in the forests and on the rocky talus slopes among the hills of
New Zealand, and discovered that, in their anatomical structure, they
have their nearest allies in Australia (and in part of the Indian region),
in Madagascar, and in South America, but exhibit few affinities with
groups elsewhere.

Professor Huxley many years ago, in a remarkable paper, read before
the Zoological Society of London, on the “Classification of the galli-
naceous birds,” pointed out that they fall into two great groups, the one
broadly occupying the Northern Hemisphere, and the other the South-
ern Hemisphere—Australasia and South America; thus dividing the
globe into two regions which he felicitously termed Arctogea and
Notogiea. The Notogean section of these birds comprises, according
to him, the mound builders or megapodes (Megapodide) in Australia
and Papuasia, and the curassows or guans (Cracide) in South America,
both of which possess structural peculiarities in common, pointing to
the fact that, though they now form different and easily distinguish-
able families occupying distant areas of the globe, they sprang from
the same stock.

The relationships of the groups above referred to as distributionally
confined to the Southern Hemisphere are such as as can be made out
by a trained eye without going very far below the surface; they are
classified by characters either externally apparent or recognizable by
an examination of their osteology or their coarser anatomy. But we
have evidence of the same affinities existing between the fauna of the
Same dissociated portions of the globe derived from a deeper source
than these. It is but a year or two since science had to mourn in the
death of Prof. W. K. Parker the loss of the very foremost of English
morphologists, and one whose knowledge of the anatomy—especially of
the cranial structure—not only of birds but of most of the vertebrates, |
from their embryo onward, was unrivaled. In one of those numerous
erudite papers, lit up with brilliant thoughts and analogies expressed
304 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

in deeply poetic language—unexpected in a subject so abstruse—an.

superbly illustrated by his own hand, which he communicated to th.

Zoological, the Linnean, and the Royal societies of London throughout
his life, he has published his labors on the embryology of some of th :
birds most typical of Australia—its piping crows, its warblers, ar 1
wood swallows. He devoted himself especially to the investigation of
the cranial constitution of birds from the very early stages of their
existence, for he believed that “ the outward form of the face gives tie
keynote to the whole bird; the head and face rule all things else, and
every modification in the organs of »rogression must be in aomieieen
with that deeper change which has taken place in the storied and
labyrinthine walls of the head.” He has unfolded their lineage as surely
as if he had witnessed its growth through the vistas of the past by
watching the laying together of each sep. rate element before ‘‘nature
with her cementing osteoblasts had obliverated their individuality.”
His penetrating eye detected the existence and recognized the signifi-
cance to their pedigree of those structures, useless to the individual
save that each new life must inexorably ascend by all the stairs its
sires have climbed before it, which within the secrecy of the egg appear
but for an hour and vanish as if they had never been. The pedigree
of the Australian piping crows arises, he finds, from the same stock
as the South American creepers (Dendrocolaptide); that of the wood
swallows oscillates between the ground thrushes (Pitta) of the Malayan
Archipelago and the South American ant thrushes; while the affinities
of the Australian warblers are with the wood warblers (Mniotiltida@) of
South America, all of them declaring their affinity with forms in the
Southern and not in the Northern Hemisphere—with groups whose
homes are not on land areas continuous to their own, but in regions
separated by wide seas, and at their farthest limits apart.

Such is the singular disconnected distribution of many undoubtedly
related groups of birds, of which I shall presently proceed to offer an
explanation.

Before doing so I wish to refer shortly to other sections of aie ani-
mal kingdom. It is well known that Australia is the great home of
those lowly mammals, the marsupials, the survivors of a family whose
ancestry dates back to the Trias, a period to be reckoned only in ages,
pach perhaps of thousands of centuries. They are remarkable, as an
order, for containing ‘‘isomorphs,” or groups that have the form and
habits of many of the various other orders of the animal kingdom.
The kangaroo rats, for instance, assume the outward form of our com-
mon rats and mice; others, such as the beautiful flying phalangers,
resemble the insectivora; while yet others, as the “*Tasmanian dev’ ~
are large, carnivorous, and wolf-like. Besides the Austromalaya.
region (which is a part of the Australasian realm), no region of the
globe now contains any representative of those implacental animals,
except the South American forests (from which two species have wan-
ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 305

dered into North America). The present marsupials, however, of South
America (the opossums) exhibit wide differences from those now living
in Australia; it is therefore not improbable that their ancestry must
be traced from forms once living, but now found fossil only, in North
America. The singular implacental animals now living in Australia
are but the remnants of a much more extensive order; for there van-
ished at a comparatively recent geological period other marsupials still
more remarkable, especially for their gigantic size. Of these the Dip-
rotodon attained to the proportions of a rhinoceros or a hippopotamus,
and the Nototherium to that of a tapir; while the Thylacoleo was a
gigantic carnivore that probably preyed on the titanic kangaroo of its
own time, an animal twice as tall as the largest “old man” kangaroo
(Macropus giganteus) of to-day, which has been known to measure
nearly 6 feet from the point of the nose to the root of the tail. The
interest of these remains has largely increased through the discoveries
of South American paleontologists who have quite recently disinterred
most unexpected treasures from the early Tertiary formations of Pata-
gonia, the first fruits, there can be little doubt, of a large harvest of
remains, which will certainly shed, as those already obtained have
done, a flood of light on the pedigree of many of the vertebrata. Among
these treasures not the least important are the remains of marsupials
closely related to the Diprotodon, the Thylacoleo, and the “Tasmanian
devil,” which, in the Pliocene age, flourished in Australia in such
abundance.

Turning for a moment to still another group of the vertebrata, we
find that, in such widely separated spots as New Zealand, Patagonia,
and the Falkland Islands, there occur identical species of different
families of fresh-water fishes. The southern salmon (Haplochitonide)
and the southern pikes (Galartide), which are unknown north of the
equator, and which could not traverse the wide expanse of sea dividing
them, are common to all of these localities.- Our highest authority on
ichthyology, Dr. A. Giinther, F. R.S., of the British Museum, has shown
that between the fresh-water fishes of Africa and Australia there is,
though not an extensive, yet an unmistakable affinity; while, with
many points of close resemblance between them, the African and the
South American genera are distinct, which indicates “ that the separa-
tion of these continents must have been of old date.”

Mr. Wallace has, in his great work on The Distribution of Animals,
pointed out how insects, as a whole, show a decided interrelation
between Australia and South America. Indeed, he believes that the
Buprestide, a family of brilliantly metallic beetles, had their original
development in temperate Australia, and spread thence, while of the
longicorn beetle (so named from the long antennie they possess) several
genera are common to South America, Australia, and New Zealand,
indicating that there must have been some means of communication
between these countries other than at present. Both the families of

sm 94——20
306 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

insects I have mentioned are wood borers, living on soft or decaying
trees, in which also their larve are developed, and necessarily requir-
ing for their growth and differentiation throughout the area of their
dispersal an extensive and wooded region—a genial Antarctic conti-
nent, not merely a series of far separated islands as stepping stones.
Now if we turn to the plants of the Southern Hemisphere, and con-
fining our attention to those not or but slightly ranging with the north
of the equator, we find they present the same problems for solution as
the fauna offered. Of the charming saxifrage family there are two
tribes (Hscalloniew and Cunoniec) which are peculiarly restricted to the
south of the equator. They contain between them thirty-five genera,
of which two only cross that boundary; the remaining thirty-three
genera are (istributed to New Caledonia, New Zealand, Australia (with
Tasmania), the Mascarene Islands, and South America areas, as we
have seen above in the case of the fauna, oceupied by related forms,
though separated from each other by wide seas. Of the forty-nine
genera and nine hundred and fifty species of the Proteaeew, the whole,
with the infinitesimal exception of twenty-five species which pass to
the north of the line, are distributed across the same regions, with the
addition of South Africa. The genus Cryptocarya of the Perseacee is
common to New Zealand, South Africa, and South America, while
among the genera of other families we find some occurring in Africa,
or Madagascar and Australia; some in Tasmania and South Americz
only; while others crop up in South Africa and Australia, or New
Zealand, or in New Zealand and South America only. During my
travels in the Eastern Archipelago I discovered growing wild in the
forests of Java a large colony of Petrewa arborea, an arboreal species of
the Verbenacee, which at the end of the last century (1792) was found
by Smith and Wiles, on the Providence expedition, in Timor also. This
genus was previously supposed to be entirely confined to the South
American continent. And yet another near relative, Petrwa viter, has
still more lately been obtained in the islands of Buru and Amboina.
Now, as to the explanation of these instances of singularly discon-
nected distribution of so many plants and animals, the highest authori-
ties are by no means agreed. Nor is it a question that can be finally
settled while our information on many points necessary to its solution is
so fragmentary. Year by year, however, new discoveries are mending
the imperfections of our records, while continued sifting of the evidence
already gathered is gradually eliminating what is unreliable and estab-
lishing more firmly that which is trustworthy. So far as his latest
opinions have been expressed, Mr. Wallace, our highest authority on
geographical distribution, holds that the presence of these numerous
genera and species of the same families or groups of plants and animals
in Australasia, in the Mascarene Islands, or in South Africa, and in
South America, can be sufficiently explained as the remnants of ancient
types once spread over the Northern Hemisphere, whose lands are prac-
ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 307

tically continuous, driven southward along these continents by the
pressure of more specialized types, and now finding refuge in these
widely separated southern lands. No one can differ from Mr. Wallace
on this subject without great diffidence, and certainly no one can feela
profounder admiration, even veneration, than the present writer (who
has followed in so many of his footsteps in the archipelago he has made
famous, with his fascinating book as his best guide and companion) for
the opinions and writings of this most distinguished doyen of our
naturalists. Still, 1 ean not persuade myself that this explanation covers
all the instances of discontinuous distribution—of forms unknown in
the Northern Hemisphere—which have been adduced in the foregoing
pages. It seems too extraordinary to be credible that it should alone
have been the same forms that have survived the vicissitudes of climate
and food during their long migrations through the deserts and forests
of Asia, Malaya, and Australia to reach New Zealand; of Europe and
Africa to reach the Cape and Madagascar, and of North and South
America to arrive in Patagonia, and even in the Antarctic islands, and
that scarcely a single representative of their line should have survived
north of the equator. Nor does the explanation that has also been
offered of the occurrence of the same genera and species in those
remote regions—that they have been the result of independent devel-
opment—appear to me to be more satisfactory; for the chances against
the same genus or species becoming developed independently at various
times in three or four distinct regions of the globe, under different con-
ditions and latitudes, and only in the southern extremities of the great
continents, are enormously great.

It has hitherto been laid down as a fundamental law in geographical
distribution that the areas inhabited by a given species, and in con-
siderable measure likewise by the same genera, are or have been
continuous with each other. The conclusion has been forced upon us,
therefore, that there must once have existed in the Southern-Ocean a
land area common to the terminations of the great continents exten-
sive enough to afford room for the development of the ancestors of so
many forms of life absent from the Northern Hemisphere; and that it
was very genial in climate and clad with vegetation sufficiently luxu-
riant to support so varied a fauna. In studying the Southern Hemi-
sphere on a globe, on which the natural relations of land and water are

evident, and tracing out the continental shelf surrounding the exist-

ing Antarctic land within the contour of the 2,000-fathom line, so far as
it is known, I was surprised to observe that the land that would result
from such an elevation of the Antarctic sea floor would explain the
perplexing distribution of the southern fauna and flora. It was also
evident that a continent so formed would not interfere with the opin-
ions entertained by so many of our highest geological authorities and
oceanographers, that the beds of the great oceans are troughs, and the
great meridianal land masses are buckles (in parts at one time dry and
308 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

at another submerged) of the earth’s crust, both of which have practi-
cally been permanent since primeval times, or to quote Mr. Darwin,
that ‘*where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the
remotest period of which we have any record; and where continents
now exist large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no doubt, to
ereat oscillations of level since the Cambrian period.”

The boundaries of this continent of Antarctica, as 1 have proposed
to designate it, would have united Patagonia, New Zealand (as part
of such a large continental island as I have described and named
Antipodea, on page 299), Tasmania with East Australia, and that old
island-continent (joined, perhaps, by a narrow commissure, for a longer
or shorter time, to East Africa), which Dr. Sclater long ago named
Lemuria, to a circumpolar land greater than at present by extensive
independent peninsulas, between which the Atlantic, the Pacific, and
the Indian oceans extended almost as far south as they do now. It
will be observed that South Africa is excluded in this view from actual
contact with this southern continent. That it did not remain so long
as the others in direct connection with Antarctica seems indicated by
the presence of so aberrant a form of the struthious family in that
country as its ostriches, which possess on their tarso-metatarsal bones
two articulatory trochlee only, thus reducing theirs to a two toed
instead of a three-toed foot, as is found in the moas, the pyornis, the
cassowaries, the emus, and the Brontornis. The loss of this toe points
unquestionably to a very long isolation of the ostrich from inter-
marriage with the more normal members of its order. The African
ostriches also differ from the eastern members of the family, in having
no after-shaft to their contour feathers, a character in which they
agree with the rheas of South America, a group to which the African
ostriches are more closely, though still very distantly, related than
perhaps to any of the others. It would seem highly probable also that
the connection between South America and Africa was severed at a
very early period—an assumption supported by the distribution of the
fresh-water fishes of Patagonia and South Africa, which, though indi-
cating, as Dr. Giinther has so well elucidated, by the undoubted affini-
ties between them, a previous approximation of the two regions, yet in
the distinctness of their genera plainly speaks of a long disseverance.
The boundaries of this Antarctic continent, which I have indicated,
would have inelosed all the circumpolar land and the islands in the
Southern Sea. Actual, apart from deductive, evidence for the exist-
ence of a greater extension of land in this region is of course very
limited, yet it is not altogether absent.

No visitor to the Chatham Islands can fail to be struck by the num-
ber of lakes and tarns that everywhere dot the landscape.’ Nor can he
travel far without remarking that the surface of the ground is covered
by a continuous layer of peat, which is in many places 40 to 50 feet
deep, and in some still unfathomed. It is in general solid enough
ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 309

to permit safe traffic over it, but extensive areas are covered with
unsuspected wet bogs extremely dangerous to a pedestrian unacquainted
with the country. The time required for the accumulation of this
enormous deposit may be imagined when it is remembered that it takes
several feet of sphagnuum—the moss of which peat is chiefly composed—
as seen growing on the surface of the bog, to form 1 inch of dense
black peat at its bottom. Everywhere throughout those peat bogs
trunks of trees, larger than and of a different sort to those that now
grow in the islands, lie entombed. They are the remains of ancient
forests which have succumbed ‘to the chilling effects of the wet bog
mosses in their upward growth.” The woods that now or did recently
(for they are fast disappearing before the demands of the agriculturist)
cover the ground are but the latest of a succession of forests already
swallowed up that had in turn taken possession of the land wherever
the water had drained away and the growth of the mosses ceased.!
The antiquity of these islands is proved by the fact that in different
places the more ancient of these peat beds have become consolidated
into lignite.

This account of the surface features of the Chatham Islands might
serve equally for those of Kerguelen Land, which also abounds in large
bogs, in lakes and great pools in the hills, and in fiords—all evidences
of great antiquity, of glaciation probably, and certainly of very exten-
sive subsidence. In the Auckland Islands also occur bogs and beds of
bituminous peat; while both in the Crozets and in Kerguelen Land
fossil trunks of large trees have been found, all distinctly pointing to
the existence of extensive and varied forests on these now sleet-swept,
bare, inhospitable lands. The prevalent features of the present flora
of Kerguelen are Fuegian, many of the species in both regions being
identical or nearly related, while others are common to Tasmania, and
still others to one or more of the unsubmerged fragments of Antipodea
(New Zealand and its surrounding islands), and some to all these three
regions, one fern being common to Kerguelen and the Cape of Good
Hope. To Kerguelen Land and to Marion Island, 1,600 miles west of
it, is confined a still more remarkable genus of plants, kuown as Pring-
lea. It is very distinct, is without near relatives, and is the survivor
of a flora unknown in any other part of the globe. Its seeds are per-
ishable, and on this account it is very unlikely that it has been con-
veyed by birds from one island to the other; and is therefore with
high probability indigenous to both. Its distribution to those isolated
spots, and various ‘‘ phenomena, besides, common to the three archi-
pelagoes—Kerguelen, Crozets, and Marion—favor,” in the opinion of
Sir Joseph Hooker and other high botanical authorities, the ‘ inference

or an archipelago extending farther westward,” on which the progeni-
tors of their once existing, or still surviving, endemic flora became
developed.

On a former page it was predicated that if such an austral continent
ever did exist, it must have been blessed with a very genial if not a
tropical climate, capable of supporting extensive forests and other lux-
uriant vegetation fit to harbor and nourish the marsupials, the birds,
and the insects found in these southern regions. That such extensive
forests did exist in far southern latitudes requires no more proof than
the occurrence of the fossil tree stems in Kerguelen Land and in the
Crozets; while I shall now try to show that the genial climate of which
I have spoken once prevailed in these islands.

It is to the late Dr. James Croll that we owe the first satisfactory
account of the astronomical and physical causes on which climate
depends, especially in reference to the causes of the glacial epochs,
which he proved to be, in that hemisphere, due to the occurrence of
winter when its pole was turned away from the sun at the same time
that the earth during its greatest eccentricity was at its farthest dis-
tance in its orbit from the source of heat. Sir Robert Ball, who has
made some important additions to this theory (by establishing mathe-
matically the different percentages of heat that are received in the
summer and in the winter of each hemisphere) emphatically asserts, as
a mathematician, that it is of the essence of the astronomical theory
that “the glaciation over the hemisphere shall be simultaneous,” and if
it were not so “it would seem wholly impossible to offer an explanation
of the phenomena by any physical cause known to us.” On the other
hand, ‘“‘ viewing the two hemispheres each as a whole it is important to
observe that their respective glaciations were not simultaneous,”
indeed “if it could be shown that the ice ages in the two hemispheres
were concurrent, the astronomical doctrine would have to be forthwith
abandoned.” ‘It is also of the essence of the astronomical theory,” he
maintains, ‘that a glacial epoch in one hemisphere shall be accom-
panied by a genial epoch in the other, and that, after certain thousands
of years, the climatic conditions of the two hemispheres shall become
interchanged; that the ice shall leave - - - and the regions that it
has abandoned shall become clothed with luxuriant vegetation.” Since
the duration of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, when once it
supervenes, endures through a period in which the rotation of the line
of the equinoxes round the eclipse may take place more than once,
‘clusters of ice ages and genial ages” may have followed each other
before each period of high eccentricity which originated them passed
away. ‘Hach hemisphere is plunged alternately into extremely gla-
cial and extremely genial conditions, and though, no doubt, during the
transition, there may be centuries during which intermediate condi-
tions will prevail, yet such periods can hardly be said to have resem-

bled the normal conditions of the globe such as that which it now
enjoys.” |

Many authorities are of opinion that great subsidences of land are
natural concomitants of a glacial period, and that it naturally follows
that the accumulation of ice at one pole must abstract and pile up a
large amount of water, and thus cause land in the opposite hemisphere
to be uncovered.

During the continuance. therefore, of the glacial epoch in the North-
ern Hemisphere, there must have existed over the Southern Hemisphere
an extremely genial epoch, during which there is no doubt that where-
ever land existed it was clothed with a luxuriant vegetation, and that
its boundaries would be enlarged from the causes just spoken of. This
vegetation would, doubtless, not be less varied and tropical than that
which flourished in high northern latitudes in Miocene times, and which
was still a remarkably temperate flora within 84 degrees of the North
Pole, and it is evident that it could harbor, and on it there could
develop the ancestors of the fauna and flora whose descendants are now
scattered across all the southern regions of the globe. That an exten-
sive land did exist not dissimilar to that described in a former page,
seems to me almost an inevitable deduction from the distributional facts
adduced above—especially in regard to the insects, the marsupials, the
birds, and the plants. Of this mass of evidence, the distribution—to
shortly recapitulate—of the three trochleaed struthious birds in all the
great regions; the Aphanapteryx, the blue gallinuies, the starlings, and
the crested parrots in Antipodea and Lemuria; the fresh-water fishes
of Australia and America—none of them northern forms—is, to me at
least, evidence not otherwise explicable. But none of that evidence
seems to me to testify with greater weight than the embryological and
anatomical data, which I have quoted from the writings of those dis-
tinguished workers, Parker and Forbes, two men of the highest
authority in their science, inasmuch as it has been detected, not in the
superficial characters only, but deep down in structures whose simi-
larity can not but proclaim genetic relationship, through ancestors who
have now vanished, and whose homes must have been on a land com-
mon to and in connection with those widely separated regions which
their descendants now occupy. The necessity for the existence of a
land surface in the Antarctic Ocean was recognized and has been
expressed by Mr. Darwin. ‘ New Zealand is plainly,” he says, “related
to South America, which though the next nearest continent is enor-
mously remote, yet this difficulty disappears in the view that New Zea-
land, South America, and the other southern lands have been stocked in
part from the Antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation
during a warmer Tertiary period.”? Dr. Blanford, in his well-known

ies ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

address to the. Geological Society of London, in 1890, gave it as his
opinion that “if the difficulty about the depth of the intervening ocean
is overcome”—and such a continent as I have sketched out in the
rough, whose shores, more or less, followed the 2,000-fathom line, pre-
sents no insuperable bathymetrical difficulties to acceptance—“ there
is no improbability in the suggestion that at some period of geolog-
ical history an important continent, having connections with South
America, South Africa, and New Zealand, may have occupied the
Antarctic area.”

Throughout his wonderful papers on the embryology of the bird’s
skull, Professor Parker! constantly perceives and insists on the neces-
sity of dividing birds into northern and southern forms: ‘“ In the South
the most struthious types, and in the North the highest,” and he
expresses his belief that our bird groups are “ as important for study in
their geographical distribution as in their taxonomy or their morphol-
ogy.” Professor Parker constantly adduces also instances of the rela-
tionship of the birds of the eastern with those of the western side of
Notogwea. ‘If these instances, ” he says, ‘‘of changed forms in the east-
ern Notogwa, corresponding to unchanged (or less changed) types in
the western Notogza, can be shown to be common, it will go far toward
the establishment of a true theory of dispersion and modification of
types. If not, if every zoological species has been created, as it is now,
fenced in by laws that can not be broken, ‘a hedge set about it and 11
that it hath,’ then I trust, for the sake of true science, that this glam-
our will soon be removed from our eyes, and that we shall not be lured
on farther after evolutional ‘will-o’-the-wisps.’” This bond of organic
community must have been by a land area in the southern seas, which
with considerable probability oceupied the region which I have desig-
nated Antarctica. It seems to me that such geological evidence as
the occurrence of fossil penguins in the Eocene of both Patagonia and
New Zealand, and of marsupials and dinornithine ostriches in the early
Tertiaries of South America, of Dinornis and Apyornis in New Zea-
land and Madagascar, point to the existence of southern land—doubt-
less with elevations and subsidences between—at least from the close
of Secondary times. But it is impossible, at least yet, to determine
whether the fauna and flora of which remnants exist in the present
southern continents and islands are the result of the development
and dispersal during the genial period corresponding to the last of the
northern alternating clusters of glacial and genial periods during the
latest high orbital eccentricity, or partly of the first-of these or of a
combination of both and of similar former vicissitudes.

It seems established on paleontological evidence that in the Northern
Hemisphere, during the early part of the Tertiary period, the climate
was tropical in the middle of Europe, and that in the Miocene we have

'On Agithognathous Birds, Transactions Z. 8., Vol. X.

a ee
ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. eile

this climate extending not only to the limits of the north temperate
zone, but a luxuriant temperate flora flourishing up to nearly 82° of
north latitude. It seems difficult, too, to believe, if we compare all the
conditions now existing at both poles under the present low eccentricity
of the orbit, that such a genial climate as just described could have
prevailed at so high a latitude, except under the conditions that would
necessitate a glacial epoch at its antipodes. So that, if we accept the
astronomical theory, we must believe that during the northern Miocene
period there was a glacial epoch in the Southern Hemisphere, of which
the rock striation and moraines in Africa, the moraines in Australia,
New Zealand, and South America, may perhaps be the result. That
there was at this time a force driving southern and tropical forms to the
north is strongly corroborated by the distribution of the fossil Sirenia
(now, and probably always, exclusively confined to the Tropics) of
which there are twelve genera and twenty-seven species ranging from
the Tropics up to 60° of north latitude in the Eocene and Miocene of
Kurope, Asia, and North America.!’ The remains of southern forms of
birds, such as parrots and trogons, not infrequent in the Oligocene and
Miocene strata of Europe may not unlikely have been migrants driven
from the south before the same impelling force. That there has been
such a northward migration is also evidenced by the occurrence of so
many plants belonging to New Zealand, Australia, and some of the
Antarctie islands isolated on the peaks of New Guinea and of Borneo.
We must caution the reader, however, against supposing that the
southern formations which have been named Eocene and Miocene, ete.,
are necessarily synchronous with those so named in the Northern
Hemisphere. All that can be affirmed is that those systems which con-
tain a similarity of succession of their fossils (especially their marine
organic remains) are homotaxial—that is, the order in which they
appeared on the earth has been similar.

This much, however, may be accepted as mathematically demon-
strated, that, during the glacial epoch of the Northern Hemisphere,
while the high eccentricity of the earth’s orbit lasted, there was an
extremely genial age over the continent, the probability of whose exist-
ence we have shown to be high, and that its fauna and flora, of which
some examples have been cited, were eventually expelled from their
southern paradise, on the passing away of the northern glacial epoch,
by the slow increase of the southern cold, which has gradually reached
to but no farther than its present condition toward glaciation, owing to
the decrease of the eccentricity of the orbit and by the extensive sub-
sidences of the land, due probably both to the ice accumulation round
its pole and to the enormous amount of voleanie disturbance of which
the whole region appears to have been the theater.

Now, as to the explanation of these anomalies of distribution in the
Southern Hemisphere, the arrangement of land which I have outlined

‘Dr. H. Woodward, F. R.S., in the Geological Magazine, page 423, 1885.

oe ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

above will, I think, account for them not less satisfactorily than that
by an entirely northern center of dispersion. Mr. Wallace! holds that
‘“the three most important south temperate land areas—south tem-
perate America, South Africa, and Australia—have in all probability
always been as widely separated from each other as now,” and “ that
it is unnecessary to suppose any land connection to explain the resem-
blance between their animal and vegetable inhabitants,” as he considers
that the northern continuous land was the origin of them all, and that
they spread meridianally south. That many forms of life did thus
reach Notogea “under pressure” of glacial epochs and ‘of more
specialized types” it is impossible to doubt. But, as I have already
remarked, this explanation will not account for marks of heredity seen
in such southern groups as the piping crows of Australia and the den-
drocolaptine birds of America, and the many other instances in the
same category enumerated by Professor Parker. That their original
ancient progenitor may have come from the north is, of course, possible,
but the characters that prove a common parentage—in forms now so
diverse—could not have arisen in birds living so far apart as Australia
and South America, without, I believe, a large common land area on
which the progeny of the original parents could develop and spread
over.

Mr. Wallace believes also that the ancestral forms of the marsupials
and monotremes reached West Australia (which for a long period in
secondary and primary times was separated off as an island from East
Australia, an arm of the sea uniting the Banda and the Antarctic seas)
from the north, through Java and the intervening islands or land in
that sea. Their fossil forms have, however, been chiefly found in East
Australia, or if found in West Australia, they occur in strata certainly
of no greater age. If such, indeed, were the route of their southward
march, it is remarkable that throughout the extensive regions over
which they passed not a single individual has survived—not even in
Timor, an island of like vegetation and climate to Australia, and that
nearest to West Australia; while marsupials and monotremes are rep-
resented abundantly on the northern and eastern Papuasian islands,
with which West Australia, as Mr. Wallace believes, was not at that
period in connection. That these groups may have originated in Antare-
tica and spread into Australia via its Tasmanian peninsula, since fossils
presenting many affinities with the Australian forms have recently been
discovered in Patagonia, appears to me a not less satisfactory explana-
tion of their distribution. Their absence so far from New Zealand is
not more difficult to account for than their entire absence in the land
which, according to Mr. Wallace, they traversed. Again, as regards the
dispersal of the ancestors of the struthious birds, Mr. Wallace believes
that they reached East Australia from New Guinea, with which it was
united across Torres Strait; and that the emus, the cassowaries, the

‘Island Life, page 527.
ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 315

Dromornis, and the moas are their descendants. If the forms with a
three-trochleaed metatarsus (from South America, Madagascar, and
New Zealand) had been developed on a southern land, they could, on
their dispersal and northern trek, have reached the region where they
now are with as much ease as by the route supposed by Mr. Wallace.

The earliest strata in which the fossil remains of both the Northern
and Southern Hemisphere struthious birds have been found have been
determined as Eocene, but whether these were really contemporaneous
periods in the north and in the south, and which is the older, it is
impossible to tell, so that their migrations may have been quite as
likely from the south as from the north; indeed, the struthious type of
bird is, according to Professor Parker, essentially Notogwean. The
African ostrich has been isolated from its congeners in the south for a
long period of time through the disconnection of Africa from Antare-
tica, and has become specialized and lost its third metacarpal trochlee
and the toe it carried. Since its isolation it has spread over Africa
northward, but it once lived in Miocene times in Greece, in Persia, and
in the Siwalik region of India. Again, in New Zealand and in East
Australia we find a great similarity in the genera of their plants,
while the species they possess in common are comparatively few, which
is what might be expected in regions unconnected with each other
except through a common land at some distance—the Antarctic conti-
nent I have predicated. No other explanation except a common
southern land will satisfy the distribution of the Aphanapteryx, the blue
water hens and the starlings of the Mascarene and the New Zealand
regions—groups of birds which are unknown on the north side of the
equator. ,

Asis well known, there live in the Galapagos Islands, on the equator,
off the west coast of America, giant tortoises, of which one of the most
remarkable facts about them is their zoological isolation. They have
no relations with any of the forms of their own order on the neighboring
continent. In several of the Mascarene Islands there lived when they
were first visited by Europeans enormous numbers of equally giant
tortoises—of which a few still survive—also in as complete isolation as
the Galapagos species, for they can claim no relationship with the tor-
toises of the nearest land, Africa. Yet, strange to say, the tortoises of
Aldabra and Madagascar indicate the closest affinity with those of the
Galapagos Islands. This extraordinary and seemingly inexplicable case
of distribution receives, in my opinion, its easiest explanation by sup-
posing that their ancestral home was in Antarctica, whence, forced by
cold and the submergence of the land south of them, they traveled
north by diverging tracks, wandering, the one along the west coast of
America and the other toward Lemuria, where, having reached islands
without foes, they have prolonged their years beyond those of their
fellows, which have died out everywhere else.
316 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND.

It is not necessary to suppose—and, moreover, it is very improbable—
that all these continental southernly peninsulas were contempora-
neously connected with Antarctica. It is impossible otherwise to
account for the presence, for instance, of the same South American
forms in Australia and their absence in New Zealand; for Mascarene
forms in the New Zealand region and not in Australia or Africa or
elsewhere. So long as we are unacquainted with the orography of the
submerged southern continent, with its mountain and river barriers,
and the order of the making and breaking of its various commissures,
we can hardly hope to account satisfactorily for all the anomalies of the
southern distribution, none of which, however, are inexplicable when
the inevitable elevations and subsidences due to the vast ‘physical dis-
turbances, of which we have abundant evidence all over the region, are
considered.

Shortly, therefore, it is highly probable that an extensive continent
existed in the Southern Hemisphere, on which many forms of terrestrial
life originated and had there the original center of their development
and dispersal; that Professor Huxley’s division of the globe, according
to the distribution of its life, into a northern and into a southern land
must be accepted as its two primary biological divisions, from whose
centers of development at both poles the wanderings of the fauna and
flora were regulated by cold and warm periods and by the elevation
and flooding of one part of the continental plateau after another, and
that from their advances and retreats across the equator and their jour-
neyings from east to west, according to the geographical features of
the region and its meteorological conditions, on which their existence
depends, resulted the present wonderful distribution of life on the
globe which forms so fascinating a study to all who commence it.
THE PROMOTION OF FURTHER DISCOVERY IN THE ARCTIC
AND THE ANTARCTIC REGIONS!

By CLEMENTS R. MARKHAM, C. B., F. B.S.

In delivering my anniversary address for the first time as your presi-
dent, it is with a feeling of intense satisfaction that I am able to do so
after all old wounds have been permanently healed over, and after per-
fect harmony has been restored in the society. It was found last year
that the rules did not all work so as to give complete satisfaction either
to the council or to the rest of the fellows, and some deplorable friction
was the result. This has now been remedied. The privileges and
rights intended to be enjoyed by the fellows under the charter have
been fully and clearly secured to them by the rules; all possibility of
contentious discussion and debate has been entirely banished for the
future from our anniversary meetings; and special general meetings
will not be called without more ample notice than has hitherto been
given, while requisitions for them will be made, and resolutions will be
passed by a more adequate number of fellows. These alterations in the
rules were called for by the general sense of the fellows. They have
removed all feeling of dissatisfaction that lingered amongst us. It will
be my aim, as your president, to maintain the harmony which happily
now exists by keeping the fellows acquainted with the decisions of the
council affecting the well-being of the society, and by using every effort
to prevent friction, and to promote, and if possible to increase, the
interest taken in the society’s work by the individuals who compose it.

I have long entertained the idea that these desirable objects might
be secured, among other ways, by a plan which, with much help and
advice from members of the council and from the society’s staff, is now
nearly matured. I have drawn up a list of all the fellows who have
written papers for our Proceedings or Journal, or have published books,
or are known to have a special knowledge of one or more departments
of our science, and to this list additions have been made by others.
For the present I have called it a List of Referees, because papers or

questions can advantageously be referred for report to any of the fel-
lows contained in the list, as regards their special subject or subjects.
It is divided into two parts, the first being an alphabetical list of names
with the subjects respecting which each is an expert; and the second
being arranged according to countries and subjects. It will be sent to
many fellows of the society for suggestions and additions, and when tol-
erably complete, it will probably include several hundred names. Some
fellows are collectors of geographical books or maps. Others may have
a profound knowledge of particular regions, or of special departments
of our work, who have never published anything. The referees may
have papers referred to them, may become members of committees on
questions relating to their special subjects, and would, no doubt, be
ready to give information and advice to inquiries, while the couneil will
be mainly recruited from them. The existence, and eventual publication,
of the List of Referees will be of.use to the general body of fellows in
various ways. ‘Taking a more general interest in geographical subjects,
the elders will thus be informed whither to go for information on points
that occupy their attention, while it will be the ambition of the younger
members to qualify themselves for inclusion in the list. In various
ways | confidently hope that the plan will have the desired tendency
of drawing the fellows more together, and into nearer touch with the
council.

Another measure, which I anticipate will have a similar effect, will
be to offer more inducements to study and make use of the great store
of geographical information in our library, by the completion of the
catalogues, and by giving greater convenience and more comfort to
readers. The present alphabetical catalogue was made in 1865, and
there have been two supplements in 1870 and 1880. But in 1893 it was
decided to recast the whole catalogue, including the three supplements
(for a third up to 1890 had been prepared and was ready for printing),
and to make one continuous alphabetical catalogue, printed in smaller
type than previously and in double column, and brought down to 1893.
It is now all in print. There will be two appendices, the first contain-
jng an alphabetical list of all the collections of voyages and travels,
with an analytical table of contents to each volume, which is also in
type. The second appendix is devoted to anonymous and periodical
literature arranged in geographical order. The catalogues have been
made under the control and superintendence of Dr, Mill. The assistant
in the library, Mr. Vincent Hawkins, deserves great credit for his
industry and diligence, and Dr. Murie has now put the series of period-
icals into perfect order, making a list of all deficiencies; but the second
appendix is not yet finished. The authors’ catalogue will, however,
be in the hands of the fellows in the course of the present year.

A subject catalogue was prepared by Mr. Godfrey Evans in 1871, and
was extremely useful, but it now contains less than half the books in
the library. In 1892 it was therefore resolved that a new and exhaustive
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. a19

subject catalogue should be prepared, and the services of Dr. Murie
were secured, to work at it under the control of Dr. Mill. He has since
given the society the benefit of his remarkably wide knowledge of
geography and travel, and of his rare perseverance and organizing
ability. The three essentials of this catalogue are that it is to be
exhaustive, systematic, and exclusively geographical, many works in
the library that are not geographical appearing only in the authors
catalogue. A subject catalogue fulfilling these conditions will be an
invaluable contribution to geography, serving as a guide to all workers
in all parts of the world, as well as rendering the contents of the library
accessible to fellows. It involves enormous labor. Al the titles of
books and pamphlets in the printed catalogues, numbering 18,000, have
been cut out and classified; and all transactions and periodicals have
been rearranged. Dr. Murie calculates that the number of titles of
papers in periodicals will amount to 84,000; so that the complete cata-
logue will comprise about 110,000 titles, occupying 5,000 octavo pages
of print. Dr. Murie is now put upon his metal to complete the work
in not more than two years.

Dr. Mill gave a new form to the bibhography in the Journal when it
was commenced last year. It was made to include not only books and
separate pamphlets, but all the longer geographical papers which
appeared in the periodicals received in the library. Thus an analysis
of current geographical work is presented each month. From these
notices a subject card catalogue has been compiled since June, 1892,
divided into continents and subdivided into countries and provinces,
the arrangement being assisted by the use of differently colored cards.
As it is kept up to date, this card catalogue forms an appendix to the
great subject catalogue.

As soon as the alphabetical catalogue is finished I intend to estab-
lish two desiderata books—one for fellows to enter any book they may
have asked for which is not in the library, and the other to contain a
complete list of works which are wanting to make our library perfect.

I am very anxious that the accommodation for readers should be
improved and that they should be made more comfortable, in order
that their numbers may increase and that more use may be made of
the library. Several suggestions have been made with this object in
view from time to time, and now the question of either improving and
enlarging the accommodation in our present house or of buying other
premises is occupying the very serious attention of the council.
Momentous financial and other questions are involved, and the subject
is one which calls for most careful consideration. It will not be decided

_ hurriedly, and no irremediable step will be taken without the consent

of the fellows of the society assembled at a special general meeting.
At the same time a final decision is rather pressing, as all the work is
kept in an unsettled state until it is known whether we are to remainin
our present house or to go elsewhere. For instance, the press marking
320 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

of the books in the library can not be proceeded with until it is known
on what shelves they are to rest. The fellows may be assured that our
deliberations wili be full and mature, that we shall seek the best advice,
and that our final decision on this subject will be the best that can be
made under the very difficult circumstances, when there are so many
things for and against any course we can adopt.

The Geographical Journal in its present form has now completed
the first eighteen months of its existence, and we may claim for it that
it has more than fulfilled the expectations that were entertained of it.
We now receive every month the papers read at our evening meetings,
with good and original maps, with the discussions and often with illus-
trations, papers on scientific and on applied geography, carefully
selected and classified notes on matters of general geographical inter-
est, notices of the literature and cartography of the month, obituaries,
and news. I find that already our Journal has attained a fair share of
success. The sale to the outside public has increased considerably,
and the importance of our publication may be gauged to some extent
from the fact that the advertisements have increased from four to an
average of twenty-two pages. This is important, because it helps the
Journal in its new form to pay for the expense of its production. The
fact that it is quoted everywhere, at home and abroad, may be taken
as a sign that it has already been recognized as the leading organ of
geography, at least in the English language. From the beginning it
has been favorably noticed by the principal organs of the press. But
I consider that the most gratifying testimony to the enterprise of our
society in this and other directions is contained in a letter from the
celebrated traveler and geographer, Baron von Richthofen, ‘* Will you
allow me,” he wrote, ‘to make use of this opportunity for congratu-
lating you on the excellent character of the Geographical Journal?”
As far as our means permit, we shall endeavor to improve its character
and attractions. We have subscribers outside the society in all parts
of the world—in remote towns in the United States and in Australia—
and steps will be taken to bring the Journal under the notice of hun-
dreds likely to be interested in it, both in America and the Colonies.
The size of our publication will probably have to be increased before
long, for even with the extra pages which have been added our
accomplished editor finds it increasingly difficult to keep pace with
geographical activity in all departments and in all parts of the world.

We thus have in our Journal every month a very complete review of |
geographical proceedings throughout the world, and every six months
six Journals are presented to us with an index. The review of these
proceedings which it has been customary for former presidents to give
in their annual addresses, has therefore become unnecessary, for the
fellows will already be in possession of such a review, and another
recapitulation is neither useful as information nor serviceable for future
reference. It is work already well done. It seems desirable, therefore,
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 321

as likely to be more interesting to the fellows, that the main part of the
address should in future dwell upon some particular subject, preferably
one that has most engaged the attention of geographers during the
past year.

I freely acknowledge that the omission of a detailed review of the
progress of geography will be quite a new departure, for such a review
has annually been given since the foundation of the society. For many
years it was essential, because the information could not be found else-
where, and for a long time it was very useful; but as it has now become
unnecessary, owing to the improved character of our Journal, the time
for a change in the plan of the annual address seems to have arrived.
During the first eight years of our existence the reviews of geographical
progress were written by our indefatigable naval secretaries, Captains
Maconochie and Washington; but in 1838 my accomplished predeces-
sor, Mr. W. Rk. Hamilton, introduced the practice of delivering annual
presidential addresses, which has ever since prevailed. Since 1838
there have been only three occasions on which the annual address has
not been written and delivered by the president. In 1861 Sir Roderick
Murchison, as vice-president, delivered the address in the absence of
Lord Ashburton; in 1879 I delivered the address as secretary, owing to
the absence of Lord Dufferin; and the illness of Lord Aberdare made
it necessary for General Strachey to deliver the address in 1886. It was
the custom for the obituaries, which now appear in the different mum-
bers of the Journal, to be collected in the address, and there was a
detailed review of work done during the year. I may observe that the
address was always entitled “Address to the Royal Geographical
Society by the president” from 1838 to 1878. In 1879 I prepared a
statement of the progress of geography during the year in lieu of a
president’s address, and ever since my title has been adopted and the
president’s address has been called “The annualaddress on the progress
of geography.” But that title was not intended for the president’s
address. I now propose to revert to the older and more convenient
title, “‘ Address to the society by the president,” leaving each president
freedom to choose his own subject-matter.

For it was not the plan of Mr. Hamilton that the addresses should
be confined to obituaries and reviews of current work, as has generally
been the case in recent times. He and his immediate successors, while
following the established practice, also dwelt upon some special subject
in the body of their addresses. In 1838 Mr. Hamilton discoursed on
the importance of geography and on the uses of the society; and in
1839 his great numismatic knowledge enabled him to offer some most
interesting suggestions respecting our medals. Mr. Greenough occupied
his address with a treatise on map drawing and an improved system of
mapping. Admiral Smyth dwelt on the duties of the society, and on
the definition and scope of geography. Sir Roderick Murchison made
it a regular practice to select some subject of interest as the principal

feature or kernel of his addresses. In 1844 this was the Ural Mountains
and the gold produce of Russia. In 1852 he sketched out, with a
master hand, the geographical features of the African continent. Ocean-
ography, suggested by Maury’s charming work, was the subject of Sir
Roderick’s address in 1853. In 1857 he stirred his audience to enthusi-
asm by his advocacy of a final Arctic search; and in the following year
he dwelt on changes of the earth’s surface. Earthquakes were his
subject in 1859, the former condition of Europe in 1863, and glaciers in
1864. In 1865 he reviewed the work remaining to be done in all parts
of the world. The address of 1867 was devoted to the Aralo-Caspian
Basin, and Sir Roderick’s later addresses were occupied with the con-
nection of geography with geology. After Sir Roderick’s time the
practice of giving a kernel to the presidential addresses was aban-
doned until, in 1888, General Strachey touched upon the legitimate
limits of geography and, in 1889, on the occupation of the waste spaces
and on the supremacy of civilized races.

The idea of devoting the bulk of the presidential address to one
special subject of interest is not, therefore, an innovation, for it was the
almost invariable practice of Sir Roderick, and had been occasionally
adopted before his time. As the ordinary subject of former addresses
is now adequately provided for every month in the Journal, a mere
recapitulation can serve no useful purpose. The fare that should now
be served up to the fellows is a kernel in imitation of Sir Roderick’s
menu, with such garnishing as time and circumstance may suggest and
as each president may think desirable. Such is my ideal of the pres-
idential address of the future; but I am unable to entertain the hope
that I can make even an approach to its realization. I will, however,
take this opportunity of dwelling upon the subjects which have chiefly
occupied geographers during the past year, namely, the promotion of
further discovery both in the Arctic and the Antarctic regions.

No less than six expeditions have either been projected or under-
taken to explore different parts of the Arctic regions within the last
two years, so that the subject has necessarily occupied a large share of
our attention. It is one that has been before this society since its
foundation, and some of the most important Government expeditions,
including that of Sir George Nares in 1875, were due to the initiative
of our council. In the long period, during which Arctic work has been
over and over again under the special consideration of the council, and
of committees appointed by it, consisting of men of science and of
varied Arctic experience, distinct canons of exploration have been laid
down, and opinions have been formulated which will certainly be useful
for our guidance in the future. The council has always consistently
maintained that merely to reach the North Pole, or to attain a higher
latitude than someone else, were objects unworthy of support. In our
view, the objects of Arctic exploration are to secure useful scientific
results: In geography, by exploring the coast lines and interiors, and by
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 323

ascertaining the conditions of land and sea within the unknown area;
in geology, by observations and collections; in zoology and botany; and
in physics, by a complete series of observations, extending over at least
a year. I well remember that when, in 1874, we were preparing the
memorandum on the scientific results of Arctic work, General Strachey
added another consideration. It may be shown, he said, that no such
extent of unknown area, in any part of the world, ever failed to yield
results of practical as well as of purely scientific value; and it may
safely be urged that, as it is mathematically certain that the area exists,
it is impossible that its examination can fail to add largely to the sum
of human knowledge.

The unknown area remains very much as it was left when these words
were written in 1874, except that the expedition of Sir George Nares,
in the two following years, discovered the trend of the land on the
eastern and western sides of Robeson Channel, the great extent of the
sea of ancient ice, and brought back valuable collections and observa-
tions in all branches of science. We are still ignorant of the region to
the north of Siberia. The northern, western, and eastern sides of the
archipelago of Franz Josef Land have yet to be explored. The problem
is still unsolved whether there is land due north of Spitzbergen. We
have yet to hear whether the outline of Greenland has been completed.
Ellesmere Land is almost entirely unknown, as well as the important
and interesting region leading from Jones Sound. The whole vast
region between Prince Patrick Island and Siberia, the exploration of
which will lead to such important results in physical geography, is also
unknown. The whole of this work can only be accomplished gradually,
and one expedition will have to follow another until all the knowledge
attainable in this field of inquiry has been secured.

For achieving success we have held certain canons, the correctness
of which has been confirmed by all experience. It is true that they
may be neglected on rare occasions without fatal consequences, but this
can very seldom be done with impunity. The first great lesson taught
by two centuries of experience is that no extensive and useful explor-
ing work can be calculated upon by merely entering the drifting pack.
Secure progress can only be made by following a coast line. The second
canon is that at least one winter must be passed at a point beyond any
hitherto reached. This is essential in order to obtain series of meteor-
ological and magnetic observations of any value. The third rule is
that a ship, not a hut on shore, must be looked upon as the proper
base of operations, sledges being the main instruments for exploration
and discovery. Thoroughly good work, including complete series of
observations of all kinds, can only be secured by the appliances and
resources of well-equipped Government expeditions. When the con-
viction of the importance of that part of the duty of a Government is
absent, which is unfortunately the case during long intervals, private
enterprise has always been ready to enter the breach, though with
324 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

inferior resources, and therefore at greater risk. The commander of an
Arctic expedition ought to be a man of high scientific attainments, of
great experience in the ice, and known to be gifted with the rare quali-
fications of a leader of men. Such a commander is seldom to be found
except in the service of a Government with a wide range of selection.
When the circumstances and qualifications that we would desire to
secure are unattainable, then we gladly welcome the nearest approach
tothem. Enterprise, however contrary to rule and however audacious,
should ever be encouraged and cheered onward. When there are only
small resources, risks must be run and attempts must be made which
could not be approved under other circumstances. We shall always
admire and applaud the enthusiasm and temerity of those who make
attempts to open geographical secrets by private enterprise and with
inadequate means. It is under such conditions that the projects have
been conceived, and in some cases matured, which have engaged our
attention in the Arctic regions during the last two years. The merit of
the. work that may be achieved will be immensely enhanced by the
special difficulties arising from different causes in each case, but all
increasing the risk and the glory. |

In Nansen the expedition to the north of Siberia has the unusual
advantage of having a commander of high scientific attainments, con-
siderable Arctic experience, and the rare gift of inspiring confidence
among his followers. As is well known, his guiding idea is that as all
previous expeditions have been stopped by the ice drifting south, he
would not be stopped if he entered the Arctic regions in the ice stream
drifting north. He thus discards our chief Arctic canon, which is that
progress should always be made along a coast line; but the application
of that rule has always been to ice drifting in a direction contrary to
the course of the ship. It seems very doubtful whether the initial force
of the current on the Siberian side of the Polar Sea will be sufficient to
carry the Fram into the strong stream which undoubtedly flows south
between Spitzbergen and Greenland. Her drift, however, may be in
the direction that is anticipated by her sanguine and very able com-
mander, and it is almost certain that there is an ice-laden channel,
unobstructed by extensive land. We have no intelligence of the expe-
dition having reached the neighborhood of the mouth of the Lena, and
it is possible that the Fram may have been beset in rounding Cape
Chelyuskin, or even earlier. In that case it is likely that land will be
discovered, which will certainly diminish the dangers of the pack.
Wilezek Land may extend for a great distance to the east. ‘he water
to the east and west of the most northern point of Siberia is deeper than
that directly to the north, which seems to indicate the existence of land
north of Cape Chelyuskin, and it is not unlikely that the /ram will have
fallen in with it. In that ease Nansen will doubtless seek its northern
limit, and thence endeavor to get into the northerly drift. Under any
circumstances, he is sure to accomplish a great deal of valuable scien-
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 325

tific work, and to make important discoveries. Of that we may be
quite confident; and I am glad to think that Nansen concurs in the
maxim of our council, that the principal aim of Arctic voyages should
be to explore the unknown regions, and not merely to reach the Pole.
Lieutenant Weyprecht writes even more strongly. ‘The key to many
secrets of nature,” he says, ‘the search for which has now been carried
on for centuries, is certainly to be sought for near the poles. But as
long as polar expeditions are looked upon merely as a sort of interna-
tional steeplechase, and their main object is to exceed by a few miles
the latitude reached by a predecessor, those mysteries will remain
unsolved.”

The scene of Weyprecht’s scientific observations, and of Payer’s
interesting and ably conducted sledge journey, was Franz Josef Land,
which is certainly the most promising starting point for further discov-
ery. This land, discovered by the Austrian expedition in 1872, consists
of an archipelago, the southern shores of which are as far north as 80°,
while the most northern land seen is in 83°. It will be remembered
that Franz Josef Land consists, besides smaller islands, of two masses
of land of sufficient extent to bear discharging glaciers sending forth
flat-topped icebergs, which apparently drift northward. Between these
two masses, called Zichy and Wilezek lands, is the channel named
Austria Sound, which was explored for a considerable distance by
Payer in the months of March and April, by means of sledges drawn
by men, assisted by three dogs. All the low islands, as well as the
main masses of land, were found to be covered by glacial caps. The
remarkable fact connected with this journey is that from Payer’s
farthest point in 82° 5’ north a water sky made its appearance in the
north, the temperature rose, and the rocks were covered with thou-
sands of auks aud guillemots. From a height Payer looked down
on a dark sheet of open water dotted with icebergs. On April 12 the
thermometer was at 54° F. These phenomena so early in the year are
most exceptional, and point to an abnormal condition of things, the
causes of which it would be of the utmost importance to discover.
Possibly they betoken the navigability of the Polar Sea in this diree-
tion at certain seasons, although it is true that Payer’s open water
was only a “polynia,” and was surrounded by old ice. In 1880 Mr,
Leigh Smith, in the Hira, reached the southern shore of Franz Josef
Land, and succeeded in rounding the western headland, whence the
land trended in a northwesterly direction.

Judging from the birds and open water in 82° north as early as the
month of April, and from the success of Mr. Leigh Smith’s voyage in
1880, it was considered by all who were capable, from their Arctic experi-
ence, of forming a judgment that the proper way to explore the north-
ern part of the Franz Josef Archipelago would be by dispatching a
well-equipped vessel along the western coast. It was the maxim of
the Baffin Bay whalers to “ stick to the land floe,” and to this Sherard
326 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

Osborn added, ‘‘ Stick to the western shore.” I strongly advocated the
dispatch of such an expedition at a meeting of this society on Decem-
ber 9, 1878, and my views were indorsed by several high Arctic authori-
ties. A vessel well handled would certainly reach the threshold of the
unknown, and would probably establish a base on the west shore of
King Osear or of Petermann lands, whence extensive and most impor-
tant discoveries would be made in the spring. This, no doubt, is the
most promising way of attempting the exploration of one of the most
important seetions of the unknown polar region, and I believe that it
will be undertaken the next time the British people wake up from their
lethargy and become alive to the national importance of Arctic work.
This happens about every thirty years.

Meanwhile we welcome the enterprise of Mr. Harmsworth and Mr,
F. G. Jackson, which is directed toward the Austria Sound of Payer.
It is highly to the credit of Mr. Harmsworth that he should have
determined to provide the funds for a laudable geographical under-
taking. It reminds one of the patriotic munificence of the merchant
princes of old, and of Sir Felix Booth in more recent times. Mr.
Jackson has made a voyage in a whaler, and last year he went out
with Captain Wiggins to Waigats Island, where he was landed. He
then made an excursion around the island with some Samoyeds, return-
ing by Archangel; these sledge journeys being undertaken in order
that he might acquire experience for his future work. His plan is to
be landed at Kira Harbor, or at some other convenient point on the
southern shore of the Franz Josef Archipelago. For this purpose a
whaler named the Windward has been purchased. She will land the
party of six men, and return without wintering. A house, brought out
in pieces. will be erected, and the explorers will pass the winter in it
in order to be ready for a spring journey up Austria Sound in the foot-
steps of Payer. The chief drawback to the plan is that so much of
the traveling will be over old ground already well explored by the
Austrian expedition; so that the base of operations will be at least
160, and if at Eira Harbor nearer 200, miles from the point reached by
Payer, where Mr. Jackson’s work will commence. It does not appear
how a second winter quarters can be established, with a sufficient stock
of provisions, at the farthest point reached. It will therefore be neces-
sary to return to the original base of operations, and to start again
over all the same ground, in the second spring. A well-considered
system of depots would render this second journey more rapid if the
explorers maintain their health, and with a good team of dogs much
ground might be covered. The most fortunate thing that could hap-
pen would be to find Austria Sound open, so that the Windward or
a steam pinnace could convey the explorers northward to within a
shorter distance of their work. Austria Sound is not the route I
should have recommended for reaching Petermann Land, but, with
wise management aud under favorable conditions of ice and weather,
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 327

a good measure of success is quite possible. The council is desirous
of giving Mr. Jackson all the encouragement and assistance in its
power, and we heartily wish him all the success that is attainable with
the means at his disposal.

Westward the archipelago of Spitzbergen ends in the parallei where
that of Franz Josef commences. It has long been a favorite idea with
inexperienced theorists, that the pole might be reached by a ship
shaping a northern course through the ice to the north of Spitzbergen.
This idea trangresses the best established of our Arctic canons, which
is never to enter the drifting pack away from land. But it occurred to
Sir Edward Parry that, although theimpracticability of sailing to the pole
by the Spitzbergen route was sufficiently proved, the same object might
be attained by traveling with sledges over the ice. Parry undertook
this feat in 1827 with two flat-bottomed boats 20 feet long, with run-
ners on each side of the keels shod with metal, so that the boat entirely
rested on the runners when on the ice, and became a sledge. They
started with seventy-one days’ provisions, and on June 23 the boats
were hauled on the ice in 81° 13/ north. The weight of each boat with
provisions was 3,753 pounds, or 268 pounds per man, there being twelve |
men and two officers for each boat. The ice floes were found to be of
small extent and intersected by high ridges of hummocks, the snow
was soft and heavy, and there was much water lodged on the floes;
but the southerly drift exceeded 4 miles a day. The advance north
under such circumstances was hopeless, and Parry resolved to retrace
his steps on July 23, when he was in 82° 45’ north. From this point
there was a strong yellow ice blink overspreading the northern horizon
and showing that the polar pack extended far to the northward.
Parry’s great mistake was in starting so late in the year. He ought to
have been at least two months earlier. The daily allowance of food
was insufficient, and the weight to be dragged, of 268 pounds per man,
was far too great.

Undoubtedly, if these errors were avoided, a much farther advance
to the northward might be made under favorable circumstances. The
object of such an expedition would be to get farther north than any-
body else—‘‘to beat the best record ”—a motive which was so earnestly
deprecated by Lieutenant Weyprecht as the bane of good Arctic
work. Still, it is a sporting thing to attempt, and as those who are
engaged in it will acquire valuable experience in the ice, it deserves
every encouragement. Mr. Walter Wellman, a journalist of Washington
City, with funds amounting to £4,000, has undertaken to make arenewed
attempt to attain a very high latitude north of Spitzbergen, and has
already started on his adventurous undertaking, with a few carefully
chosen assistants. He is a capable and resolute man, and a thoroughly
well-planned effort will be made under his auspices. He will land on
Danes Island, near the northeast angle of Spitzbergen, in the present
month. Thence he will push northward in aluminium boats of a new
328 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

design, constructed at Baltimore, and weighing only 450 pounds each.
The boats are 18 feet long, 6 in beam, and 2 feet deep amidships, and
are intended for a crew of nineteen men. They contain no frames, the
gunwale, thwarts, knee braces, and water-tight compartments at either
end giving the necessary rigidity; but too much rigidity is undesirable,
elasticity serving to cushion-the blows of the ice and to transmit
the force of the concussion through the whole structure. The keel isa
plate of aluminium, and the plates are riveted together clinker fashion,
and are only a tenth of an inch thick. Two ash runners are fitted on
the boat’s bottom, so as to convert it into a sledge, and a sheet of alu-
minium is riveted to the outer sides of both, so as to form a broad sur-
face for running on the snow or ice. It is doubtful how this kind of
runner will work, but the lightness of the boats will be an incalculable
advantage, and Mr. Wellman ought to advance far beyond Parry,
especially if the dogs prove to be of use. If there are islands beyond
83° north on the Spitzbergen meridians, and he is able to explore them,
his expedition will be of great service to geography; but if not, very
little benefit can be derived from a journey over the ice floes in Parry’s
footsteps.

The enterprise of Lieut. Robert E. Peary in northern Greenland is of
the greatest geographical importance. It is designed to solve the ques-
tion of the insularity of Greenland, one of the oldest that remains for
solution, and not the least interesting. It is a great achievement to
put the finishing touch to the long tale of heroism and constaney which
relates the discovery of the outline of that vast glacier-bearing island.
The romantic story of the Norsemen is succeeded by the splendid work
of Davis and Baftin, followed by the voyages of Ross, Inglefield, Kane,
Hayes, Hall, and Nares, and by the sledge journeys of Beaumont and
Lockwood. These dauntless explorers completed what we know of the
western side. On the east side the boat journeys of Graah, Holm,
and Ryder have been connected with the discoveries of Scoresby and
Clavering, and the German expedition of Koldewey named the most
northern point they saw on the east coast after Prince Bismarck. It is
Peary’s noble ambition to connect Cape Bismarck with the farthest
point reached by Lockwood; and he resolved to make the attempt from
the western side by one of the most remarkable, if not the most
remarkable, journeys ever made over an unbroken glacier.

Peary is a native of Maine, aged about 40, and an engineer in the
United States Navy. He is a man who appears to be cut out for such
work, combining forethought and prudence in planning his operations
with great skill and the most undaunted resolution in carrying them
into execution. His first expedition in 1891-92 was tentative, but it
was a great success. He went out in the whaler Aite, and was landed
in MeCormick Bay in 77° 43/ north, on the northern side of Inglefield
Gulf (the Whale Sound of Baffin), the party consisting of seven persons,
including Mrs. Peary. Peary had his leg broken during the voyage,
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 329

and was in a helpless condition when he was landed. His complete
recovery was due in no small degree to the unremitting care of his wife.
We must all feel the greatest admiration for the devotion of this lady,
who braved the rigors of the Arctic regions, and was not only the life
and soul of the winter quarters, but was throughout a most useful mem-
ber of the expedition. The house was conceived and erected in a work-
manlike manner, and in all Peary’s operations there is the evidence of
capacity and skill. He studied the questions of clothing, of provisions,
and of sledge weights with great care and good working results. He
also tried the different kinds of sledges before finally deciding that
McClintock’s pattern was the best. His journey occupied eighty-three
days, from May 15 to August 6. The start was made with four sledges,
four men, and dog teams, the depot sledge with two men returning from
Humboldt Glacier. Peary, with his companion Astrup, proceeded with
three sledges and the dogs, and was traveling forty-eight days before
reaching the northern edge of the great glacier, the actual marching
time being forty days, and the distance covered 650 miles, or 164 miles
a day. They had no depots, and all the food was carried on the sledges,
except two musk oxen and a calf shot on the northeast coast. The
return journey of 600 miles occupied only twenty-eight days. Peary
started with twenty dogs, reached his extreme point with fifteen, and
returned with five. A good Eskimo dog will drag 100 pounds at the
rate of 10 to 20 miles a day.

It was found that in approaching the edge of the glacier toward the
north the travelers got involved among numerous crevasses, causing
endless trouble to circumvent them, so that it was advisable to keep
on the plateau of the glacier. He reached the northeast coast of Green-
land at a place which he named Independence Bay; and from the height
called Navy Cliff he obtained an extensive view of lands to the north-
ward with no ice caps, and therefore probably islands.

Peary returned home in September, 1892, and earned sufficient funds
for his second expedition by means of lectures and articles for the
press. He had made a very thorough reconnoissance in 1891-92, by
which he had tested all his equipments and got well acquainted with
the nature of the country. He now resolved to proceed upon his final
effort to complete the work he had set himself to achieve. He sailed
in July, 1893, with a party numbering fourteen, including Mrs. Peary
and her maid, with the intention of erecting the house in Bowdoin Bay,
on the shores of Whale Sound. Peary’s intention was to commence
sledging operations in March, two months earlier than in 1892, and to
make for Independence Bay by a route between the previous outward
and return routes, so as to avoid the crevasses of the northwest and
the fogs of the higher plateau. Hight Mexican donkeys have been
taken as an experiment and fitted with snowshoes, as has been done
with horses in Alaska. On reaching Independence Bay it is intended
to send one party southward to Cape Bismarck and the other north-
330 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

ward to connect with Lockwood’s farthest. But it appears that Peary
is also bitten with the “beating the best record” mania, and thinks of
pushing due north with the object of reaching the highest latitude
attainable. It is to be hoped that this fancy will not be allowed to mar
the real work of the expedition, which is to complete the outline of
Greenland.

Mr. Peary is again accompanied by the hardy young Norwegian,
Hivind Astrup, who was with him throughout his first journey.

The Falcon steamer is to sail next June and proceed to Peary’s quar-
ters in Whale Sound: but it is not certain whether he will return or
resolve to continue his work during another year. His, decision will
probably depend on the extent of his explorations this year and on the
amount of work he will have completed. We shall all look out for the
particulars of his achievement with the deepest interest. For my own
part, | look upon Peary as an ideal explorer. He chose one of the
greatest and oldest of the geographical problems that remain to be
solved, and he set to work as if he really intended to find the solution.
Every detail of equipment was thoughtfully considered, gear was tried
and tested before being used, a brilliant preliminary journey over the
inland ice was made. All was done in the workmanlike style of a true
discoverer. I therefore believe that Peary will succeed. Iam sure that
he deserves success.

I now come to the saddest part of my Arctic story. Next to northern
Greenland, the most interesting part of the unknown region is the land
on the western side of the north part of Baffin Bay, between. Smith
Sound and Jones Sound, and extending along the north side of Jones
Sound to the west and north. It was named Ellesmere Land by Sir
Edward Inglefield, who saw it from the deck of the [sabella in 1852. It
is called Uming-mak (the land of the musk oxen) by the Eskimos. No
one, so far as we know, has ever landed between Jones Sound and
Smith Sound. But in August, 1851, the Intrepid and Pioneer went up
Jones Sound for 40 miles, and Sherard Osborn gave a very interesting
account of the cruise. Two of his officers landed on a small island at
their farthest point, and found Eskimo remains, abundance of vegeta-
tion, and some reindeer antlers. In the following year Sir EK. Inglefield
entered the sound in bad weather, but did not effect a landing. This
is all we know of Ellesmere Land south of Smith Sound.

The absence of knowledge respecting Ellesmere Land, and the com-
parative ease with which its eastern coast may be reached, induced an
accomplished and adventurous young Swede, named Altred Bjorling,
to turn his attention to its exploration. His original plan was to pro-
ceed up Baffin Bay in a St. John’s whaler, and to land as near as pos-
sible to Cape Sabine, within Smith Sound. During the next ten weeks
he proposed to travel by boat and sledge through Hayes Sound
toward the Victoria Archipelago, or North Kent. Bjérling is a bota-
nist, and he believed that this region, while quite unknown geograph-

fe
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 331

ically, would otter an exceptionally rich field for botanical researches,
because its position makes it a connecting link between Greenland and
Arctic America. His return journey was to have been directed either
to Cape Warrender or along the east coast of Ellesmere Land to a spot
where he could be picked up by a returning whaler.

This was a well-conceived plan, provided that proper arrangements
were made with a whaler. There is no reason why geographers and
naturalists should not spend ten weeks of the summer on such useful
work, if properly equipped, and if a vessel will engage to call for them
before returning home, at a prearranged spot. Bjérling received a
grant from the Vega exploring fund and the proceeds of subscriptions,
and left Stockholm in the spring of 1892.

Alfred Bjérling was born in 1871, and always cherished an ardent
desire to make discoveries in the Arctic regions. In order to prepare
himself for this work, he wandered through extensive tracts of the
mountainous region of northern Scandinavia during 1887 and 1883, and
he was the first to ascend the peak of Kebnekaisse, the highest méun-
tain in Sweden. In the summer of 1890 he accompanied a Swedish
expedition to the west coast of Spitzbergen, made valuable collections
of Arctic plants, and assisted in the hydrographical and topographical
work. In the following year Bjérling went to Greenland in one of the
Danish vessels, and from Upernavik he made a voyage with Eskimos
in an umiak along the coast of Melville Bay inshore, as far northward
as the Devil’s Thumb. He returned to Sweden in the autumn.

Bjorling was only 21 years of age when he became the leader of the
Ellesmere Land expedition. His companion, Evald Gustaf Kallstenius,
was born in 1868, and since 1886 he had been a student of zoology at
the University of Upsala, but he had not been in the Arctic regions
before. The two young explorers did not succeed in making an arrange-
ment with a whaler at St. Johns, Newfoundland, and, after much diffi-
culty, Bjdrling bought a small schooner cf 37 tons, called the Ripple,
for $650. He succeeded in persuading three men to form a crew, with.
himself and his companion. A Dane named Karl Kann entered as
skipper, an Englishman named Gilbert Dunn formed the crew, and the
cook was a North Briton, named Herbert Macdonald. Owing to the
long delay in getting the Ripple ready for sea, Cape Walsingham was
not sighted until July 24, and on the 28th she arrived at Godhavn,
having behaved very well in theice of Dans Strait. Bjérling purchased
at Godhavn a fowling piece and a rifle with ammunition, some provi-
sions and clothes, and a boat. He was provided, before leaving Stock-
holm, with scientific instruments. He left Godhavn on August 3.

Some anxiety for the gallant young Swedes began to be felt when
Lieutenant Peary started on his second expedition last July, and he
was requested to obtain information respecting their proceedings, and if
necessary to go to their relief. In November, 1893, the whaler Awrora
returned from Baffin Bay with a report of the loss of the Ripple. On
332 PROMOTION OF ‘ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

June 17, 1893, the Awrora was in the north water of Baffin Bay, and
sighted a wreck on the most southeastern of the Cary Islands. A boat
was sent on shere, and the schooner Ripple was found driven on the
beach, and almost buried in ice. Not far from the wreck there was a
heap of stones covering the dead body of a man, probably the Dane,
Karl Kann. Close by there was a large cairn, in which a tin pot was
found, containing open letters from Bjérling. It appears that he
reached the Cary Islands on August 16, 1892, so that the voyage from
Godhayn occupied a fortnight, and he crossed Melville Bay in a single
day. On the following day the Ripple was driven on shore while they
were engaged in taking provisions on board from the depot of Sir
George Nares, apparently with the intention of wintering on the coast
of Ellesmere Land. Up to this time all appears to have gone well, but
the unforeseen calamity of the loss of their vessel must have destroyed
all their anticipations of success. They were obliged to remain several
weeks at the Cary Islands owing to bad weather; but eventually Bjérl-
ing“ resolved to undertake the voyage to Cape Clarence or Cape
Faraday on the western side of Baffin Bay, in an open boat, buoyed
with the hope of meeting Eskimos. In his letter he said that he hoped
a whaler would visit the Cary Islands in the following summer, and
that he would consequently try to return with his people by July 1,
1895. He added, addressing the captain of the supposed whaler, “ I
shall be very much obliged to you if you would go to Clarence Head
(50 miles off), where I shall leave in a cairn information relative to our
fate during the winter. Our provisions, if I can not find Eskimos, will
not last beyond January 1. We are now five men, of whom one is
dying.” The date is October 12, 1892. The Aurora found that Clar-
ence Head could not be approached in June within 20 miles, and she
made no further attempt to comply with Bjérling’s request later in the
season.

The conduct of the two heroic lads was admirable throughout. There
was the usual risk and danger of Arctic work in their project, but no
more, before they lost their vessel. Their message is most touching.
Not a sign of fear, not a word of complaint, but the simple words of
brave men, most pathetic in their simplicity. There is one circumstance
which is worthy of notice. The eastern side of Baffin Bay is within 20
miles of the Cary Islands, and friendly Eskimos are well known to have
settlements there. Yet BjOrling and Kallstenius chose to go in an open
boat to the northern side, which is 50 miles off, and where the presence
of Eskimos was uncertain. There can only be one reason. The west-
ern side was Ellesmere Land, the appointed place of their work, and
even in their dire extremity they resolved to go whither duty pointed.
It was not foolhardiness, nor thoughtless enthusiasm, but a sense of
duty, which pointed the way. One of the most experienced of our
Arctic officers thus wrote on the subject: ‘It is evident that Bjérling
must have had good sterling qualities, to induce two Englishmen to

throw in their lot with him. As they could have left him at the Danish
settlements, it would appear as if he was a born leader, and might have
become a great man if he had had patience to wait until he had gained
experience. However, very little would be done in the world without
the enthusiasm of youth. The experience of age can not be combined
with it, so that the latter will never have all the say. Yet a good
many victims is the result, and in this case that result is much to be
deplored.”

When the news brought back by the Aurora reached Swecen there
was an idea of a relief expedition. But in the end of 1893 a cireu-
lar from Mr. Robert Stein, who is connected with the United States
Geological Survey Office at Washington, announced his scheme for
exploring the whole polar area, and for reaching the pole by a system
of gradual approaches. He proposed to establish a station, to serve as
a permanent base of operations, at Cape Tennyson, on the northern
shore of Jones Sound. Here he intended to place fifteen men always
provisioned for two years. Thence he would push forward secondary
stations into the unknown area, each with fivemen. Mr. Stein intended
to form the first station in Jones Sound, and he also undertook to con-
duct a search for the relief of the missing Swedish explorers. Baron
Nordenskidld promised a subscription of $2,000 in consequence, and
the importance of the Stein expedition was very much enhanced.
Funds were, however, much needed. I therefore made an appeal for
subscriptions in the Times, on April 7. But immediately afterwards I
was amazed to hear that Mr. Stein had postponed his expedition for
another year. *

I nevertheless opened a ‘“ Bjérling relief fund,” and subscriptions
were received at the society’s rooms with the object of assisting Baron
Nordenskj6ld in any measures he might adopt for the relief of his gal-
lant young countrymen. At our meeting on April 9 I made an urgent
appeal to the fellows for subscriptions. Several came forward, includ-
ing many Arctic officers, who are never deaf to such appeals, and [am
happy to say that I have been enabled to forward the sum of £84 10s.
to Baron Nordenskjold at Stockholm. But the abandonment of his
design by Mr. Stein has left but little time for other measures to be
matured. Mr. Nilson has been sent out in the whaler Helipse from
Dundee in the hope of reaching Clarence Head; and Dr. Ohlin, with
the same object, has proceeded to St. Johns, Newfoundland, whence he
is to go to Baffin Bay in June, on board the Falcon, the steamer that
is to bring back Peary’s party.

These arrangements may suffice if the only object is to ascertain the
fate of the lost explorers, but if their relief and rescue are intended,
it is necessary to dispatch a special steamer for the purpose. A vessel
engaged in other work, such as whale fishing or attendance on the
Peary expedition, might be induced to touch at Clarence Head, but she
might not be able to reach the shore during the time she could allow
334 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

for that object, and she could not wait beyond a certain time. Buta
vessel sent for the relief service alone would wait for opportunities, and
make a thorough and efficient search. It therefore becomes necessary
to consider whether the sad duty of ascertaining the fate of those gal-
lant youths, and their companions, alone remains; or whether there is
any hope of their having survived.

If Bjorling fell in with a party of friendly Eskimos, there is no reason
why he and his companions should not have survived through two
winters, if animal life were abundant around their encampment. This,
therefore, is the question, whether there is a reasonable probability of
Eskimos being met with near Clarence Head. Many years ago, when
I was serving in the Arctic regions, it was assumed that the western
side of Baffin Bay, north of Lancaster Sound, was uninhabited. In
1851 Sherard Osborn found vestiges of Eskimos in Jones Sound, and
when I landed near Cape Warrender, with Sir Erasmus Ommanney, in
the previous year, | came upon several stone graves. It was supposed
that these remains were very ancient, possibly representing the origi-
nal migration of the people now settled in northern Greenland. But
in 1853 Sir Edward Inglefield found a party of Eskimos in the very
harbor where I had landed in 1850, proving that, though wanderers
had left their vestiges in the remote past, people of the same race still
frequented the region in question. Their remains were also found by
the expedition of Sir George Nares on the western side of Smith Sound.
Captain Buddington, who commanded the Polaris expedition after
Hall’s death, met with Eskimos at Port Foulke who had certainly
wandered round the whole northwestern side of Baffin ‘Bay from Lan-
caster Sound. The information collected by Dr. Franz Boas from the
Eskimos in Baffin Land is more detailed. ‘They occasionally cross
Laneaster Sound from Admiralty Inlet to the neighborhood of Cape
Warrender, but not often, because they have no boats or canoes, and
the sound is seldom frozen over. On reaching the coast of North
Devon, they go across the land with their sledges, and in four days
reach the coast of Jones Sound, at a place where a long narrow prom-
ontory juts out toward Ellesmere Land called Nedlung. The promon-
tory becomes an island at high tide, and there is a channel of open
water throughout the winter. In the spring this becomes a large
open space clear of ice, frequented by enormous quantities of seals.

Farther north, on the coast of ENesmere Land, which abounds in rein-—

deer and musk oxen, there was another small colony of Eskimos.
These facts are certainly encouraging. Bjorling would not have
landed at Clarence Head until the middle of October, which is against
his chances; but on the other hand, he would not then be more than
10 or 12 miles from the Eskimos, if they were still in Ellesmere Land.

On the whole there is ground for hope; and it is discreditable to
abandon the unfortunate explorers to their fate. The two Swedish
lads are the stuff of which heroes are made, and every civilized people

must be interested in their rescue. British subjects are with them,
whom we are bound to befriend. Most certainly a special steamer ought
to be dispatched for their relief. But the time is very short. Hundreds
would gladly subscribe their mites, and the funds could have been
raised if there had been a year or so to collect it in. But there is
barely a month. The only hope was that a few very rich people might
be induced to come forward and save the credit of their country. I
felt very strongly that a vessel ought to be dispatched, and I therefore
made every effort, and left no stone unturned to obtain the necessary
funds. But lam sorry to say that I was not successful. Our sole hope
is now in the efforts of Mr. Nilson on board the whaler Eclipse, and of
those in the Falcon. The Falcon will sail froin St. Johns early in July,
under the command of Mr. Henry G. Bryant, the recording secretary
of the Geographical Club of Philadelphia. It is hoped that Peary’s
headquarters at Bowdoin Bay will be reached by July 25, but as Peary
and his inland party will not then have returned, the Falcon will have
about a month to spare for an independent cruise, before embarking
the Peary expedition in the first days of September. Ina letter I have
just received from Mr. Bryant he assures me that he takes a deep inter-
est in the fate of the young Swedes, and his plan includes a landing at
Clarence Head and other points, and a search for records left by Bjérl-
ing and Kallstenius. Mr. Bryant also contemplates the exploration of
the channel leading west from Jones Sound. I have only just received
these particulars from Mr. Bryant, which place the chances of relief for
the missing explorers in a brighter light. I heartily wish all possible
success to the Peary auxiliary expedition and its gallant leader. Dr.
F. A. Cooke, who was with Peary in 1891-92, proposes to go up Baffin
Bay with a party of excursionists on board the steamer Newfoundland,
owned and commanded by Capt. J. A. Farquhar, leaving New York on
June 25, and intending to return on September 10. Perhaps Captain
Farquhar may be induced to visit Clarence Head.

I must take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr. Trevor-
Battye for his enthusiastic efforts to promote the dispatch of a relief
vessel; as well as to Captain Haserick and to Mr. William Pine Coffin,
who both felt deeply the shame of leaving the gallant explorers to their
fate, and were ready to help, and did help, with the utmost zeal and
ardor in so good a cause. Mr. Trevor-Battye, failing the relief expedi-
tion, is about to start in the steamer Saxon, of 150 tons, in company with
Mr. Mervyn Powys, to make a thorough ornithological as well as geo-
graphical examination of the little-known Kolguev Island, I believe
under Lord Lilford’s auspices. Mr. Trevor-Battye has studied under
Mr. Coles, and the council has granted him the loan of instruments
necessary for navigation. To my mind Mr. Trevor-Battye is cut out
for a successful explorer. A hunter of elk on ski in Sweden, of moose
and wapiti in the Rockies, a salmon fisherman in the Far West, of pow-
erful physique and great powers of endurance, he is also a naturalist,
336 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

an artist, and an accomplished author. It is to the training and encour-
agement of such men that the society must look, if we are to have great
travelers in the future to advance our science and to do honor to our
country.

Circumstances have obliged us to pay very special attention to Arctic
questions in the past year; but the great meeting which assembled to
hear Dr. Murray’s paper, on the 27th of last November, is our witness
that the Antarctic regions have not been forgotten. All the scientific
societies in the United Kingdom and on the Continent are now of one
mind as to the importance of Antarctic exploration, and they are con-
vineed that it must be a Government undertaking. It is half a century
since Sir James Ross returned, and the time has come for renewing the
work which he commenced so admirably. The arguments of Dr. Murray
must have brought conviction to the minds of all who had not previously
studied the subject. An expedition is necessary for magnetic observa-
tions alone. Professor Neumayer wrote to Dr. Murray that “itis certain
that without an examination and a survey of the magnetic properties of
the Antarctic regions, it is utterly hopeless to strive, with prospects of
success, at the advancement of the theory of the earth’s magnetism.”
Dr. Murray thus summed up the work of a modern Antarctic expedition:
“To determine the nature and extent of the Antarctic continent, to pene-
trate into the interior, to ascertain the depth and nature of the ice cap,
to observe the character of the underlying rocks and their fossils, to
take magnetic and meteorological observations both at sea and on land,
to observe the temperature of the ocean at all depths and seasons of the
year, to take pendulum observations on land, to bore through the
deposits on the floor of the ocean at certain points to ascertain the con-
dition of the deeper layers, and to sound, trawl, dredge, and study the
character and distribution of marine organisms.” <All these observations
are earnestly demanded by the science of our day for many purposes.
Science demands a steady, continuous, laborious, and systematic explora-
tion of the whole southern region with all the appliances of the modern
investigator.

Enlightened by the exhaustive and most interesting paper of Dr.
Murray, and encouraged alike by his enthusiasm and. by the sound
sense of his remarks in favor of the renewal of Antarctic exploration,
our council appointed a committee with instructions to report upon the
best means of achieving the objects set forth by Dr. Murray. Our
Antarctic committee consisted of Sir Joseph Hooker, one of the two
survivors of Sir James Ross’s expedition; of Sir George Nares, the
only living naval captain who has navigated the Antarctic Ocean; of

Japtain Wharton, the hydrographer; of Admiral Sir Erasmus Omman-
ney, who has long been a warm advocate of such an enterprise; of
Aduiral Sir R. Vesey Hamilton, one of our best Arctic authorities, who
has also written on the subject of Antarctic navigation of Dr. Murray
and myself.
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 337

The committee in its report enumerated the scientific results of
Antarctic research, especially dwelling on the necessity for an accurate
study of terrestrial magnetism. The experiences of early navigators
in approaching the pack edge are then reviewed, and it is shown that
Sir James Ross alone boldly entered it, with a view to passing through
it, on two occasions, with success. In January, 1841, he forced his way
through it in four days, reaching an open sea, discovering Victoria
Land, and penetrating to the seventy-eighth parallel. On the second
occasion he entered a pack several hundreds of miles in width, and he
was forty-two days getting through, but he again succeeded. In 1843,
on his third attempt, it was too late in the season when he entered the
pack, and the young ice was forming rapidly. If it had been Decem-
ber instead of March he might have effected more. The committee
then contrasts the conditions of navigation in the Arctic and Antarctic
regions. In the north there are fields of ice of vast extent, often fixed
for months in one place by intricate channels. The danger of long
detention, arising from being beset in such ice, is not so serious in the
Antarctic regions. But there are other dangers which are equally for-
midable. In gales of wind and in fogs, and even in calms, sailing ves-
sels are in much danger, when involved in the pack, from the swell
eaused by heavy gales, and when it is impossible to avoid collisions
with huge masses of ice. On such occasions a sailing vessel is helpless.

But as screw steamers would, of course, be employed on any new
Antarctic expedition, these dangers would be very much reduced and
a great saving of time would be effected. Calms occur, and there are
often adverse winds when there is clear weather. At such times sail-
ing vessels would be beating up 20 miles while a steamer might make
100. With steam it might be possible to do in one season all that
which, in the cases of Wilkes and Ross, occupied three. A steamer
would be in little danger from bergs except in fogs, and in heavy gales
she could lie to in safety under their lee, instead of drifting at the
mercy of wind and waves. She would also be better able than a sailing
vessel to double the pack. The weak point of a steamer in the pack
would be during a gale of wind. She might avoid collision with the
ice better than a sailing vessel, but not altogether. But specially
adapted screw steamers would no doubt facilitate Antarctic naviga-
tion, and remove many of the difficulties which had to be encountered
by sailing vessels.

Having fully considered the exigencies of Antarctic navigation, the
committee recommend that the expedition should consist of two vessels
as well strengthened against the ice as were the Hrebus and Terror,
fitted with steam power, and specially protected aft. It is indispensa-
ble that officers and crews should be under naval discipline, and a full
commission of three years would be necessary for the performance of
the work. Apart from the valuable scientific results of an Antarctic
expedition, the committee dwell upon the excellent effect that all such

sM 94 22

338 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

undertakings, in which our country has been prominent, have invari-
ably had on the navy, by maintaining the spirit of enterprise.

Having been adopted by our council, the report of our Antarctic
committee, together with Dr. Murray’s paper, was transmitted to the
Royal Society, with an urgent request that that learned body would
take the subject of the renewal of Antarctic discovery into serious
consideration, with a view to its being brought before Her Majesty’s
Government in a memorial presented by the Royal Society, with the
cordial assent of every scientific body in the United Kingdom. I
understand that a committee has been appointed by the couneil of the
Royal Society, and that the important question is receiving mature
and careful consideration. ‘The fellows may rest assured that no efforts

on the part of our council will be wanting, and that the duty of pro-

moting the renewal of Antarctic exploration will be borne in mind.
If men of science are unanimous, both as to the importance of the
work and the best method of executing it, and if they are backed by
enlightened public opinion, the Admiralty will be only too glad to take
the subject into favorable consideration, and difficulties raised by the
treasury will be overcome. But unanimity and the support of publie
opinion are absolutely essential to success.

I have devoted the body of my address to work within the polar
regions. I will not, however, omit to refer to the labors of others in
regions which, through their exertions, may become the main subjects
of future addresses. You have recently heard an account of the results
of the journey of Mr. and Mrs. Littledale, which are in many respects
remarkable. It was a very hazardous adventure; it covered several
hundreds of miles of entirely new ground, and very careful observa-
tions were taken all along the route, which have been embodied in a
valuable map. The additions made by Mr. Littledale to our knowledge
of the famous route to China followed by Marco Polo are of the first
importance.

Of no less interest is the journey into the Hadramaut Valley accom-
plished by Mr. and Mrs. Bent, an account of which was presented to us
a week ago. They were accompanied by an excellent surveyor, deputed
by the government of India, and by a botanist from Kew, while their
own archeological notes, photographs, and sketches are of exceptional
value. These experienced travelers were so interested in the strange
and almost unknown country of Hadramaut that they hope to return
to continue their explorations in Arabia.

In Africa there has been, and continues to be, abundant activity, as
the monthly pages of our journal have shown. We have already heard
a very full account of Dr. Gregory’s expedition to Mount: Kenia, and
we hope shortly to have full details of the expedition into new country
north of the Tana River, led by Mr. Astor Chanler, accompanied by
Lieutenant von Héhmel. Mr. Scott Elliot is actually exploring the
Ruwenzori region, and we have helped to equip other young African

—a
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 339

travelers who hope to open up new ground. Mr. Coryndon, a friend of
Mr. Selous, has already started for the country lying between the west
shore of Lake Tanganyika and the Kongo, where he will remain for at
least a year. Dr. Donaldson Smith, a young American gentleman,
leaves in a few days for Somali Land, whence he will push southward
to Lake Rudolf, thus connecting the discoveries of Count Teleki with
those that have been made farther north.

How valuable a service is being performed by our indefatigable map
curator, Mr. Coles, in giving instruction to intending explorers, is
shown by the work that has been done by his pupils within the last
two years. In Africa Major Leverson and Mr. F. A. Lamb have done
surveying work on the Anglo-German boundary commission, Dr. J. W.
Gregory has surveyed and mapped the Mount Kenia region, Mr. Teed
is now surveying in the territory of the Royal Niger Company, Captain
Gallwey has been at work in the Oil Rivers Protectorate. Lieut. S.
Vandeleur, of the Scots Guards, has made an exceedingly well-executed
route survey in Somali Land, checked by observations for latitude. Mr.
G. F. Scott Elliot is at work in the Ruwenzori region. In Asia Mr.
Conway has made surveys and a map of the Karakoram glaciers, and
Mr. Littledale has done valuable work in central Asia and on the Hoang-
Ho. In America Mr. ©. W. Anderson has been working in British
Guiana, and our traveling students, Mr. G. B. Grundy and Mr. Cozens
Hardy, have surveyed, one the battlefield of Plata, the other a part
of Montenegro.

I must not omit to refer to the admirable work accomplished by our
librarian, Dr. Mill, in the survey of the English lakes, in which he has
opened up a hitherto unknown part of our country, although a part
which is under water. At one of our meetings in June Dr. Mill will
explain to us some of the more interesting results of his limnological
investigations.

On several occasions during the session I have regretted the absence
of my illustrious predecessor, Sir Henry Rawlinson, on whom the man-
tle of Sir Roderick fell in 1871. I especially missed him on the ocea-
sion of Colonel Sawyer’s paper on the “Bakhtiari country being read;
and, indeed, I had a faint hope that he might once more appear
among us on that occasion, to brighten the discussion by his profound
knowledge and unrivaled powers of exposition. Sir Henry was one of
the best of our presidents from every point of view, and I do not know
his equal in giving life to an apparently dull subject, and in awakening
an interest in geographical details by enriching them from the abun-
dant stores of his historical memory. I shall never forget the rapt
attention with which the audience listened to his account of the route
taken by the gypsies on their way toward Europe from the valley of
the Indus. He is unrivaled in showing the dependence of history ona
knowledge of geography, and though he is often missed by those who
340 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY.

remember the time when he presided here, he can never be replaced.
I still indulge the hope of seeing him among us before the session is over.

In conclusion, it is my duty to announce the retirement of Mr. Doug-
las Freshfield from the post of secretary, and that he has declined to
allow himself to be put in nomination as a member of the new council.
Mr. Freshfield was my colleague from 1881 to 1888, and for the last six
years he has been senior secretary of the society. A renowned climber
and Alpine explorer, he now holds the honorable post of president of
the Alpine Club. But he is not a mere climber. He is well versed in
the historical literature of the Alps, as is shown by his papers on the
Alpine notes of Leonardo da Vinci in 1884, and on the pass of Hanni-
bal in 1886. He was also the author of sketches in the mountains of
Ticino. Having exhausted the Alps, Mr. Freshfield turned to the Cau-
casus, and our Proceedings have been enriched by four of his papers
describing with a master hand the physical aspects of that little-known
range, and his own well-planned and successful ascents. He also pub-
lished a work on Central Caucasus and Bashan. Mr. Freshfield gave up
much of his time to the society, and was indefatigable in his supervision
of the work of the departments, and initiated our large and valuable col-
lection of photographs. He introduced the use of photographic slides
at our evening meetings. He took a special interest in educational
questions, and the society’s arrangements with the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge owed much to his active and zealous aid. He
read a paper of great importance at the British Association meeting
of 1866, on “* The place of geography in education.” In that paper he
truly remarked that much of the literature of physical science was ren-
dered unreadable by the absence of the art of letters in its producers.
The classies, he added, are the authors and models of the art of clear
and condensed expression for European literature. And this reminds
me that one of Mr. Freshfield’s highest qualifications for the post of
our secretary was that he was a classical scholar. How often have I
deplored the loss of this qualification through having gone to sea so
young! Mr. Freshtfield conducted a good deal of correspondence, both
private and official, the results of which were very conducive to the
best interests of the society. As an example, I may mention his letters
to the India office, to which were due the establishment of an excellent
understanding with the departments in India, and to our betng regu-
larly supplied with geographical information which was previously
withheld. He was joint editor of the three latest editions of Hints to
Travellers, taking the subject of outfit as his own part of the work.
For these varied and important services the warm thanks of our coun-
cil and of the society are justly due to Mr. Freshtield. Although he
retires, by his own desire, from any further official connection with the
society, he will, I am sure, continue to take a warm interest in our pro-
ceedings, and to be an active and zealous, though independent, member
of our body.
PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 341

We have had heavy losses this year from the deaths of distinguished
fellows, whose obituaries have appeared in the numbers of our Journal.
Among them were several dear friends of my own, and I can not help
mentioning how deeply we have all felt the loss of our late foreign
secretary, Gen. Sir Beauchamp Walker.

I have to thank Captain Wharton, the hydrographer, for the account
which follows of the work that has been done during the year by our
naval marine surveyor, to whose hard work navigation and geography
owe so much; and Mr. C. EK. D. Black for his abstract of the work of
the Indian surveys during the past year.

The magnificent work prepared by a commission, under the auspices
of the Italian Government, as Italy’s contribution toward the celebra-
tion of the fourth centenary of Columbus, has just reached me. In the
name of the fellows of this society, [ have warmly congratulated our
brother geographers in Italy on its appearance. A review of the great
Colombian work follows this address.

THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN|!

By Capt. W. J. L. WHARTON, R.N., F. R. S.

You will not be surprised if, having called upon an hydrographer to
preside over this section, he takes for the subject of his review the sea.
Less apparently interesting, by reason of the uniformity of its surface,
than the land which raises itself above the level of the waters, and
with which the term geography is more generally associated, the ocean
has, nevertheless, received much attention of later years. In Great
Britain, especially, which has so long rested its position among the —
nations upon the wealth which our merchant fleets bring to its shores,
and upon the facilities which the sea affords for communication with
our numerous possessions all over the globe, investigation into the
mysteries, whether of its ever-moving surface or of its more hidden
depths, has been particularly fascinating. I purpose, therefore, to
attempt a brief survey of our present knowledge of its physical
condition.

The very bulk of the ocean, as compared with that of the visible land,
gives it an importance which is possessed by no other feature on the
surface of our planet. Mr. John Murray, after a laborious computation,
has shown that its cubical extent is probably about fourteen times that
of the dry land. This statement appeals strongly to the imagination,
and forms, perhaps, the most powerful argument in favor of the view,
steadily gaining ground, that the great oceans have in the main existed
in the form in which we now see them since the constituents of the
earth settled down into their present condition.

When it is considered that the whole of the dry land would only fill
up one third of the Atlantic Ocean, the enormous disproportion of the
two great divisions of land and sea becomes very apparent.

The most obvious phenomenon of the ocean is the constant horizontal
movement of its surface waters, which in many parts take well-defined
“egalgule These great ocean currents have now been studied for

Madders to the peenical en of the British Association, Oxford, 1894, Pate

ber, 1894, and in Nature, August 16, 1894.
344 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

many years, and our knowledge of them is approaching a point beyond
which it is doubtful whether we shall ever much advance, except in
small details. For though, while indisputably the waters continually
move in each great area in generally the same direction, the velocities
vary, the limits of the different streams and drifts vary, mainly from
the ever-varying force and direction of the winds.

After long hesitation and much argument, I think it may be now
safely held that the prime motor of the surface currents is the wind.
Not, by any means, the wind that may blow, and even persistently blow,
over the portion of water that is moving, more or less rapidly, in any
direction, but the great winds which blow generally from the same
general quarter over vast areas. These, combined with deflection from
the land, settle the main surface circulation.

I do not know if any of my hearers may have seen a very remark-
able model, devised by Mr. Clayden, in which water disposed over an
area Shaped like the Atlantic, and sprinkled over with Lycopodium dust
to make movement apparent, was subjected to air impelled from various
nozzels, representing the mean directions of the permanent winds. It
dispelled the last doubt I held on the subject, as not only were the
main currents reproduced, but the smaller effects and peculiarities of
the Atlantic drifts were produced with surprising accuracy.

There is a small current, long shown on our charts, but which I had
always regarded with suspicion. I refer to the stream which, after
traveling from the Arctic Ocean southward along the east coast of
Greenland, turns sharply round Cape Farewell to the northward into
Davis Straits, where it again doubles sharply on itself to the south-
ward. This is exhibited in the model in all its details, and is evidently
caused by the pressure of the water forced by the mimic Gulf Stream
into the Arctic region, where it has no escape except by this route, and
is pressed against the land, round which it turns as soon as it can.
This is, no doubt, the explanation of the real current. The very
remarkable winter equatorial current, which runs in a narrow belt east-
ward, justnorth of the main stream traveling west, was also reproduced
with extraordinary fidelity. The winds, however, that are ordinarily
considered permanent vary greatly, while in the monsoon areas the
reversal of the currents caused by the opposite winds exercise a great
influence on the movements of the water far beyond their own limits,
and anything like a prediction of the precise direction and rate of an
oceanic stream can never be expected. The main facts, however, of
the great currents can be most certainly and simply explained in this
manner. The trade winds are the prime motors. They cause a surface
drift of no great velocity over large areas in the same general direction
as that in which they blow. These drifts after meeting and combining
their forces eventually impinge on the land. They are diverted and
concentrated and increase in speed. They either pour through pas-
sages between islands, as into the Caribbean Sea, are pressed up by
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 345

the land, and escape by the only outlets possible—as, for example, the
Strait of Florida, and form a great ocean current like the Gulf Steam—
or, as in the case of the Agulhas current and the powerful stream which
runs north along the Zanzibar coast, they are simply pressed up against
and diverted by the land, and run along it with increased rapidity.
These rapid currents are eventually apparently lost in the oceans, but
they in their turn originate movements of a slower character, which on
again passing over shallow water or on meeting land develop once more
into well-defined currents.

We find an analogous state of things on the western side of the Pa-
cific, where the Japan current is produced in a similar manner. The fact
that on all western shores of the great oceans toward which the trade
winds blow we find the strongest currents running along the coast, is
almost enough of itself to prove the connection between them.

The westerly winds that prevail in higher northern and southern lati-
tudes are next in order in producing great currents. From the shape
of the land they in some cases take up and continue the circulation
commenced by the trade winds; in others they themselves originate
great movements of the water. Compared to the great circulation from
this source the effect of differences of temperature or of specific grav-
ity is insignificant, though no doubt they play their part, especially in
causing slow under circulation, and in a great degree the vertical mix-
ing of the lower waters. No drop of the ocean, even at its greatest
depth, is ever for one moment at rest.

Dealing with minor points, the American officers of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey have found after long and patient investigation that
the velocity of the Gulf Stream in its initial and most marked part, the
Strait of Florida, is greatly affected by the tide, varying as much as
one-half its maximum rate during the twenty-four hours. These Amer-
ican investigations are of greatest interest. They have extended over
the whole area of the Caribbean Sea and its approaches, the Gulf of
Mexico, and the Gulf Stream proper and its vicinity. In no other part
of the ocean has observation of this detailed character been carried
out, and they throw a great light on oceanic circulation. The Blake,
the vessel specially fitted for the purpose, has during the several years
in which she was employed on this work anchored in over 2,000 fathoms
water, or a depth of considerably more than 2 miles, a feat which would
a Short time ago have been deemed impossible. One great point that
has come out very strongly is the continual variation in the strength
and direction of the currents and the varying depths to which the sur-
face current extends.

Eastward of the chain of the Windward Islands the general depth
of the surface movement may be said to be about 100 fathoms, below
which tidal influence is very distinct. There is also a very plain back-
ward flow of water, at depths which vary, caused by the submarine
ridge which connects the Windward chain of the West Indian Islands.
346 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

These observations also generally support what I have already men-
tioned: that the velocity of a current depends on the strength of winds,
possibly thousands of miles distant, which have given the original
impetus to the water, and this, combined with tidal action when the
current approaches orruns along a coast, will always cause uncertainty
on the resultant velocity.

Dealing for yet another moment with the Gulf Stream, there are two
points which have not been much dwelt upon, but which have a great
effect on its power of bringing the modifying influence of its warm
water as far as our shores. The first is the prevention of its spread-
ing, as it leaves the Strait of Florida, by the pressure of the portion of
the equatorial current which, unable to get through the passages
between the Windward Islands, is diverted to the north of the Baha-
mas and bears down on the eastward side of the Gulf Stream proper,
compressing it between itself and the cold water flowing south-
ward along the American coast, and at the same time adding to its
forces and maintaining its high temperature. The second is that by
the time the Gulf Stream has lost its velocity as a current, in about
the vicinity of the Bank of Newfoundland, it has arrived in the region
of the westerly winds, that is, of winds whose average direction is from
west, whose influence, causing a surface drift somewhat comparable
to that of the trade winds, bears the water onward to the British
islands and Norway. Without these prevailing westerly winds the
warm water of the Gulf Stream would never reach these shores.

The depth to which the surface currents extend in other parts is lit-
tle known. Direct observations on undercurrents have been rare. In
the first place, it is not an easy observation to make. Apparatus has
generally to be improvised. This has usually consisted of some form
of flat surface lowered to the required depth and suspended in the
water by a buoy, which presents to the resistance of the upper stratum
a very much smaller area than that of the surface below. More perfect
machines have been devised, notably that used by the Americans in
their West Indian experiments. These, however, are delicate and
require so much care and experience in working, and so much time is
wanted for such observations, that under the pressure of the more
urgent requirements on surface movements in the interests of naviga-
tion very little has been done. The Challenger made some observations
on the depth of the equatorial current in mid-Atlantic, but they were
not very conclusive for lack of suitable appliances. They, however,
tended to show that below 100 fathoms there was but little current.

It has been calculated theoretically that winds blowing steadily in
one direction with the ordinary force of the trade winds would in
100,000 years by friction between the particles put the whole of a mass
of water 2,000 fathoms deep, not otherwise influenced, into motion in
that direction; but the direction and force of the trade winds are ever
changing, and the actual strong currents of the ocean are not in the

Set
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 347

trade-wind areas, but are the result of these drifts meeting one another
and being compressed by the conformation of the land. We can not
therefore expect this theoretical effect to be realized.

One instance of the underrunning of one current by another is
brought very plainly to our notice in the North Atlantic to the east of
the Great Banks of Newfoundland, where the icebergs borne by the
Arctic current from Baffin Bay pursue their course to the southward
across the Gulf Stream running eastward. These great masses of ice,
floating with seven-eighths of their volume under the surface, draw so
much water that they are all but wholly influenced by the undercur-
rent. A large berg will have its bottom as much as 600 or 700 feet
below the surface. The only reason that these bergs continue their
journey southward is the action of the cold undercurrent.

It was my good fortune to be ordered in 1872 to undertake a series
of experiments of the currents and undercurrents of the Dardanelles
and Bosporus. They proved most interesting. It was well known
that a surface stream is almost continuously passing out of the Black
Sea through the Bosporus into the Sea of Marmara, and again through
the Dardanelles into the Mediterranean. Certain physicists, of whom
Dr. W. Carpenter was one, were, however, of opinion that a return
current would be found under the surface running in the opposite
direction, and this I was enabled to demonstrate. Though from the
imperfection of our apparatus, which we had to devise on the spot, we
were unable to exactly proportionate the quantities of water moving
in the two directions, we found, whenever the surface current was
rushing southwestward through these straits, that for a certain dis-
tance, from the bottom upward, the water was in rapid motion in the
opposite direction. It was an astonishing sight to behold the buoys
which supported a wooden framework of 36 square feet area, lowered
to depths from 100 to 240 feet, tearing up the straits against a strong
surface current of as much as 3 and 4 miles an hour. It was as per-
fect an ocular demonstration of a counter undercurrent as could be
wished, and the Turks, who watched our proceedings with much sus-
picion, were strongly of opinion that the devil had a hand in it, and
only the exhibition of the Sultan’s firman saved us from interruption.
In the investigation of these currents we found, as usual, that the wind
was the most potent agent. Though the surface water from the Black
Sea is almost fresh, and the bottom water of the heavy Mediterranean
density of 1.027, it was found that when calm had prevailed the surface
current slackened, and at times became nil, while the undercurrent
responded by a similar slackening.

The ordinary condition of wind in the regions of the Black Sea and
Sea of Marmara is that of a prevalent northeast wind. ‘Ihis causes a
heaping up of the water on the southwest shores of those seas, pre-
cisely where the straits open, and the surface water therefore rapidly
escapes. These straits no doubt present abnormal characters, but, so
348 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

far as surface currents are concerned, the long series of observations
then made convinced me of the inadequacy of differences of specific
gravity, which were here at a maximum, to cause any perceptible hori-
zontal flow of water. I have said that we were unable to define by
direct observation the exact position of the dividing line between the
opposing currents, but the rapid change in the specific gravity at a cer-
tain depth, which varied on different days, gave a strong indication
that the currents changed at this point.

A Russian officer, Captain Makaroff, afterwards made similar experi-
ments in the Bosporus, but with more perfect appliances, and he found
that at the point where the specific gravity changed the currents also
changed.

I have been anxious to obtain similar observations at the Straits of
Babel Mandeb, the southern outlet of the Red Sea, where somewhat
similar conditions prevail. Here the winds are governed by the mon-
soons. For half the year the wind blows from the north down the
whole length of the sea, causing a surface flow outward into the Gulf
of Aden and a general lowering of the whole level of the sea of about
2 feet. For the other half of the year the wind at the southern end of
the sea is strong from the southeast, causing a surface set into the Red
Sea, over which the general level of the water rises, while the northerly
wind continues to blow throughout the northern half. At either of
these times I think it is highly probable that there is an undercurrent in
the opposite direction to that at the surface, but unfortunately the sea
disturbance is great and observations are very difficult. Observations
were, however, made by Capt. W. U. Moore in H. M.S. Penguin in
1890, but at a time when the change of monsoon was taking place.
The result was peculiar, for it appeared that at a depth of about 360
feet the movement of the water was tidal, while the surface water was
moving slowly in one direction—a result generally similar to that
obtained by the Americans in the West Indies—but the direction of
the tidal flow was directly opposite to what might have been expected,
viz, the water ran in while the tide fell, and vice versa. More obser-
vations are, however, needed here before any certain conclusions can
be formed.

The depth of the ocean is the next great feature which demands
attention. On this our knowledge is steadily, though slowly, increas-
ing. The whole of it has been gained during the last fifty years. Com-
menced by Sir James Ross, whose means were very small, but who
nevertheless demonstrated that the so-called unfathomable ocean was
certainly fathomable everywhere, the sounding of the ocean has con-
tinuously proceeded. ‘The needs of submarine cables have constantly
demanded knowledge in this particular, and the different cable compa-
nies have had a large share in ascertaining the facts. Expeditions
whose main object has been to obtain soundings have been sent out,
Great Britain and the United States taking the first place; but most

tee
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 349

maritime nations have aided. In the immediate past the additions have
mainly been from the soundings which Her Majesty’s surveying ships
continually take whenever on passage from one place to another, from
the work of our cable companies, and from United States vessels. We
have as a result a very fair general knowledge of the prevailing depths
in the Atlantic, but of the Indian and Pacific oceans it is very fragmen-
tary. We have enough to give us a general idea, but our requirements
increase as years roll on. It is a vast task, and it may be safely said
will never be completed, for we shall never be satistied until we know
the variations of level under the water as well as we know those on the
dry land.

It is hopeless to do more than to briefly sketch the amount of our
knowledge. First, as to the greatest depths known. It is very remark-
able, and from a geological point of view significant, that the very deep-
est parts of the ocean are not in or near their centers, but in all cases are
very near land. One hundred and ten miles outside the Kurile Islands,
which stretch from the northern point of Japan to the northeast, the
deepest sounding has been obtained of 4,655 fathoms, or 27,930 feet.
This appears to be in a deep depression, which runs parallel to the Kurile
Islands and Japan, but its extent is unknown, and may be very large.
Seventy miles north of Puerto Rico, in the West Indies, is the next deep-
est cast known, viz, 4,961 fathoms, or 27,366 feet—not far inferior to the
Pacific depth; but here the deep area must be comparatively small, as
shallower soundings have been made at distances 60 miles north and
east of it. A similar depression has been sounded during the last few
years west of the great range of the Andes at a distance of 50 miles
from the coast of Peru, where the greatest depth is 4,175 fathoms.
Other isolated depths of over 4,000 fathoms have been sounded in the
Pacific—one between the Tonga or Friendly Islands of 4,500 fathoms,
one of 4,478 fathoms near the Ladrones, and another of 4,428 fathoms
near Pylstaart Island, all in the Western Pacific. They all require
further investigation to determine their extent. With these few excep-
tions the depth of the oceans so far as yet known nowhere comes up to
4,000 fathoms, or 4 sea miles, but there can be little doubt that other
similar hollows are yet to be found.

The sea with the greatest mean depth appears to be the vast Pacifie,
which covers 67,000,000 of the 188,000,000 of square miles composing
the earth’s surface. Of these 188,000,000, 157,000,000 are sea, so that
the Pacific comprises just one-half of the water of the globe and more
than one-third of its whole area. The Northern Pacific has been esti-
mated by Mr. John Murray to have a inean depth of over 2,500 fathoms,
while the Southern Pacific 1s credited with a little under 2,400 fathoms.
These figures are based on a number of soundings, which can not be
designated otherwise than very sparse.

To give an ideaof what remains to be done I will mention that in the
eastern part of the Central Pacific there is an area of 10,500,000 square
350 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

miles in which there are only seven soundings, while in a long strip
crossing the whole North Pacific, which has an area of 2,800,000 square
niles, there is no sounding at all. Nevertheless, while the approximate
mean depth Iam mentioning may be considerably altered as knowledge
increases, we know enough to say that the Pacific is generally deeper
than the other oceans. The immensity, both in bulk and area, of this
great mass of water is difficult to realize, but it may assist us when we
realize that the whole of the land on the globe above water level, if
shoveled into the Pacific, would only fill one-seventh of it. The Indian
Ocean, with an area of 25,000,000 square miles, has a mean depth, ac-
cording to Mr. Murray, of a little over 2,000 fathoms. This also is esti-
mated from a very insufficient number of soundings. The Atlantic, by
far the best-sounded ocean, has an area of 31,000,000 square miles, with
a mean depth of about 2,200 fathoms. _

The temperature of this huge mass of water is an interesting point.
The temperature of the surface is most important to us, as it is largely
on it that the climates of the different parts of the world depend. This
is comparatively easy to ascertain. We know so much about it that
we are not likely to improve on it for many years. We are quite able
to understand why countries in the same latitude differ so widely in
their respective mean temperatures, why fogs prevail in certain locali-
ties more than others, and how it comes about that others are subject
to tempestuous storms. On the latter point nothing has come out
plainer from recent discussion than the fact that areas where great dif-
ferences of surface temperature of the sea prevail are those in which
storms are generated. It is a matter of observation that in the region
south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland many of the storms which
travel over the Atlantic to this country have their rise. An examina-
tion of surface temperature shows that in this region the variations are
excessive, not only from the juxtaposition of the warm water of the
Gulf Stream and the cold water of the Arctic current flowing south-
ward inside of it, but in the Gulf Stream itself, which is composed of
streaks of warm and colder water, between which differences of as much
as 20° F. exist. The same conditions exist south of the Cape of Good
Hope, another well-known birthplace of storms. Here the Agulhas
current of about 70° F., diverted by the land, pours into the mass of
water to the southward colder by some 25°, and the meeting place is
well known as most tempestuous. Southeast of the Rio de la Plata is
another stormy area, and here we find the same abnormal variations in
surface temperature. Yet another is found off the northeast coast of
Japan with the same conditions. These differences are brought about
by the mingling of water carried either by the flowing of a powerful cur-
rent turned by the land into a mass of water of different temperature,
as is the case off the Cape of Good Hope, or by the uprising of lower
strata of cooler water through a shallow surface stream, as appears to
be the case in the Gulf Stream.
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. Jul

A remarkable point recently brought to light by the researches of
Mr. John Murray in Scotch lochs is the effect of wind on the surface
temperature. It has been observed that wind driving off a shore drifts
the surface water before it. This water is replaced by the readiest
means, that is to say, by water from below the surface rising to take
its place. As the lower strata are in all cases cooler than the surface a
lowering of the temperature results, and we find in fact that near all sea-
shores off which a steady wind blows the water is cooler than farther to
seaward. This has an important bearing on coral growth, and explains
why on all western coasts of the great continents off which the trade
winds blow we find an almost absolute dearth of coral, while on the east-
ern coasts, on which warm currents impinge, reefs abound, the coral
animal flourishing only in water above a certain temperature.

Observations of the temperature of the strata of water between the
surface and bottom have been of late years obtained in many parts.
Compared with the area of the oceans they are but few, but our knowl-
edge steadily increases every year. The subject of the vertical distri-
bution of temperature has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the
light of the whole of the information which we now possess, but Dr.
Alexander Buchan has been for some time devoting his spare time to the
task, and it is a heavy labor, for the data obtained here and there over
the world by different ships of all maritime nations are very difficult to
collect and to appraise; but I understand that before long we shall have
the result, which will prove very interesting, in the last volume of the
Challenger series. It willreadily be understood that observations on tem-
peratures at great depths require great care. In the first place, the ther-
mometers must be most carefully manufactured. They must be subjected
to rigorous tests, and they must be carefully handled during the oper-
ation. All observations are not of the same value, and the discussion
therefore presents considerable difficulty and demands much discretion.
In the meantime we can state certain known facts. We have learned
that the depth of the warm surface water is small. In the equatorial
current between Africa and South America, where the surface is of a
temperature of 78°, at 100 fathoms it is only 55°, a difference of 23°, and a
temperature of 40° is reached at 400 fathoms. In this region, so far as
knowledge goes, the fall in temperature as we descend is most rapid;
but, generally speaking, the same variations prevail everywhere. In
the tropical Pacific the temperature falls 32° from the surface, where it
stands at 82°, to a depth of 200 fathoms, 40° being reached at from
500 to 600 fathoms below the surface. Below the general depth of from
400 to 600 fathoms the temperature decreases very slowly, but there
is considerable variation in the absolute amount of it when we get to
great depths in different parts of the ocean.

One of the most interesting facts that has been recognized is that in
inclosed hollows of the ocean the bottom temperature is apparently
much less than that of the stratum of water at a corresponding depth
352 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

in the waters outside the submarine rid ge that forms the inclosing walls,
separating them from deeper areas beyond, and is, in all cases that
have been observed, equal to that on the ridge. From this fact we are
enabled to supplement our imperfect knowledge of depths, because if
in a certain partof an ocean we find that the temperature at great
depths is higher than we know exists at similar depths in waters appar-
ently connected, we can feel certain that there is a submarine ridge
which cuts off the bottom waters from moving along, and that the
depth on this ridge is that at which is found the corresponding tem-
perature in the outer waters. As a corollary we also assume that the
movement of water at great depths is confined to an almost impercep-
tible movement, for if there was a motion that we could term, in the
ordinary acceptation of the word, a current, 1t would infallibly surmount
a ridge and pour over the other side, carrying its lower temperature
with it. A notable instance is the bottom temperature of the North
Atlantic. This is nowhere below 35° F., although the depths are very
great. But in the South Atlantic at a depth of only 2,800 fathoms the
bottom temperature is but a little above 32° F., and we are therefore
convinced that somewhere between Africa and South America, though
soundings do not yet show it, there must be a ridge at a depth of about
2,000 fathoms. We also come to the same conclusion with regard to
the eastern and western portions of the South Atlantic, where similar
differences prevail. Again, the few temperatures that have been
obtained in the eastern South Pacific show a considerable difference
from those in the South Atlantic, and we are compelled to assume a
ridge from the Falkland Islands to the Antarctic continent.

It is interesting that the investigation into the translation of the
great seismic wave caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1885 led toa
similar and entirely independent conclusion. ‘he wave caused by the
explosion in the Straits of Sunda reached Cape Horn, where by good
chance a French meteorological expedition had erected an automatic
tide gauge, but instead of one series of waves being marked on the
paper there were two. A little consideration showed that the South
Pole having directly interposed between Sunda Straits and Cape Horn,
the waves diverted by the land about the pole would arrive from both
sides. One wave, however, made its appearance seven hours before
the other. Study showed that the earliest wave coincided in time with
a wave traveling on the Pacific side of the pole, with a velocity due to
the known depth, while the later wave must have been retarded in its
journey via the South Atlantic. The only possible explanation is that
the wave had been impeded by comparatively shallow water. The evi-
dence from bottom temperature was then unknown, and thus does one
branch of investigation aid another.

In the Western Pacific the water is colder, a few bottom tempera-
tures of a little over 53° F. having been found in the deep trough east
of the Tonga Islands; but the North Pacific, though the deeper ocean—
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 353

of enormous area and volume—is apparently again cut off by a subma-
rine ridge. The northwestern part of the Indian Ocean is for similar
reasons assumed to be divided from the main body, the shallower water
probably running from the Seychelles to the Maldive Islands.

Mr. Buchan has pointed out why some parts of oceans, deep and vast
though they be, are, when cut off from communication with others,
warmer at the bottom. Water can only sink through lower layers
when it is the heavier, and though a warmer surface current becomes
from evaporation denser, its heat makes it specifically lighter than the
Strata below. It is only when such a current parts gradually with its
heat, as in traveling from tropical to temperate regions, that it sinks
and slowly but surely carries its temperature with it, modifying the
extreme natural cold of the bottom layers. In the North Atlantic and

Pacific we have such a condition. The great currents of the Gulf
Stream and Japan current as they flow to the north sink, and in the
course of ages have succeeded in raising the bottom temperature 3 or
4 degrees... In the southern seas this influence is not at work, and
directly connected with the more open water around the South Pole,
_ there is nothing to carry to the abysmal depths any heat to raise them
from their normal low temperatures, due to the absence of any heating
influence. The ice masses around the South Pole have probably little
or no effect on bottom temperature, as the fresher, though colder, water
will not sink; and, as a matter of fact, warmer water is found at a few
hundred fathoms than at the surface. The lowest temperature ever
obtained was by Sir John Ross in the Arctic Ocean in Davis Strait at
a depth of 680 fathoms, when he recorded a reading of 25° F. This
probably requires confirmation, as thermometers of those days were
somewhat imperfect. In the great oceans the greatest cold is found on
the western side of the South Atlantic, where the thermometer stands
at 32.3° F., but temperatures of 29° F. have been obtained of recent
years east of the Faroe Islands, north of the ridge which cuts off the
deeper waters of the Arctic from the Atlantic.

Though scarcely within the limits of ny subject, which is the sea
itself, I must say a few words on the sea floor. The researches carried
on in the Challenger revealed that, while for a certain distance from the
continents the bottom is composed of terrestrial detritus, everywhere
in deep water it is mainly composed of the skeletons or remains of
skeletons of the minute animals that have lived in the water. In com-
paratively small depths we find remains of many shells. As the depth
increases to 500 fathoms or so we get mainly the calcareous shells of
the globigerinie, which may be said to form by far the greater part of
the oceanic floor. In deeper water still, where pressure, combined with
the action of the carbonic acid, has dissolved all caleareous matter, we
find an impalpable mud with skeletons of the siliceous radiolaria of
countless forms of the greatest beauty and complexity. Deeper still,
i. e., in water of, speaking generally, over 3,000 fathoms, we find a

SM 94. 23

354 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

reddish-colored clayey mud, in which the only traces of recognizable
organic remains are teeth of sharks and cetacea, many belonging to
extinct species. What the depths of these deposits may be is a sub-
ject of speculation. It may be that some day, as mechanical appliances
are improved, we shall find means of boring, but up to the present no
such operation has been attempted.

On the specific gravity of the water of the sea I can say but little
except that if varies considerably. It is not yet known for certain how
far the specific gravities observed at various points and depths remain
appreciably constant. In localities where evaporation is great and
other influences do not interfere it is evident that the specific gravity
of the surface will be high; a consideration which observations confirm,
but there are many complications which require more observation
before they can be resolved. In some few places repeated observations
permit deductions, but taking the sea as a whole we are yet very
ignorant of the facts bearing on this point.

The waves which forever disturb the surface of the sea demand much
study. The greatest of these, and the most regular, is the tidal wave.
On this many powerful intellects have been brought to bear, but it still
presents many unsolved anomalies. Lord Kelvin and Professor Darwin
have demonstrated that the tidal movement is made up of many waves
depending upon different functions of the moon and sun, some being
semidiurnal, some diurnal. The time of transit over the meridian, the
declination of both bodies, create great variations; the changing dis-
tance and position of the moon and the position of her node also have
ereat effect, while the ever-varying direction and force of the winds and
the different pressure of the atmosphere play their part, and sometimes
a very large part, on what is somewhat loosely known as the meteorolog-
ical tide. The amplitude of the oscillation of the water depending upon
zach of the astronomical functions varying for every point-on the earth,
the effect is that, each having a different period, the resulting mean
movement of water has most astonishing variations. In some places
there is but one apparent tide in the day; in others this phenomenon
occurs only at particular periods of each lunation, while in the major-
ity of cases it is the movements of each alternate tide only that appear
to have much to do with one another. Though after long observation
made of the times and ranges of tides at any one spot they can now be
predicted with great accuracy for that particular place by the method
of harmonie analysis, perfected by Prof. G. Darwin, the meteorological
tide excepted, no one can yet say what the tide will be at any spot
where observations have not been made.

Observations all over the world have now shown that there is no part
where the tidal movement is so regular and simple as around the Brit-
ish Islands. This is more remarkable when it is found that the tides
on the other side of the Atlantie—at Nova Scotia, for instance—are
very complicated. The minor tides, which in most parts of the world,
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 355

when combined in one direction, amount to a very considerable fraction
of the principal lunar and solar tides, and consequently greatly increase
or diminish their effects, are in Great Britain so insignificant that their
influence is trifling; but why this should be [ have never yet found any-
one toexplain. Nevertheless there are many very curious points about
our tides which are plainly caused by interference, or, in other words,
by the meeting of two tidal waves arriving from opposite directions or
from the rebound of the tidal waves from other coasts. This effect,
also, it has been so far found impossible to predict without observation.
On our southern coasts, for instance, in the western part the tide rises
about 15 feet, but as it travels eastward the range becomes less and
less until, about Poole, it reaches a minimum of 6 feet. Farther east
again 1t increases to Hastings, where the range is 24 feet. Yet farther
east 1t again gradually diminishes. This is due to the reflection from the
French coast, which brings another wave which either superposes itself
upon or reduces the effect of the main tide advancing up the English
Channel; but the details of such reflection are so complex that no one
could forecast them without more knowledge than we possess. There
can be little doubt that to this cause—reflection—is mainly due the vari-
ations in the amount of mean range of tide which are found on many
coasts at different parts; and as these reflected waves may arrive from
great distances and be many in number, we may cease to wonder at the
extraordinary differences in range of tide which prevail, though it will
be understood that this is wholly separate from the varying heights
of each successive tide or of the tide at different parts of each lunation,
or at different times of the year, which depend upon the astronomical
influences. .

The actual height of the tide in deep water is small, but on passing
into shallow water when approaching a shore, and especially when roll-
ing up a gulf of more or less funnel shape, it becomes increased by the
retardation caused by friction and by compression laterally, and hence
the height of the tide on a coast affected by other causes is greater than
in the open sea. The oceanic tide wave is supposed to be from 2 to 3
feet in height, but as this has been assumed from observations made
at small oceanic islands where, although the magnifying influences
mentioned are at a minimum, they still exist, we wait for precise infor-
mation until some means of actually measuring the tide in deep
water is devised.

The waves due to wind, though not so far-reaching in their effects as
the majestic march of the tide wave, are phenomena which are more
apparent to the traveler on the ocean. The deep sea in a heavy gale
presents, perhaps, the most impressive manifestation of the powers of |
nature which man can behold, and doubtless many of us have expe-
rienced feelings that may vary from awe and wonder to sheer delight,
according to the temperament of each individual, at for the first time
finding himself face to face with this magnificent sight, though I rather

fear that discomfort is the prevailing feeling that many carry away.
The height to which storm waves may arise has never been very satis-
factorily determined. Apart from the difficulty of the task and the
small number of people who will address themselves to it when they
have the chance, it is butrarely that any individual sees really abnormal
waves, even though he may be at sea all his life. Different heights
for what are called maximum waves have been recorded, and they vary
from 40 to 90 feet from crest to hollow. All we can say is that the
most probable figure is about 50 or 60 feet. These great storm waves
travel very far. In some cases they convey a warning, as their velocity
always far exceeds that at which the storm is traveling. In others
they intimate that a gale of which no more is seen has occurred some-
where—it may be many miles distant. When they have traveled
beyond the limits of the wind which raised them they lose the steep-
ness of slope which characterizes them when under its influence and
become an undulation which is scarcely noticed when in deep water.
On approaching shallow water, however, they are again apparent, and
the “rollers” that occur unperiodically at various places in latitudes
where gales never occur would seem to be caused by such waves, origi-
nating in areas many thousands of miles distant. Such appears to be
the origin of the well-known rollers at Ascension and St. Helena, where

the rocky and exposed nature of the landing has caused this phenom-

enon to be especially noticed.

Other rollers are, however, undoubtedly due to earthquakes or vol-
canie eruptions occurring in the bed of the sea. Many of the great
and sudden waves which have caused devastation and great loss of life
on the shores of western South America are referable to this cause.
Observations to enable the focus of such a disturbance to be traced
have generally been lacking, but it is probable that where the wave has
been large the point of origin has not been far distant.- In one nota-
ble instance the conditions were reversed. The point of origin was
known, and the distance to which the resulting wave traveled could be
fairly satisfactorily traced. This was the great eruption in the Straits
of Sunda, in August, 1883, which locally resulted in the disappearance
of the major part of the island of Krakatoa, and the loss of nearly
40,000 lives on the neigboring shores of Java and Sumatra by the huge
wave which devastated them. The records of automatic tide gauges
and the observations of individuals enabled the waves emanating from
this disturbance to be followed to great distances. These waves were
of great length, the crests, arriving at intervals of about an hour, and
moving with a velocity of about 350 miles an hour, were about that dis-
tance apart. The waves recorded at Cape Horn were apparently
undoubtedly due to the eruption and traveled distances of 7,500 miles
and 7,800 miles in their course on either side of the south polar land.
They were only 5 inches in height above mean level of the sea, while
the waves recorded at places on the southern part of Africa, at a dis-
tance of about 5,000 miles from the scene of the eruption, were from

1 to 2 feet high, the original long waves being of an unknown height,
but probably did not exceed 10 or 15 feet. No other such opportunity
of testing tbe distances to which great waves may travel has ever
occurred, and as such a catastrophe as gave rise to them could scarcely
be repeated without similar loss of life, it may be hoped we shall not
live to see another, interesting though the discussion of the numerous
phenomena were.

The movement of the particles of water due to the tide wave extends
to the bottom of the deepest water, and doubtless plays an important
part in keeping up a constant motion in the abysses, but the depth to
which the action of the surface waves originating in wind reach is still
but little known by observation. If, however, we study the contour of
the bottom off the shores of land exposed to the full influence of the
great oceans, we are struck by the very general rapid increase of slope
after a depth of about 80 to 100 fathoms (500 to 600 feet) has been
reached. It appears probable that this is connected with the depth to
which wave action may extend, the fine particles brought down by
rivers or washed from the land by the attrition of the breakers being
distributed and gradually moved down the slope. When we examine
banks in the open sea, we find, however, that there are a great many
with a general depth of from 50 to 40 fathoms, and the question arises
whether this may not be the general limit of the power of oceanic waves
to cut down the mass acted upon when it is fairly friable.

The question has an interesting bearing on the subject of the ever-
debated origin of coral atolls, for this is the general depth of many
large lagoons; and granted that the sea can cut down land to this
depth, we have at once an approach to the solution of the problem of
the formation of bases of a suitable depth and material upon which the
coral animal can commence operations. This question also awaits more
light, and I merely offer this remark as a suggestion. It is, however,
somewhat remarkable that in recent cases of volcanic islands piled up
by submarine eruptions, they have all been more or less rapidly washed
away, and are in process of further diminution under the surface.

Observations on the mean level of the sea show that it constantly
varies,in some places more than others. This subject has not yet been
worked out. In some localities it is plainly due to wind, as in the Red
Sea, where the summer level is some 2 feet below that of winter, owing
to the fact that in summer the wind blows down the whole length of the
sea, and drives the water out. In many places, as in the great estuary
of the Rio de la Plata, the level is constantly varying with the direction
of the winds, and the fluctuation due to this cause is greatly in excess
of the tidal action. In others the cause is not so clear. At Sydney,
New South Wales, Mr. Russell found that during eleven years the level
was constantly falling at about an inch a year, but by the last accounts
received it was again stationary.

The variations in the pressure of the atmosphere play an important
part in changes of sea level. A difference of 1 inch in the barometer
358 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.

has been shown to be followed by a difference of a foot in the mean
level of the sea, and in parts of the world where the mean height of the
barometer varies much with @he seasons and the tidal range is small,
this effect is very marked.

Of any secular change in the level of the sea little is known. This
can only be measured by comparison with the land, and it is a question
which is the more unstable, the land or the water—probably the land,
as it has been shown that the mass of the land is so trifling, compared
with that of the ocean, that it would take a great deal to alter the gen-
eral mean level of the latter.

All the points connected with the sea that I have had the honor of
bringing before you form part of the daily observation of the marine
surveyor when he has the chance, but I can not refrain from also men-
tioning other duties, which are indeed in the present state of our knowl-
edge and of the practical requirements of navigation, the principal
points to which he has to pay attention, as it may explain why our
knowledge on so many interesting details still remains very imperfect.

Working as we do in the interests of the vast marine of Great
Britain, the paramount necessity of good navigational charts requires
that the production of such charts should be our principal aim. It is
difficult for a landsman and difficult even for a sailor who has never
done such werk to realize the time that is necessary to make a really
complete marine survey. The most important part, the ascertainment
of the depth, is done, so to speak, in the dark—that is to say, it is by
touch and not by sight that we have to find the different elevations
and depressions of the bottom of the sea. In making a map of the
land an isolated rock or hill stands up like a beacon above the surround-
ing land,and is at once localized and marked, but a similar object under
the sea can only be found by patient and long-continued sounding, and
may very easily be missed.

When it is considered that marine surveying has only been seriously
undertaken for about one hundred years, with a very limited number of
vessels, we Shail, I think, understand how in the vast area of the waters,
taking only those bordering the shores, many unsuspected dangers
are yearly discovered. Very, very few coasts have been minutely sur-
veyed, and, setting aside for a moment the great changes that take
place off shores where sandbanks prevail, I should be sorry to say
that even on our own coasts charts are perfect. Yearly around Great
Britain previously unknown rocks come to light, and if this is the case
at home, what are we to think of the condition of charts of less-known
localities! Our main efforts therefore are directed to the improvement of
charts for safe navigation, and the time that can be spared to the eluci-
dation of purely scientific problems is limited. Nevertheless, the daily
work of the surveyor is so intimately connected with these. scientific
problems that year by year, slowly but surely, we add to the aceumula-
tion of our knowledge of the sea.
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS AND THE DISCOYV-
ERY OF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN)!

By W. K. Brooks,

Professor of Zoology in the Johns Hopkins University.

In the Origin of Species Darwin says that the sudden appearance of
species belonging to several of the main divisions of the animal king-
dom in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks is at present inexplicable
and may be truly urged as a valid objection to his views.

It his theory be true, he says that ‘‘it is indisputable that before the
lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long
as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian
age to the present day, and that during these vast periods the world
swarmed with living creatures. Here,” he says, ‘‘we encounter a for-
midable objection; for it seems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state
for the habitation of living creatures, has lasted long enough. ‘To the
question why we do not find such fossiliferous deposits belonging to
these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system I can give
no satisfactory answer.”

On its geological side this difficulty is even greater than it was in
Darwin’s day, for we now know that the fauna of the Lower Cambrian
was rich and varied; that most of the modern types of animal life were
represented in the oldest fauna which has been discovered, and that all
its types have modern representatives. The paleontological side of
the subject has been ably summed up by Walcott in an interesting
memoir on the oldest fauna which is known to us from fossils, and his
collection of one hundred and forty-one American species from the
Lower Cambrian is distributed over most of the marine groups of the
animal kingdom, and except for the absence of the remains of verte-
brated animals, the whole province of animal life is almost as com-
pletely covered by these one hundred and forty-one species as it could
be by a collection from the bottom of the modern ocean. Four of the
American species are sponges, two are hydrozoa, nine are actinozoa,
twenty-nine are brachiopods, three are Jamellibranchs, thirteen are gas-

teropods, fifteen are pteropods, eight are crustacea, fifty-one are trilo-
bites, and trails and burrows show the existence of at least six species
of bottom forms, probably worms or crustacea. The most notable char-
acteristic of this fauna is the completeness with which these few species
outline the whole fauna of the modern sea floor. Far from showing us
the simple unspecialized ancestors of modern animals, they are most
intensely modern themselves in the zoological sense, and they belong
to the same order of nature as that which prevails at the present day.

The fossiliferous beds of the Lower Cambrian rest upon beds which
are miles in vertical thickness, and are identical in all their physical
features with those which contain this fauna. They prove beyond
question that the waters in which they were laid down were as fit for
supporting life at the beginning as at the end of the enormous lapse of
time which they represent, and that all the conditions have since been
equally favorable for the preservation and the discovery of fossils.
Modern discovery has brought the difficulty which Darwin points out
into clearer view, but geologists are no more prepared than he was to
give a satisfactory solution, although I shall now try to show that the
study of living animals in their relations to the world around them
does help us, and that comparative anatomy and comparative embry-
ology and the study of the habits and affinities of organisms tell us of
times more ancient than the oldest fossils and give a more perfect
record of the early history of life than paleontology.

While the history of life as told by fossils has been slow and
eradual, it has not been uniform, for we have evidence of the occur-
rence of several periods when modification was comparatively rapid.

We are living in a period of intellectual progress, and among terres-
trial animals cunning now counts for more than size or strength, and
fossils show that, while the average size of mammals has diminished
since the Middle Tertiary, the size of their brains has increased more
than 100 per cent; that the brain of a modern mammal is more than
twice as large, compared with its body, as the brain of its ancestors in
the Middle Tertiary. Measured in years the Middle Tertiary is very
remote, but it is very modern compared with the whole history of the
fossiliferous rocks, although more of brain development has been
effected in this short time than in all preceding time from the beginning. -

The later paleozoic and early secondary fossils mark another period
of rapid change, when the fitness of the land for animal life, and the
presence of land plants, brought about the evolution of terrestrial
animals.

I shall give reasons for seeing, in the Lower Cambrian, another period
of rapid change, when a new factor—the discovery of the bottom of the
ocean—began to act in the modification of species, and I shall try to
show that, whiie animal life was abundant long before, the evolution of
animals likely to be preserved as fossils took place with comparative
rapidity, and that the zoological features of the Lower Cambrian are of
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 361

such a character as to indicate that it is a decided and unmistakable
approximation to the primitive fauna of the bottom, beyond which life
was represented only by minute and simple surface animals not likely
to be preserved as fossils.

Nothing brings home more vividly to the zoologist a picture of the
diversity of the Lower Cambrian fauna and of its intimate relation to
the fauna on the bottom of the modern ocean than the thought that
.he would have found on the old Cambrian shore the same opportunity
to study the embryology and anatomy of pteropods and gasteropods
and lamellibranchs, of crustacea and medusie, echinoderms and bra-
chiopods, that he now has at a marine laboratory; that his studies
would have followed the same lines then that they do now, and that
most of the record of the past which they make known to him would
have been ancient history then. Most of the great types of ancient
life show by their embryology that they run back to simple and minute
ancestors which lived at the surface of the ocean, and that the common
meeting point must be projected back to a still more remote time, before
these ancestors had become differential from each other.

After we have traced each great line of modern animals as far back-
ward as we can through the study of fossils, we still find these lines
distinctly laid down. The Lower Cambrian crustacea, for example,
are as distinet from the Lower Cambrian echinoderms or pteropods or
lamellibranchs or brachiopods as they are from these of the present day,
but zoology gives us evidence that the early steps in the estabiishment
of these great lines were taken under conditions which were essentially
different from those which have prevailed, without any essential change
from the time of the oldest fossils to the present day, and that most of
the great lines of descent were represented in the remote past by ances-
tors, which, living a different sort of life, differed essentially, in strue-
ture as well as in habits, from the representatives of the same types
which are known to us as fossils.

In the echinoderms we have a well-defined type represented by
abundant fossils, very rich in living forms, very diversified in its
modification, and therefore well fitted for use as an illustration. This
great stem contains many classes and orders, all constructed on the
~same plan, which is sharply isolated and quite unlike the plan of strue-
ture in any other group of animals. All through the series of fossilifer-
ous rocks echinoderms are found, and their plan of structure is always
the same. Paleontology gives us most valuable evidence regarding
the course of evolution within the limits of a class, as in the ecrineids
or the echinoids; but we appeal to it in vain for light upon the organiza-
tion of the primitive echinoderm or for connecting links between the
classes. To our questions on these subjects, and on the relation of
the echinoderms to other animals, paleontology is silent, and throws
them back upon us as unsolved riddles.
362 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

The zoologist unhesitatingly projects his imagination, held in check
only by the laws of scientific thought, into the dark period before the
times of the oldest fossils, and he feels absolutely certain of the past
existence of a stem from which the classes of echinoderms have
inherited the fundamental plan of their structure. He affirms with
equal confidence that the structural changes which have separated this
ancient type from the classes which we know from fossils are very much
more profound and extensive than all the changes which each class has
undergone from the earliest paleozoic times to the present day. He is
also disposed to assume, but, as I shall show, with much less reason
that the amount of change which structure has undergone is an index
to the length of time which the change has required, and that the
period which is covered by the fossiliferous rocks is only an inconsid-
erable part of that which has been consumed in the evolution of the
echinoderms.

The zoologist does not check the flight of his scientific imagination
here, however, for he trusts implicitly to the embryological evidence
which teaches him that still farther back in the past all echinoderms
were represented by a minute floating animal which was not an echino-
derm at all in any sense except the ancestral one, although it was dis-
tinguished by features which natural selection has converted, under
the influence of modern conditions, into the structure of echinoderms.
He finds in the embryology of modern echinoderms phenomena-which
‘an bear no interpretation but this, and he unhesitatingly assumes
that they are an inheritance which has been handed down from genera-
tion to generation through all the ages from the prehistoric times of
zoology.

Other groups tell the same story with equal clearness. A lingula is
still living in the sand bars and mud flats of the Chesapeake Bay
under conditions which have not effected any essential change in its
structure since the time of the Lower Cambrian. Who can look ata
living lingula without being overwhelmed by the effort to grasp its
immeasurable antiquity; by the thought that while it has passed
through all the chances and changes of geological history, the struc.
ture which fitted it for life on the earliest paleozoic bottom is. still
adapted for a life on the sands of the modern sea floor?

The everlasting hills are the type of venerable antiquity; but lingula
has seen the continents grow up, and has maintained its integrity
unmoved by the convulsions which have given the crust of the earth
its present form.

As measured by the time-standards of the zoologist lingula itself is
modern, for its life history still holds locked up in its embryology the
record, repeated in the development of each individual, of a structure
and a habit of life which were lost in the unknown past at the time of
the Lower Cambrian, and it tells us vaguely but unmistakably of life
at the surface of the primitive ocean at a time when it was represented
by minute and simple floating ancestors.

THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 363

sroadly stated, the history of each great line has been like that of
the echinoderms and brachiopods. The oldest pteropod or lamelli-
branch or echinoderm or crustacean or vertebrate which we know from
fossils exhibits its own type of structure with perfect distinctness, and
later influences have done no more than to expand and diversify the
type, while anatomy fails to guide us back to the point where these
various lines met each other in a common source, although it forces us
to believe that the common source, once had an individual existence.
Embryology teaches that each line once had its own representative at
the surface of the ocean, and that the early stages in its evolution have
passed away and left no record in the rocks.

If we try to call before the mind a picture of the land surface of the
earth we seo a vast expanse of verdure stretching from high up in
the mountains over hills, valieys, and plains, and through forests and
meadows down to the sea, with only an occasional lake or broad river
to break its uniformity.

Our picture of the ocean is an empty waste, stretching on and on
with no break in the monotony except now and then a flying fish or a
wandering sea bird or a floating tuft of sargassum, and we never think
of the ocean as the home of vegetable life. It contains plant-like ani-
mals in abundance, but these are true animals and not plants, although
they are so like them in form and color. At Nassau, in the Bahama
Islands, the visitor is taken in a small boat, with windows of plate
glass set in the bottom, to visit the “sea gardens” at the inner end of
a channel through which the pure water from the open sea flows
between two coral islands into the lagoon. Here the true reef corals
grow in quiet water, where they may be visited and examined.

When illuminated by the vertical sun of the Tropies and by the light
which is reflected back from the white bottom, the pure, transparent
water is as clear as air, and the smallest object 40 or 50 feet down is
distinetly visible through the glass bottom of the boat.

As this glides over the great mushroom-shaped coral domes which
arch up from the depths, the dark grottoes between them and the caves
under their overhanging tops are lighted up by the sun, far down among
the anthozoa or flower animals and the zoophytes or animal plants,
which are seen through the waving thicket of brown and purple sea
fans and sea feathers as they toss before the swell from the open ocean.

There are miles of these “sea gardens” in the lagoons of the Baha-
mas, and it has been my good fortune to spend many months studying
their wonders, but no description can convey any conception of their
beauty and luxuriance. The general effect is very garden-like, and the
beautiful fishes of black and golden yellow and iridescent-cobalt blue
hover like birds among the thickets of yellow and lilac gorgonias.

The parrot fishes seem to be cropping the plants like rabbits, but
more careful examination shows that they are biting off the tips of the
gorgonias and branching madrepores or hunting for the small crustacea
364 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

which hide in the thicket and that all the apparent plants are really
animals.

The delicate star-like flowers are the vermilion heads of boring anne-
lids or the scarlet tentacles of actinias, and the thicket is made up of
pale lavender bushes of branching madrepores, and green and brown
and yellow and olive masses of brain coral, of aleyonarians of all shades
of yellow and purple, lilac and red, and of black and brown and red
sponges. Hven the lichens which inecrust the rocks are hydroid corals,
and the whole sea garden is a dense jungle of animals, where plant
life is represented only by a few calcareous alge so strange in shape
and texture that they are much less plant-like than the true animals.

The searcity of plant life becomes still more notable when we study
the ocean as a whole. On land herbivorous animals are always much
more abundant and prolific than the carnivora, as they must be to keep
up the supply of food, but the animal life of the ocean shows a most
remarkable difference, for marine animals are almost exclusively ear-
nivorous.

The birds of the ocean, the terns, gulls, petrels, divers, cormorants,
tropic birds and albatrosses, are very numerous indeed, and the only
parallel to the pigeon roosts and rookeries of the land is found in the
dense clouds of sea birds around their breeding grounds, but all these
sea birds are carnivorous, and even the birds of the seashore subsist
almost exclusively upon animals such as mollusca, crustacea, and
annelids.

The seals pursue and destroy fishes; the sea elephants and walruses
live upon mollusks; the whales, dolphins and porpoises and the marine
reptiles all feed upon animals and most of them are fierce beasts of prey.

There are a few fishes which pasture in the fringe of seaweed which
grows on the shore of the ocean, and there are some which browse
among the floating tufts of algze upon its surface, but most of them fre-
quent these places in search of the small animals which hide among the
plants. .

In the Chesapeake Bay the sheepshead browses among the alge upon
the submerged rocks and piles like a marine sheep, but its food is
exclusively animal, and I have lain upon the edge of a wharf watching
it crunch the barnacles and young oysters until the juice of their bodies
streamed out of the angles of its mouth and gathered a host of small
fishes to snatch the fragments as they drifted away with the tide.

Many important fishes, like the cod, pasture on the bottom, but their
pasturage consists of mollusks and annelids and crustacea instead of
plants, and the vast majority of sea fishes are fierce hunters, pursuing
and destroying smaller fishes, and often exhibiting an insatiable love
of slaughter, like our own bluefish and tropical albacore and barracuda.
Others, such as the herring, feed upon smaller fishes and the pelagic
pteropods and copepods; and others, like the shad, upon the minute
organisins of the ocean, but all, with few exceptions, are carnivorous.

THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 365

In the other great groups of marine animals we find some scavengers,
some which feed upon micro-organisms, and others which hunt and
destroy each other, but there is no group of marine animals which cor-
responds to the herbivora and rodents and the plant-eating birds and
insects of the land.

There is so much room in the vast spaces of the ocean, and so much
of it is hidden, that it is only when surface animals are gathered to-
gether that the abundance of marine life becomes visible and impres-
sive; but some faint conception of the boundless wealth of the ocean
may be gained by observing the quickness with which marine animals
become crowded together at the surface in favorable weather. Ona
cruise of more than two weeks along the edge of the Gulf Stream I
was surrounded continually night and day by a vast army of dark-
brown jelly-fish (Linerges mercutia), whose dark color made them very
conspicuous in the clear water. We could see them at a distance from
the vessel, and at noon, when the sun was overhead, we could look down
to a great depth through the center-board well, and everywhere, to a
depth of 50 or 60 feet, we could see them drifting by in a steady pro-
cession like motes in a sunbeam. We cruised through them for more
than 500 miles and we tacked back and forth over a breadth of almost
a hundred miles, and found them everywhere in such abundance that
there were some in every bucketful of water which we dipped up; nor
is this abundance of life restricted to tropical waters, for Haeckel tells
us that he met with such enormous masses of Limacina to the north-
west of Scotland that each bucket of water contained thousands. The
tendency to gather in crowds is not restricted to the smaller animals,
and many species of raptorial fishes are found in densely packed banks.

The fishes in a school of mackerel are as numerous as the birds in a
flight of wild pigeons, and we are told-of one school which was a wind-
row of fish half a mile wide and at least 20 miles long. But while
pigeons are plant eaters, the mackerel are rapacious hunters, pursuing
and devouring the herrings as well as other animals.

Herring swarm like locusts, and a herring bank is almost a solid
wall. In 1879 three hundred thousand river herring were landed in a
single haul of the seine in Albemarle Sound; but the herring are also
carnivorous, each one consuming myriads of copepods every day.

In spite of this destruction and the ravages of armies of meduse
and siphonophores and pteropods the fertility of the copepods is so
great that they are abundant in all parts of the ocean, and they are
met with in numbers which exceed our power of comprehension. On
one occasion the Challenger steamed for two days through a dense cloud
formed of a single species, and they are found in all latitudes, from the
Arctic regions to the Equator, in masses which discolor the water for
miles. We know, too, that they are not restricted to the surface, and
that the banks of copepods are sometimes more than a mile thick.
When we reflect that thousands would find ample room and food in a
366 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

pint ef water, one can form some faint conception of their universal
abundance. 5

The organisms which are visible in the water of the ocean and on
the sea bottom are almost universally engaged in devouring each other,
and many of them, like the bluefish, are never satisfied with slaughter,
but kill for mere sport.

Insatiable rapacity must end in extermination unless there is some
unfailing supply, and as we find no visible supply in the water of the
ocean we must seek it with a microscope, which shows us a wonderful
fauna made up of innumerable larve and embryos and small animals,
but these things cau not be the food supply of the ocean, for no carniv-
orous animal could subsist very long by devouring its own children.
The total amount of these animals is inconsiderable, however, when
compared with the abundance of a few forms of protozoa and proto-
phytes, and both observation and deduction teach that the most
important element in marine life consists of some half dozen types of
protozoa and unicellular plants; of globigerina and radiolarians, and
of trichodesmium, pyrocystis, protococcus and the cocecospheres rhab-
dospheres and diatoms.

Modern microscopic research has shown that these simple plants,
and the globigerinw and radolarians which feed upon them, are so
abundant and prolitic that they meet all demands and supply the food
for allthe animals of the ocean. This is the fundamental conception of
marine biology. The basis of all the life in the modern ocean is found
in the micro-organisms of the surface.

This is not all. The simplicity and abundance of the microscopic
forms and their importance in the economy of nature show that the
organic world has gradually taken shape around them as its center or
starting point, and has been controlled by them. ‘They are not only
the fundamental food supply, but the primeval supply, which has deter-
mined the whole course of the evolution of marine life.

The pelagic plant life of the ocean has retained its primitive simplic-
ity on account of the very favorable character of its environment, and
the higher rank of the littoral vegetation and that of the land is the
result of hardship.

On land the mineral elements of plant food are slowly supplied, as
the rains dissolve them; limited space brings crowding and competi-
tion for this scanty supply; growth is arrested for a great part of each
year by drought or cold; the diversity of the earth’s surface demands
diversity of structure and habit, and the great size and complicated
structure of terrestrial plants are adaptations to these conditions of
hardship.

At the surface of the ocean the abundance and uniform distribution
of mineral food in solution; the area which is available for plants; the
volume of sunlight and the uniformity of the temperature are all favor-
able to the growth of plants, and as each plant is bathed on all sides
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 367

by a nutritive fluid, it is advantageous for the new plant-cells which
are formed by cell-multiplication, to separate from each other as soon
as. possible, in order to expose the whole of their surface to the water.
Cell-aggregation, the first step toward higher organization, is therefore
disadvantageous to the pelagic plants, and as the environment at the
surface of the ocean is so monotonous, there is little opportunity for an
ageregation of cells to gain any compensating advantage by seizing
upon amore favorable habitat. The pelagic plants have retained their
primitive simplicity, and the most distinctive peculiarity of the micro-
scopic food supply of the ocean is the very small number of forms which
make up the enormous mass of individuals.

All the animals of the ocean are dependent upon this supply of
microscopic food, and many of them are adapted for preying upon it
directly, but a review of the animal kingdom will show that no highly
organized animal has ever been evolved at the surface of the ocean,
although all depend upon the food supply of the surface.

The animals which now find their home in the open waters of the
ocean are, almost without exception, descendants of forms which lived
upon or near the bottom, or along the seashore, or upon the land, and
all the exceptions are simple animals of minute size. A review of the
whole animal kingdom would take more space than we can spare, but
it would show that the evidence from embryology, from comparative
anatomy, and from paleontology all bears in the same direction and
proves that every large and highly organized animal in the open ocean
is descended from ancestors whose home was not open water but solid
ground, either on the bottom or on the shore. Embryology also gives
us good ground for believing that all these animals are still more
remotely descended from minute and simple pelagic ancestors, and that
the history of all the highly organized inhabitants of the water has
followed a roundabout path from the surface to the bottom and then
back into the water. When this fact is seen in all its bearings, and its
full significance is grasped, it is certainly one of the most notable and
instructive features of evolution.

The food supply of marine animals consists of a few species of micro-
scopic organisms which are inexhaustible and the only source of food
for all the inhabitants of the ocean. The supply is primeval as wellas
inexhaustible, and all the life of the ocean has gradually taken shape
in direct dependence upon it. In view of these facts we can not but
be profoundly impressed by the thought that all the highly organized
marine animals are products of the bottom or the shore or the land,
and that while the largest animals on earth are pelagic the few which
are primitively pelagic are small and simple. The reason is obvious.
The conditions of life at the surface are so easy that there is little
fierce competition, and the inorganic environment is so simple that
there is little chance for diversity of habits.

The growth of terrestrial plants is limited by the scarcity of food,
but there is no such limit to the growth of pelagic plants or the animals
368 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

which feed on them, and while the balance of life is no doubt adjusted
by competition for food this is never very fierce, even at the present
day, when the ocean swarms with highly organized wanderers from
the bottom and the shore. Even now the destruction or escape of a
microscopic pelagic organism depends upon the accidental proximity
or remoteness of an enemy rather than upon defense or protection, and
survival is determined by space relations rather than a struggle for
existence.

The abundance of food is shown by the ease with which wanderers
from the land, like sea birds, find places for themselves in the ocean,
and the rapidity with which they spread over its whole extent.

As a marine animal the insect Halobates must be very modern as
compared with most pelagic forms, yet it has spread over all tropical
and subtropical seas, and it may always be found skimming over the
surface of mid-ocean as much at home as a Gerris ina pond. I never
found it absent in the Gulf Stream when conditions were favorable for
collecting. ;

The easy character of pelagic life is shown by the fact that the larvee
of innumerable animals from the bottom and the shore have retained
their pelagic habit, and I shall soon give reasons for believing that the
larva of a shore animal is safer at sea than near the shore.

There was little opportunity in the primitive pelagic fauna and flora
for an organism to gain superiority by seizing upon an advantageous
site or by acquiring peculiar habits, for one place was like another, and
peculiar habits could count for little in comparison with accidental
space relations. After the fauna of the surface had been enriched by
all the marine animals which have become secondarily adapted to
pelagic life, competition with those improved forms brought about
improvements in those which were strictly pelagic in origin, like the
siphonophores, and those wanderers from the bottom introduced another
factor into the evolution of pelagic life, for their bodies have been
utilized for protection or concealment and in other ways, and we now
have fishes which hide in the poison curtain of Physalia, crustacea
which live in the pharynx of Salpa or in the mouth of the menhaden,
barnacles and sucking fish fastened to whales and turtles, besides a
host of external and internal parasites. The primitive ocean furnished
no such opportunity, and the conditions of pelagic life must at first
have been very simple, and while competition was not entirely absent
the possibilities of evolution must have been extremely limited and
the progress of divergent modification very slow so long as all life was
restricted to the waters of the ocean.

There can be no doubt that floating life was abundant for a long
period when the bottom was uninhabited. The slow geological changes
by which the earth gradually assumed its present character present a
boundless field for speculation, but there can be no doubt that the sur-
face of the primeval ocean became fit for living things long before the
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 369

deeper waters or the sea floor, and during this period the proper con-
ditions for the production of large and complicated organisms did not
exist, and even after the total amount of life had become very great it
must have consisted of organisms of small size and simple structure.

Marine life is older than terrestrial life, and as all marine life has
shaped itself in relation to the pelagic food supply, this itself is the
only form of life which is independent, and it must therefore be the old-
est. There must have been along period in primeval times when there
was a pelagic fauna and flora rich beyond limit in individuals, but
made up of only a few simple types. During this time the pelagic
ancestors of all the great groups of animals were slowly evolved, as
well as other forms which have left no descendants. So long as life
was restricted to the surface no great or rapid advancement, through
the influences which now modify species, was possible, and we know
of no other influences which might bave replaced them. We are there-
fore forced to believe that the differentiation and improvement of the
primitive flora and fauna was slow, and that, for a vast period of time,
life consisted of an innumerable multitude of minute and simple pelagic
organisms, During the time which it took to form the thick beds of
older sedimentary rocks, the physical conditions of the ocean gradu-
ally took their present form, and during a part, at least, of this period
the total amount of life in the ocean may have been very nearly as great
as it is now without leaving any permanent record of its existence, for
no rapid advance took place until the advantages of life on the bottom
were discovered.

We must not think of the populating of the bottom as a physical
problem, but as discovery and colonization, very much like the coloni-
zation of islands. Physical conditions for a long time made it impossi-
ble, but its initiation was the result of biological influences, and there
is no reason why its starting point should necessarily be the point where
the physical obstacles first disappeared. It is useless to speculate upon
the nature of the physical obstacles; there is reason to think one of
them, probably an important one, was the deficiency of oxygen in deep
water.

Whatever their character may have been they were all, no doubt, of
such a nature that they first disappeared in the shallow water around
the coast, but it is not probable that bottom life was first established
in shallow water, or before the physical conditions had become favor-
able at Esa rable depths.

The sediment near the shore is destructive to most mantis animals,
and recent explorations have shown that a stratum of water of very
great thickness is necessary for the complete development of the float-
ing microscopic fauna and flora, and it is a mistake to picture them as
confined to a thin surface stratum. Pelagic plants probably flourished
as far down as light penetrates, and pelagic animals are abundant at
very great depths. As the earliest bottom animals must have depended

AO) THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

directly upon the floating organisms for food, it is not probable that
they first established themselves in shallow water, where the food sup-
ply is both scanty and mixed with sediment; nor is it probable that
their establishment was delayed until the great depths had become
favorable to life.

The belts around elevated areas far enough from shore to be free
from sediment, and deep enough to permit the pelagic fauna to reach
its full development above them, are the most favorable spots, and
paleontological evidence shows that they were seized upon very early
in the history of life on the bottom.

It is probable that colony after colony was established on the bottom
and afterwards swept away by geological change like a cloud before
the wind, and that the bottom fauna which we know was not the first.
Colonies which started in shallow water were exposed to aecidents from

which those in great depths were free; and in view of our knowledge of

the permanency of the sea floor and of the broad outlines of the conti-
nents, it is not impossible that the first fauna which became established
in the deep zone around the continents may have persisted and given
rise to modern animals. However this may be, we must regard this
deep zone as the birthplace of the fauna which has survived, as the
ancestral home of all the improved metazoa.

The effect of life upon the bottom is more interesting than the place
where it began, and we are now to consider its influence upon animals,
all whose ancestors and competitors and enemies had previously been

pelagic. The cold, dark, silent, quiet depths of the sea are monotonous:

compared with the land, but they introduced many new tactors into
the course of organic evolution.

It is doubtful whether the animals which first’ settled on the bottom
secured any more food than floating ones, but they undoubtedly obtained
it with less effort, and were able to devote their superfluous energy to
growth and to multiplication, and thus to become larger and to increase
in numbers faster than pelagic animals. Their sedentary life must have
been favorable to both sexual and asexual multiplication, and the tend-
ency to increase by budding must have been quickly rendered more
active, and one of the first results of life on the bottom must have been
to promote the tendency to form connected cormi, and to retain the con-
nection between the parent and the bud until the latter was able to
obtain its own: food and to care for itself. The animals which first
acquired the habit of resting on the bottom soon began to multiply
faster than their swimming allies, and their asexually produced progeny,
remaining for a longer time attached to and nourished by the parent
stock, were much more favorably placed for rapid growth. As the
animals of the bottom live on a surface, or at least a thin stratum,
while swimming animals are distributed through solid space, the rapid
multiplication of bottom animals must soon have led to crowding and

to competition, and it quickly became harder and harder for new forms-
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. att

from the open water to force themselves in among the old ones, and
colonization soon came to an end.

The great antiquity of all the types of structure which are repre-
sented among modern animals is therefore what we should expect, for
after the foundation of the fauna of the bottom was laid it became, and
has ever since remained, difficult for new forms to establish themselves.

Most of our knowledge of the sea bottom is from three sources: From
dredgings and other explorations, from rocks which were formed beyond _
the immediate influence of continents, and from the patches of the
bottom fauna which have gradually been brought near its surface by
the growth of coral reefs, and from all these sources we have testimony
to the density of the crowd of animals on favorable spots. Deep-sea
explorations give only the most scanty basis for a picture of the sea
bottom, but they show that animal life may thrive with the dense luxuri-
ance of tropical vegetation, and Sir Wyville Thomson says he once
brought up at one time on a tangle, which was fastened to a dredge,
over twenty thousand specimens of a single species of sea-urchin. The
number of remains of paleozoic crinoids and brachiopods and trilobites
which are crowded into a single slab of fine-grained limestone is most
astounding, and it testifies most vividly and forcibly to the wealth of
hfe on the old sea floor.

No description can convey any adequate conception of the boundless
luxuriance of a coral island, but nothing else gives such a vivid picture
of the capacity of the sea floor for supporting life.. Marine plants are
not abundant on coral islands and the animals depend either directly
or indirectly upon the pelagic food supply, so that their life is the same
in this respect as that of animals in the deep sea far from land.

The abundant life is not restricted to the growing edge of the reef,
and the inner lagoons are often like crowded aquaria. At Nassau my
party of eight persons found so much to study on a little reef in a lagoon
close to our laboratory that we discovered novelties every day for four
months, and our explorations seldom carried us beyond this little tract
of bottom. Every inch of the bottom was carpeted with living animals,
while others were darting about among the corals and gorgonias in all
directions; but this was not all, for the solid rock was honeycombed
everywhere by tubes and burrows, and when broken to pieces with a
hammer each mass of coral gave us specimens of nearly every great
group in the animal kingdom. Fishes, crustacea, annelids, mollusca,_
echinoderms, hydroids and sponges could be picked out of the fragments
and the abundance of life inside the solid rock was most wonderful.

The absence of pelagic life in the landlocked water of coral islands
is aS impressive and noteworthy as the luxuriance of life upon and near
the bottom.

On my first visit to the Bahama Islands I was sadly disappointed by
the absence of pelagic animals where all the conditions seemed to be
peculiarly favorable,
aie THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

The deep ocean is So near that, as one cruises through the inner sounds
past the openings between the islets which form the outer barrier,
the deep blue water of mid-ocean is seen to meet the white sand of the
beach, and soundings show that the outer edge is a precipice as high
as the side of Chimborazo and much steeper.

Nowhere else in the world is the pure water of the deep sea found
nearer land or more free from sediment, and on the days when the
weather was favorable for outside collecting we found siphonophores
and pteropods, pelagic mollusks and crustacea and tunicates and all
sorts of pelagic larve in great abundance in the open water just outside
the inlets.

Inside the barrier the water was always calm, and day after day it
was as smooth as the surface of an inland lake. When I first entered
one of these beautiful sounds, where the calm, transparent water
stretches as far the eye can reach, while new beauties of islets and
winding channels open before one as those which are passed fade away
on the horizon, I felt sure that I had at last found a place where the
pelagic fauna of mid-ocean could be gathered at our door and studied on
shore. The water proved to be not only as pure as air but almost as
empty. At high water we sometimes captured a few pelagic animals
near the inlets, but we dragged our surface nets through the sounds day
after day only to find them as clean as if they had been hung in the
wind to dry. The water in which we washed them usually remained as
pure and empty as if it had been filtered, and we often returned from
our touring expeditions without even a copepod or a zoea or a pluteus.

The absence of the floating larvie is most remarkable, for the sounds
swarm with bottom animals which give birth every day to millions of
swimming larve. The mangrove swamps and the rocky shores are
fairly alive with crabs carrying eggs at all stages of development, and
the boat passes over great black patches of sea-urchins crowded
together by thousands. The number of animals engaged in laying
their eggs or hatching their young is infinite, yet we rarely captured
any larvee in the tow net, and most of these we did find were well
advanced and nearly through their larval life.

It is often said that the water of coral sounds is too full of lime to
be inhabited by the animals of the open ocean, but this is a mistake,
for the water is perfectly fit for supporting the most delicate and sensi-
tive animals, and those which we caught outside lived in the house in
water from the sounds better than in any other place where I ever tried
to keep them, and instead of being injurious the pure water of coral
sounds is peculiarly favorable for use in aquaria for surface animals.

The searcity of floating organisms can have only one explanation.
They are eaten up, and competition for food is so fierce that nearly
every organism which is swept in by the tide and nearly every larva
which is born in the sounds is snatched by the tentacles around some
hungry mouth.
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. o13

Nothing could illustrate the fierceness of the struggle for food among
the animals on a crowded sea bottom more vividly than the emptiness
of the water in coral sounds where the bottom is practically one enor-
mous mouth. ‘The only larve which have much chance to establish
themselves for life are those which are so fortunate as to be swept out
into the open ocean, where they can complete their larval life under the
milder competition of the pelagic fauna, and while it is usually stated
that the larve of bottom animals have retained the pelagic habit for
the purpose of distributing the species, it is more probable that it has
been retained on account of its comparative safety.

These facts show that competition must have come quickly after the
establishment of the first fauna on the bottom, and that it soon became
very rigorous and led to severe selection and rapid modification; and
we must also remember that life on the bottom brought with it many
new opportunities for divergent specialization and improvement. The
increase in size which came with economy of energy increased the possi-
bilities of variation and led to the natural selection of peculiarities which
improved the efficacy of the various parts of the body in their functions
of relation to each other, and this has been an important factor in the
evolution of complicated organisms.

The new mode of life also permitted the acquisition of protective
shells, hard-supporting skeletons, and other imperishable parts, and
it is therefore probable that the history of evolution in later times
gives no index as to the period which was required to evolve from small,
simple pelagic ancestors the oldest animals which were likely to be pre-
served as fossils.

Life on the bottom also introduced another important evolutionary
influence—competition between blood-relations. Inthoseanimals which
we know most intimately, divergent modification, with the extinction of
connecting forms, results from the fact that the fiercest competitors of
each animal are its closest allies, which, having the same habits, living
upon the same food, and avoiding enemies in the same way, are con-
stantly striving to hold exclusive possession of all that is essential to
their welfare.

When a stock gives rise to two divergent branches, each escapes
competition with the other so far as they differ in structure or habits,
while the parent stock competing with both at a disadvantage is exter-
minated.

Among the animals which we know best, evolution leads to a branch-
ing tree-like genealogy, with the topmost twigs represented by living
animals, while the rest of the tree is buried in the dead past. The
connecting form between two species must therefore be sought in
the records of the past or reconstructed by comparison. Even at the
present day things are somewhat different in the open ocean, and they
must have been very different in the primitive ocean, for a pelagic
animal has no fixed home, one locality is like another, and the compet-
8374 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

itors and enemies of each individual are determined in great part by
accidents. We accordingly find, even now, that the evolution of
pelagic animals is often linear instead of divergent, and ancient forms,
such as the sharks, often live on side by side with the later and more
evolved forms. The radiolarians and medusie and siphonophores fur-
nish many well-known illustrations of this feature of pelagic life.

No naturalist is surprised to find in the South Pacifie or in the Indian
Ocean a Salpa or a pelagic crustacean or a surface fish or a whale which
was previously known only from the North Atlantic, and the list of
species of marine animals which are found in all seas is a very long
one. The fact that pelagic animals are so independent of those laws of
geographical distribution which limit land animals is additional evi-
dence of the easy character of the conditions of pelagic life.

One of the first resuits of life on the bottom was to increase a sexual
multiplication and to lengthen the time during which buds remain
united to and nourished by their parents, and to crowd individuals of
the same species together and to cause competition between relations.
We have in this and other obvious peculiarities of life on the bottom a
sufficient explanation of the fact that since the first establishment of
the bottom fauna, evolution has resulted in the elaboration and diver-
gent specialization of the types of structure which were already estab-
lished rather than the production of new types.

Another result of the struggle for existence on the bottom was the
escape of varieties from competition with their allies by flight from the
crowded spots and a return to the open water above; just as in later
tinfes the whales and sea birds have gone back from the land to the
ocean.

These emigrants, like the civilized men who invade the homes of
peaceful islanders, brought with them the improvements which had
come from fierce competition, and they have carried everything before
them and produced a great change in the pelagic fauna.

The rapid intellectual development which has taken place among the
mammals since the Middle Tertiary, and the rapid structural changes
which took place in animals and plants when the land fauna and flora
were established, are well known, but the fact that the discovery of the
bottom initiated a much earlier and probably more important era of
rapid development in the forms of animal life has never been pointed out.

If this view is correct the primitive fauna of the bottom must have
had the following characteristies:

(1) It was entirely animal, without plants, and it at first depended
directly upon the pelagic food supply.

(2) It was established around elevated areas in water deep enough
to be beyond the influence of the shore.

(3) The great groups of animals were rapidly established from pelagic
ancestors.

(4) The animals of the bottom rapidly increased in size and hard
parts were quickly acquired.
THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. aD

(5) The bottom fauna soon produced progressive development among
pelagic animals.

(6) After the establishment of the fauna of the bottom elaboration
and differentiation among the representatives of each primitive type
soon set in and led to the extinction of connecting forms.

Many of the oldest fossils like the pteropods are the modified
descendants of ancestors with hard parts, and there is no reason to
suppose that the first animals which were capable of preservation as
fossils have been discovered, but it is interesting to note that the oldest
known fauna is an unmistakable approximation to the primitive fauna
of the bottom.

The Lower Cambrian fossils are distributed through strata more
than 2 miles thick, some, at least, of them showing by their fine grain
and by the perfect preservation of tracks and burrows which were
made in soft mud, and of soft animals like jelly-fish, that they were
deposited in water of considerable depth. The sediment was laid down
slowly and gently in water so deep as to be free from disturbance and
under conditions so favorable that it contains the remains of delicate
animals not often found as fossils.

While the fauna of the Lower Cambrian undoubtedly lived in water
of very considerable depth, it was not oceanic but continental, for we
are told by Walcott that ‘‘one of the most important conclusions is
that the fauna of the Lower Cambrian lived on the eastern and west-
ern shores of a continent that in its general configuration outlines the
American continent of to-day.” ‘Strictly speaking, the fauna did not
live upon the outer shore facing the ocean, but on the shores of interior
seas, Straits or lagoons that occupied the intervals between the several
ridges that ran from the central platform east and west of the main
continental land surface of the time.

This fauna was rich and varied, but it was not self-supporting, for
no fossil plants are found, and the primary food supply was pelagic.
Animals adapted for a rapacious life, such as the pteropods, were
abundant, and prove the existence of a rich supply of pelagic animals.
All the forms known from the fossils are either carnivorous, like the
medusie, corals, crustacea, and trilobites, or they are adapted, like the
sponges, brachiopods, and lamellibranehs, for straining minute organ-
isms out of the water or for gathering those which rained down from
above, and the conditions under which they lived were very similar to
those on the bottom at the present day.

Walcott’s studies show that the earliest known fauna had the follow-
ing characteristics: [t consisted, so far as the record shows, of animals
alone, and these were dependent upon the pelagic food supply for sur-
port. While small in comparison with many modern animals, they
were gigantic compared with primitive pelagic animals. The species
were few, but they represent a very wide range of types. All these
types have modern representatives, and most of the modern types are
376 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS.

represented in the Lower Cambrian. Their home was not the bottom
of the deep ocean, but the shores of a continent under water of consid-
erable depth.

The Cambrian fauna is usually regarded as a halfway station in a
series of animal forms which stretches backward into the past for an
immeasurable period, and it is even stated that the history of life
before the Cambrian is larger by many fold than its history since. So
far as this opinion rests on the diversity of types in Cambrian times,
it has no good basis; for if the views here advocated are correct the
evolution of the ancestral stems took place at the surface, and all tie
conditions necessary for the rapid production of types were present
when the bottom fauna first became established.

As we pass backward toward the Lower Cambrian we find closer and
closer agreement with the zoological conception of the character of
primitive life onthe bottom. While we can not regard the oldest fauna
which has been discovered as the first which existed on the bottom, we
may feel confident that the first fauna of the bottom resembled that of
the Lower Cambrian in its physical conditions and in its most distine-
tive peculiarities—the abundance of types, and the slight amount of
differentiation among the representatives of these types—and we must
regard it as a decided and unmistakable approximation to the begin-
ning of the modern fauna of the earth, as distinguished from the more
ancient and simple fauna of the open ocean,

THE RELATIONS OF PHYSIOLOGY TO CHEMISTRY AND
MORPHOLOGY!

3y GIULIO FANO.

Owing to advances in methods of research, to the increase in the
aggregate of facts acquired by science, and to the ever more thorough
study of scientific systems concerning living beings, we have become
more and more exacting as to the interpretations—always, unfortu-
nately, doubtful—to be given to physiological facts. We have sought
to replace the theory of vital force by a physico-chemical theory of life;
to put in the place of a mysterious and impalpable entity a confusion of
material elements, which in their turn assume mysterious and impon-
derable characters as soon as we attempt to define them in any way.

But while it is true that the fundamental doctrine of physies and
chemistry could not itself stand a searching analysis, yet there is no
doubt that it represents in the hierarchy of science the higher grade of
development now attained by our methods of investigation. The rapid
progress of these branches of science is probably chiefly due to the
relative simplicity of the problems with which they have to deal, but in
any case they are considered as the rational basis of a considerable
number of researches undertaken by physiology for the purpose of
defining scientifically the phenomena of life. Let us not forget, how-
ever, that physics and chemistry have yet far to go before they become
free, if indeed they ever do, from the shackles of empiricism; before
they are able to reduce every phenomenon to the simple expression of
time, space, and force, and to the derivatives therefrom—energy, veloc-
ity, and mass; and that under the names attraction, affinity, conducti-
bility, ete., are hidden things no less obscure than are the phenomena
of life. However this may be, since we can not conceive of a mechan-
ical basis of psychic facts, we ought nevertheless to admit that, with the
exception of consciousness, all expressions of function, infinite and com-
plex as they are, may be comprehended among physico-chemical phe-

nomena, if we allow that the physics and chemistry involved have
special characters of their own, and that they frequently are mechan-
ical in their operations, and that the effects produced by them are of a
quite peculiar nature.

It was in accordance with the natural development of human thought
that physiologists should first be led to examine the physical phe-
nomena of life, or to look to physies for explanations by analogy, and
that, in spite of the most serious objections, if was only later that they
took up the chemical side of biological questions, trying to give a con-
ception of them based upon the mechanism of atoms. In short, it may
be said that since that has been done many problems of physiology are
treated from the standpoint of chemistry, and that we resort to that
science for what many believe to be the latest intelligence concerning
the manifestations of life.

A quite characteristic example of the development of the general
ideas that controlled and still control physiology is found, among many
others, in the theory which attempts to account for a phenomenon of
great interest, and now much studied, that of inhibition. You know
that by inhibition we designate the arrest of a functional act induced
by an antagonistic act, but not, as in paralysis, by suppressing totally
or in part the conditions producing the phenomenon. We have a well-
known example of it in the action of the pneumogastric nerve upon
the heart. Whenever that nerve is excited by a sufficiently powerful
stimulant, the movements of the heart cease, returning again as soon
as the excitation is withdrawn or the force of the nerve exhausted. In
this case we have produced by means of an excitant a nervous vibra-
tion, which, elaborated in certain ganglia situated in the substance of
the heart, neutralizes the action of the excito-motor cells. ‘This con-
clusive experiment, first made in 1846 by the brothers Weber,' encoun-
tered objections based, it must be confessed, upon a prejudice arising
from the systematic notions then in vogue. At that time physiology
was at a period of its history when, imbued by somewhat crude mate-
rial conceptions, it was alleged that everything could be simplified so
as to reduce every movement to a reflex act. So it was denied that
there could be found in our organism any other than sensory and motor
fibers.

We ought to add that the philosophical tendency of that time had
great force, for among those who refused to allow that the experiment
of Weber had any special importance were two of the most illustrious
names of modern physiology.?. But other acts of restraint were found
besides the inhibition of the heart, so that the opposition could no
longer be maintained, especially when it was found that in the nervous
centers themselves there occur inhibitory processes, in which, as we

shall presently see, we must look for the definite physiological basis of
thought.

One of the first explanations proposed for inhibition in the realm of
theoretical physiology was, as might have been expected, purely phys-
ical in its character. It was thought that its phenomena might be
considered as analogous to those classed under interference. You
know that the union of two sounds may produce silence, and that from
two rays of light we may derive darkness. This occurs when the
waves that theoretically constitute their material basis meet in such a
way that the summit of one wave corresponds to the hollow of another
so that they mutually neutralize each other. The beats and the rings
of Newton are phenomena of interference. Lauder Brunton,' following
the footsteps of Bernard? and of Romanes,’ tried with much skill to
bring the phenomena of inhibition into the same category as those we
have just cited. It would be very interesting to follow the learned
investigator in his defense of his doctrine, but I shall limit myself to
stating that he founded his theory upon the supposition, which appears
very probable in view of certain considerations, that in inhibition the
nervous vibrations follow two paths of unequal length, then unite in a
single one in which the parted waves again meet with opposite phases
and consequently neutralize each other. As you will observe, this
doctrine recalls at once the acoustic tubes invented by Herschel and
then successfully constructed by Quincke and Kénig.!

In short, Lauder Brunton holds that movement, sensation, inhibition,
or stimulation are not absolute, but merely relative terms. According
to him the same cell may exercise inhibitory or excito-motor functions,
according to the length of the waves of impulsion that pass to or from
it, according to the distance which these impulsions traverse and the
velocity with which they travel. The English experimenter endeavored
also to find a morphological basis for his doctrine in the two prolonga-
tions, one straight and the other spiral, with which certain nerve cells
are provided. This hypothesis is, as you see, inspired solely by phys-
ical conceptions which demand a structural form, but, however ingeni-
ous it may be, it does not account for the facts, and we now admit that
acts of inhibition are processes essentially chemical in character.

Permit me to lay some stress upon this argument, for it will afford us
an opportunity of touching upon several questions of fundamental
importance in physiological studies.

From a chemical point of view the functions of a living being may be
included in two great categories. The first embraces the destructive,
analytic, catabolic, or disintegrating acts by which the individual in

question liberates energy in the form of heat, electricity, ete.; the sec-
ond embraces synthetic, anabolic, or restorative acts by which there
becomes accumulated in the tissues under the form of explosive or
reserve materials the force necessary for the functions that develop
or reestablish the dynamical and histological losses they have suffered.

Living matter is, to use a comparison of Hering,' like a copper wire
immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, which, when conducting
an electric current, loses on the one hand a portion of its substance by
solution, on the other accumuiates an additional amount of metal.
These antagonistic functions have within our organism a close correla-
tion, being united in an intimate solidarity from which results that
dynamic and material stability that gives to a tissue its morphological
character. This solidarity has, in my opinion, among its other control-
ling conditions, a very important chemical basis.”

You know that exercise develops organs and that this fact is con-
firmed throughout the entire sphere of our functions. Thus it is that
muscles enlarge in consequence of repeated movements, that glands
increase in size when obliged to perform unusual work, that in other
terms function develops the organ through which it acts. We here
enter upon a functional circle which might in logic be called a vicious
circle, but which gives admirable results from a teleological point of
view.

In a word, while an organ develops by exerting its functions, this
very development makes it more and more capable of performing those
functions. This relation, universally recognized, finds its application
in the doctrine of evolution and helps much to explain to us those mar-
velous progressions and differentiations of structure by which amor-
phous protoplasm is transformed into a complex organism. But when
we say that an organ develops by executing its functions, or that fune-
tion makes the organ, we content ourselves with enunciating a fact
without explaining the mechanism to which it is due. Let us try,
however, to throw light on some of the conditions that determine the
above-mentioned relations between an organ and its function.

We are able to determine with considerable accuracy the stimulants
that cause an organ to act, and that these are found partly in the
environment of the organism, partly in the interstitial blastema that
surrounds the tissues, partly within the elements of the tissues. All
our activities may therefore be classed as reflex acts, pseudo-automatic
acts and automatic acts properly so called. We also know that the
processes of molecular destruction that form the chemical basis of our
functional acts are frequently followed by a corresponding and pro-
portional amount of work of restoration, but we are ignorant of the
nature of the internal impulses that cause the tissues to restore them-

selves. Now, from some of my studies, it seems to me that one may
conclude that stimulants to the nutritive activities for organic restora-
tion consist, in certain cases, at least, in the by-products, the scoriz,
the cinders that result from functional activity.

These catabolic products gradually accumulate in the tissues and
pass from thence into the blood, which, continually circulating, trans-
ports them to the glands, by which they are again worked over and
finally eliminated. It appears that it is precisely these by-products,
produced by our tissues when in activity, that give to nutritive phe-
nomena the impulse that excites to a renewal of the energy spent in
function, which leads the organ accomplishing a work to develop and
adapt itself to new demands of the individual and the environment.
In order to understand my assertion it must be remembered that the
tissues are never completely at rest; that, on the contrary, as to mate-
rial matters they are constantly changing and are being ceaselessly,
though slowly, consumed; even when they show no internal evidence of
function. Yet the by-products occurring during this apparent fune-
tional repose do not suffice to properly maintain, or rather are not
suitable for setting up, this work of reconstruction, since an inactive
organ decreases, atrophies, and may be reduced to a rudimentary
state. When, on the contrary, it remains active, it maintains itself in
nutritive equilibrium, and increases in proportion to its greater or less
functional activity. This arises, at least in part, from the fact that
the by-products of the function excite to restorative work greater in
amount than the destruction that occurred during the period of activ-
ity. In fact, if an organ that only occasionally acts does not atrophy,
it is because that during its action it establishes such a stimulation to
nutrition that it compensates not only for the losses occasioned by
activity, but also for those occurring during repose. Thus scientifie
sanction is given to a fact of daily experience, viz: that an organ is
kept in good nutritive condition by a proper alternation of work and
rest. It is also seen why increased activity of the function of an organ
leads to its hypertrophy. Increase of work produces, indeed, such an
amount of nutritive stimulation that, as a logical consequence of what
has been said, the losses that preceded the period of activity as well as
those which arise from it will not only be made good, but restored with
usury, and the organ will consequently be in a better nutritive condi-
tion than before. That is of course within physiological limits, for
excessive activity leads to those phenomena of auto-intoxication which
are collectively designated under the term fatigue.

It is ikewise certain that the chemical mechanism which I have now
briefly sketched out for you includes but one side of the question, and
that it is necessary to consider another which concerns itself with
morphological phenomena. The chemical elaborations by which tissues
develop give rise to molecular polarizations, from which results the
structure of living beings.
382 PHYSIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND MORPHOLOGY.

We may thus suppose that structural adjustments are formed keep-
ing pace with the fundamental improvement of the nervous centers
which are working and developing, such adjustments becoming mani-
fest as special modifications of the nerves.!

Besides the basis of a chemical nature of which I have spoken,
destructive and constructive phenomena owe their reciprocal solidarity
to the nervous system, which combines with each other the different
organs and tissues, and, modifying their respective attitudes, unites
them in a homogeneous and stable whole.

That the nervous system presides over destructive functions has
long been known. We know, indeed, that almost all the movements
of our organism originate from impulses that start from the motor
centers and induce modifications of form accompanied by manifesta-
tions of energy due to an increase in the destructive processes in the
contractile tissues. Thus when a motor nerve is stimulated it produces
in muscle an exaggerated chemical action that leads to a destruction
of the contractile tissue. In other terms, a motor nerve is an analytic
or catabolic nerve.

Let us consider now the processes of inhibition. We have already
stated that the fibers of the pneumogastric nerve that supply the
heart muscle, have an inhibitory function, and can not for that reason
be placed in the same category as the motor or catabolic fibers. We
will now say, on the other hand, that there are many facts that show
that inhibition is the result of an increase in the synthetic processes of
organic restoration, and hence relates to a diminution of catabolic
acts, a decrease of molecular destruction.’

In this way the energy set at liberty by impulses acting on the motor
nerves serves to increase the destructive acts in the interior of the tis-
sues, and manifests itself externally under the form of motion, heat,
electricity, ete. On the contrary, that set in motion by the inhibitory

nerves, serves to overcome the chemical affinities opposed to the syn-
thetic formation of great molecular coinplexes, and, setting up restora-
tive chemical processes, causes the diminution or cessation of functional
acts of a disintegrating chemical character.

In addition to these phenomena of inhibition, which we may term
peripheric, there are others of a central origin brought to light by the
investigations of Setchenow, Guyon, Golsy, and others. These have
shown that the nervous centers may exert a strong inhibitory action
upon reflex acts in general, and even, according to some experiments of
my own, upon the automatic activities of the medulla oblongata, This
restraining action of the nervous centers is closely connected with the
problem of the physiological basis of thought.! In fact, the inhibitory
processes oppose such a resistance to the nervous vibrations passing
through the brain that impressions are necessarily arrested for a long
time within the sphere of the sensorium, and may thus induce that
associated series of conscious phenomena that lies above the sphere of
mere sensation or motion. Besides, the restorative chemical character
of the processes of inhibition eapiains to us the phenomena of memory,
without which we would be unable to understand consciousness. The
intensity of the psychical act is therefore in direct proportion to the
force of the restraining act. It would take too long to refer, even in
passing, to the importance of inhibition in all psychical operations.
We will merely allude to the fact that education, which contributes to
form the character of the child, is valuable in proportion as it trains
the capacity for controlling the iMeniuenive impulses of human nature.

Thus it is that, starting from the arrest of the movements of the heart,
we nay, by a gradual succession of facts and deductions, finally attack
one of the most difficult, and certainly one of the highest, problems of
physiology—that of the functional basis of thought. We ean thus
prove that both the simplest acts of the vegetative life of a tissue, as
well as the most complex psychical manifestations of a superior organ-
ism, have for their essential basis chemical processes of the same nature.

But we must not boast too much over these results; for while, in the

-conerete case we have cited, chemical antagonism helps to explain the

“

relation between inhibition and movement, chemistry can not usually
reveal the modus operandi of a functional act.

From the chemical processes of our organism there are, as we have
already said in another form, effects derived of two kinds—either liber-
ation of energy in actions aittended with the disengagement of heat or
its accumulation in processes during which such disengagement does
not take place. But if we were acquainted with the innumerable reac-
tions that take place in our organism, which for the greater part are
entirely unknown to us, we would yet have to find out how the energy

developed by them is transformed into function; how, in the compli-
cated mechanism of our tissues, it comes to manifest itself in the form
of heat, electricity, muscular movement, secretion, and nervous activity.
Is not the same coal burned in the different engines? Yet how many
varied effects may be manifested by these different causes! Although
the chemical basis of their function may be the same, does not that
function remain invariable, even when the nature of the fuel consumed
in the furnace varies? Consider the immense variety of metabolisms of
animals and plants; compare that with the admirable functional unity
of these beings, and tell me if that does not suffice to show how slight
is the importance of chemical work in the development of a special
function.

All this appears to me to be forgotten by those who, impelled by that
enthusiasm for system now so much in vogue, see in every organic fune-
tion a chemical fact and nothing else. We, on the contrary, recognize
truly that chemical action is the cause of the energy displayed: but we
can not forget that function is self-determined, transforming that energy
and presenting it under an infinite number of manifestations.

The admirable researches of Raoul Pictet! show clearly the share
that in functional acts ought to be ascribed to chemical reactions and
that which should be given to the organization ef the tissues. This
experimenter has recently shown that a very low temperature—100°
below zero—stops all chemical reaction, no matter what; even sulphuric
acid and nitric acid no longer combine with soda, potash, and ammonia. —
These experiments show that at absolute zero heterogeneous bodies no
longer react upon each other, whatever may be their affinities, for the

reason, according to Pictet, that they have attained the limit of cohe-
sion, and that no sufficient one brings the atoms near enough to each
other to get them within the sphere of each other’s activity. If, on the
other hand, we keep living things in a refrigerating apparatus for a
long time, it may be observed that after thawing they again resume
their functions in an absolutely normal manner. Pictet thus obtains ¢
complete restoration of the manifestations of life in bacilli and seeds
kept at 200° below zero. Vibratile cilia that have supported a tempera-
ture of 90° and fish that have been so frozen as to form a solid mass
with the ice in which they are embedded and have become as brittle as
glass may also be recalled to life.

These experiments are of great importance, inasmuch as they demon-
strate that an arrest of chemical activity in the tissues does not destroy
the potential conditions of life, and that the latter finds the basis for its
continuity rather in the organization of the body, that is in its structural
mechanism. To use a Somewhat crude illustration, the usual relation
of chemistry to the functional aCLvaRy, of a living being is like that of

coal to the work performed by a steam engine. By cooling the animal
we may extinguish the fire in the furnace; its functions are suspended,
but the mechanism that causes it to move is not, after all, destroyed,
for if we again heat the organism which we have been cooling it will
behave as the engine does when we relight its fire; the being on
which we are experimenting will again resume its movements. “If we
could,” says Pictet,' “‘create an organized structure quite complete,
but dead, physicochemical conditions would be sufficient to develop all
the phenomena of vegetable life. Let us at once admit,” he continues,
“that psychic phenomena could never be produced nor explained by
the simple movement of organized matter.” It is a strange fact that
diastases and the poisons known as ptomaines, unlike organized matter,
appear to be much injured by great cold and lose their specific activities.
Thus low temperatures effect a remarkable distinction between microbes
and diastases, marking clearly the difference between chemical actions
under the influence of organization and those not so controlled.

Let us further observe how processes which in the interior of living
tissues constitute the chemical basis of function, likewise occur exter-
nally in reactions which have their origin in life as well as in dead tis-
sues. These are processes that do not always lead to exactly similar
chemical results, but which have a similar general catabolic character
by which the very complex organic molecule, by means of oxidation or
successive divisions, by hydration or reduction, mounts the scale of
organic compounds and becomes by degrees more and more simple.

The difference lies in this, that in living beings the kinetic effect
resulting from chemical affinity manifests itself in a thousand diverse
activities, while in dead tissues it is transformed almost wholly into
heat, other forms of movement, more particularly those of a fune-
tional character, being totally arrested.

This occurs because in dead tissues catabolic action likewise attacks
the structural mechanism, and this makes the working of the organic
machine impossible, while in the living organism the products that
by their decomposition induce functions are, under normal conditions,
almost wholly those inclosed within differentiated protoplasms, and if
Sometimes this activity is also exercised upon the tissues, they are
rapidly and fully restored by metabolic processes.

In short we ought to again recall that the chemistry of the tissues
not only supplies fuel for the mechanical substratum of our functions,
but is also used in constructing and restoring the organism. These
assimilating processes are controlled by the special elective attitudes
of each of the elements, and if they also have a chemical basis they
yet find their determining cause in a long history of external reactions
and internal adaptations by which is explained the gradual develop-
ment of living beings and the place which an organism has fixed for
itself in the hierarchy of organic forms.

But here we enter the very obscure domain of the origin and develop-
ment of life. You know how much the determining causes of heredity
and evolution have been discussed, and how the Darwinian laws,
although remaining fundamentally the same, have been profoundly
modified as far as regards the conditions of their development. While,
for example, it would seem that we must not admit the hereditary
transmission of acquired characters in animals, the study of the
development of plants tends to change our too absolute ideas as to
the relations between autogeny and phylogeny and to give to evolution
a periodic character established by heredity,' and by the influence of
time and the environment.

At all events it is always organization, independently of the causes
by which it was or is determined, that fixes and molds the activities
of an organism, although, in the causal succession of phenomena,
functional differentiations precede morphological differentiations, and
are sometimes manifested in a tissue whose details can not be shown by
our present means of investigation. Besides, even the so-called amor-
phous protoplasm is developed little by little into a very complex
whole, and it is even thought that it may be considered as a colony of
microorganisms.”

The cell, according to this theory, loses its fundamental character of
morphological unity and is supposed to be made up, like a higher
organism, of a multitude of very much smaller units that probably
differ from each other. Finally let us, with these, go beyond the world
actually cognizable by the senses, let us imagine an internal weft made
up of unities still more minute and more simple that bear the same
relation to organized forms as molecules do to inorganic matter. The
structure of these elements and the morphological relations that unite
them ought not, however, to be considered as the bed through which
flows the torrent of life, but as the mechanism which elaborates and
develops its manifestations.

We know, besides, that the morphological element has no stable
basis, and that it even becomes modified according to the various fune-
tions it has to perform. Thus it is that the anatomical changes of an
element may sometimes inform us as to the condition of its nutrition,
whether it has been in action or remained long at rest, and whether
there are developing within it those mysterious processes by which a
cell prepares for reproduction. From all this it clearly results that by
the study of conditions and of the morphological modifications that
determine, accompany, or follow a functional act, much more than by
chemical researches, we can perhaps some day explain many a weighty
problem of physiology, if not those fundamental processes character

scientifique, T. LII, page 649, 1893.

istic of a living being by which energy is accumulated and manifested,
transformed and given its special developments. For these morpho-
logical facts express, as we have already said, elective activities slowly
accumulated in the infinite past which, associating themselves with the
present chemical activities, give results that are unexpected in propor-
tion as we are ignorant of the intimate nature of the organization.

Thus Pfeffer,' after having observed that active bavilli are attracted
by peptone, by asparagine, by chloride of sodium, in short by many
substances, while the zoospores of ferns are attracted by malic acid, and
those of mosses by sugar of milk, and that the trillionth part of a milli-
gram is sufficient to produce that attraction, grants that the observer
might be led to conclude that there was here an act of volition rather
than a simple chemical phenomenon. Because of this and of many other
observations of a similar character, some authors regard the elective
action of molecular organisms as the rudimentary expression of tastes
and proclivities as well as the origin of certain idiosynerasies and of
the more or less localized action of certain poisons, so that even in the
most simple phenomena of the nutritive activity of a tissue we encounter
a problem of selection indissolubly bound up with that of thought, the
origin of which is probably closely connected with that of life.

To this may be added that not only do the chemical actions that
occur in an organism have a peculiar quality; the conditions under
which they occur are also special and peculiar to living beings—that is
to say, to organization and its products. We can indeed reproduce some
of these chemical processes that occur in the weft of our tissues, but to
obtaim similar results we are obliged to employ very strong electric eur-
rents or reagents of such power that they would destroy any organisin,
no matter what. In organized beings, on the contrary, these effects
are obtained at a temperature equal to or but a little above that of the
environment, at ordinary atmospheric pressure, under the influence of
currents so slight as to be hardly demonstrable, and by using chemical
affinities of the most feeble power.

What we have said hitherto, while indicating the limits of physiolog-
ical chemistry, detracts in po way from its great and real importance.
It is sufficient to mention the new spheres for investigation now open-
ing—the metabolism of the tissues, the action of the blood glands, and of
the sympathetic nerve, auto-intoxication and imimunity—to show how
vast is the field of practical action open to chemical research. It gives us
occasion to note how organisms in their manifold adaptations use these
affinities according to their varied conditions of existence, and how the
chemical forces adapt themselves to the production of colors, to the
distillation of perfumes, to the accumulation of substances, which, like
explosives, amass in small volume a large amount of virtual energy; to
the elaboration or materials of all kinds for the mechanical needs of

the organism, for the nutritive necessities of life, for the wsthetic exi-
gencies of sex. In all this chemistry has an immense field of fruitful

research before it, and we shall find in the phenomena of living beings
the desired instructions for making life easier, for improving and defend.
ing it, for rendering it sufficiently eroduchive to permit us to practice
that social altruism that nature herself now prevents us from attaining.
But this field is now and will remain more practical than theoretical,
more utilitarian than scientific, because, even if the complicated proc-
esses going on within the crucibles of life were well known to all, life
itself would always remain for us unknown and impenetrable. But
this ought not to deter us; we shall keep on trying and testing, accu-
mulating facts, pushing as far as possible our analytical researches,
convinced that we should be content to seek truth without acquiring
the whole of it.

As you see, we are to-day already quite far from the systems in vogue
a few years ago, and, knowin g more, we realize more clearly how slight
is the scope of our engetet ge; for with increased knowledge comes an
enlargement of our encepton of the complexity of the phenomena of
life; the horizon of the unknown widens out in vast relative propor-
tions. For this reason permit me to believe that the moment is not
yet at hand when the facts developed within the living organism can
receive an astronomic sanction, and let me recall to you what was said
by Gaiileo, the founder of the experimental method, the regenerator
of natural philosophy: “I have always held him extremely rash who
attempts to measure by human capacity all that nature can and will
do, since there is not, on the contrary, a single effect in nature, how-
ever small it may be, that can be entirely understood by the most pen-
etrating intelligence. This idle presumption of wishing to understand
everything must necessarily arise from never having understood any-
thing; for if he had ever applied himself to perfectly understand any
one thing, and had really appreciated what constitutes knowledge, he
would know that in the infinity of other conclusions he does not under-
stand one.”!

We ought, when experimenting, to always have these words in mind;
for if it is true that we ought to keep our attention firmly fixed upon a
fact until we have acquired a clear and limpid perception of it, it is
none the less so that before interpreting it we ought to consider its
entire surroundings, remembering that itis not isolated, but, on the con-
trary, a simple facet, infinitely small, of a preeminently complex whole.
Let us not imitate the presumptuous physiologists that achieve success
by the apparent clearness of their explanations, giving the pupil the
agreeable illusion that he can learn much, quickly, and without fatigue.
This, unfortunately, is a too general tendency, and we often see how, in
their desire to warp the phenomena of life to the limits of their own

Westies caunleny Dalene nei aan massimi sistemi aa aaa Fi irenze, 1812 , vol.

PHYSIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, AND MORPHOLOGY. 389

intelligence, they construct systems much more ingenious than vera-
cious, and then display them before a public that only applauds readily
constructed automata presented to it as living beings. I must confess
that I always look with extreme distrust upon systems. I can not for-
get that if they have a didactic importance they never correspond
exactly to the truth, especially in what concerns living beings, so com-
plex in their great simplicity. Technical necessities often oblige us to
separate functional elements from each other; but we then ought to
seek to reunite them, because it is from their union that springs that
resultant complex of reciprocal influences that constitutes a living
organism. Thus to the cool, impartial, and sagacious work of the
experimenter the physiologist must bring the assistance of a high
philosophical culture and a certain breadth of intuition and imagina-
tion, that faculty which Tyndall' lauds as one of the most powerful
aids to human progress. ‘ Without imagination,” says he, ‘“‘ we could
not make a step beyond the animal world; we could hardly reach its
confines. I do not here allude to that irregular power that plays
capriciously with facts, but to that orderly, disciplined capacity whose
only function is to create the ideas imperiously demanded by the
intellect.”

Certainly, looked at in this way, the goal of physiology is very diffi-
cult to reach, and I should be the last to remind you of it, being myself
unequal to the task. But inability to attain an ideal ought not to pre-
vent you from having it constantly before your eyes, from clinging to
and proclaiming it, in hopes that others with greater powers than your-
self may reach it. High ambitions are allowed to all, provided that
they are sincere and disinterested, and I do not think that doubt can
be entertained of the sincerity of a lover of physiology, particularly in
this age of sharp struggle for material existence.

THE WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS}!

By EK. Ae MAREY
Member of the Institute of ree

Physiology has for its domain all organized nature. It seeks to pene-
trate the secret of life in all beings. It is the guide of natural history,
which ought not only to describe the forms of animals and of plants,
but also to ascertain the kind of life and the functions peculiar to each
species.

The older naturalists understood that their science had this scope;
the zoologists, for example, when they described the species of animals,
noted at the same time the habitat, method of locomotion, kind of food,
and manner of reproduction of each.

This way of studying and teaching the natural sciences was kept up
so long as people were content to observe the exterior of animals and
the external manifestations of their life; but, in proportion as the
anatomy of living beings was more profoundly studied, the naturalist’s
task became harder; for a knowledge of the conform: an of the differ-
ent organs awakened a desire to understand the functions of each.
From this moment a division of labor became necessary. Those who
applied themselves more especially to the anatomical deseription of
organized beings were called naturalists and those who specially
studied the functions of life physiologists.

If such a separation were permanent, if the two parallel sciences
were not united at certain points, both would suffer. Zoology would
then be only a dry catalogue of animal forms whose meaning would be
unexplained, while physiology, confined to laboratories and reduced to
experimentation upon mutilated animals, would teach us less how these
animals live than how to make them die.

Is it not possible to combine these natural sciences without hindering
the development necessary for each? I wish to show you that this ean
sometimes be done and that it affords us the highest intellectual satis-
faction, that of comprehending the marvelous harmonies of living

nature. In order to unite zoology and physiology it is necessary that
these two sciences should have methods in common and should apply
them under the same circumstances, which should neither be in the
gallery of the zoologist nor in the laboratory of the vivisector.

During our epoch the natural sciences have made such progress as has
quite transformed them. The physiologists of to-day use new methods
and instruments of precision which enable them to study the phenomena
of life with an exactitude formerly obtained only by physicists. This
apparatus, first intended to be used in vivisection, is undergoing a grad-
ual change and is tending to become applicable for use upon animals
and to man himself while in perfect health and in the exercise of their
normal functions.

On their side the zoologists, in addition to the menageries in which
they bring together living animals of all kinds and all countries, have
found, in the employment of the aquarium and in the establishment of
maritime zoological stations, the means of observing in its natural
surroundings the fauna of the sea and even that of fresh water. The
moment seems to have arrived when the natural sciences may be made
to profit by these two kinds of progress, and when we may direct
toward a common end efforts too long divergent.

It is with this intention that the Physiological Station was estab-.
lished.

In order to show the resources of this institution and the develop-
ments it ought to have, permit me to first recount the evolution of the
schemes of investigation for the application of which it was established.

JE

Daughter of anatomy, physiology was at first obliged to use the
scalpel. It was while dissecting living animals that Asellius, Harvey,
Charles Bell, and so many others made their grand discoveries. But
the number of phenomena accessible to pure observation is necessa-
rily limited, so physiologists had to borrow from the physicists their
methods and their instruments in order to discover new facts. Thus
the mercurial manometer was used by Magendie to measure the pressure
of the blood at the different points of the vascular system; the deli-
cate thermometers of Walferdin enabled Claude Bernard to show the
unequal distribution of temperature in the organism, to recognize the
effect which nerves have upon these variations of temperature, and to
establish the foundations of a general theory of vasomotor nerves.
M. Pasteur himself, whose discoveries have given a new impetus to
physiology and medicine, would never have been able to support his
doctrines by such weight of evidence had he not conceived and created
new methods and appliances.

For many long years I have devoted my time to developing and per-
fecting physiological apparatus. Struck with the importance of move-
ment in most of the functions of life, 1 wished to make it possible to

register and measure this fugitive phenomenon, and for that purpose I
had recourse to the tracing apparatus which occupies to-day an impor-
tant place in our laboratories. Thus M. Frangois-Franck, who continues
with so much talent my teaching at the College of France, makes much
use of the graphic method. Those of you who follow his work have
often seen him examine at the same time upon the same animal, seven
or eight different vital movements, registering them by tracings placed
one above the other so as to make apparent the reciprocal relations of
all the phenomena that occur during the course of an experiment.

Fig. 1, Pl. XLVI, taken from the beautiful memoir of M. Franck upon
the action of digitalin, isan example of these multiple registrations. The
five tracings shown upon this plate are, from above downward, as fol-
lows: First, that of a mercurial manometer indicating the pressure of
the blood in the carotid artery; second, that of another manometer
showing the variation of pressure in the pulmonary artery; third, that
of a sphygmoscope giving the pulsations of the pulmonary artery;
fourth, that of another giving the carotid pulse; fifth, the lower line,
giving, in seconds, the time occupied by the experiment. Reference lines
traced upon this sheet show the effects produced at the same moment
in the four tracings by a stimulus that causes a tetanus of the heart.
A simple inspection of this figure teaches us all the variations that
tetanus of the heart produces in the general and in the pulmonary
circulation with a precision that the most attentive observation could
not attain.

In a special work! I have described most of the tracing instruments,
paying special attention to those which do not require preliminary
vivisections, but record the action of organs by their exterior manifes-
tations. We can thus, in both man and other animals, record the pul-
sations of the heart and arteries, the respiratory movements of the
thorax and of the abdomen, the phases in the displacement of respired
air, the contractions of the muscles, with the various degrees of force
which they develop, the variations of caliber occurring in small vessels,
etc. Modern physiologists pay particular attention to perfecting and
multiplying these apparatus already so widely applied and of a much
greater range of application than had at first appeared possible.

In fact this apparatus not only records the phenomena for which it
was directly invented, but permits us to ascertain indirectly other facts.
Thus the:myograph, invented at first for recording the movement
of muscles, makes known indirectly the velocity of the transmission of
force in the motor and sensitive nerves, in the columns of the spinal
cord, and even in the different layers of the cortex of the brain.

For the nervous acts of organic life, such as the contraction and
relaxation of vessels, of which we do not even have any conscious
knowledge, physiologists also possess a veritable myograph in the
graphic apparatus that records the changes of volume of organs.

1La Méthode graphique: Paris, G. Masson, 1885.
394 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

Many improvements have been made in this apparatus during recent
years. Quite recently two pupils of M. Francois-Franck, MM. Hallion
and Comte, have conceived a small instrument very simple and easy
of application. On introducing a finger between two air-cushions con-
nected with a graphic apparatus it is seen that this finger constantly
changes its volume, swells when its vessels dilate and diminishes as
they contract. Any pain felt by the subject under experiment, a simple
sensation of heat or cold, any emotion, even if slight, is soon followed
by notable contraction of the vessels of the finger; that is to say, by a
lowering of the curve that is traced. (See fig. 2, Pl. XLVI.)

We even find that in certain maladies an excitation not perceived by
the subject may give rise to a vascular contraction, which shows that
the seat of production of the vascular reflex is different from that of
conscious sensation.

The possibility of transmitting to considerable distances by means of
air tubes the movements it is desired to record has much enlarged the
field of application of the graphic method.

Thus we may in the case of a running man or a galloping horse note
the suecession of footfalls or the cadence of the hoofs. In a flying bird
we may record the various phases of the action of its muscles, the trajec-
tory of a point of its wing, and the reactions thus effected upon the mass
of its body. But these experiments, although very carefully made, give
but a partial knowledge of the complicated acts of animal locomotion.
Another method, more prompt and more simple, records these move-
ments in a much more perfect manner. This is chrono-photography.

I had the honor two years ago to make known to you the origin and
developments of this method. Since then I have improved it and
applied it to the study of the most varied phenomena. All these appli-
cations have been set forth in a little volume recently published.' It
will be sufficient to say that besides the phenomena of physics and
mechanies, in which chrono-photography does most valuable service,
this method enables us to analyze the kind of locomotion used by most
species of animals, mammals, reptiles, birds, insects, fishes,etc. It may
even be used to register the movement of microscopic creatures.

Chrono-photography may therefore be considered as the most perfect
form of the graphie method. It is especially important when we have
to deal with very extensive or complicated movements, or, indeed;
when a movement has not sufficient force to actuate the tracer of an
instrument.

A record of the mechanical forces developed by animals may be
obtained by other apparatus, such as dynamographs, some of which
measure efforts of traction, others efforts of pressure, and these, by the
way, must, like balances, be more or less strongly constructed according
to the amount of force to be applied.

In order to give a complete idea of the physiological apparatus we
should also cite the instruments used to measure the electric currents

1Le Mouvement, Paris, G. Masson, 1894,

WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 395

by which nerves and muscles are stimulated, or to determine the char-
acteristics of the electricity generated by animals. The numerous
improvements introduced by M. d’Arsonyal in the determination of tem-
peratures and the measurement of the calories generated by an ani-
mal according to its height, species, and the physiological conditions
in which it is placed, should be here mentioned.

All these apparatus also tend to become registers, and this makes
their indications comparable with each other and permits us to assemble
ina single graphic table the curves of all sorts of phenomena. All
tend likewise to be applicable to man and to animals under normal con-
ditions without disturbing in any way the functions they are intended
to investigate.

The zoologist, then, as well as the experimental physiologist, may
investigate in different species of alimals the variation of function in
an organ corresponding to its variation of form. It is here, as I have
before said, that union may be effected between the two sciences, long
separated from each other.

Il.

Physiologists and naturalists ought to seek not only unity of method,
but also a favorable field for their joint investigations. The classical
physiological laboratory is not well adapted to anything but vivisee-
tions, while space, open air, and unobstructed light are indispensable
for the study of living creatures. It often happens that it is difficult
to secure all the conditions necessary; it is hardly possible to study
the physiology of insects except in the country; marine animals must
be studied at some maritime station with all the necessary instruments.

It is, however, possible to set up near cities an experimental station
fulfilling the principal conditions just noted. The Physiological Station
is the first establishment of this kind; it already affords many resources
not elsewhere found; and is, besides, susceptible of important devel-
opments that may be made from time to time as the need for them is
felt. But in bringing this establishment to its present state many diffi-
culties were encountered which it may be useful to briefly consider.

In 1864, at the time when the graphic method of recording certain
physiological phenomena seemed sufficiently developed to permit an
analysis of the different kinds of movements, I attempted to use it for
determining the mechanism of locomotion in different species of ani-
mals. The movement of the wings of insects was quite easy to catch,
and besides, the theory of this kind of locomotion had been established
by a true synthesis, using artificial apparatus, in which a motion of
translation was effected by agitating mechanical wings. This first sue-
cess made me think that the problem of the flight of birds, the details of
which almost completely elude direct observation, might be elucidated
by the same method, and that tame birds to which suitable apparatus
had been fitted would, when flying in an inclosed space, record the move-
396 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

ments of their own wings, together with the reactions which such
movements produced upon their own bodies.

An artist’s studio, No. 14 rue de ’Ancienne Comédie, furnished me
the large room necessary for my purpose. This studio, 15 meters long
by 12 wide and 8 high, was well lighted. It was easy to set up within
it the workbench of a mechanic, cages for animals, and giass cases
for the instruments, already so numerous, required for physiological
researches. In this way, an old theater which had accommodated the
Comédie Frangaise in its early days, and was afterwards the studio in
which Horace Vernet painted his great heroic pictures, became in turn
a Shelter for science, and was the first laboratory established by private
enterprise for physiological experimentation.

Many advantages were already combined in this first establishment.
They were certainly superior to those which I found later at the College
of France when I entered it as professor. Much time is saved if the
construction of the instruments, together with the incessant modifica-
tions of them required by this kind of experimentation, can be super-
vised in the same apartment in which the experiments themselves are
conducted. ;

With carefully tamed buzzards, with pigeons, and with ducks, I
succeeded in registering the movements of flight, the frequency and
character of the wing strokes, the contraction of the muscles, and the
reactions produced upon the body of the bird.

This study conducted me to that of the resistance of the air, which
made it necessary to construct a whirling table 6 meters in diameter, in
order to determine the pressure of air on different surfaces for different
velocities of rotation. .

This apparatus, also supplied with special registers, gives us an
opportunity of analyzing the movements of walking in man, and was
used in the beautiful experiments of my pupil and lamented friend,
G. Carlet.

As might have been expected, the space was soon found insufficient
for studying the locomotion of man. On a circular path 20 meters at
most in diameter it was impossible to walk otherwise than slowly,
incessantly hampered by the curve of the circle. Open roads were
necessary for the study of walking and running, and horizontal or vari-
ously inclined footways were required for the determination, by means
of the portable odograph, of the influences that cause variations in the
xadence and length of steps. I often had to go far in order to find all
the necessary conditions.

Later, attempting to determine the best means of utilizing the mus-
cular force of man and animals, | had to compare the amount of work
expended in the traction of carriages, both with rigid and slightly elas-
tic traces, and upon different kinds of ground. In the neighborhood of
the grounds of the Luxembourg there were certain avenues paved in
different ways. I here experimented with carriages drawn at different
WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 397

velocities, following them and carrying the registering apparatus, sur-
rounded by an importunate crowd of curious people.

At another time, wishing to ascertain the effect which gymnastic train-
ing has upon the movements of the heart and on respiration, | had to
transport my apparatus to the Ecole de Joinville, to which M. Hillairet
kindly offered me access.

Finally, in order to determine the succession of the movements of the
horse, I had to go to the riding schools of Paris to find the means of
making the necessary experiments.

The annoyance of shifting about so continually was but slight as com-
pared with the grave disadvantages of carrying long distances delicate
instruments whose slightest derangement made the journey useless.
From that time I had but one desire, that of finding a spacious ground
where I might unite a workshop, a laboratory, and an experimental field.
I soon thought that my wishes were about to be realized.

In 1878, the Universal Exposition had just been closed, and General
Farre, then minister of war, who was interested in my experiments on
the gaits of men and horses, offered to place at my disposal some ground
in the Champ de Mars which was in a few months to be turned over to
the war department. This was the large space where now stands the
Kiffel Tower. An officer of engineers examined the place and at the
end of a few weeks sent me a plan showing a perfectly level circular
track 500 meters in circumference, passing through the groups of trees
there planted, and touching the edges of the two lakes. At certain
times of the day this track was to be given up to experiments. I yet
have this plan which gave me a certain transitory joy. In a few weeks
it happened that by a certain arrangement between the General Goy-
ernment and the city the grounds were assigned to the latter and I
thought for a time that all was lost.

But the municipal council of Paris, which has given so many proofs
of its interest in science, was soon to gratify my wishes beyond my
hopes.

Upon the motion of its president, M. de Hérédia, the municipal coun-
cil placed at my disposition a spacious ground at the Pare des Princes,
and voted an annual allowance of 12,000 francs to maintain the new
establishment. The General Government on its part, upon the request
of M. Jules Ferry, granted the sum necessary for the construction of the
buildings. Finaliy, to add to these resources, I transferred to the new
locality the laboratory for advanced studies which I had been conduet-
ing at the College of France, as well as all the apparatus and instru-
ments that [ had made during more than twenty years.

Such was the origin of the Physiological Station, which is already
known to many of you. Those who may do me the honor to visit it
will not tind there monumental constructions, but slight buildings
which during the summer season admit of the employment of a con-
siderable number of workers and are arranged for all sorts of studies.
398 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

I have there been able to resume, under new and quite exact condi-
tions, my studies of the flight of birds, experimenting upon a great
number of different species. By means of chrono-photography it has
been possible to obtain a series of the successive phases of a wing
stroke in the form of instantaneous photographs, as many as one hun-
dred per second being recently obtained. Thus, in a wing stroke so
rapid that the eye can not follow it, the apparatus shows with perfect
precision more than twenty successive phases, passing from one to
another by almost insensible transitions.

The gaits of the horse have been determined, not only as regards
the successive beats of the feet, but in a complete manner; that is to
say, by fixing the entire series of actions and reactions that are involved.

The great circular and perfectly level track permits us to analyze the
walking and running paces of man as well as his various physical exer-
cises, and to determine the conditions most favorable to the proper
utilization of muscular force. These studies have been conducted with
regard to their practical application, either for the amelioration of the
condition of the soldier or for the improvement of the methods of phys-
ical education. In these researches i have been greatly aided by the
officers of the army and by my former assistant, M. Demeny, who, up
to recent years, performed his duties with much skill.

I would not speak of the experiments made at the Physiological Sta-
tion on a great many physical and mechanical phenomena, such as the
fall of bodies, the resistance of the air, the vibrations of strings, the
movement of liquids, the measurement of forees and of work, etc.,
were it not that these studies are intimately connected with the physi-
ology of movement.

In fact, in the locomotion of man and of terrestrial animals the me-
chanical actions of the muscles consist in displacing the center of gray-
ity of the body, either by lifting its weight or by imparting to it a
movement of translation. From these actions in various directions we
can deduce the amount of work expended. In aerial locomotion the
action of the muscles communicates a similar amount of movement,
both to the body of the animal and to the mass of air struck by the
wings. ‘The same division occurs in different kinds of locomotion upon
the ground and in the water. ;

The experiments already made at the Physiological Station have
given the approximate value of the work expended in the different
kinds of locomotion. These determinations have been checked by two
different methods; on the one hand, by measuring the forces and the
quantities of movement by means of registering dynamometers; on the
other, by estimating the forces acting at each moment by the accelera-
tion imparted to the mass of the body.! The results derived from these
two sources show variations of but slight importance, that will cer-
tainly disappear when the methods of analyzing movements and forces
shall be perfected,

WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. i)

At any rate these experiments have clearly shown that muscular
forces behave in their final result like other mechanical forces.
New problems are now placed before us; let us examine them.

TET;

The analysis of the movements of man and animals may be made
from different points of view. It is, indeed, not sufficient to determine
the external characters of the movement; the important matter is to
ascertain the mechanism by which that movement is effected and to
distinguish the part played by the different portions of the locomotor
apparatus, muscles, articular surfaces, and osseous radii.

To adapt it for these different researches chrono-photography may be
employed in different ways,' sometimes using a movable plate and some-
times a fixed plate.

When it is wished to record the movements as a whole, it is necessary
to use chrono-photography on a movable plate, for it gives a series of
entire images of the subject in action. Thus Pl. XLVII, which shows
seven different attitudes of a person taking a step in walking, gives the
necessary information concerning the velocity and the extent of the
displacements of the body and the limbs as well as the state of eon-
traction or relaxation of certain muscles shown in relief under the skin.
But in order to be well understood these independent images should be
placed in their relative positions, and this is done by means of a series
of successive tracings, examples of which will shortly be given.

This laborious and delicate operation makes the analysis of move-
ment a long process; this may, however, be shortened in certain cases.
It was just because I wished to get, at a single exposure, a photo-
graphic outline of a movement that I conceived the idea of chrono-
photography upon a fixed plate. With this method it is true the
images of a moving man or an animal are reduced to a few brilliant
points and lines, but this is generally sufficient to mark the action of
the limbs in the different gaits.

It is not only in locomotion properly so called that movements occur
that are of scientific interest; mastication, respiration, speech, expres-
sion of the countenance, partial movements of the limbs, hands, or feet
are of no less interest.

Suppose, for example, that it is desired to ascertain the movements
of the lower jaw by chrono-photography on a fixed plate.

The teeth of the lower jaw, first well wiped, are placed in one of
those metallic molds full of wax, which dentists use for taking impres-
sions. Upon this solid base there is fixed a bright metallic rod (fig. 1,
Pl. XLVIII), whose angular curvature exactly follows that of the lower
jaw. This rod, placed outside of the jaw, shows clearly upon a small
piece of velvet that forms for it a dark background (fig. 2, Pl. XLVIII).

1See Le Mouvement, Chapters IV and VII.
400 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

If a series of successive photographs is taken upon a fixed plate
during the act of opening or closing the mouth, the figure thus
obtained gives all the positions successively occupied by the bright
rod, and consequently all the displacements of the lower jaw itself.
Now it will be seen that, by reason of the sliding of the condyles of the
jaw in the glenoid cavities, the center of movement is found very low
upon the ascending ramus near the angle (fig. 3, Pl. XUVITI).

In movements of mastication this line takes different positions
according as we chew upon the incisor or upon the molar teeth. It has
still other movements during speech or in displacement of the chin
either forward or backward (fig. 4, Pl. XLVITT).

In these experiments chrono-photography gives us a true sketch of
the movements, and as the length of the bright rod is exactly equal to
that of the lower jaw its end traces out exactly the form of that part
of the glenoid surface upon which the condyle slides. This experiment
already shows us the necessary interdependence between the forms of
organs and the forms of movements. It would be curious to follow out
in a series of animal species this anatomo-physiological parallel.

It should be noted that these experiments were made under very
simple conditions and that it was not necessary to use the chrono-
photographie apparatus.

In this case it was of but little importance to find the velocity and
phases of movement of the lower jaw; it was only desired to determine
the successive positions of the jaw at the different degrees of opening
the mouth, a perfect equality in the intervals of time separating the
different images being unnecessary. Besides, these experiments were
made in winter, with a diffused and quite feeble light, a long exposure
(about one-fourth of a second) being necessary. The procedure was
as follows:

An ordinary photographic apparatus provided with a pneumatic shut-
ter was trained upon the subject of experiment. This subject having
his head firmly supported from behind so as to fix it, opened his mouth
at several successive degrees of wideness, stopping an instant after
ach, so that a photograph might be taken. The figure thus obtained
differs in no respect from that which the chrono-photographie apparatus
might have given, except that the intervals separating two successive
images are arbitrary.

When it is wished to determine the trajectory of a point, an ordinary
photographic apparatus is also sufficient. In this case the shutter is
held open during the entire movement, and if the point is brilliant and
shown upon a dark background it traces its trajectory in the form of a
continuous line. It is in this manner that I was able to determine the
character of the movement of the atlas upon the axis, according to the
trajectory made by a brilliant point fixed upon the oeciput.

The movements of the ribs during respiration are determined in a
similar manner. These movements are very complex because of the

eurvature of the ribs, the unequal flexibility of their cartilages, and
their multiple articulations both with the bodies and transverse proc-
esses. of the vertebre and with the sternum and costal cartilages.
Without points of reference observation of the movements of the ribs
was absolutely impossible; the nature of these displacements has there-
fore been heretofore determined according to certain theoretical con-
siderations. Experimentation gives, on the contrary, very exact results.

A series of small, black rods (fig. 1, plate X LIX) presses loosely upon
the walls of the chest, each resting upon a rib by one of its extremities
and bearing near this point avery brilliant pearl. An ordinary photo-
graphic apparatus is turned toward the subject of experiment, who,
strongly illuminated, is placed before a black background. If the
exposure lasts during the entire respiratory movement we obtain fig. 1,
in which each of the brilliant pearls has traced the movement of the
subjacent rib. At the first glance it is seen that each rib has its own
special movement.

This is not the place to analyze the mechanism of this movement. I
may say, however, that among the divers opinions which have been
held by authors that of Chabry accords the best with the results of the
experiments.

If it is required to know the nature of the movement of the anterior
wall of the chest, we apply upon that wall the series of rods and obtain
the trajectory of each of the points of that wall from the epigastrium to
the superior part of the sternum. We then see that the epigastrium
has but a slight upward movement, while the sternum moves obliquely
upward and forward.

Similar researches repeated upon different species of animals would
doubtless give interesting results as to the comparative physiology of
respiration considered from a mechanical point of view.

Another very important study is that of respiratory types. It has
been supposed that women breathe especially by means of the upper
part of the thorax (superior costal type), and men by the diaphragm
(abdominal type). Hutchinson has shown these two types by tracing
on a wall the silhouette of a man and that of a woman in the two
extreme states of inspiration and expiration. But the hand has not
time to trace the profile of the thorax and of the abdomen during the
few instants in which inspiration reaches its extreme limits; besides, if
the subject stops his respiratory movements a moment, nothing proves
that the thorax and the abdomen keep the respective positions which
they had in normal respiration.

Photography replaces with advantage the tracing of the silhouettes.
An ordinary apparatus provided with a pneumatic shutter is trained
upon the subject. <A picture is taken during inspiration, another dur-
ing expiration, and we thus obtain a double contour for all parts of the
trunk displaced. We thus show that in a woman without a corset
respiration occurs as it does in a man—that is to say, that the thorax
and the abdomen both take part in it.

402 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

Not only does chrono-photography afford a means of studying the
kinematics of movements, it also furnishes an indication of the work
performed in certain muscular acts.

A distinguished engineer, M. Frémont, has just made at the physio-
logical station a study of the work performed in hammering iron upon
an anvil. On a movable film M. Frémont took the series of attitudes
assumed by the blacksmith in the successive movements given to the
hammer.' By chrono-photography on a fixed plate there was shown
the trajectory of the hammer and its successive positions at definite
instants, the intervals between which weremeasured by a chronographie
dial,

By such a figure we can estimate the forces acting upon the mass of
the hammer at each instant by means of the acceleration given to that
mass. We also obtain a measure of the work, since it shows the
velocity of the hammer at the moment it is about to strike the iron.

In most physiological acts forces and work should be measured by
another method—that is to say, by the dynamograph. I have described
under the name of dynamographs certain instruments that show the
forces of pressure or traction applied to them by means of astylus that
traces the curve of variations of these forces.2 I have also shown how
the results obtained from these instruments may be synchronized with
those obtained from chrono-photography, so that we may know at each
phase of a footfall, for example, what force the foot exerts upon the soil
ina vertical direction. If a traction dynamograph indicates the force
developed by the same act, we may by combining these different data
obtain all the information necessary to understand the mechanism of
locomotion in different animals.

The number of experiments necessary may seem to you excessive,
but the invention of methods, the care required to secure their preci-
sion, their first application to the analysis of movements and to the
measure of forces constituted the most arduous part of the task.
Already our records accumulate; the field of possible comparisons
enlarges every day, and at the same time the interest in anatomo-
physiological comparisons increases. I wish to give you some examples
of these comparisons.

LVS:

If we wish to study locomotion in different types of mammals so as
to elucidate the variety of their forms by the special movements char-
acteristic of each we must first ascertain all the anatomical and physi-
ological elements necessary for such a comparison.

Drawings and plates will not suffice as anatomical material. It is

anatomists, I have been able to collect a portion of the specimens nec-
essary for the study of certain common species of mammals.

I have also been able to collect, in the physiological department,
chrcno-photographs and sketches of the movement of the same species.

Plates L and LI show a series of thirty-six photographs of a dog
taken while making astep. For such a slow gait the number of pictures
is greater than necessary, for a more rapid one all would be required. In
the present case it will be sufficient to compare every four pictures to
follow the phases of the movement. As the chronometric dial is used to
measure the intervals of time between two suecessive attitudes, so
the space passed over by the animal is measured by a mark fixed in the
ground, ‘This mark consists of a small white rod set up on the course.
At the commencement of the experiment the dog is behind the rod, at
the end he has passed it. The actual distance traversed is read off
upon a metric scale.

Plate LIL shows a sheep walking. The number of photographs is
reduced to nine, and the time between the first and last, as shown by
the chronometric dial, is twenty-five sixtieths of a second. The pro-
gression of the animal is estimated by his approach to the chronometer.

To obtain these pictures a dark background is used. This is not nec-
essary when a movable film is employed; then a hght background will
answer, as Shown in plate LILI, which represents a galloping horse. As
this was quite a long series, it was not possible within the space of a
column of text to show the entire set of movements; about half are
shown from the moment when the horse leaves the ground to that
when the two diagonally opposite feet are on the ground.

It is sometimes desirable to take pictures of an animal from different
aspects; chrono photography upon a movable plate 1s easily adapted
to such work. It is possible to follow in any gait of an animal the
series of movements of his limbs.

But the dimensions of the pictures obtained by printing from the
original negatives are too small to be directly utilized. Arrangements
must be made to more easily examine and measure the displacements
made by the different portions of the same limb during the step of any
gait. For this we proceed as follows:

We commence by enlarging by means of a projection apparatus each
of the little images which we wish to compare. Plate LIV shows one of
these enlargements. It is limited to five diameters, so as to accommo-
date the page, but it is better to nearly double those dimensions.

If we wish, for example, to study the movement of one of the hind
legs we trace the contours of that leg on a sheet of transparent paper,
using aS guides in applying this paper to the picture the line of the
ground and a fixed point upon that line. Having traced the first
image of the series we proceed to the second, placing the transparent
paper exactly over the guides, and thus obtain (fig.1 ) the series of sue-
cessive positions occupied by the hind leg of a horse while walking,
from the first raising of the foot to its final return to the ground,
404 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

In this representation of attitudes the leg is supposed to occupy sue-
cessive planes superposed upon each other, so that the last image
covers partially those which precede it. The contours covered by the
following image are represented by dotted lines.

Repeating this same operation for another species of animal, we
obtain (fig. 2) the series of attitudes of the hind leg of a dog walking,
and (fig. 5) a similar series for a sheep. In these last two figures an
attempt has been made to represent by dotted lines the contours of the

left hind leg, so as to show the alternation of movements between the
two legs.

At the first glance it is seen that in different species of animals the
length of the step in relation to the height is very different. This ine-
quality is much greater in rapid gaits and in certain animals of small
stature,

But I can not enter into detail regarding these special comparative
studies which show analogies and differences between various species
of animals in accordance with their anatomical structure.

The absolute fidelity of these chrono-photographic outlines allows us
to estimate the value of certain analyses of the movements of limbs
made by different authors. The most exact are certainly those of Vin-
cent and Goiffon. We can not too greatly adimire the sagacity of these
authors who have given so faithful a representation of the movements
of the horse in slow gaits.

Finally, these same pictures permit us to determine the action of cer-
tain muscles at different phases of the gaits. By starting from the suc-
cessive attitudes of the limbs we reach the physiological mechanism of
the movements under consideration.

. The sagacity of physiologists has often been tried by these obscure
questions. Maissiat'! more than anyone else has attempted to eluci-
date the part played by muscles in the walk of man. He has done in
this respect all that can be done by subtle observation joined to a pro-
found knowledge of the laws of mechanics.

But in questions of this kind the keenest intelligence can not attain
the precise results that are obtained by an exact method. Already, by
using localized electrization, Duchenne, of Boulogne, has shown in
man the special functions of the individual muscles; he has shown that
in the various acts of locomotion the muscles are associated by groups,
synergistic or antagonistic, and that each movement is a resultant of
these combined forces.

More powerful methods allow us to now elucidate these questions.

Upon the photographs of an animal in motion we may mark the
origin and insertion of muscles which we have learned from our ana-
tomical specimens, and, joining these insertions by one or more marks,

we will have for each attitude of a limb the length shown by each mus-
cle visible in the figure under consideration. We can easily follow
upon the series of photographs the phases of the shortening or length-
ening of these muscles—that is to say, their contraction or their relaxa-
tion. We may finally trace the curve or change of length of these
different muscles according to time, and compare the relations which
exist between certain muscular acts and the reactions imparted to the
body of the animal. .

As soon as we know the action of the different muscles during the
different phases of movement of an animal, we shall have the greater
part of the data necessary for understanding the mechanism of loco-
motion. Now, this knowledge can not be acquired by simple observa-
tion, for the most sustained attention concentrated on the action of a
single muscle, can with difficulty catch the phases of activity and of
repose even for the slowest gait. How, then, can we hope to catch the
action of all the muscles of the limbs at all phases of a rapid gait?

Such is the general plan for the study of comparative locomotion
which I have just undertaken. This long task is as yet but little
advanced, but the results which it promises are worth all the efforts
which it will cost.

Certain minds value science only for its practical application. To
such we may recall what the Physiological Station has already done and
show what it may be expected to. do. The physician may seek there
new means for the diagnosis of certain maladies and for investigating
the effects of their treatment; the soldier may study there the proper
regulation of marching so as to diminish fatigue and use to greater
advantage the bodily forces; the educator of youth may learn how to
logically direct gymnastic exercises; the artist, how to represent more
truthfully the scenes that he wishes to depict; the agriculturist, how
to use to the best advantage the strength of animals; the artisan,
how to more quickly acquire the skill necessary for his professional
labors. It seems that the utilitarian side of physiology has up to the
present time been the best appreciated.

But science has also other functions; it gives a lofty satisfaction to
the mind by causing us to comprehend the marvelous harmonies of
nature. The astronomer who knows how to calculate the movement
of the stars, to measure their distance, estimate their masses, and even
determine their chemical composition, must have a more lively intellect-
ual pleasure than the ordinary contemplator of the starry vault. There
is no doubt that zoology and physiology, mutually elucidating each
other, give us a grander conception of the animal kingdom by showing
its action in all its beauty.

I imagine that this evolution of the natural sciences will be effected,
as may be said, of itself, by the patient and methodical collection of
WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. AQT

anatomical facts and experimental determinations. And since we are
considering here only the comparative physiology of animal locomotion,
I believe that it is easy to point out the successive stages which ought
to lead to this result.

First, the animal forms should be grouped according to the type
of motion peculiar to them, so as to bring into notice their general
anatomico-physiological relations. This we have now begun to do, and
itis already evident that many of these relations depend upon ordinary
laws of mechanics. These relate to muscles, bones, and articular sur-
faces. As regards this I can only summarize here what I have given
elsewhere with more detail.!

The relation existing between the form and the functions of muscles
is as follows: The extent of the movement of a muscle is in proportion
to the length of its red fibers; its force is proportional to the cross-
section of sucn fibers; the work it can perform is proportional to its
weight.

These relations, the first of which was established by Borelli, can
easily be verified upon the muscles of a single animal. They explain
also why, in two different species, homologous muscles have different
anatomical characters; it is because the functions of the muscles differ
in the two species.

It will be seen that in order to carry further the anatomico-physiolog-
ical relation it will be necessary to determine with great precision the
functions of each muscle and the peculiarities of its movements; it is
precisely for that purpose that the experiments have been undertaken
which I have cited above.

The form and length of the bones correspond to that of the muscles
attached to them, and to which they seem subordinated, as is shown
by the beautiful experiments of Fick; the configuration of the articu-
lations shows the character of the movements which they permit.

Let us consider, for example, the form of the head of the humerus in
different animals. We see that it has a spherical curvature in man,
monkeys, and lemurs, in which animals movements in every direction
are allowed; that it is cylindrical in ruminants and pachyderms whose
anterior limbs move backward and forward, parallel to the axis of the
body; elliptical in birds whose wings move with unequal amplitude in
two directions perpendicular to each other. It is impossible not to see
that there is, between the form of the articular surfaces and the move-
ments, a necessary relation which permits us, when we know the char-
acteristics of the movement, to predict what will be those of the organ,
and vice versa.

A long habit of comparing with each other the skeletons of different
animals enabled Cuvier to recognize among the different bones of an
animal certain relationships which he called the* subordination of
characters. A bone of a certain form imphed the existence of certain

408 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

characteristics in the other pieces of the skeleton. Our great natural-
ist could therefore, to repeat an expression that has become classical,
restore from a single bone the entire skeleton of the animal to which
that bone belonged.

Without the long practice of a Cuvier, we may, by taking for our
guide anatomico-physiological relations, arrive at determinations of a
similar kind which may seem astonishing to those who do not know
the theory by which they are reached.

IT have shown that it is sufficient to see the wing of a bird, or even
the bones of the forearm of that wing, to deduce the dimensions of the
sternum.'! These relations have not, as far as I am aware, been indi-
cated by anatomists. They are as follows: Birds with small wings
have the sternum long and narrow; those with the large wings have
that bone broad and short. This relation is easy to verify on the skele-
tons of birds in zoological collections. The considerations which led
me to predict this are as follows:

In watching the flight of birds it is seen that large-winged species
have wing beats of but slight extent. This is because the large sur-
face of their wings finds a strong resistance in the air. Species that
have but little wing surface have, on the contrary, wing beats of great
amplitude in order by motor work and by the length of the path
described to make amends for the feeble resistance. Having such dis-
similar movements, these two kinds of birds ought to have correspond-
ing differences in the great pectoral muscles that lower the wings. In
the first these muscles are large and short; in the second, long and
slender. But the sternum, in the lateral fossee of which these muscles
are inserted, must correspond in its form to that of the muscles them-
selves. It must therefore be broad and short in the first type of birds,
long and narrow in the second. All sorts of intermediate forms exist
between these two extremes.

A comparison of the skeletons of birds shows that it is really so.
Still, gallinaceous birds seem to offer an exception to the rule; they
have a sternum too short for the small surface of their wings. But in
these species the great length of the coracoid bones really prolongs the
sternum, so that the exception to the general rule is only apparent.

The same kind of relations led me to predict, from the conformation
of the muscles of the calf, a curious peculiarity of the skeleton of the
negro. Comparing the calves of the negro with those of the white man
it is seen that in the first the gastrocnemii are much longer and more
slender, which allows us to conclude that the muscles have less force
but more range of motion in the black race. Now, to get the same
results of work expended in walking, it is necessary that the muscles
should act upon a longer lever; or, to state it otherwise, that the dis-
tance should be greater between the end of the caleaneum and the center
of movement in the ankle joint. Measurements show that this predic-

= ie
WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 409

tion is correct; the difference in the length of the caleaneum in the two
races is enormous, the ratio being as 7 Is to 5.

The constant examination of the physiological relations existing
between the form of the locomotor organs and the type of locomotion
in the different species of animals is the directing idea of the studies
that are pursued at the Physiological Station. There is no doubt that
every advance in our knowledge of the movements of locomotion will
bring out more clearly the perfect harmony that exists between an
organ and its function.

[ have tried to show by examples the happy effect of a union between
comparative anatomy and physiology. Anatomy alone may reveal cer-
tain unexplained relations between organs—the law of the subordina-
tion of characters is of this nature—but the law of harmony between
organs and their functions is deduced from acquaintance with the
physiological activities of each part of the body; it does not content
itself with simply stating the fact, but explains it, and thus completely
satisfies the mind.

This is not yet all. Naturalists have always sought to ascertain how
the conformity between an organ and its functions is actually brought
about. From this research originated the doctrine of final causes
which has, in our days, been replaced by more satisfactory hypotheses
tending to show that the different types of animals have been evolved
during the progress of ages by the action of forces effecting a closer and
closer adaptation to the varying conditions in which they are placed.
This is the doctrine of transformism or evolution.

But how shall we explain, in its turn, this evolution by the action of
natural forces? Certain zoologists, like Buffon and Lamarck, admit
that exterior influences may, in a more or less direct way, induce modi-
fications of organs; others, such as Darwin and Wallace, hold that
certain variations are transmitted by heredity when their effect is such
as to better adapt the beings that possess them for living in the condi-
tions in which they are placed, and to better fit them to resist agencies
that cause their destruction.

Twenty years ago, in discussing these two hypotheses,' I ventured to
hope that experimentation might decide this question, or at least assign
an equitable part to the different factors of evolution. The eminent
surgeon, J. Guérin, struck at seeing, after luxations, a tendency to the
formation of a new joint with cartilages, synovial membrane, and liga-
ments, said “ Function makes the organ.” This aphorism expresses
the ideas of Lamarck and Buffon; certain pathological cases amount,
indeed, to actual experiments, and show that, in a living being, mechan-
ical forces may bring about an adaptation of organs resulting in a
change in their functions.

1La Machine Animale, page 105.
410 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS.

Guided by certain theories it occurred to me that the muscular sys-
tem might also be modified and the form of a muscle changed by
altering the range of its movements. The result, as we shall see, has
confirmed my anticipations.

Let us take up again the well-marked example of the unequal length
of the gastrocnemii muscles in the white man and in the negro. If the
white man, as we have said, has the shorter calf, it is on account of
the shortness of his caleaneum. Suppose that the length of the calea-
neum in an animal is diminished, If the muscle adapts itself to the
new conditions of work it ought to diminish in length.

The rabbit is well adapted for such an experiment. It has a very
long calcaneum, and consequently the extensor muscles of the foot
have very long, red fibers. I resected in a rabbit a third of the length
of the caleaneum, and placed the hmb operated upon in a plaster cast
until the bone was entirely united. The animal was then set free in a
large yard, where soon it was running about with as much agility
as its companions. At the end of a year the rabbit was killed and it
was seen that upon the side operated upon the muscles had become
modified in accordance with the theory. The red fibers were reduced
to about a third of their length and replaced by tendon. A com-
parison of the sound limb with that operated upon showed this change
in a striking manner.

I made an experiment which was the converse of this by an oper-
ation upon a kid. In this species only the ungual extremity of the foot
strikes the ground, and the caleaneum, always raised, moves but slightly
in walking. The resection of this bone had, therefore, but little
effect either upon the mode of locomotion of the animal or upon the
character of its muscles.

Finally M. W. Roux has given numerous examples of the modifica-
tions of the muscles of man after partial anchyloses which reduced,
more or less, the range of movements. He has shown in a great num-
ber of autopsies a diminution in the length of the red fibers and their
replacement by tendon. This diminution in length was always propor-
tional to the reduction which had occurred in the range of movement.

The adaptations of muscles to mechanical conditions experimentally
created by mutilations is then well established. It is more than prob-
able that similar adaptations may be obtained in the length of the
muscles of animals by placing them in conditions where they would be
forced to make movements more extensive than those of their normal
life, by obliging them, for example, to leap or climb to get their food.
I will shortly cite some facts of this kind.

But even if it 1s shown that in an individual the muscles and the
skeleton become adapted to conditions of work, this would not be sufti-
cient to explain transformism. It is, in fact, necessary, in order to cause
a variation of species, that the modification acquired by individuals
Should be transmitted to their descendants by heredity.
WOBK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 411

Now, except in certain rare cases, the effects of the mutilation of peri-
pheral organs are not transmitted to the offspring. But itis not the same
with lesions that affect the nervous system, This fact has been well
established by the experiments of Brown-Sequard. In guinea pigs
this eminent physiologist saw curious deformations of the limbs and
exophthalmia produced as a consequence of nervous lesions; and these
modifications may be transmitted hereditarily throughout a long series
of generations. It seems that in such cases the traumatism has affected
function at its very origin; that is to say, in the organ placed at the
head of the physiological hierarchy.

There is, indeed, an evident subordination among the different parts
of the organism; the nervous system conceives acts and directs them
to be carried out; the muscles perform these acts; the bones and the
articulations bear the strains. May we not suppose that some new
exterior circumstances excite in an unaccustomed manner the nervous
system of an animal so that new conditions bring about new acts and
consequently lead to a modification of organs? The modifications thus
produced would be transmissible by heredity as in the experiments of
Brown-Sequard. We might thus explain the transformation of animals
during the lapse of ages: The variations of the environment create
new needs and excite to new acts, affecting first the nervous system,
which gradually modifies the organs subordinate to it.

Thus in the course of the past two centuries the breed of race horses
has diverged markedly from its primitive form. The excitation to
more rapid and more energetic muscular action is the cause of the
modifications revealed by comparative anatomy, which are in great
part hereditarily transmitted.

Jonathan Franklin states that kangaroos bred in captivity, having
no longer as in their natural habitat to bound over the tall grass, begin
to use their fore limbs for walking and running, whiie they lose in part
the robust character of their tails and the power of their hind legs.
M. Tegetmeier! states that rabbits, although imported into Australia in
quite recent times, have already shown notable modifications, and have
acquired by climbing trees habits which they did not have in the country
of their origin. These facts and other similar ones should be rigor-
ously investigated. The physiological and anatomical modifications of
all such cases should be determined with precision, so as to ascertain
if they correspond. If these modifications are real and their heredi-
tary transmission is well established the theory of evolution will be
experimentally demonstrated.

You see how many questions present themselves and how vast is the
experimental field in which the Physiological Station may be used. I
hope that I may have inspired you with a desire to seek a solution to
all these problems. The task is long and difficult, but it is not beyond
the scope of the experimental methods at our disposal.

As for myself, I am no longer at an age when great projects are pos-
sible. It is my desire to associate in my enterprise those who may
have the time and the necessary force to continue it. For this reason I
ask you to make use of the resources of the Physiological Station. You
will find there means of study applicable to the most varied subjects
and sometimes even pecuniary subsidies, too often wanting to workers.

Nothing conduces more to the development of science than the asso-
ciation in the same work of men whose knowledge and aptitudes differ.
Physicists, machinists, anatomists, and physiologists mutually enlighten
and supplement each other. The animal organism will offer to them a
valuable field of study, for in its physical and mechanical phenomena it
gives simple and admirable solutions of an infinity of problems.

This idea that different branches of knowledge should be brought
together is not a new one; it has been considered in the organization
of our great establishments for superior instruction, bat the combina-
tion is not made in an effective manner; physicists, chemists, and
mathematicians work near each other, but they do not work together.
And this results from the very necessities of teaching, which, in order
to secure clearness of exposition and good methods, must necessarily
present each branch of science as isolated from the others and sutfti-
cient unto itself.

The fusion of different sciences can not be effected at this time except
in matters of research; this promises important discoveries, but we must
not ask of it the material for regular teaching. The Physiological Sta-
tion is simply an establishment for original research, where I invite you
to unite your efforts and your learning for the resolution of the prob-
lems that I have just concisely placed before you. if you respond to
my appeal, each of you, I am sure, will find it to his profit.

As for myself, I shall owe you the gratification for which I am most
anbitious, that of having been useful.

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION|!

By ALFRED R. WALLACE.

The modern doctrine of organic evolution may be said to date from
the great French naturalist Buffon, who, more than a hundred years
before the publication of the Origin of Species, clearly indicated his
belief in the mutability of specific and generic forms, although, owing
to the power of the church in his day, he was often obliged to veil his
opinions under the guise of hypotheses, which, as they were opposed to
religion, of course could not be true. Yet he occasionally speaks very
plainly, as when he says:

‘“Nature, I maintain, is in a state of continual flux and movement;”
and again—

“What can not nature effect with such means at her disposal? She
can do all except either create matter or destroy it. These two
extremes of power the Deity has reserved for.-Himself only; creation
and destruction are the attributes of His omnipotence. To alter and
undo, to develop and renew—these are powers which He has handed
over to the charge of nature.”

Dr. Erasmus Darwin held similar views, which he developed at great
length, and in doing so anticipated many of the arguments afterwards
elaborated by the celebrated Lamarck, that changes in species were
caused both by the direct action of the environment, by the use and
exercise by animals of their several organs, and nore especially by the
effects of effort and desire leading to the development of parts and
organs calculated to gratify those desires. The great French natural-
ists Geoffrey and Isidore St. Hilaire? adopted these views with certain
modifications, as did a limited number of German naturalists; while
they were popularly set forth with much knowledge and literary skill
by the late Robert Chambers in his Vestiges of Creation. Somewhat
later the general theory of evolution was explained and illustrated by
Herbert Spencer with so much power and completeness as to compel
its acceptance by most. thinkers; but neither he, nor any of the great

writers who had gone before him, had been able to overcome the diffi-
culty of explaining the process of organic evolution, since no one had
been able to show how the wonderful and complex adaptations of living
things to their environment could have been produced by means of
known laws and through causes proved to exist and to be of sufficient
potency. Alike for naturalists, for men of science in general, and for
students in philosophy, the method of organic evolution remained an
insolvable problem.

Considering that this state of opinion prevailed up to the very date
of publication of the Origin of Species, the effect produced by that work
was certainly marvelous. A considerable body of the more thoughtful
naturalists at once accepted it as affording, if not a complete solution,
yet a professional theory, founded upon incontrovertible facts of nature,
demonstrating a true cause for specific modification, and affording a
satisfactory explanation of those countless phenomena of adaptation
which every preceding theory had been powerless to explain. Further
consideration and discussion only increased the reputation of the author
and the influence of his work, which was still further enhanced by his
Animals and Plants under Domestication, published nine years later ;
and when this had been fully considered—about twelve years after the
publication of the Origin—a large proportion of naturalists in every
part of the world, including many of the most eminent, had accepted
Darwin’s views, and acknowledged that his theory of natural selection
constituted—to use his own words—‘‘the main but not the exclusive
meaus of modification.” The effect of Darwin’s work can only be com-
pared with that of Newton’s Principia. Both writers defined and
clearly demonstrated a hitherto unrecognized law of nature, and both
were able to apply the law to the explanation of phenomena and the
solution of problems which had baffled all previous writers.

Of late years, however, there has arisen a reaction against Darwin’s
theory as affording a satisfactory explanation of organic evolution. In
America, especially, the theories of Lamarck are being resuscitated as
of equal validity with natural selection; while in this country, besides
a considerable number of Lamarckians, some influential writers are
introducing the conception of there being definite positions of organic
stability, quite independent of utility and therefore of natural selection;
and that those positions are often reached by discontinuous variation—
that is, by spurts or sudden leaps of considerable amount, which are
thus “competent to mold races without any help whatever from the
process of selection, whether natural or sexual.”' These views have
been recently advocated in an important work on variation,’ which
seems likely to have much influence among certain classes of natural-
ists; and it is because I believe such views to be wholly erroneous and

to constitute a backward step in the study of evolution that I take this
opportunity of setting forth the reasons for my adverse opinion in a
manner likely to attract the attention not only of naturalists but of all
thinkers who are interested in these problems.

Before proceeding to this special discussion it may be well to illustrate
briefly the essential difference between the theories of Darwin and
those of his predecessors and oponents, by a few examples of those
cases of adaptation which are insoluble by all other theories, but of
which natural selection gives an intelligible explanation.

The Darwinian theory is based on certain facts of nature which,
though long known to naturalists, were not understood in their rela-
tions to each other and to evolution. These facts are: Variation, rapid
multiplication, and the resulting struggle for existence and survival
of the fittest. Variation is the fundamental fact, and its extent, its
diversity, and its importance are only now becoming fully recognized.
Observation shows that when large numbers of individuals of common
Species are compared there is a considerable amount of variability in
size, form, color, in number of repeated parts, and other characters.
Further, that each separate part which has been thus compared
varies, so that it may be safely asserted that there is no part or organ
that is not subject to continual variation. Again, all these variations
are of considerable amount—not minute, or infinitesimal, or even small,
as they are constantly asserted to be. And, lastly, the parts and
organs of each individual vary greatly among themselves, so that each
separate character, though sometimes varying in correlation with other
characters, yet possesses a considerable amount of independent varia-
bility. The amount of the observed variation is so great that in fifty
or a hundred adult individuals of the same sex, collected at the same
time and place, the difference of the extreme from the mean value of
any organ or part 1s usually from one-tenth to one-fourth, sometimes
as great as one-third, of the mean value, with usually a perfect grada-
tion of intervening values.

The multiplication of individuals of all species is so great and so
rapid that only a small proportion of those born each year can possibly
survive; hence the struggle for existence, the result of which is that,
on the average, those individuals which are in any way ill fitted for the
conditions of existence die, while those better fitted live. The struggle
is of varied character and intensity—either with the forces of nature, as
cold, drought, storms, floods, snow, etc.; with other creatures, in order
to escape being devoured, or to obtain food, whether for themselves or
for their offspring; or with their own race in the competition for mates
and for the means of existence; while as regards all these forms of
struggle mental and social qualities are often as important as mere
physical perfection, and sometimes much more important. The fact
already stated, of the large amount of variability in most species, has
been thought by some to show either that there can be no such severe
A416 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

struggle as has been suggested, or that the characters which vary so
much can be of little importance to the species, and can not therefore
determine survival. But in making these objections two considerations
have been overlooked. In the first place, we always compare adults,
and an enormous amount of destruction has already taken place during
the earlier stages of life. The adults therefore are already a selected
group. In the second place, the struggle is very largely intermittent,
owing both to the occurrence only at long intervals of the most adverse
meteorological conditions, while the diversity of these conditions leads
in each case to the selection of a different characteristic. An excep-
tionally severe winter will destroy all which are deficient in one set of
characters, while a long drought, or scarcity of some particular kind of
food, will weed out those deficient in another set of characters. Thus in
any one year there will exist numbers of individuals which are doomed
to speedy destruction under some one of the special adverse conditions
which are constantly recurring; and it is this, probably, that explains
why there is so much individual variation continually present, although
the central or typical form remains unchanged for very long periods.
This typical form is that which, under existing conditions, survives all
the periodical or secular adverse changes, during which the outlying or
extreme variations of whatever kind are sooner or later eliminated. It
is for want of giving full weight to the essentially intermittent nature
of the struggle for existence that so many writers fail to grasp its full
significance and continually set forth objections and difficulties which
have no real importance.

We are now ina position to estimate the efficiency of Darwin’s theory
in explaining the wondrous and complex adaptations that abound in the
organic world, as compared with that of Lamarck or of his modern sup-
porters. And first lét us take the simple case of the adaptation of
fleshy and juicy fruits to be eaten by birds, causing what seems at first
sight an injury to the species, but which is really most beneficial, inas-
much as it leads to the wide dispersal of the seeds, and greatly aids in
the perpetuation of the plants which produce such fruits. To what
possible direct action of the environment can we impute the production
of fleshy or juicy pulp, with attractive color and with small, hard-coated
seeds, in the innumerable fruits which are devoured by birds, through
whose bodies the seeds pass in a state fitted for germination? There
is here a combination of characters caleulated to a certain end, a defi-
nite adaptation. If we suppose that in an early stage of development
ancestral fruits which happened to be a little softer than others were
xaten by birds, how could that circumstance increase the softness,
develop juice, and produce color in future generations of the trees or
bushes that sprang from the seeds so dispersed? And if we assume
that these several characteristics are positions of “organic stability,”
acquired through accidental variation, we have to ask why the several
kinds of variation occurred together, or why neither of them occurred

a
THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. Aled

in the numerous species in which to be eaten by birds would be injurious
instead of beneficial.

But if we begin at the same stage and apply the Darwinian theory,
we find that the whole process is easy of explanation. It is an observed
fact that fruits vary in softness, juiciness, and color, and seeds in the
hardness or hairiness of their integumnents. Any variation of primitive
fruits in either of these directions would therefore be beneficial, by
attracting birds to eat them and so disperse the seeds that they might
reach suitable stations for development and growth. Such favora-
ble variations would therefore be preserved while the less favorable
perished.

Now, ask the same questions as to the production of the innumerable
modes of dispersal of seeds by the wind, from the simple compressed
form and dilated margins of many small seeds to the winged seeds of
the ash and maple, and the wonderful feathery parachute of the thistle
and the dandelion. Oy again, inquire as to the wonderful springed
fruits which burst so as to scatter the small seeds, as in some of the bal-
sams; or yet again, as to the sticky glands of the sundews, and the
small water traps of the bladder wort; and a hundred other equally
strange adaptations to some purpose of use to the species, but whose
development has no relation whatever to any possible direct action of
the environment, though all of them are explicable as the result of the
successive preservation of such variations as are known to occur, act-
ing at various intervals, and by means of successive modifications, dur-
ing the whole period of the development of the group from some remote
ancestral form.

The modern advocates of Lamarckism content themselves with such
simple cases as the strengthening or enlarging of organs by use, the
hardening of the sole of the foot by pressure, or the enlarging of the
stomach by the necessity for eating large quantities of less nutritious
food. These, and many other similar modifications, may doubtless be
explained by the direct action of conditions, if we admit that the change
thus produced in the individual is transmitted to the offspring. That
such changes are transmitted has, however, not yet been proved, and a
considerable body of naturalists reject such transmission as improbable
in itself, and at all events as not to be assumed without full and suffi-
cient proof. But even if accepted it will not help us to explain the
very great number of important adaptations which, like those already
referred to, are quite unrelated to any direct action of the environment.
Having thus cleared away some preliminary misconceptions, and stated
in briefest outline the main features of the law of natural selection, we
_ mnay proceed to consider the objections of those modern writers to whose

-works we have already referred.

Mr. Bateson’s large and important volume consists mainly of an
extensive collection of cases of variation of a particular kind, which
have been met with throughout the whole animal kingdom, and have

Sieg 4=——— ii)
/

418 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

been recorded in all parts of the world. These are arranged systematic-
ally under nearly nine hundred numbered headings, and are in many
cases well illustrated by characteristic figures. The character and mor-
phological relations of these variations are often very fully discussed
with great knowledge and acuteness, and some original views are set
forth which are of interest both to morphologists and physiologists.
So far as this part of the work is concerned the present writer would
feel himself quite incompetent to criticise it, but would welcome it as
presenting in a convenient form a great body of interesting and little-
known facts. But the book goes far beyond this. The first words of the
preface tell us that “This book is offered as a contribution to the study
of the problem of species;” and in a lengthy introductory and shorter
concluding chapters this problem is discussed in some detail, with the
view of discrediting the views held by most Darwinians; while a new
theory, founded upon the facts given in the body of the work, is set
forth as being a more probable one. It is therefore necessary to give
some account of the nature of the facts themselves, as well as of the
particular theories they are held to support.

Darwin distinguished two classes of variations, which he termed
“individual differences” and “sports.” The former are small but
exceedingly numerous, the latter large but comparatively rare, and these
last are the “discontinuous variations” of Mr. Bateson to which refer-
ence has been already made. Darwin, while always believing that indi-
vidual differences played the most important part in the origin of species,
did not altogether exclude sports or discontinuous variations, but he
soon became convinced that these latter were quite unimportant, and
that they rarely, if ever, served to originate new species; and this view
is held by most of his followers. Mr. Bateson, however, seems to
believe that the exact contrary is the fact, and that sports or discon-
tinuous variations are the all-important, if not the exclusive, means by
which the organic world has been modified. Such a complete change
of base as to the method of organic evolution deserves, therefore, to be
considered in some detail.

The difficulty which seems to have struck Mr. Bateson most, and
which he declares to be of “immense significance,” is that while spe-
cific forms of life form a discontinuous series, the diverse environments
on which these primarily depend shade into each other insensibly, and
form a continuous series (p. 5). Further on this objection is again
urged in stronger language: ‘“We have seen that the differences
between species are specific, and are differences of kind, forming a
discontinuous series, while the diversities of environment to which they
are subject are on the whole differences of degree, and form a continu-
ous series; it is therefore hard to see how the environmental differences
can thus bein any sense the directing cause of specific differences,
which by the theory of natural selection they should be” (p. 16).
Again, at page 69, he urges that the essential character of species is

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 419

that they constitute a discontinuous series, and he asks “Is it not
then possible that the discontinuity of species may be a consequence
and expression of the discontinuity of variation?” He then states
that on the received hypothesis, ‘ Variation is continuous, and the dis-
continuity of species results from the operation of selection.” This,
however, is not quite a correct statement of the received hypothesis if
‘‘ discontinuous” is used in Mr. Bateson’s sense, as including every
change of color which is not by minute gradation, and every change in
number of repetitive parts—as of vertebrie, or of the joints of an antenna,
or the rings of a worm—which is not by a gradation of the part from
a minute rudiment. Such changes of color or in the number of parts
are admitted by all Darwinians as, in many cases, constituting a part
of that individual variation on which modification of species depends.
It is, however, on the supposed rejection of this class of variations by
Darwinians that he bases what he terms ‘an almost fatal objection”
to their theory.

Returning, however, to the supposed overwhelming importance of
discontinuous variation, we pass on to the last chapter of the book,
headed ‘‘Conciuding reflections,” and we read: ‘The first object of this
work is not to set forth in the present a doctrine, or to advertise a solu-
tion of the problem of species,” and then follows immediately a further
discussion of this very theory of discontinuity, which is set forth as a
doctrine, and as a help to the solution of that problem. We are told
that the difficulties of the accepted view ‘‘have oppressed all who have
thought upon these matters for themselves, and they have caused some
anxiety even to the faithful;” it is urged that “the discontinuity of
which species is an expression has its origin not in the environment,
nor in any phenomenon of adaptation, but in the intrinsic nature of
. organisms themselves, manifested in the original discontinuity of varia-
tion;” that, ‘‘the existence of sudden and discontinuous variation, that
is to say, of new forms having from their first beginning more or less
of the kind of perfection that we associate with normality, is a fact that
disposes, once and for all, of the attempt to interpret all perfection and
definiteness of form as the work of selection.” And then comes the
positive statement “the existence of discontinuity in variation is there-
fore a final proof that the accepted hypothesis is inadequate” (p. 568),
and after several more pages of illustration and argument, the final
conclusion is reached that “it is quite certain that the distinctness and
discontinuity of many characters is in some unknown way a part of
their nature, and is not directly dependent upon natural selection at all.”

Before going further it will be well to make a few observations on
these very definite and positive conclusions at which Mr. Bateson has
arrived; and it must be remembered that this volume deals only with
one portion of the subject even of discontinuous variation, which is
itself, if we exclude monstrosities, only a small fragment of the whole
subject of variation. The impression that will be produced on those
420 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

who have given special attention to the relations of living organisms to
each other and to their inorganic environment will be that of an aca-
demic discussion, dealing to a large extent with words rather than with
the actual facts of nature. The author’s main point that species form
a discontinuous series, and that specific differences can not, therefore,
have been produced by any action of the environment, because that
environment is continuous—an argument which, as we have seen, he
dwells upon and reiterates with emphasis and persistency—rests wholly
upon the obvious fallacies that in each single locality the environment
of every species found there is the same, and that all change of envi-
ronment, whether in space or time, is continuous. To take this latter
point first, nothing can be more abrupt than the change often due to
diversity of soil, a sharp line dividing a pine or heather clad moor from
calcareous hills; or to differences of level, as from a marshy plain to dry
uplands; or, for aquatic animals, from the open sea to an estuary, or
from a nontidal stream to an isolated pond. And when, in the course
of geological time, an island is separated from a continent, or volcanic
outbursts build up oceanic islands, the immigrants which reach such
islands undergo a change of environment which is in a high degree
discontinuous.

Kven more important, perhaps, is the fact that everywhere the
environment as a whole is made up of an unlimited number of sub-
environments, each of which alone, or nearly alone, affects a single
species, as familiarly included in the term “their conditions of exist-
ence.” The mole and the hedgehog may live together in the same
general environment, yet their actual environments are very different,
owing to their different kinds of food, habits, and enemies. The same
thing applies to the rabbit and the hare, the rook and the crow, the
ring snake and the viper; and still more when we look at animals of
greater diversity, as the otter and the badger, the dung beetle and the
eockchafer, and a hundred others that might be quoted. Now, though
all these creatures may be found together in the same area, each of
them has its own ‘‘environment,” to which it must be adapted in order
to maintain its existence. Many species, however, live, as it were, on
the borders of two distinct environments, as when they obtain differ-
ent kinds of food at different periods, being then exposed to different
enemies and varied climatic effects. In such cases, it is easy to see
that a small modification of structure might enable them advanta-
geously to change their habits, and thus obtain what would be practi-
cally a different environment. This is well seen in those closely allied
species which have somewhat different modes of life, as the meadow
pipit (Anthus pratensis) and the tree pipit (Anthus arboreus), the former
having a long, nearly straight claw to the hind toe, a more slender bill,
and arather greener tinge of coloring, a modifications suited to its
different habits and distinct physical surroundings. Here we have an
example in nature of how environments, even when continuous as a
w

whole, may become quite discontinuous in relation to two species dif-
fering in very slight characters. Darwin dwelt much upon this phe-
nomenon of new species being formed when any body of individuals
seized upon vacant places in the economy of nature, and by means of
comparatively slight variations became adapted to it. It is what we
see everywhere in the world around us.

It thus appears that what is evidently supposed to be a very power-
ful argument, leading to the conclusion that discontinuous variations
as a Class are those which are of vital, if not exclusive, importance in
the production of new species, entirely breaks down when confronted
with the facts of nature. It does not, however, follow that because an
unsound a priori argument has been used to call attention to these vari.
ations, and because they have been set before the world in a way to
suggest that their importance in relation to the origin of species is a
new discovery calculated to revolutionize the study of this branch of
biology, they are therefore of no value in this connection. We will
therefore now proceed to consider them on their own merits as possible
factors in the process of organic evolution. For this purpose we must
briefly indicate the nature of the variations so laboriously recorded in
this volume.

These consist of what are termed meristic variations; that is, varia-
tions in the number or position of parts which occur in series, whether
linear, bilateral, or radial. Such are the variations in the number of
segments of annulosa and arthropoda, such as worms, leeches, centi-
pedes, etc.; in the antenne and legs of insects; in the vertebra, ribs,
teeth, nipples, limbs, and toes of vertebrates; in the rays of starfish,
encrinites, and allied animals. The ocelli and other symmetrical mark-
ings on the wings of butterflies are also recorded, as well as numerous
malformations when these affect serial or symmetrical organs.

On carefully looking through the cases of variation in this volume,
we are struck with the large proportion of them which exhibit more or
less deformation or want of symmetry, culminating in the various kinds
of monstrosity. In Chapter ILI, on the variations of vertebree and ribs,
we find vertebrw imperfectly divided in snakes and frogs. Numerous
cases of abnormalities in human vertebre are given, usually exhibiting
asymmetry or deformation, and similar variations are found in the
anthropoid apes, but here there is apparently more of regularity and
symmetry. The greatest amount of this kind of variation oecurs in
the sloths, as might be expected when we consider that they are the
most abnormal of mammals as regards the cervical vertebrae. In Chap-
ter VIII numerous cases of Supernumerary mamnmie are recorded, almost
all of which are unsymmetrical. The variations in the number or form
of the horns in sheep, goats, and deer recorded in Chapter XI show
them to be usually more or less irregular.

Nearly a hundred pages are devoted to the digits (fingers and toes)
of mammals and birds, about one hundred and forty cases of variation
422 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

being recorded. Almost the whole of these present, more or less, want
of symmetry, while a large proportion, as the double-handed and double-
footed children and the six or seven toed cats, can only be classed as
monstrosities.

In succeeding chapters the variations in the antenne and leg joints
of insects; in the radial parts of medusz and encrinites; in the medial
structures of fish, insects, mollusks, ete., which become sometimes
double; in the eyes and coloration of flatfish; in duplicate or branch-
ing legs of insects and crustaceans; in extra limbs of batrachia; and,
lastly, double monsters, are all discussed at great length, and are illus-
trated by anumber of very interesting woodcuts. But almost the whole
of these can only be classed as malformations or monstrosities which
are entirely without any direct. bearing on the problem of the “ origin
of species.”

Nothing can better show the small value of the book from this, which
is the author’s own, point of view than the large amount of space
devoted to the various monstrosities of the hands and feet of man and of
some of the mammalia. Not only throughout all mammals, but also in
the case of birds, reptiles, and amphibia, five is the maximum number
of the toes or fingers. These may vary in size or in proportions, they
may be reduced in number by coalescence, or by the loss of the lateral
digits; they may be strangely modified in form and function, as in the
flappers of the whale or in the wing of the bat, yet never once in the
whole long series of land vertebrates do they exceed five in number.
Yet we have six, seven, or eight fingered, double-handed, or double-
footed children; similar malformations in monkeys; six and seven toed
cats; four, five, or six toed pigs; double-footed birds, and other mon-
strosities, described at great length, and all their peculiarities discussed
in the most minute detail and from various points of view, in a work
presented to us as “a contribution to the study of the problem of
species.” Many of these malformations have been observed among
animals in a state of nature, and, in fact, Mr. Bateson believes that they
occur as frequently among wild as among domesticated animals. Con-
sidering how rarely the former cases can be observed, they must be
every where occurring; yet in no single instance do they seem to have
established themselves as a race or local variety on however small
a scale. Yet we know that in the case of the six-toed cats, and prob-
ably in other cases, they are easily transmissible; and we must there-
fore conclude that all these irregularities and monstrosities are in a
high degree disadvantageous, since when subject to free competition
with the normal form in a state of nature they never survive, even for
a few generations.

As the volume we are discussing is entirely devoted to variations in
the number or position of the serial parts of organisms in relation to
the origin of species, it becomes necessary to lay some stress upon the
very familiar, but apparently overlooked, fact that, among all the higher

ie.
THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 493

types of life at all events, the most stable of all characters, and the
most permanent during long periods of evolution, and throughout
changes which have led to the production of a marvelous variety and
abundance of specific forms, are these very characters of the number
and relative positions of serial organs; whence it follows that varia-
tions of this kind can only have led to specific changes at enormously
long intervals, and that, as a general rule, they can have had nothing
whatever to do with the origin of an overwhelming majority of living
species.

First we have the four limbs of vertebrates, which, among all the
marvelous variety of form and function, on land, in the water, or in the
air, is never exceeded, and appears to have been fixed at a very early
stage of the development of the vertebrate type. Equally fixed, and
extending through a still vaster range of modifications of specific forms,
are the six legs and four wings of true insects, which, asin vertebrates,
may be reduced but never increased in number. Still more extraordi-
nary, because less obviously connected with the main structure and
functions of the organism, is the limitation and permanence in the num-
ber of the subdivisions of limbs and other appendages. There is no
obvious reason why in land vertebrates the divisions of the hand and
foot should never exceed five, yet not only is this number the maxi-
mum, but it may be considered the normal number of which ali others
are reductions, since it still prevails largely in the marsupials, rodents,
carnivores, primates, and lizards; and the five-toed land vertebrates
(excluding birds) are probably far more numerous than those with a
lesser number.

In birds there are only four toes as a maximum, and comparatively
few have asmaller number. But we have here a peculiarity in the num-
bers of the toe joints which does not occur in any other vertebrates.
These form a series in arithmetical progression, the hind toe having
two and the others three, four, and five joints in regular order; and
this rule is very nearly universal, the only exceptions being in some of
the swifts and goatsuckers, whose habits render the feet of compara-
tively little importance, while their general organization is of a some-
what low type. .

Coming to insects, we again find the legs consisting of a limited num-
ber of parts, and, strangely enough, this number is again five—the coxa,
trochanter, femur, tibia, and tarsus. The tarsus, however, is subdivided
into small movable joints, and these, too, are five as a maximum, but in
certain groups are reduced to four, three, or two. The five-jointed tarsus
is, however, the most prevalent, and in the enormous order of Coleoptera
or beetles, comprising at least one hundred thousand described species,
fully half belong to families which have the tarsi five-jointed. Even the
antenne, although they vary greatly in the number of joints, yet in
numerous large groups comprising many thousands of species, they
have the number of joints constant. Another indication of the tendency
of serial parts to become fixed in number, is the typical limitation of the

a
ADA THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

cervical or neck vertebrie of mammalia to seven joints. This number
is wonderfully constant, being the same in the long necks of the giraffe
and camel and the very short necks of the hippopotamus, porpoise, and
mole, the only exceptions in the whole class being some of the sloths,
which have from six to ten, often varying in the same species, and the
manatee, which has six.

Now, if we consider the enormous extent of these fixed numerical
relations of important parts of the organism in the higher vertebrates
and in insects, both as regards the number of living species affeeted—
perhaps 99 per cent of the whole—and as regards their range in time,
throughout the whole of the Tertiary and Secondary, and even a con-
siderable portion of the Paleozoic periods, and if we take account of the
vast number of extinct species, genera, and families needful to com-
plete the various lines of descent from the earliest known forms, pre-
senting the same numerical relations to those now living, we shall be
able to form some conception, however inadequate, of the overwhelming
frequency and importance of variations in the size, form, proportions,
and structure of the various: parts and organs of the higher animals,
as compared with variations in their number. No doubt in the earlier
stages of organic development numerical variations were more frequent
and more important, as they are now among the lower forms of life; but
at a very early period in geological history the main numerical relations
of the essential parts of the higher organisms became more or less fixed
and stable, and have in many cases remained unchanged through a
large proportion of the period comprised in the geological record. ‘The
four limbs of vertebrates were already established in the fishes of the
Devonian period, as were the four wings and six legs of true insects in
the cockroaches and archaic orthoptera of the Carboniferous; and
almost all subsequent changes have resulted from modifications of these
early types. The earliest mammals of which we have sufficient knowl-
edge have the typical five-toed feet, and the earliest birds appear to
have had the same progressive series of toe joints as now prevails.

We are thus irresistibly led to the conclusion that, among all the
possible forms of variation now occurring, those affecting the number
of important serial parts among higher organisms are those which
have the least possible relation to whatever modification of species
may now be going on around us, or which has been going on dur-
ing a large portion of geological time. Yet it is to variations of this
nature, a large proportion of which are mere malformations or mon-
strosities, that the bulky and learned volume we are discussing has
been devoted. The author of this book puts forward these malfor-
mations and irregularities, mixed up with a proportion of normal
variations, under the misleading name of ‘“ Discontinuous variations,”
as if they were something new, and had been ignorantly overlooked
by Darwin and his followers; and he loses no opportunity of telling
us how important he thinks they are, what difficulties they enable us

eats

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 425

to overcome, and how they are the beginnings of the establishment of
a sure base for the attack on the problems of evolution. In so doing
he has entirely failed to grasp the essential features which characterize
at least 99 per cent of existing species, which are, slight differences
from their allies in size, form, proportions, or color of the various parts
or organs, with corresponding differences of function and habits, com-
bined with a wonderful amount of stability in the numerical relations
of serial parts, extending sometimes only to genera, but more usually
to families, tribes, orders, or even to whole classes of the higher ani-
mals. It is differences of the former kind that do actually characterize
the great majority of species;' they affect those organs which vary
most frequently and most conspicuously in the individuals of every
fresh generation, and they constitute that individual variation on
which Darwin always relied as the essential foundation of natural
selection, and which his followers have shown to be far more abundant
and of far greater amount than he was aware of; and, lastly, they
afford amply sufficient material for the continuous production of new
forms. Rarely in the history of scientific progress has so large a claim
been made, and been presented to the world with so much confidence
in its being an epoch-making discovery, as Mr. Bateson’s idea of dis-
continuous variation corresponding to and explaining the discontinuity
of species; yet more rarely has the alleged discovery been supported
by facts which, though interesting in themselves, are for the most part
quite outside the general conditions of the complex problem to be
solved, and are therefore entirely worthless as an aid to its solution.

3efore leaving this part of the subject we may note the extension of
definite numerical relations to plants as well as to animals. In dico-
tyledons we have a typical five-petaled flower, or a corolla with five
divisions, a character which prevails in irregular as well as in regular
flowers, and often when the stamens are not a multiple of five, as in
mallows, bignonias, and many others. Some form of five-parted flower
prevails throughout many extensive natural orders, and comprises prob-—
ably a considerable majority of all dicotyledonous plants. A three or
six parted flower is almost equally a characteristic of monocotyledons,
prevailing even among the highly specialized and fantastically formed
Orchide and Iridew, thus again demonstrating how large a portion of
the specific modifications of organisms are independent of variations
in number, but depend wholly upon variations in the size, form, color,
and structure of the various parts and organs.

Other matters of importance in Mr. Bateson’s work, together with
some theories recently advanced by Mr. Francis Galton, will be dis-
cussed in the concluding portion of this article.

1Mr. Bateson, however, makes the extraordinary statement that ‘‘it is especially
by differences of number and by qualitative differences that species are commonly
distinguished” (p.573). Species makers know too well that, among the higher
animals at all events, it is not so.
426 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

1h

In the first part of this article the misconception which underlies the
main body of Mr. Bateson’s work has been discussed in some detail.
We will now deal with some of the minor objections to the views of
most Darwinians, which are to be found in his lengthy introduction;
after which the validity of Mr. Francis Galton’s doctrine, as to posi-
tions of organic stability (also held by M1. Bateson), will be considered.
And first, we note that he uses the usual misleading terms ‘‘minute,”
“minimal,” “imperceptible,” and ‘insensible” (p. 15) as applied to the
individual variations on which Darwin relied, although he has himself
given figures of beetles and earwigs showing that such variations are
enormous—greater, indeed, than in the illustrative cases I have given
in my Darwinism.'

A strong attack is made on the theory of the utility of specific
characters. It is admitted that an enormous amount of evidence has
been collected, and that ‘the functions of many problematical organs
have been conjectured, in some cases perhaps rightly;” yet he adds,
‘whole groups of common phenomena are still almost untouched even
by conjecture.” He tells us that “many suggestions have been made
as to the benefits which edible moths may derive from their protective
coloration, and as to the reasons why unpalatable butterflies in gen-
eral are brightly colored” (p. 11); but neither here nor elsewhere is any
hint given that more than “suggestions” have been advanced. Consid-
ering that this is the one branch of the subject in which natural selec-
tion has been shown to be an actual working reality in nature by the
experiments of Jenner Weir, Butler, Stainton, and Belt, the observa-
tions of Bates and Fritz Miiller, and especially by the elaborate investi-
gations of Professor Poulton, it was hardly fair to pass the subject by
as if nothing had been done but pure conjecture. He also ignores the
continuous advance that is being made in determining the utilities of
the innumerable modifications in the forms and arrangement of the
leaves and other of the nonfloral appendages of plants by Kerner,
Lubbock, and many other observers; as well as the light thrown on
color and marking as specific characters in the higher animals by the
consideration of the value of distinctiveness for purposes of recogni-
tion, a character of life-preserving value in the case of many animals,
and in all of great importance to reproduction, and an essential factor
in the differentiation of species. » It is, therefore, not correct to say, ‘‘ But
as to the particular benefit which one dull moth enjoys as the result
of his own particular pattern of dullness as compared with the closely
similar pattern of the next species, no suggestion is made.” The sug-
gestion has been made (Darwinism, p. 226), and has been accepted as
at all events a good working hypothesis by many naturalists. On this
question of the utility of characters which are constant characteristics

‘See Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1892 (pp. 59-23) [592-3?], in a paper by
W. Bateson and H. H. Brindley.

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 427

of the species, but whose utility is not apparent to the casual observer,
Mr. Bateson uses very strong language. Referring to the case of two
ladybirds, the small Coccinella decempunctata being exceedingly vari-
able, both in color and spotting, the larger C. septempunctata, very
constant, he says, “To be asked to believe that the color of C. septem-
punctata is constant because it matters to the species, and that the
color of C. decempunctata is variable because it does not matter, is to be
asked to abrogate reason” (p. 572). I fear that I myself must be in this
sad case, for though I have not been asked to believe this unreasonable
thing, yet I do believe it. Of course I may be wrong and Mr. Bateson
right, but how is it that he is so absolutely sure that he is right?

Bette proceeding further we may briefly notice that Mr. Bateson
seems to imply that the ‘“meristic,” or numerical variations, to which
he has devoted his volume, are altogether ignored by Darwinians in
their adoption of “individual variations” as opposed to “sports” for
the main materials on which natural selection works. But this is alto-
gether erroneous. Nodoubt they would reject nine-tenths of Mr. Bate-
Son’s cases as being simply monstrosities, which neither have nor could
ever have had any part in the production of new species; but they
always recognize that genera, and even species are sometimes DEE ely
ized by a difference in the number or arrangement of serial parts—as
of vertebrie, ribs, teeth, or markings, and that therefore variations of
this kind are sometimes, though comparatively very rarely, the material
on which natural selection works. As development seems almost always
to have proceeded by reduction from large and indefinite numbers of
serial parts to the minimum number compatible with the maximum of
utility, an increase in number occurring now may be, as is usually eon-
sidered, a form of reversion, though Mr. Bateson denies that there is
any such thing in nature. This diminution in number may have occurred
either by a gradual diminution in size and ultimate disappearance, as
when limbs of the higher animals have been lost, in whales, the apteryx,
snakes, etc.; or it may sometimes have been abrupt, Sncn means that
the mien of the part ceased to develop at an early embryonic stage.
Hither mode is quite in harmony with the views of Darwinians, and not
very much seems to be gained by terming the former “continuous” and
the latter “discontinuous,” especially when this last term is held to
include almost every kind of monstrosity.

We have now to consider an equally important, though as I consider
an equally unsubstantial, novelty—the view that there are ‘definite
positions of organic stability,” which alone are sufficient to mold races
“without any help whatever” from natural selection. This view appears
to have originated with Mr. Francis Galton, and was first stated in his
work on Natural Inheritance, and again in his Royal Society paper on
“Thumb and finger marks.” The same view is adopted by Mr. Bateson;
and in an article on “Discontinuity in evolution” in Mind (Vol. III,
pp. 362, 372) Mr. Galton approves of Mr. Bateson’s work, and restates
his latest views on the subject, and these I now propose to consider.
*

428 THE METHOD OF ORFANIC EVOLUTION.

Although Mr. Galton begins by the consideration of races only, that
is, of well-marked forms below the value of species, yet later on he
applies his theory to the evolution of species and of all higher groups.
Speaking of discontinuous or, as he terms it, transilient variation, he
says: “A leap has taken place into a new position of stabiltiy. Iam
unable to conceive the possibility of evolutionary progress except by
transiliences, for, if they were mere divergences, each subsequent gen-
eration would tend to regress backward toward the typical center, and
the advance which has been made would be temporary and could not be
maintained” (1. ¢., p. 368.) Mr. Galton has before implicitly admitted
that there is such a thing as natural selection, yet in this passage he
reasons as if it had no existence, and that regression to mediocrity
would occur just the same with it as without it. For the essence of
natural selection is thatit preserves and thus increases favorable varia-
tions by destroying the unfavorable; but this statement by no means
expresses the real power of selection, which may be better illustrated
by saying that it destroys about 99 per cent of the bad and less bene-
ficial variations and preserves about the 1 per cent of those which are
extremely favorable. With such an amount of selection how can there
be any possible ‘regression backward toward the typical center” when
any change in the environment demands an advance in some special
direction beyond it as the only means of preserving the race from
extinetion? Well did Darwin say that unless the universal struggle
for existence ‘be thoroughly ingrained in the mind, the whole economy
of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extine-
tion, and variation will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.” Almost
all the misconceptions of popular writers against Darwinism arise from
the want of this constantly present recollection; and as capable and
instructed writers, such as Mr. Galton and Mr. Bateson, as well as
capable, but uninstructed writers, such as Lord Salisbury, alike suffer
in this respect, it is needful to again state obvious facts which may
serve to drive home the overwhelming importance of this factor in
evolution.

Let us suppose an animal which lives ten years and produces 10 young
(5 pairs) each year, a moderate allowance even for many mammals and
birds. A little simple arithmetic will show that if none died for five
years there wowd be 6,480 pairs in place of the 1 pair, or 6,480,000,000
in place of 1,000,000, as the case might be. But it is evident that
such an average rate of increase for all animals could not go on for even
one or two years, as no country could supply them with-food. We will
suppose, then, that only 1 pair, instead of 5, survive each year to breed
the next year; but if this goes on for the ten years of the life of the
first pair we shall still have 512 pairs instead of each pair, a number
which is equally impossible. Let us, then, suppose that only one-fiftieth
part of those born survive, that is, that only 1 individual lives to
breed out of 5 successive broods of 10 each; even then, at the end

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 429

of ten years, we shall have a population two and a half times as great
as at first, or, more exactly, if we began with 1,000,000 individuals, then
in ten years we should have 2,595,743. This is probably something like
what happens. Forty-nine fiftieths of those born never live to breed,
yet the population increases steadily so long as conditions are moder-
ately favorable, the surplus being got rid of at uncertain intervals by
recurrent unfavorable conditions, so as to keep the number of individ-
uals on the average about stationary. Looking at it in another way,
we find that, beginning with 100 individuals whose oftsprings each year
amount to 500, of which only 10 survive to breed, then during ten years
about 8,000 will have been born, making, with the original hundred,
8,100, out of which only the 100 fittest, or nearly the fittest, will
survive, to be again weeded out every successive ten years, or there-
abouts. Without making some numerical estimate of this kind it is
impossible to realize the severity of the struggle continually going on
in nature and the resultant elimination of the unfit. With the above
figures (which would have to be enormously greater with many species)
we see that for every 80 born only 1, on the average, survives to
breed. With such an amount of selection it is evident that whenever
it happened that the mean point, or “typical center” of the curve of
variation, ceased to be the most advantageous point in relation to the
whole conditions of existence, then a new typical center would rapidly
be produced by the elimination of all which diverged from it to any
injurious extent. There could not possibly be regression from the new
typical center unless the inevitable survival of the fittest in a rapidly
increasing population can be gotten rid of. .

We are now in a position to discuss Mr. Galton’s theory, that there
are certain variations which possess ‘ organic stability,” and that these
are the real factors of evolution *‘ without any help whatever from the
process of selection.” And first, what is the exact character of these
stable variations which form races and ultimately new species by their
own inherent force of stability? Is the stability in relation to the
actual conditions of the environment or altogether independent of
those conditions? If the former, how did it come to be in harmony
with them? If this harmonious relation depends upon a mere chance
coincidence, we have to consider the comparative rarity of these large
or discontinuous variations, and that only a small. proportion of them
have the alleged character of *‘ stability.” Moreover, this class of vari-
ations is generally a variation in a single part or organ, and Herbert
Spencer (as well as many other writers) has argued forcibly that modi-
fications of single characters would in all cases be useless unless
accompanied by the correlative modifications of a number of other
characters. I have myself shown that in the case of individual varia-
tions this is no difficulty, because all characters are varying more or
less in every generation, and thus the needful harmonious relation
between the different organs or parts can be easily maintained; but in
430 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

the case of these large and rare variations the difficulty is an over-
whelming one. And we must always remember that these alleged
“stable” variations, from the first moment of their appearance, can
not possibly escape from the action of natural selection. As, roughly
speaking, only about 1 per cent of each generation survives to breed,
this new form, however stable in itself, can not become part of that 1
per cent unless the particular variation which characterizes it is either
beneficial or entirely harmless. But in the latter case it is difficult to
see what constitutes its superiority over the rest of the species which,
year by year, by means of this intensely severe process of elimination,
is kept in harmony with the environment. If the stability consists in
greater health, vigor, reproductive power, or intelligence, all these
qualities have already been developed to the fullest needful extent,
and these superior individuals will be selected in the usual way. But
if—as a second alternative—these alleged stable variations are sup-
posed to have some kind of inherent stability independent of the
environment, then, stability notwithstanding, they would inevitably
soon succumb under the terrible eliminating power which year by year
leaves only about 1 per cent of the most fit to survive. There is really
no escape irom this dilemma: If your new variety is among the 1 or 2
per cent of the most fit, then it does not need this purely imaginary
quality of ‘organic stability ” in order to survive; if it is not among
this small body of the most fit—that is, of the best adapted to the
whole conditions of existence of the species or race—then, any other
quality notwithstanding, it will certainly not survive.

The term ‘organic stability” has really no meaning except that of
harmonious adaptation to the environment as tested and maintained by
natural selection. To talk about new races or species being produced
‘‘without any help whatever from natural selection” can, under the
actual conditions of the terrestrial universe, only mean that there is an
inherent developmental power which modifies organisms in definite
ways, and in more perfect harmony with the environment than has
been or can be brought about by natural selection, thus keeping these
modified organisms always ahead of the rest. They may thus be said
to be independent of survival of the fittest, because they and their
ofispring always are the most fit, and therefore always survive! On
this theory evolution goes on by the production of new races complete
and ready formed, and in perfect harmony with the environment when-
ever that environment undergoes a change. But no evidence is offered
for such an extraordinary developmental power being always at work
and always able to produce adaptation to an ever-changing environ-
ment. Such a power would be hardly different from the old special
creation, or than the preordained harmony of the philosophers; and it
would, moreover, have rendered unnecessary and unintelligible that
rapid multiplication and consequent enormous expenditure of life
which now prevails. It would equally render unnecessary that won-

te Nes

derful property of individual variability, whose only use would then be
to enable man to improve his domestic animals and cultivated plants.
We should thus have two rival systems at work, and we might almost
imagine Mr. Sullivan’s cosmic spirits— William and James—to be reali-
ties, and that each had been experimenting in organic development on
our earth in order to see whose scheme was the most satisfactory.!

As evidence of the actual existence of this hypothetical ‘ organic
stability,” Mr. Galton adduces the patterns in thumb and _ finger
marks, which he has so carefully studied. In his Royal Society
paper on this subject he tells us that these marks fall into definite
groups and can be systematically classified, and he actually describes
and figures twenty-five distinctive patterns arranged under three
very distinct classes. He then urges that these fundamentally dis-
tinet classes are strikingly analogous to genera in biology, and as
the patterns are so insignificant in every way that they can in them-
selves be neither useful nor ornamental, and can therefore never have
been the subjects of selection, they prove, he thinks, ‘‘ that natural
selection has no monopoly of influence in forming genera, but that it
could be wholly dispensed with, the internal conditions acting by them-
selves being amply sufficient to form them.” And itis from the case of
these finger marks that he considers the reality of positions of organic
stability has been proved, and that they are ‘‘competent to mold races
without any help whatever from the process of selection.”

At first sight this may appear to be sound reasoning, and to be fatal
to some of the claims of the Darwinians, but further examination will
show that it is a pure fallacy arising from the vague use of terms, and
from comparing quite different things as if they were of the same nature.
The fallacy depends on applying the terms of classification in system-
atic biology to groups of single objects which have no real relation with
the genera and species of the naturalist. The essential character of a
species in biology is that itis a group of living organisms, separated
from all other such groups by a set of distinctive characters, having
relations to the environment not identical with those of any other group
of organisms, and having the power of continuously reproducing its
like. Genera are merely assemblages of a number of these species
which have a closer resemblance to each other in certain important and
often prominent characters than they have to any other species. It
will be more intelligible and more instructive if we confine ourselves to
species as the unit of comparison with Mr. Gelton’s groups of stable
finger patterns, in order to show the fundamental differences between
them. And first we see that Mr. Galton classifies the marks them-
selves, not the individuals who possess the marks. He tells us that the
very same general varieties in these marks are found in English, Hin-
doos, and negroes, and, presumably in all other races; and, further,
that he has “failed to observe any correlation between the patterns and

‘See Strand Magazine, Vol. IV.
432 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

any single personal quality, whether mental or physical.” <All this is
entirely different from either specific or generic characters, whose essen-
tial feature is that they are found in every normal individual of the
genus or species, and are always correlated with other characters. In
his first paper on this subject (in 1890), Mr. Galton said he had reason
to believe that the patterns are to some extent hereditary, but that he
had no evidence of it; while in his paper on ‘“‘ Mind,” four years later, he
could still only say that “they are to be looked upon” as having “a
slight tendency toward transmission by inheritance.” But the very
essence of specific and generic characters is that they are strictly
transmitted by inheritance. Yet, again, whatever difference of opinion
there may be as to the utility of all the characters which distinguish
species, everyone will admit that many are useful, and especially that
the general assemblage of characters that fit each species for a some-
what different mode of life from its nearest allies, must certainly be
useful. But the very essence of Mr. Galton’s argument as to these
finger prints is that they are not and can not be in any way directly
useful. How, then, can the manner in which these patterns may be
grouped furnish us with any argument whatever as regards such totally
diverse things as generic or specific characters, and still less as regards
genera and species themselves?

The fact is, no doubt, that these patterns are the direct result of the
laws of growth of the tissues of the skin. The limited number and
definite character of these patterns are probably the mechanical inci-
dental results of these laws, under the ever-varying conditions of
development in each individual. A good analogy would be found in
snow crystals, of which about a thousand varieties have been recorded,
which may, however, all be grouped under five classes, while each snow
fall usually produces crystals of one class. Here we have the fixed and
definite laws of the crystallization of water, so modified by conditions
of moisture, temperature, motion, and perhaps electric state of the
atmosphere, as to lead to this wonderful variety of the product, yet
always subject to the law of crystalline symmetry and to systematic
grouping under definite classes; just as in these finger prints we have
a more limited variety of forms, which also can be grouped under a few
classes. But neither the one nor the other has any real bearing upon
the problem of the nature and origin of the genera and species of
living organisms. A study of the distribution of the stars over the
surface of the heavens, or of the interlacing ripple marks upon the
sea-beach, would no doubt show that these objects might also be the
subject of classification; and from the point of view of elucidating the
origin of species, they would be about as useful, or as worthless, as the
study of finger marks.

Of course, there are many varieties or races, both among animals and
plants, which continually reappear, and which in some cases are known
to reproduce their like, and these undoubtedly have an appearance

}

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 433

of stability. Such are the light and dark colored varieties in many
insects and in some mammals and birds, the hairy or smooth varieties
of plants, specially banded or colored land shells, and many others.
Whenever any of these variations are not injurious under the actual
conditions of existence of the species they may persist in considerable
numbers, and thus appear to be stable. But others which are compar-
atively rare may be just as stable organically, as shown by the case
of white mice, pigeons, etc., which increase to any extent under domes-
tication. In a wild state they never do so, and the obvious reason
is that either the conspicuous color or something correlated with it is
injurious. In flowers white varieties are frequent, and they occur in
all degrees of abundance or rarity, and this indicates, in all proba-

bility, various degrees of hurtfulness. If in any case the white color

were not at all injurious as compared with that of the type, it would
almost always, by the operation of Delboeuf’s law, tend to increase to
nearly an equality with the parent form, and as this equality so rarely.
occurs we must conclude that in most cases the variety, of whatever
kind, is to some extent injurious.' From the usually limited number
of individuals presenting these discontinuous variations, we may there-
fore draw an important conclusion which has hitherto been overlooked.
It is that not only do such variations afford no support to the theory
of a special “organic stability” capable of producing races, species,
and even genera, without any aid from natural selection, but they fur-
nish a strong, if not conclusive, argument against it, since any which
did possess such exceptional stability and were in no degree injurious
would long since have become equal in numbers to the type of the
species.

A few words are here necessary as to the very common misconcep-
tion that extreme Darwinians do not recognize the importance of the
organism itselfand of its laws of growth and development in the proce-
ess of evolution. For myself, | may say that no one can be more
profoundly impressed by the vast range, by the complexity, by the mys-
tery, by the marvelous power of the laws and properties of organized

For a statement and popular demonstration of Delbeuf’s law see Habit and
Intelligence, by J. J. Murphy, 2d ed., page 241. Briefly, the law is that if a species
produces a variety, in however small a proportion annually, and if the variety pro-
duces its like in the same proportion as does the species, and if it is neither bene-
ficial nor hurtful to the species, then the variety will increase, rapidly at first and
more slowly afterwards, till it approaches to equality in numbers with the species.
From this law it follows that, as varieties are usually very much less numerous than
the species, this must be due to one of the following causes: Either (1) the variety
has but recently originated, and has not had time to increase, or (2) the variety has
ceased to be produced by the species, or (3) it does not reproduce its like so com-
pletely as does the species, or (4) it is disadvantageous to the species. The first two
suppositions are improbable, and can only account for a very small proportion of the
varieties which are greatly inferior in numbers to the species; the other two are
antagonistic to any special “organic stability,” which must therefore, in the great
majority of cases, be rejected as being both unproven and opposed to the facts.

matter, which constitute the very foundation of all life, and which alone
render possible its countless manifestations in the animal and vegeta-
ble worlds; while those who have read Weissmann’s account of the
complex processes of development of sperm and germ cells, in his vol-
ume on The Germ Plasm, must feel sure that he, at all events, can have
no inadequate conception of their importance.

What Darwinians deny is, as 1 understand the question, that these
laws themselves serve to keep the completed organism in close adapta-
tion to the fluctuating environment, instead of merely furnishing the
material which is required for that adaption. In our view, the funda-
mental laws of growth and development, through the agency of rapid
multiplication and constant variability, provide the material on which
natural selection acts and by means of which it is enabled to keep up.
the adaption to the environment (which alone renders continuous life
and reproduction possible) during the constant though slow changes,
whether inorganic or organic, by which, in the course of ages, the
effective environment of each species becomes more or less profoundly
modified. Thus, and thus alone, we believe, are new species produced
in strict adaption to the new environment. So far as rendering possi-
ble and actually leading to growth, reproduction, and variation, the
fundamental laws are supreme. In securing the development of new
forms in adaption to the new environment, natural selection is supreme.
Hence arises the real distinction—though we may not always be able
to distinguish them—between specific and nonspecific or developmental
characters. The former are those definite though slight modificatiens
through which each new species actually became adapted to its changed
environment. They are, therefore, in their very nature useful. The
latter are due to the laws which determine the growth and develop-
ment of the organism, and therefore they rarely coincide exactly with
the linits of a species. The more important of these latter characters
are common to much larger groups, as families, orders, or classes, while
others, depending partly on complex and fluctuating influences, are
variable even within the limits of a species. Of this kind are the finger
prints, which, like many other minute details of form or structure, vary
from individual to individual.

I have now, I think, shown that the two most recent efforts to estab-
lish new methods of organic evolution as either complete or partial
substitutes for natural selection—that is, for the survival of the fittest
among the individual variations annually produced—have completely
failed to establish themselves as having any relation to the actual facts
of nature. Mr. Bateson’s discontinuous variations were long ago
rejected by Darwin as having no important part in the formation of
new species, while recent and ever-growing proofs of the generality
and the magnitude of individual variability render these larger and
rarer kinds of variation of even less importance than in his time. Mr.
Galton’s theory of organic stability, which is essential to the success

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 435

of discontinuous variations, has been shown to be founded upon a com-
parison of things of a totally dissimilar nature, and, further, to be
absolutely unintelligible and powerless unless in strict subordination
to natural selection.

The reason why two writers of such extensive knowledge and
undoubted ability have so completely failed in dealing with the great
problem of the modification of organic forms has been clearly indicated
during the course of this discussion. It has arisen from the fact that
they have devoted themselves too exclusively to one set of factors,
while overlooking others which are both more general and more funda-
mental. These are the enormously rapid multiplication of all organ-
isms during more favorable periods, and the consequent weeding out
of all but the fittest in what must be on the whole stationary popula-
tions. And acting in combination with this annual destruction of the
less fit is the periodical elimination under recurrent unfavorable con-
ditions of such a large proportion of each species as to leave only a
small fraction—the very elect of the elect—to continue the race. It is
only by keeping the tremendous severity of this inevitable and never-
ceasing process of selection always present to our minds and applying
it in detail to each suggested new factor in the process of evolution
that we shall be able to determine what part such factors can take in
the production of new species. It is because they have not done this
that the two authors whose works have been here examined have so
completely failed to make any real advance toward a more complete
Solution of the problem of the origin of species than has been reached
by Darwin and his successors.
THE PART PLAYED BY ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA
OF ANIMAL LIFE:.}

By M. ERNEST SOLVAY

- - Biological research must be guided in the direction of physies
and chemistry, and, in my opinion, we must set out with this profound
conviction—that the phenomena of life can and should be explained solely
by the working of the physical forces which control the material universe,
and that among these forces electricity plays a predominant part.

It is with a view to contribute to the verification and development of
this thesis by observation and by study of the facts of experiment that
I have determined to found a spécial institute for research.

- I would now address myself to all those who, in the future, and even
after I shall have ceased to live, shall undertake researches in the
laboratories which are about to be opened; I would try to state the
character of the answers which I foresee are to be looked for from their
labors to the great problem, as I understand it, of the nature of life.
Having meditated much upon this problem, I believe that I have found
some new points of view which it may be useful to make known to
those who enter upon experimental researches in this direction. I aim
at establishing a close correlation among the facts by tracing them back
always tothe foundation of physical principle. I introduce hypothesis
when needful, as a lever, as a tool with which to open a new path for
investigation. The future will show to what extent my views are true,
or how far I have been mistaken.

OF KLECTRICAL ENERGY,

heat disengaged, with positive or negative value, is equal to that which

would be necessary and sufficient to decompose into its constituents

the substance formed. - - - It seems permissible to assume that,
in every case of chemical combination, electrical energy may exist
before thermic energy, and that the latter may be but the result of a
transformation of the former; that, if this way of looking at the facts
is but partially sustained by experiment, the reason is to be found in
our working under conditions which cause the immediate transforma-
tiou, in whole or in part, of electricity into heat.

In support of this mode of looking at the facts let us notice that
electricity is capable of decomposing a substance without sensibly
raising its temperature, while this is far from being true in regard to
heat; hence the product of an electrolysis is much greater than that
of a dissociation due to heat alone. It follows that electricity appears
to us as endowed with a peculiar and specific character, of which we
shall have to take account. - - -

II.—OF THE RELATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN THE PHENOMENA OF PHYSICS AND OF
CHEMISTRY—UNITY OF THE PHYSICAL FORCES.

- - - We may, it seems to me, explain all phenomena, both phys-
ical and chemical, by assuming that every mass of matter (particle,
molecule, or atom) is endowed with a specific character which is a
mathematical function of its temperature, of its pressure, and of its
potential energy or its electrical state.!

Expanding this proposition, here stated in its most eeneral form, we
recognize that it affords us the means of explaining, not only the
attractive force acting between the parts of matter of the same kind,
but also and equally well the special elective power which characterizes
the chemical force called affinity; that it enables us to interpret the

variations which this latter force exhibits under the influence of changes
in temperature, pressure, or previous electrical state (dissociation,

action in the naseent state, etc.); that in short this very function of

which we are speaking must be the expression of the physical force
ralled cohesion or of the chemical force known as affinity, according as
the substances brought together are identical or different in nature.

All phenomena, physical and chemical, are thus blended, and fall
into two great classes:

(1) Endothermic phenomena, which consume, absorb, or render latent
a certain quantity of external energy; and

(2) Exothermic phenomena, which set free a part of the energy exist-
ing in the potential state in the ingredients which unite in the forma-
tion of a new body.

Let us go back now to what has been said (in I) as to the preappear-
ance of electrical energy in the act of chemical combination.

If it be true that chemical and physical phenomena present no essen-
tial porns of difference, and are but the manifestations of a single and

tomes the nota energy may be expressed as lolecacien energy.

ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 439

identical aggregate of causes, have we not ground for supposing, by
reason of analogy, that in every exothermic physical phenomenon the
energy set free appears, or tends to appear, first under the form of
electricity? That if we have not hitherto succeeded in completely
revealing it in this form, it is because the very circumstances of our
experiments have occasioned its transformation.

If this conjecture be vindicated we shall be authorized to regard all
the phenomena of nature, whatever they may be, as manifestations of
electricity, without deciding beforehand anything as to the essential
nature of this force.

This is the form under which the idea presents itself to my mind of
the unity of the forces of nature.

- - - Among the essential characteristics presented by the animal

automatic locomotion, which has been called motivity.

The study of this distinctive quality leads us quite naturally to the
most general consideration of the phenomena of life in their connected
aggregate, so that we may conveniently take this as our starting point
when we propose to unfold the part taken by the forces of inanimate
nature in connection with the phenomena in question, Since motivity
is essentially inherent in the nature of the living animal organism, we
may say that ap animal is a motor; further than this, we have good
reason to believe that an animal is an electric motor, as I will now try
to show.

Proceeding by the method of exclusion, we see at the outset that
motivity can not arise from a dynamic transformation of potential
energy of the kind presented to us in a hydraulic motor, for we per.
ceive neither a reservoir of liquid nor a fall capable of being turned to
account. x

Neither can the cause we seek be found in a purely thermic transfor-
mation of the same kind as that exhibited by gas engines, hot-air engines,
and steam engines, to which contrivances no one would think of com-
paring a muscle.

On the other hand, electricity lends itself to a satisfactory solution
of the problem before us, a solution to which it will be well that we give
our attention, at any rate until the future shall have revealed to us the
existence of some other as yet unthought-of mode of transformation of
energy, if so be that such a mode exist.

Laying aside, then, finally, on the evidence before us, the supposition
of hydraulic action, let us examine more closely the two other hypoth-
440 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

eses, and let us especially compare the yield in mechanical energy of
a thermic or electric motor with that of a living motor.

We know that the most highly approved thermic motors do not give
more than about 8$ per cent of useful effect; the theoretic limit to the
yield of steam engines is 17 per cent, and to that of gas engines 21 per
cent. On the other hand, let us look back to the experiments of Hirn
and Helmholtz. We find that we must assign to the yield of a muscle
a mean value of more than 30 per cent.

It is impossible, as we see, to compare with this useful effect the far
inferior yield of the thermic motors of human contrivance; the differ-
ence is so great that, without reference to certain physical impossibil-
ities pointed out by Hirn, it suffices to make us give up the hypothesis
of a thermic cause, in the sense in which we have just spoken of it.
The idea of electrical transformation presents itself in quite a different
light, since in this case the yield in dynamic effect is much greater and
is comparable to that of the living motor.

Il.—OF THE SEAT IN THE ANIMAL BODY OF ELECTRICAL MANIFESTATIONS.
ELECTROGENIC APPARATUS.

- - - QOvxidation of organic matter takes place in all the living cells.
It takes place even in the blood and in the lymph at the expense of the
chemical constituents carried forward by these fluids and not as yet
endowed with organized structure. All the tissues take part in this
process of internal combustion. All must thus contribute to the supply
of energy necessary to the living being.

But the relative importance of each of the tissues varies greatly in
this respect. To convince ourselves of this we need but, for instance,
contrast the physiology of muscular tissue with that of connective
tissue.

The preponderant importance of the part played by muscular tissue
is manifest; we know, in fact, that when work is being done the mus-
cles come in for some 70 or 80 per cent of the total oxidation taking place
in the animal economy. The glands, which represent apparatus com-
posed of cells of great vital activity, also undergo rapid oxidation.
Internal oxidation is for us the source of electricity. This process goes
on chiefly in the muscles and in the glands; hence we give to these
portions of the whole organic structure the name of electrogenic
apparatus.

It is interesting to notice that the tissues which are the seat of most
active oxidation, as the muscles and the glands, are richly provided
with nerves, while those in which oxidation is feeble, as the cartilages
and connective tissue, are but poorly supplied by the nervous system.

May we not use this fact—a very important one, in my opinion—to
establish an analogy between each animal organism, simple or com-
plex, ameba or man, and the cell or single element of a voltaic battery?
Thus the readily oxidizable tissues, forming the electrogenic apparatus,

ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 441

would play the part of the negative plate, the fluids producing oxida-
tion and hydration that of the positive plate; the nerves would serve
to close the circuit.

We should thus recognize in the economy of the living animal the
chemical duality necessary for the production of electrical energy;
should we not, consequently, be justified in considering this organism
as a true physiological battery? If so, we ought to follow up the com-
parison, and try to understand how this battery works; what is the
nature and what the extent of its circuit; what are the causes which
make its discharge to vary, and finally, what becomes of the energy
which it develops.

III1.—OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL VOLTAIC BATTERY.

In every battery the existence of available electrical energy is mani-
fested only in so far as the electricity is able to flow off by appropriate
conductors to parts of the apparatus where it may be utilized or
transformed.

In default of such an arrangement—in the case, for instance, of a bat.
tery short-circuited by means of a conductor of low resistance—we
perceive nothing but a development of heat, which seems to be the
immediate result of the transformation of energy which occurs, but
which, in accordance with what we have said as to the preappearance
of electricity, may here again be regarded as a secondary phenomenon.

To justify the use of the expression physiological battery or pile, we
have at the outset to prove that there exist in the animal organism
lines cf least electrical resistance (or behaving as such) capable of giv-
ing direction to the electricity disengaged, of conducting and distrib-
uting it.

But I have good reason for believing that this part devolves upon the
nerves, and that wherever they are developed and ramified they gather
up a part of the electricity produced by the electrogenic apparatus and
convey it to pots where if reappears unaltered or transformed.

The slight oxidizability of nervous tissue and its great functional
importance lend, moreover, support to this mode of looking at it.

In what way does the propagation of electricity in the nerves take
place? This question is certainly destined to occupy a large place in
the programme for the experimental work of the institute. To answer
it there will be need, it seems to me, for seeking first of all to complete
our knowledge of the constitution itself of the nerve fiber, afterwards
to study very closely the electro-physical properties of nerve tissue, to
investigate under what influences its electrical resistance varies, to
determine finally the nature of the process itself by which the nerve
current is propagated toward the organs where it is utilized. The
inmost nature of this process is as yet unknown to us, and I do not
understand that it is to be regarded as identical with the propagation
of electricity in a metallic conductor. I limit myself then, for the
442 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

present, to a single remark on this point—already proved to be true—
namely, that manifestations of nerve action are always accompanied by
variations of electrical condition.

I will not enlarge further upon these questions, important as they
are, so as not to go beyond the plan of a merely general statement of
views.

No one among you, moreover, can have overlooked the great inter-
est of the researches of which these points will form the subject in the
new institute.

IV.—OF THE PART PLAYED BY THE NERVES IN THE PIIENOMENA OF STIMULATION.

Muscle and nerve respond to stimulation of mechanical, thermic,
chemical, or electrical origin, but the last of these is attended with
especially remarkable results.

Electrical influence is in fact by far the most powerful and extended
in its effect, whether it be applied directly to the muscular tissue or,
above all, if it be applied to a nerve.

On the one hand, if a muscle be directly stimulated by a shock, a
drop of acid, or a prick with a sharp point, we produce but a limited
local effect, while, on the contrary, if we act through the medium of a
nerve we call forth generalized effects, whatever be the stimulus made
use of, and it is the whole muscle that contracts as if each of its parts
were electrified.

To obtain the same result without having recourse to a nerve as
medium it would be necessary to apply the stimulus simultaneously to
all the elementary fibers of the muscle.

These facts have a double bearing: they seem to justify the idea of
attributing to the nerves the part of conductors, and show also that
electricity is the form of energy which lends itself better than any other
to propagation to a distance and to distribution in the living organism.

V.—OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTILITY.

Although stimulation gives rise to electrical manifestations 1t does not
follow that the appearance or presence of electricity is necessarily
dependent upon the occurrence of external stimulation.

lam much rather inclined to believe that the physiological electric
battery is always in a state of activity, and that a muscle works—that
is to say, gives out energy produced by this battery—even when it
accomplishes no external work.

A muscle is an elastic body, more or less stretched, capable of being
progressively contracted by the electric current up to the point of pro-
ducing an external mechanical effect. As the current diminishes the
muscle relaxes; as the current increases it contracts, and we may say
that its tonus, or intensity of contraction, is some function of the
quantity of electrical energy employed.

ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 443

On the other hand, it seems evident that it is in consequence not of
a static but of a dynamic action that the muscle as an organ maintains
its state of contraction. It behaves like a spring upon which a jet of
water constantly plays, and not like a spring loaded with a weight.

In the former of these two cases the dynamic stress, constantly kept
up, is exerted against work, which involves expenditure of the moving
fluid and, consequently, a certain amount of energy. In the same way
the sustained contraction of a muscle also demands a continued supply
of energy.

The physiological battery operates, then, to furnish this energy even
when the muscle is at rest, and as no external work is accomplished in
this condition all the energy furnished is transformed into heat.

It would be easy to multiply illustrations of this condition of special
equilibrium; we find it notably exhibited in the case of a ball supported
on a jet of water and in that of a soaring bird, which contends with
the action of gravity by the rhythmic strokes of its wings.

VI.—OF THE VARIABILITY IN YIELD OF ENERGY BY THE ANIMAL ORGANISM.

It is easy to see that the quantity of energy consumed must increase
when the state of rest is followed by that of activity from whatever
sause, during which external and internal work are superadded to that
of the tonus existing during muscular repose. The reaction of the
organism is not coustant; it varies in intensity with the condition of
sleep, of wakefulness, and of work. - - -

It must be, then, of absolute necessity that the yield or output of
energy of the physiological battery can regulate itself in due proportion,
so that there shall never be either excess or deficiency.

Where shall we find the seat of this regulating action if it be not in
the nervous system itself, with the importance of which as an apparatus
of stimulation we have already taken note?

Assuming that the nervous system is not the producer of energy, but
that its function is only to distribute it, must we not hence conclude
that by means of its stimulating power it can modify, hasten, or retard
this distribution ?

4

VII.—OF THE GENERAL REASON FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

We may picture to ourselves simply enough, in general principle, the
reason for the existence of the nervous system if we represent a nerve
as the main path by which electrical energy is carried from the point
at which it originates to a nerve center and from thence to an organ
of expenditure.

In proportion as we ascend in the scale of matured animal forms or
in that of embryonic stages of development, and as we study more and
more perfect organisms, we observe the muscular and nervous systems
develop in extent and at the same time increase in the complexity of
their structure and functions. In proportion as the embryo undergoes
444 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

development the nerve fiber elongates and becomes the seat of increased
electrical resistance.

Thus the nervous network ceases to be able to carry more than a
continually diminishing part of the total energy. The greater part,
forced to undergo utilization at the seat of its production, gives to the
muscular fiber its peculiar character and brings about its contractility
or tonicity, as we have seen (nV). - - -

If we reflect upon the stage of progressive evolution of an inferior
animal, or upon one of the earlier phases of development of an embryo,
we understand that in proportion as nerve trunks take their rise in the
neighborhood of each other differences of electric potential, existing
between certain points of these trunks, tend to give rise to new trunks,
superadded to the former, and the presence of which helps to render
electrically dependent upon each other the different parts of the elee-
trogenic system.

Let these anastomoses be multiplied ad infinitum, without losing
sight of the fundamental idea of the system, and we shall be able, as
it seems, to succeed in explaining the governmental order which reigns
throughout the whole nervous system, from the smallest sporadic gan-
glia to the brain, which is itself the center of centers.

VIIL—OF THE PART PLAYED BY SENSORY EXCITATIONS.

Let us now investigate how the nervous system may play the part of
stimulator while drawing its functional energy from the reaction of the
whole organism, and how it comes to regulate the operation in all its
variations of the physiological battery.

Nothing seems to stand in the way of our looking on the series of
multiplied nerve trunks which constitute the nervous system of one of
the higher animals as closely analogous to an ordinary system of wires
for the distribution of electrical energy, in which whole series of appa-
ratus for the consumption of this energy (lamps, electric motors, etc.)
are branched off from a great source of production of electricity at a
central station.

We may assume all of these pieces of apparatus for the utilization
of the current to be regulated by instruments electrically connected
with the central source of power, which instruments themselves con-
sume in their operation a certain share of the available energy, and
represent so many secondary derivations of energy from the system.
Finally, to complete this ideal scheme, we may imagine each of the
pieces of apparatus for the utilization of the current to be furnished
with an “ annuneciator ”—an instrument operated electrically—which
shall give notice to the regulating apparatus of anything going wrong
at the point at which such instrument is placed.

The aggregate of all the regulating apparatus in such a system
forms, to my eyes, an image of the brain, and the instruments which
give notice of what may occur at the various outlying points in the
system are but the analogues of the organs of sense.

ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 445

Moreover, nothing prevents the parts of sucha system being arranged
so as to produce apparent automatism; such would be the impression
conveyed by the innate character of the reflex actions arising from the
structure conferred upon the system.

As for the sense impressions, the predominant part assigned them
in such a distribution of energy will be to act upon the regulating
apparatus, and by their means to modify the conditions of output of
energy.

As the effect of influences from without acting upon the organism will
be to oppose or to favor organic activity in those parts where such
influences have long tended to favor such activity, the organs of spe-
cial sense will have been formed and developed, and will have become
the normal stimulators of vital action.

In such a system, provided the normal organism be not called upon
for more than a part of the energy which it can produce, the actual
production must essentially correspond with the demand for it; the
physiological battery has, in the sensory organs, a true regulating
apparatus capable of adjusting the amount of vital oxidation to the
direct or indirect excitations which come from the environment; the
whole matter appears as if the stimulations of sense impressions set
up conditions more favorable for the genesis of energy by increasing
nerve conductivity, perhaps by a swelling up and consequent increase of
contact or compression of the material of the axis cylinders. The tlow
of energy thus produced at the seat of excitation will necessarily be
returned like an echo to the other end of the line, acting upon the mus-
cle in which energy is utilized, and the increase of muscular contrae-
tion will be the physiological expression of this echo in the muscle of
the signal given by the sense impression. - - -

TE:
THE MECHANISM OF VITALITY.

I.—OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF VITAL ACTIVITY.

Having thus pictured to myself the conditions of the working of the
nervous system in a living animal, working which is dependent upon
the distribution of electric energy generated by physicochemical reac-
tions in the protoplasm, I have been led to examine how it is possible
to conceive of the origin of vitality in this system; that is to say, the
origin of the reactions producing electricity in the very heart of the
prinitive protoplasm.

Reasoning from one inference to another, I have come to propose in
definite form the following thesis:

Life is essentially characterized by the existence of a system of con-
tinuous reactions, the necessary elements of which are ceaselessly repro
duced and which take place in the midst of an appropriate medium.
446 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

It presents itself to us, therefore, not only in the complex organism,
but even in the last result of its structural subdivision in the single
cell, in which it still exhibits the same essential character by which it is
sufficiently defined.

It is not limited by particular morphological conditions. Organic
form and structure may vary almost endlessly with a condition of the
medium without the essential character of vitality thereby disappearing.

In order that this vital reaction may take place three general cond1-
tions are necessary: First, the simultaneous presence together of the
prime materials essential to the reaction; secondly, a particular state
of distribution of these prime materials, from which may result the
heterogeneity indispensable to the progress of the reaction, and, finally,
such arrangements as shall permit the energy liberated by the reaction
to be consumed, utilized, or transformed, either on the spot or outside
the field of the reaction.

Il.—OF OXIDATION IN THE ORGANISM,

Among the chemical phenomena, varied as they are, which the living
organism presents to us there is one, that of oxidation, which is dis-
tinguished from all the rest by its generality of extent and its prepon-
derant importance; we may even Say that, so far as the higher animals
are concerned, oxidation is the essential chemical phenomenon of life
and the others are but of secondary character. - - - The principal
seat of vital activity is to be found in protoplasm submitted to the
action of oxygen. It is protoplasm which forms cells; it is by it that
they live and are nourished. As for the protoplasm itself, it derives
its material from the various forms of food, solid, liquid, and gaseous,
which are thus the prime source of the energy developed in the organ-
ism. - - - But before broaching the subject of chemical change as
it occurs in the organism let us first consider a simple phenomenon, and
one with which we are familiar; we shall thus make clearer the state-
ment which is to follow.

When we plunge a piece of perfectly pure and homogeneous zinc into
acidulated water, as long as the metal remains isolated in the liquid we
observe no reaction, save that at the first moment of introduction a
difference of electric potential is immediately established, but all is
limited to this.

If, on the other hand, we connect the zine with the acid by a sub-
stance less oxidizable than this metal, immediately an electric current
is set up and reaction between zine and acid takes place.

Simple contact then does not suffice to bring about reaction; it can
but produce a sort of orientation of tension, or, if one please so to put
it, a new state of equilibrium of the particles, in which there come in
an electro-motive force and a counter electro-motive force equal and
opposed thereto.

copra sill

ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 447

When the circuit is completed by means of a nonoxidizable or less

oxidizable substance this equilibrium is made an end of by doing
away with the counter electro-motive force, as a path of escape is offered
to the electricity; but the electric flow or current thus established
constitutes an available form of energy, which may be used to liberate
zine if we cause such current to act by a suitable arrangement upon an
easily decomposable zine salt.
- On condition, then, that we provide by a supply of supplementary
energy for the inevitable losses of effect resulting from these succes-
sive operations, we see that it is possible to form a cycle of reactions
corresponding at all points to our definition of vitality.

Tf, then, this definition give a true statement of the facts, must we
not come to recognize in the vital cycle the image of that which we
have just sketched. - - -

Let us consider a culture medium capable of maintaining the life of
a given cell by furnishing it with all the constituent material it requires,
and let us observe that in order to suitability of the medium for the
cell the former must contain at least the chemical elements which occur
as constituents of tlie latter.

As long as the cell is absent this medium may be compared to the
voltaic. battery with circuit unclosed, which we have taken as an
example by analogy. Like this latter, and by virtue of the same nat-
ural laws, it will present a state of equilibrium, due to the existence of
two opposite electrical forees—a kind of state of virtual combination
between the electro-positive and electro-negative constituents—but no
chemical change will disturb its original homogeneity.

Let us now suppose that the living cell is introduced. As soon as
equilibrium is overthrown displacements of electricity are set up, com-
binations and decompositions take place, and the vital circulation of
energy and matter is established.

To explain what has thus occurred we must assume, it seems to me,
that the first result of the introduction of the living germ or cell has
been to offer to the electricity conducting paths, or in other words, to
bring about what I will call odogenesis.! The first effect of vitality
would seem to be that of a contact action, allowing of chemical change
being energetically produced by favor of the short circuits offered to
the electrical energy engendered.

III.—OF THE PART PLAYED BY THE LIVING CELL.

Nevertheless, how can this take place, since the medium we have
under consideration continues inactive, the cell introduced reacting
only with the stratum of this medium with which it is in immediate
contact?

To explain this it is essential to remark that from the quite special
point of view at which we are just now placing ourselves we must

1 Odogenesis, the creation of a path, from 6dé6¢ and yéveoce.
448 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

logically think of the cell as chemically forming a part of the medium
by which it is surrounded, since it draws from thence, and continues to
draw from thence, the materials from which it is made up. The cell,
although distinct from the medium, is but a fraction of it. The chem-
ical medium thus extends to the cell which lives in it; the latter in
finding its way into the former has but set up a selection among the
constituent elements.

The fundamentally electro-positive materials go to form the substance
of the cell itself; the oxygen, or its electro-negative equivalent, remains
in the portion of the medium which is in intimate contact with the
matter of the cell, whether on the outside or on the inside of the
morphological element which it constitutes.

It follows then, clearly, from this remark that the cell is, properly
speaking, but the means of reaction presented to the medium, and,
further, that the path for electric conduction that we are looking for
must exist between the cell and the fractional part of the medium which
is in direct relation with it.

IV.—ON THE PART PLAYED BY SELECTIVE ELECTROLYSIS IN THE PEENOMENON OF
CELL NUTRITION.

But before we concern ourselves with this point we ought to look into
the phenomenon of cell nutrition and ask ourselves how it is that in
the complex medium that surrounds it on all sides the cell is able in
some way to choose the elementary particles which suit it; by what
directive influence these particles take up their positions and arrange
themselves in such a way as to become integral parts of an organized
structure; whence finally comes the impulse which determines the
special course of the vital circulation of matter and energy, allowing
the cell, on the one hand, to assimilate such or such a determinate con-
stituent from the medium, while at the same time it gives up, on the
other hand, some constituent which has just before formed a part of its
structure?

It is easy to reply to these questions if we go back to the inorganic
reaction between zine and acid, and take it as a new subject of com-
parison, imagining now the zine to be in a finely divided condition. We
have seen that in this case the acid, ready to combine with the zine, is
held in check by the electricity set free at the first moment of contact,
this electricity counterbalancing or neutralizing its chemical affinity.

We have the same state of things before us in the growing cell
surrounded by a nutrient medium. The albuminoids of the plasma
correspond to the finely divided zinc; the oxygen represents the acid
of the mineral illustration. .

When this oxygen, kept in the inactive state by favor of the albumi-
noids with which it is virtually associated, makes its way with them
into the domain of the cell and comes in contact with albuminoid
materials of the same kind, but more readily oxidizable for reasons
ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 449

which we shall see further on, it at once enters into combination with
them. It thus sets free new portions of albuminoid matter from the
virtual combination which it had formed with them, and these immedi-
ately take advantage of the electricity produced by the oxidation to
raise their own electric potential to such a point that they may be able
in consequence to take their places in turn in the structural edifice of
the cell thus endothermically built up. It is in this way that, quite
naturally, the cycle of reactions is established which constitutes the
rotation of changes in the living machine.

The mechanism which we have just explained shows how the chem-
ical changes which represent the nutrition of the cell take place in the
inmost recesses of the living substance itself, from atom to atom and
from molecule to molecule, producing, in place and step by step with
their occurrence, the electric energy needed for each ensuing reaction.

Following out this order of procedure, the cell may be said to with-
draw from the surrounding medium the nutrient materials which are
adapted to the different parts of its own substance by its proper
affinity, which I will call selective electrolytic power, but which is
merely the resultant of the previous electrical condition of the con-
stituents concerned. The dropping out of the one constituent neces-
sarily incites the reentrance of another precisely similar constituent.
Thanks to the continuity of the rotational change going on, each
particle of the cell passes in succession, all other things being equal,
through the same phases of condition with that which has preceded it,
from the moment of its admission to the substance of the cell up to
the moment when it becomes separated from it. Before being intro-
duced into the substance of the cell the atom must leave the virtual
combination in which it was held. It is precisely the disappearance of
the atom which precedes that furnishes to the one which follows it
the exact amount of energy required to effect its selective electrolysis
or its liberation from the state of virtual combination. Thus we shall
have concordance, referring to the possibilities of the case, between
what the one lacks in order to leave the medium and enter into the
substance of the cell and that which the other provides when it frees
itself from the combination in which it has been held in order to
engage itself in one more powerful; and, on the whole, quantitatively
speaking, there will be a certain available excess of energy on the
latter side. It follows from this that the points of accretion, howsoever
distributed as to position in the protoplasm, always retain their iden-
tity both in composition and structure; and, as the same causes every-
where bring about the same effects, the whole cell must reproduce
itself indefinitely with maintenance of its identity if the nutrient
medium remain on its part constant in character and the process of
transformation goon. - - - .

The preceding hasty sketch sufficiently shows, I think, that it is
legitimate to compare, as I have done at the outset, the mechanism of

Sm 94—_—_29
450 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE.

vital activity to that of a single element of a voltaic battery, when
once we recognize in the living cell the special part which I have
assumed it to play. - - -

I believe that these general considerations will suffice to render intel-
ligible, and in a provisional way to justify, the mode in which I con-
ceive of the mechanism of life, with the aid of the physical and chemical
forces of nature only, and without invoking any mysterious or extra-
natural cause. - - -

THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN AGENTS IN DESTROYING
Rat oVvITAGEEY OF THE TYPHOID AND OF THE COLON
3 ACILLUS. !

By JOHN 8S. BILLINGS and ADELAIDE WARD PECKHAM.

During the last year a series of researches upon the influence of light,
of desiccation, and of the products of certain micro-organisms upon the
vitality of some cf the pathogenic bacteria has been earried on in the
laboratory of hygiene of the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Adelaide
W. Peckham, in accordance with a general scheme for such investiga-
tion prepared by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Billings, the director of
the laboratory, and with the aid of a grant from the Bache fund.

That direct sunlight kills or stops the growth of certain bacteria has
been known since 1877, when Downes and Blunt presented to the
Royal Society a report on “Researches on the effect of ight upon bae-
teria and other organisms.”? Since that date a number of papers on
this subject have been published, the most important one in relation to
the typhoid bacillus being that of Janowski in 1890.2 The first series of
experiments by Dr. Peckham was made with the staphylococcus pyo-
genes aureus, the object being mainly to determine the best methods of
investigation.

Photobacteriographs were made by Buchner’s method, namely, by
placing a square of black paper, or of glass of different colors, upon
the bottom of a plate containing inoculated agar-agar during insola-
tion; but although the protected portion was visible after fifteen min-
utes’ insolation and incubation for twenty-four hours, and sharply
defined after two hours’ insolation and incubation as before, no accu-
rate estimate could be made of the difference in the destructive power
of different periods of insolation. Successful photobacteriography
requires inoculation of large quantities of bacteria, in order that the
colonies Iinay be set so closely together that a ground-glass sp be aac’

is produced, in which case counting of the colonies is practically
impossible.

For this reason the following method was used for each of the three
organisms, the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, the bacillus coli com-
munis, and the bacillus typhi abdominalis.

To obtain an accurate measure of the effects produced by lights of
different intensity or of different colors, it 1s necessary to insure, as far
as possible, that the bacteria to be experimented on shall be uniformly
distributed in the culture media. Tubes containing each 10 ¢. c. of
bouillon were inoculated with one drop of a bouillon culture and then
placed in an incubator for twenty-four hours. A small quantity of
sterilized gravel was then added to the culture tube and it was thor-
oughly shaken, after which 10 ¢. ¢. of a one-half per cent salt solution
was added and the culture drawn into a Nuttall’s dropping apparatus.
From this one-twentieth of 1 ¢. ¢. of the bouillon culture was dropped into
a tube of melted agar-agar, which was slowly and thoroughly agitated,
and the contents were then poured into a Petri dish, carefully leveled
on a leveling tripod over ice water. In the first method used the Petri
dishes were found to be so uneven on the bottom that the layer of
medium under the protective square was often very thick or very thin
as compared with that about the circumference of the plate, and there-
fore comparisons made between the center and the circumference would
be in almost every case unreliable. To overcome this difficulty just
one-half of the plate was shaded with black paper or colored glass.

The plates were then exposed to sunlight bottom upward, so as to
allow the sun to shine as directly as possible on the inoculated agar-
agar. At intervals of fifteen minutes a plate was removed and placed
in the incubator. The temperature of the plates during insolation was
always below 34° C., as shown by a thermometer with a blackened
bulb which was placed in the sun and the temperature noted every
fifteen minutes. Sunny, still days were utilized for insolation, begin-
ning at 10 a. m., during the mouths of October, November, and Decem-
ber. After insolation the plates, and also a noninsolated control plate,
were incubated for twenty-four hours.

The colonies were counted in the following manner: A No. 1 eye-
piece was divided into fields (as done by Nuttall in counting tubercle
bacilli) by introducing a disk of black cardboard which had a square
opening divided into four parts by two hairs placed at right angles.
This eyepiece and an objective of low power were used in counting.
The percentage of germs destroyed by insolation was estimated from
the mean of four counts taken on both the insolated and the protected
halves of the plate. By this method an accurate statement can be
made regarding the difference in protective power given by the differ-
ent colors, not from simple observation, but by comparison of a definite
number of colonies counted.

I*rom this series of experiments the following results were obtained:

Insolation for fifteen minutes destroys to a slight extent each of the
three organisms experimented upon. Two hours’ insolation destroys
98 per cent of the germs and from three to six hours kills all. The
colon bacillus is more easily destroyed by insolation than is the typhoid
bacillus. Exposure to diffuse daylight, to gaslight, or to the incandes-
cent electric hght produces little effect. Red, orange, yellow, and green
light produce little effect during two hours insolation; while the blue
and violet rays kill nearly as rapidly and as certainly as full sunlight.
Insolation from six to eight hours lessens the number of colonies under
the protective square to a slight extent, for the colors red, orange,
yellow, and green.

Plates were made in the same manner and exposed to diffused light
for periods varying from fifteen minutes to two days. The exposure
was made on clear sunny days in the light part of a room. In this
experiment the result was negative, the number of colonies on the two
sides of the plate being approximately the same.

An ordinary gas-burner and an incandescent light were each used as
the source of illumination. The plates were placed bottom upward in
a dark room near the light used. Illumination for sixteen hours with
gas produced no effect on the growth of the organism as shown by
counting of the colonies.

Illumination for four and one-half hours with an incandescent light
also gave negative results.

A series of experiments was made with tubes of bouillon inoculated
with the different organisms and then inclosed in larger tubes contain-
ing fluids of different colors—red, orange, yellow, and blue—which were
exposed to sunlight with control tubes, one placed in water and the

454 DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS.

other in a similar tube covered with black paper. The materials used
for making the colored solutions were corallin, chromate and bichro-
mate of potassium, and methylene blue. From these tubes plates were
made, and the number of colonies counted.

It was found that an increase in the number of colonies continued to
the eighteenth day, the number being greater in the colon and aureus
cultures than in the typhoid. The colonies then began to decrease, and
on the fifty-eighth day the plates contained but few colonies. In this
experiment, as in the last, plates made from culture tubes placed i in
blue fluid showed fewer colonies.

Since the presentation of the above results, with details, charts, and
tables, to the National Academy, in April, 1894, Dr. Dieudonné has
published, in the Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte, a
paper on the effects of sunlight on bacteria, in which he reports results
substantially the same, and obtained by almost the same methods as
those of Dr. Peckham.

Sunlight not only weakens or kills the typhoid and the colon bacillus,
but it affects culture media so as to render them less capable of sup-
porting the growth of these organisms. Dr. Peckham found that
sterile bouillon insolated from one to ten days and then inoculated with
the bacillus typhi abdominalis showed no diminution in the number of
colonies as compared with a control plate made from a similar culture
not so exposed. Twenty days insolation and then inoculation with the
typhoid bacillus showed great, decrease in the number of colonies on
all the plates; some of them were sterile. Insolation of forty days,
and inoculation in the same manner, gave very few colonies for each
plate, probably the same as the number of germs introduced—i. e., there
had been no development. Bouillon insolated fifty to sixty days and
inoculated gave sterile tubes. This insolated bouillon after inoculation
and incubation remained perfectly clear, and plates made after a week

of incubation gave no more colonies than those made at the end of

twenty-four hours. Its reaction was alkaline, but not intensely so.
Insolated agar-agar.—Of twenty-three tubes of agar-agar insolated
twenty days and then inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis,
all except one remained sterile, and neither the bacillus typhi abdom-
inalis nor the bacillus coli communis grew when inoculated in stripes on
these piates. Of seven tubes of agar-agar insolated forty days and

then inoculated with the bacillus of typhoid, all remained sterile. On °

four of these plates mold appeared after some days. Of seven tubes
of agar-agar insolated forty days and then inoculated and incubated as
before, all remained sterile.

Insolated gelatin.—Of ten gelatin tubes insolated forty days and then
inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis, six remained sterile, two
contained a few colonies of bacillus typhi abdominalis, and two were
contaminated,

io

The insolated bouillon was then kept in diffuse daylight for forty
days and again inoculated with the typhoid bacillus. Within twenty-
four hours the tubes of bouillon became turbid and plates made from
them showed innumerable colonies.

It is difficult to account for the effect of insolation on culture media,
Roux in his experiments on anthrax found that insolation of bouillon
for two or three hours rendered it unsuitable for germination of the
spores, but if the bacilli were introduced they would thrive. He attrib-
utes this alteration to some chemical change which the culture media
undergo during the insolation. He found also that if the insolated
media were kept in the dark or in diffuse daylight for a time, the orig-
inal nutritive qualities were restored and germination of spores would
take place. Geisler and Janowski observed the bactericidal properties
of insolated media, but the latter could find no chemical alteration in
such media.

Perey Frankland in his chapter on action of light on micro-organisms!
concludes from the results obtained by many investigators ‘‘that the
effect is due to a process of oxidation possibly brought about through
the agency of ozone or peroxide of hydrogen, or both; that all appar-
ently direct low temperature oxidations require the presence of water.
And inasmuch as the bactericidal action of light is unquestionably a
case of low temperature oxidation, there is the strongest presumptive
evidence, as well as weighty experimental evidence, that moisture,
which practically means the possibility of the presence of peroxide of
hydrogen, or of Some similar material, is essential for its manifesta-
tion.”? Westbrook ? found that old broth enltures of the tetanus bacil-
lus in an atmosphere of hydrogen were not in the least affected by
exposure to sunlight, either in regard to their virulence or their rapid-
ity of growth on reinoculation.

When the same culture was sealed up in the presence of air the
micro-organisms were not only killed, but the material was completely
harmless when inoculated into white mice. It was however, possible
to obtain vigorous and virulent growths from cultures which had been
nade quite innocuous by the action of the sun. Oxygen was used up
in the process. Under ordinary circumstances one might be tempted
to explain the effect of sunlight in destroying bacteria by the drying of
the organisms exposed to it. especially in the case of those bacteria
which do not form spores, but our experiments show that desiccation

*Gelatin, to which were added different amounts of the peroxide of hydrogen, was
inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis and poured into plates. Whose
plates in which more than one part of the peroxide to 5,000 of gelatin was used
were sterile.

456 DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS.

for months has little effect on the vitality of the typhoid or of the
colon bacillus. To determine the influence of desiccation upon these
organisms, and also upon the staphylococcus aureus, the following
experiments were made:

Bouillon cultures of the bacillus typhi abdominalis, the bacillus coli
communis, and the staphylococcus aureus were roughly dried on threads
1 em. long and then desiccated, a portion being placed in a vacuum,
another portion in a desiccator over sulphuric acid, and a third in a
closet; all were kept in the dark. The result of the desiccation under
the three different conditions is as follows:

Bacillus typhi abdominalis.—Lived in a vacuum from December 30
until July 24, or 207 days; in a desiccator over sulphuric acid from
January 3 until July 24, or 213 days; in a closet from December 18
until July 24, or 229 days.

Bacillus coli communis.—Lived in a vacuum from November 29 until
May 30, or 183 days; in a desiccator over sulphuric acid from January
3 until July 24, or 213 days; ina closet from December 30 until May 30,
or 152 days.

Staphylococcus aureus.—Lived in a vacuum from November 29 until
July 24, or 207 days; in a desiccator over sulphuric acid from October
25 until April 19, or 178 days; in a closet from February 13 until
July 24, or 162 days.

Tt will be seen from these experiments that the organisms experi-
mented on endure desiccation for five months, or more, without losing
their vitality, and hence the slight evaporation which may have
occurred in the insolation experiments had probably no influence on
the results.

It is evident that sunshine must exercise considerable influence in
destroying bacteria on the surface of soil, streets, ete., exposed to its
influence, but its action is almost confined to the surface, as appears
from the results obtained by Esmarch in attempts to disinfect bedding
and clothing by this agency. While the light from an incandescent
electric lamp has little germicidal effect, that from a powerful are lamp
produces effects similar to those of sunlight, and it has been proposed
to use this means to disinfect the walls of infected rooms. The bacillus
of tuberculosis appears to be more quickly destroyed by light than the
typhoid or the colon bacillus, being killed by exposure to simple diffused
daylight in about a week,!' and this fact should be borne in mind in
advising measures to prevent the diffusion of this organism.

The investigations upon the typhoid and the colon bacilli referred
to in this paper were undertaken as part of a general scheme of inquiry
to ascertain the agencies which tend to destroy the typhoid bacillus
when it is introduced into a source of water supply, as, for example,
into a running stream. An important part of this investigation relates

‘Ueber bacteriologische Forschung: Vortrag in der ersten allgem. Sitzung des X.
intcernationalen Congress, 1890.

DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS. 457

to the influence of the common water bacteria or of their products
upon the vitality of the typhoid bacillus.

A research relating to the influence of the common water bacteria or
of their products upon the vitality of the typhoid and colon bacilli was
then undertaken. Three series of experiments were made, the first to
ascertain whether the typhoid and colon bacilli would grow on media
containing the products of growth of the water bacteria; the second to
verify the first, to meet any objection that might be raised as to the
sterilization by heat of the medium in which the water organisms had
grown, as the opinion has been advanced that some products of the
activity of bacteria are either volatile or rendered inert by high tem--
peratures. The third experiment was made to find whether the two
organisms would grow with the water bacteria. These series of experi-
ments were conducted in the following manner:

(1) Forty-four varieties of bacteria obtained from the water of the
Schuylkill River were used in the first experiment. A pure culture of
each organism was inoculated upon slanted tubes of agar-agar and
allowed to attain a luxuriant growth. The tubes were then thoroughly
sterilized in the steam sterilizer, the reaction was taken, and the
medium was again slanted. A set of these tubes was then inoculated
with the bacillus typhi abdominalis, and a second set with the bacillus
coli communis. As aresult of this research it was found that the
typhoid and colon bacilli grew upon these tubes in every instance, the
growths varying in thriftiness from luxuriant ones on some tubes to
transparent films on others.

(2) In the second series which were made to verify the first—that is,
to find whether the products of the activity of water bacteria in the
medium used would retard or prevent the growth of the typhoid and
colon bacilli—the water bacteria were inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks
of bouillon, each containing 70 ¢. ¢., and placed in the incubator. After
being incubated from fifteen to twenty days the cultures were filtered
through porcelain, the reaction was taken, and the filtrate was run into
sterilized tubes. Two sets were made as before and inoculated with
the typhoid and the colon bacilli, respectively. These tubes were then
incubated for twenty-four hours, and from them gelatin tubes were
inoculated and poured into Petri plates. In each of these inoculated
filtrates the two organisms grew in a characteristic manner and multi-
plied for at least four days.

(3) In the third experiment thirty-nine varieties of the water bacteria
were inoculated into tubes, each containing 10 ¢. ¢., of sterilized tap
water and 5 drops of sterilized bouillon. Two sets of tubes were made
as before, and each set inoculated with one of the organisms which was
being tested, and each tube contained a different variety of water bac-
teria. From these tubes gelatin plates were made each day for more
than twelve days. Both bacilli gave characteristic colonies with each of
the water organisms except two, which had apparently an antagonistic
458 DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS.

effect upon their development. They were both members of the sub-
tilis group. In other members of this group this peculiarity was absent.
The typhoid bacillus in several instances outlived its associate organism.
In one instance a gelatin plate made from a tube of sterilized bouillon
inoculated with the typhoid bacillus and a water bacterium one hundred
and sixty days previously, gave characteristic colonies of the bacillus
typhi abdominalis.

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK IN THE
TREATMENT OF DISEASES OF THB HEART AND CIRCU-
LATION,!

By Dr. TS LAUDER, BRUNTON, EF) R38.

This annual meeting in memory of Harvey is usually associated with
feelings of pleasure and happiness, for it was intended by its immortal
founder to commemorate the benefactors of the college and to encourage
good fellowship among us.

Such commemoration of those who have benefited the college in the
past, although it necessarily recalls many who have passed away, is,
notwithstanding, on ordinary occasions, pleasant instead of painful,
because the feeling of loss through their death is completely over-
powered by the recollection of the good they have done im their lifetime.
To-day the case is very different, for the first thought that must needs
occur to everyone present here is that on this occasion last year our
late president showed for the first time what seemed to be imperfect
fulfillment of his duty to the college by being late in his attendance at
the meeting. Perhaps nothing else could have shown more clearly his
deep concern for the welfare of the college and his thorough devotion
of every faculty of mind and body to its interests than the fact that
no duty, no pleasure, and no press of occupation could tempt him to
leave one iota of his work in the college undone. The only thing that
did keep him back was the hand of death, which, although at the last
meeting he and we knew it not, was already laid upon him. Though
his death was less happy than that of the great Harvey, inasmuch as
he lingered on for days instead of hours after he was first struck down,
yet their deaths were alike in this respect that, up to the time of the
fatal attack, each was in the full possession of his faculties, each was
in the enjoyment of his life. Like Radeliffe and Mead, like Halford
and Baillie, and like many other distinguished fellows of this college,
the greatness of Clark is to be estimated not by the published works
which he has left behind but by the influence he exerted on his con-

temporaries. For the very estimation in which his professional skill
was held led to his whole time being taken up in giving advice and
prevented him from having the leisure to work out or record the results
of the pathological and clinical observations which both his youthful
publications and his later-career showed him to be specially fitted to
make. I might say very much more about him, but it has already been
said much better than I conld possibly do it by yourself, Mr. President,
in your annual address and in the eloquent and heart-stirring words
which you addressed to the college on the occasion of your taking the
presidential chair rendered vacant by the death of Sir Andrew Clark.

But while we were saddened to-day by the death of our late presi-
dent we hope to be gladdened by the presence among us again of one
whom we all reverence not only as a former president of this college,
but as one of the greatest leaders of clinical medicine in this century,
Sir William Jenner. Like Harvey, Sir William Jenner is honored by
his college, by his country, by lis sovereign, and by the world at
large. In times of trial and danger the lives of the royal children
were committed to the keeping of Harvey by his king, and to-day the
care not only of her own life but of that of her nearest and dearest is
committed to Sir William Jenner by his sovereign in the full and well-
grounded assurance that in no other hands could they be more safe.
The great clinician, Graves, wished to have as his epitaph, “He fed
fevers;” but Jenner has advanced much beyond Graves, and by show-
ing us how to feed the different kinds of fevers has saved thousands
of valuabie lives. To-day this college is acknowledging his right to
rank with Sydenham, Heberden, Bright, and Garrod by bestowing
upon him the Moxon medal for clinical research. In numbering Sir
William among its medalists the college honors itself as well as him,
and in acknowledging the great services he has rendered, it is, on this
occasion, acting as the mouthpiece of the medical profession not only
in this country, but in the world at large. ;

It was with the wish to keep green the memory of the benefactors of
the college that this oration was instituted by Harvey, and not at all with
the intention that it should be devoted to his own praise. But Harvey
stands out so high above all others that it is only natural that in the
numerous orations which have been yearly given before the College of
Physicians, the subject-matter should have been to a great extent con-
fined to a consideration of Harvey and his works. On looking over
many of these orations I find that everything I could say about Har-
vey—his person, his circumstances, lis character, and his works—has
already been said so fully and eloquently that I could not add to it any-
thing further, nor could IT hope to express it even so well. I purpose,
therefore, to consider to-day some of the modern developments of Har-
vey’s work, more especially in relation to the treatment of diseases of
the heart and circulation. There is, I think, a certain advantage in
this also, inasmuch as one is apt by considering Harvey’s work only as
MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. 461

he left it to overlook the enormous extent to which it now influences
our thoughts and actions, and thus to comprehend its value very
imperfectly.

As he himself says, *‘ From a small seed springs a mighty tree; from
the minute gemmule or apex of the acorn, how wide does the gnarled
oak at length extend his arms, how loftily does he lift his branches to
the sky, how deeply do his roots strike down into the ground!” !

How very minute is the gemmule from which has sprung everything
that is definite in medical science, for this gemmule is no other than the
idea which Harvey records in these simple words, “I began to think
whether there might not be motion, as it were, in a circle.”

Out of this idea has grown all our knowledge of the processes of
human life in health and disease, of the signs and symptoms which

indicate disease, of the mode of action of the drugs and appliances
_which we use and the proper means of employing them in the cure of

disease. In the works that have come down to us we find that Harvey
developed his idea physiologically in several directions. He discussed
its application to the absorption and distribution of nourishment
through the body, the mixing of blood from various parts, the main-
tenance and distribution of animal heat, and excretion through the
kidneys. How far he developed it in the direction of pathology and
therapeutics we do not know, as the results of his labors on these sub-

jects have, unfortunately, been lost tous by the destruction of his

manuscripts during the civil war.

We are proud to reckon Harvey as an Englishman by birth, but he
is far too great to belong exclusively to any country; men of various
nations and scattered all over the face of the earth acknowledge him as
their teacher, and have played, or are playing, a part in developing his
discovery in its various branches of physiology, pathology, pharma-
cology, semeiology, and therapeutics. Americans, Austrians, Danes,
Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Norwegians, Russians, and
Swedes have all shared in the work, and so numerous are they that it
would be impossible for me to name them all. Stephen Hales, how-
ever, deserves special mention, for he was the first to measure the pres-
sure of blood in the arteries, and the resistance offered to the circula-
tion of the blood by the capillaries was investigated by Thomas Young,
a fellow of this college, who ranks with Harvey, Newton, and Darwin
as one of the greatest scientific men that England has ever produced,
and whose undulatory theory has been as fertile of results in physies
as Harvey’s idea of circulation has been in physiology and medicine.

Harvey’s desire that those who had done good work should not be
forgotten was founded upon his knowledge of mankind, and of the tend-
ency there is to forget what has already been done by those who have
gone before us. The opposite condition often prevails, and the past is
glorified at the expense of the present. But sometimes the present is

1The Works of W. Harvey, Sydenham Society’s edition, page 320.

462 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK.

wrongly glorified at the expense of the past, and past work or past
benefits are forgotten.

Good examples of this are afforded by physiological views regarding
the action of the vena cava and pulmonary veins and the causation of
the cardiac sounds. Harvey appears to have thought that the vena
cava and pulmonary veins were simply dilated passively by the pas-
sage of blood into them; but the fact that they possess.a power of inde-
pendent pulsation was known to Haller,'and was brought prominently
forward by Senac,? who regards the vena cava as the starting point of
the whole circulation. He says: “The vena cava is therefore the first
motor cause which dilates.the cavities of the heart; it fills the auricles,
and extends their walls in every direction.”

These observations appear to have been almost forgotten until they
were again made independently a few years ago,’ and in one of the

latest and most accurate physiological treatises which now exist the.

description of the cardiac cycle is nearly the same as that given by
Senac. “A complete beat of the whole heart, or cardiac cycle, may be
observed to take place as follows:

‘The great veins, inferior and superior vene cave, and pulmonary
veins are seen, while full of blood, to contract in the neighborhood of
the heart; the contraction runs In a peristaltic wave toward the auri-
cles, increasing 1m intensity as it goes.” *

The pulsation of these veins, however, can not be a constant phe-
nomenon, or it would have been noticed by such a keen observer as
Harvey.

The sounds of the heart were discovered by Harvey, or at least were
known to him, for he speaks of the sound caused in the esophagus of
the horse by drinking, and says: “In the same way it is with each
motion of the heart, when there is a delivery of blood from the veins
to the arteries, that a pulse takes place and can be heard within the
chest.” This observation remained, as far as we know, without any
further development until the time of Laennec, who introduced the
practice of auscultation; but it was a fellow of this college, Dr. Wol-
laston,® who first discovered that the muscles during contraction give
out a sound; and although many observations were made regarding
cardiac murmurs by Corrigan, Bouillaud, and Piorry, it was chiefly by
fellows of this college, Dr. Clendinning, Dr. C. J. B. Williams, and Dr.
Todd, that the question was finally settled, and the conclusions at which
they arrived are those now accepted as correct, viz, that “the first or
systolic sound is essentially caused by the sudden and forcible tight-
ening of the muscular fibers of the ventricle when they contract; and
that the second sound which accompanies the diastole of the ventricle

depends solely on the reaction of the arterial columns of blood in the
semilunar valves at the arterial orifices.” !

Yet in recent discussions regarding the origin of cardiac sounds little
mention has been made of the work of this committee; and, indeed, I
first learned of the value of the work from a German source, Wagner’s
Handworterbuch der Physiologie.

The importance of these observations in the diagnosis of heart dis-
ease it would be hard to overestimate. But diagnosis alone is not the
aim of the physician, whose object must be to prevent, to cure, or to
control disease. A knowledge of physiology may greatly help us to
prevent disease, not only of the heart and vessels, but of every member
of the body. The control and cure of disease may also be efteeted by
diet and regimen, but it is undoubtedly in many cases greatly assisted
by the use of drugs, and is sometimes impossible without them, Har-
vey knew that drugs applied externally are absorbed and act on the
body,” so that colocynth thus applied will purge and cantharides will
excite the urine; but the action of drugs when injected into the blood
appears to have been tried first by Christopher Wren, better known as
the arehitect of St. Paul’s than as a pharmacologist. According to
Bishop Spratt, “He was the first author of the noble anatomical experi-
ment of injecting liqours into the veins of animals, an experiment now
vulgarly known, but long since exhibited to the meetings at Oxford,
and thence carried by some Germans and published abroad. By this
operation divers creatures were immediately purged, vomited, intoxi-
cated, killed, or revived, according to the quality of the liquor injected.
Hence arose many new experiments, and chiefly that of transfusing
blood, which the society has prosecuted in sundry instances, that will
probably end in extraordinary success.” *

The method originated by Wren, of injecting drugs into the circula-
tion, was skillfully utilized by Magendie for the purpose of localizing
the particular part of the body upon which the drugs exerted their
action, and he thus conclusively proved that the symptoms produced
by strychnine were due to its effect on the spinal cord. His experi-
ments showed that the rate of absorption from various parts of the
body varied enormously, and, through the teaching of Christison, led
to the introduction into practice by Dr. Alexander Wood of that most
useful aid to modern therapeutics, the hypodermic syringe.

The first quantitative experiments on the effect of drugs upon the
circulation were made, to the best of my knowledge, by James Blake,
in 1844, in the laboratory of University College, at the suggestion of
the late Professor Sharpey, with the hemadynamometer of Poiseuille,
which had then been recently introduced.

464 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK.

In speaking about the work of Blake and Sharpey, who are both
dead, one requires to use the greatest care not to unduly detract from
the merit of one by ascribing more to the other; but those who knew
Professor Sharpey’s enormous range of knowledge, his readiness to put
it all at the disposal of others, and the influence he exerted upon all
who came in contact with him, as well as his unselfishness in making
no Claim whatever to*what was justly his due, will at once recognize
how greatly Blake was indebted to Sharpey. More especially is this
the case when we consider that, although the credit for the observa-
tions themselves belongs to Blake, yet after the impetus which Sharpey
gave him had passed away, he did very little more during the course
of along life. It seems all the more necessary to commemorate Sharpey
on this occasion, because he has left comparatively few writings behind
him, and anyone who should judge by them alone of his influence upon
physiological progress in this country would grievously underestimate
it; for Sharpey was above all a teacher, and his work was written not
with pen and ink on paper or parchment, but was engraved upon the
hearts and minds of his pupils and friends. Upon two of these, espe-
cially, has Sharpey’s mantle fallen, and to Burdon-Sanderson and Michael
Foster we owe a revival of experimental physiology in this country, a
revival of the method which Harvey not only used in making his great
discovery, but also employed to demonstrate the truth of it to the rulers
of this land. By their writings, by their lectures, by their original
experiments, by their demonstrations, and by the pupils they have
trained, Burdon-Sanderson and Michael Foster, under the auspices of
Acland and Humphrey, have diffused among the medical men of this
country a knowledge of physiology so extensive and exact as could
only be found before their time among those who had made a special
study of the subject. Yet more than to them, more than to anyone
else since the time of Harvey, do we owe our present knowledge of the
circulation to Carl Ludwig. He it is who first enabled the pressure of
blood in the arteries to record its own variations automatically, so that
alterations could be noticed and measured which were too rapid or too
slight to be detected by the eye. -To him also we owe the plan of arti-
ficial circulation, by which the changes in the functions of the organs
and in the vessels which supply them can be observed quite apart from
the heart, lungs, or from the nervous system.

Like Sharpey, Ludwig is a great teacher, and like the great architects
of the Middle Ages, who built the wonderful cathedrals which all
admire, and the builder of which no man knows, Ludwig has been con-
tent to sink his own name in his anxiety for the progress of his work
and in his desire to aid his pupils. The researches which have appeared
under these pupils’ names have been in many instances, perhaps in most,
not only suggested by Ludwig, but carried out experimentally with his
own hands, and the paper which recorded the results finally written by
himself. In the papers which have appeared under his pupils’ names we
find their obligations to the master recorded in such terms as ‘ unter

Mitwirkung.” But no one except those who have worked with him ean
understand what such cooperation meant.

The graphic method introduced by Ludwig for the purpose of measur-
ing the blood pressure was adapted by Volkmann to the registration of
the pulse in man, and the same method has been modified and rendered
more easily applicable at the bedside by Marey and Chauveau, to whom
we chiefly owe our knowledge of the modifications in the form of the
apex beat and of the pulse curve. It is to Ludwig and his scholars,
however, that we owe the greater part of our knowledge of the mechan-
ism of the circulation and of the varying distribution of the blood in

rarious parts of the body.

The effect of emotion upon the heart was carefully noted by Harvey,
who says: ‘For every affection of the mind which is attended with
pain or pleasure, hope or fear is the cause of an agitation whose influ-
ence extends to the heart.” !

-Not only was Harvey well acquainted with the fact that the beats of
the heart vary very much in strength and force, but he also knew that
the circulation in various parts of the body may be very different at
one and the same time. He says:

“Tt is manifest that the blood in its course does not everywhere pass
with the same celerity, neither with the same force in all places and at
all times, but that it varies greatly according to age, sex, temperament,
habit of body, and other contingent circumstances, external as well as
internal, natural or nonnatural. For it does not course through intri-
cate and obstructed passages with the same readiness that it does
through straight, unimpeded, and pervious channels. Neither does it
run through close, hard, and crowded parts with the same velocity as
through spongy, soft, and permeable tissues. Neither does it flow and
penetrate with such swiftness when the impulse (of the heart) is slow
and weak, as when this is forcible and frequent, in which case the blood
is driven onwards with vigor and in large quantity.

‘And what, indeed, is more deserving of attention than the fact that
in almost every affection, appetite, hope, or fear, our body suffers, the
countenance changes, and the blood appears to course hither and
thither? In anger, the eyes are fiery and the pupils contracted; in
modesty, the cheeks are suffused with blushes; in fear and under a
sense of infamy and of shame, the face is pale, but the ears burn asif
for the evil they heard or were to hear; in lust, how quickly is the
member distended with blood and erected.”

Harvey’s great contemporary, Milton, though so violently opposed to
him in politics, would certainly not remain in ignorance of Harvey’s
work, and he has noted the changes in the color of the face produced
by emotions. In describing the behavior of Satan on his journey from
hell to Paradise, he says:

Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face,
Thrice changed with pale—ire, envy, and despair,
Which marr’d his borrow’d visage.3

But although these facts were kuown to Harvey so long ago, it is
only in comparatively recent years that the mechanism by which they
are brought about has been investigated, and it is only within the last
deeade that physiologists have begun regularly to believe that the
cardiac muscle has a power of rhythmic pulsation independent of its
nerves, although Harvey had noted that when the heart was cut into
small pieces the fragments would still continue to pulsate. We may
fairly, indeed, compare the movements of the heart, as regarded by
physiologists of the present day, to those of a horse, which is capable
of going independently, although its pace may be slowed or accelerated
by the reins or spur of the rider. The power of the vagus to act as a
rein to the heart, and slow its movements or stop them altogether, was
first noted by Edward and Ernest Heinrich Weber, while the effect
that it sometimes has of accelerating instead of slowing, like the effect
of shaking the reins of the horse, was observed by Schiff, Moleschott,
and Lister.

The accelerating nerves of the heart, and the position of the nerve
center from which they spring, were more thoroughly investigated by
von Bezold,! while the power of the vagus to weaken as well as slow the

heart was observed by Gaskell. The position of the cardiac center, —

which, like the rider, regulates the movements of the heart, was located
in the medulla oblongata chietly by Ludwig and his scholars. Like the
heart, the vessels also are regulated in diameter by the nervous system
in accordance with the wants of the body generally; and the effect
upon the vasomotor nerves, which when cut allow them to dilate and
when stimulated cause them to contract, was discovered by Bernard,
Brown-Séquard, and by our countryman, Waller; while the power of
other nerves to cause immediate dilatation was discovered by Bernard,
Eckhardt, and Ludwig in the submaxillary glands, penis, and periph-
eral vessels, respectively.

The heart when cut out of the body still continues to beat, and the
transmission of excitation from one cavity to another was experimented
on by Paget, although removed completely from the influence of the cen-
tral nervous system, and the vessels have a somewhat similar power of
independent contractility. The alterations produced in the circulation
generally and locally by the contractile power of the vessels and the
changes caused in the vessels by the central nervous system by periph-
eral stimulation of the nerves or by variations in the quality of the
blood have formed the subject of a series of researches extending over
many years, and though originated and in many cases entirely conducted
by Ludwig have appeared to a great extent under the names of his pupils.
The starting point of these investigations was an examination of the
changes in the blood as it flowed through isolated organs, with the view
of ascertaining in what manner the combustion by which the animal heat

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. A67

is maintained was effected in the body. While keeping up the circulation
of blood through the vessels of muscles severed from the body, Ludwig
and Sezelkow! observed variations in the flow which appeared to indi-
cate contractile power in the vessels themselves. This research was
carried on under Ludwig’s direction by various of his scholars in sue-
cession, Alexander Schmidt, Dogiel, Sadler, myself, Hafiz, Lépine, A.
Mosso, von Frey, and Gaskell. Their observations, as well as those of
Cohnheimn and Gunning, lave shown that the muscular fibers of the
arterioles, not only in the muscles but throughout the body generally,
have a power of independent and sometimes rhythmical contraction
and relaxation. Their contractility is, however, controlled by the cen-
tral nervous system in accordance with the wants of the body generally,
for the amount of blood contained in tlre body is insufficient to fill the
whole of the vascular system at once, and when the vessels are fully
dilated, as they are after death, we find that nearly the whole of the
blood of the body may be contained in the veins alone. It is therefore
necessary that when one part of the body is receiving a larger supply
of blood another should be receiving a smaller supply; and the fune-
tions of the vaso motor centers have been well compared by Ludwig to
the turncocks in a great city, who cut off the water supply from one dis-
trict at the same time they turn it on to another. Thus it is that when
the brain is active the feet may get cold, and Mosso has shown this
in an exceedingly neat manner by placing a man on a large board deli-
‘ately balanced at its center, and demonstrating that whenever the man
began to think the increased supply of blood to his brain caused the
head to go down and the heels to rise up. A similar condition was
indicated by Mayow, who gave a different explanation. He said that
the vital spirits were not able to be in the same place at once, and there.
fore it happens that if aman eats a heavy meal he is apt to become
drowsy, because the vital spirits descend from the brain to the stomach
in order to carry on digestion; and, on the other hand, if a man thinks
vigorously after dinner the vital spirits have to leave the stomach to go
to the brain, and consequently digestion is imperfectly performed. If
we substitute the word blood for vital spirits we have an exact expres-
sion of present physiological ideas.

Ubi stimulus ibi affluxus was an old doctrine and expressed a great
truth. Wherever the need for increased nourishment or increased sup-
ply of oxygen exists in the healthy body, thither does the blood flow in
larger quantities than usual. If the glands are active their blood sup-
ply is greatly increased, as was shown by Bernard, and a similar occur-
rence takes place in the contracting muscle, as has been shown by
Ludwig and his scholars. The vessels of the intestines and of the
skin, with their numerous glands, have their caliber regulated by the
vasomotor nerves which proceed from the center in the medulla oblon-

468 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK.

gata. This center acts most readily upon the vessels of the intestine,
and rather less readily on those of the skin. In consequence of this,
when the center is irritated, the vessels of the intestine contract and
drive the blood through the skin, so that it is warmer than before,
and it is only when the stimulation is very great that the vessels
of both contract so that the skin receives less blood than normal
and becomes colder than before. But if the vessels of the skin and
intestine are both contracted, where does the blood go? This ques-
tion was put by Ludwig, and answered by. the experiments which
he made with Hafiz. It is evident that if the heart be stopped while
the blood pressure is being measured in the artery of an animal the
pressure will fall regularly and steadily, because the blood is flowing
out all the time through the arterioles and capillaries into the veins.
One would naturally expect that if the arterioles were contracted by
irritation of the vasomotor centers in the medulla the fall of blood
pressure would either not take place at all or would be very much
slower than before; but on trying the experiment, Ludwig and Hafiz
found to their surprise that the blood pressure fell almost as quickly as
when the vasomotor center was left alone, and the vessels of the skin
and intestine therefore remained uncontracted. In other words, the
vessels which supply the muscles of the body and limbs are capable of
such extension that when fully dilated they will allow the arterial blood
to pour through them alone nearly as quickly as it usually does through
the vessels of the skin, intestine, and muscles together. This obser-
vation, it seems to me, is one of the greatest importance, and one that
has hardly received as yet the attention which it merits.

It is obvious that contraction of the cutaneous vessels, such as occurs
upon exposure to cold, will drive more blood through the muscles, and
as oxidation goes on more rapidly in them the result will be increased
production of heat.

The experiments I have just mentioned show that the vessels of the
muscles are not controlled by the vasomotor center in the medulla
oblongata in the same way as those of the intestine and skin. How far
their vascular centers may be associated with those for voluntary move-
ments, which have been so admirably localized by Ferrier in the cerebral
cortex, still remains to be made out. The circulation through the mus-
cles is indeed a complex phenomenon, and it was shown by Ludwig and
Sadler to depend upon at least two factors having an antagonistic action.
When a muscle is thrown into action, it mechanically compresses the
blood vessels within it, and thus tends to lessen the circulation through
it, but at the same time the stimulus which is sent down through the
motor nerve, and which ealls it into action, brings about a dilatation
of the vascular walls, and thus increases the circulation through the
muscle. |

When the amount of blood is measured before, during, and after
stimulation of its motor nerves, it is sometimes found that the flow is

“

a

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. 469

diminished, at others that it is increased, the alteration depending upon
the comparative effect of the mechanical compression of the vessels of
the muscles just mentioned, and upon the increase of their lumen by the
dilatation of their walls. It invariably happens, however, that after
the muscle has ceased to act, the flow of blood through the muscle is
increased. This increase is quite independent of any alteration in the
general pressure of blood in the arteries, and it occurs when an artificial
stream of blood, under constant pressure, is sent through the muscle.
The dilatation in the muscular vessels, as indicated by the increased
flow of blood, and consequent change of color in the frog’s tongue, was
observed by Lépine after stimulation of the peripheral ends of the
hypoglossal and glossopharyngeal nerves, and the actual changes in
the vessels themselves were observed microscopically by von Frey and
Gaskell.

The dilatation of muscular vessels on irritation of peripheral nerves
was thus brought into a line with the dilatation noticed in the vessels
of the submaxillary gland by. Bernard, and in the corpora cavernosa
by Eckhart. It is evident that alteration in the size of such a huge
vascuiar tract as the muscular arteries must influence, to a great extent,
the blood pressure in the arteries generally, and it is equally evident
that the changes induced in the condition of the blood pressure by
muscular action may be of two kinds, either a rise or a fall. If the
arterioles are compressed by the muscles so that the flow through them
is impeded, the general blood pressure will rise. When this effect is
more than counteracted by the dilatation of the arterioles themselves
under nervous influence the general blood pressure will fall, for the
blood will find an easy passage through the vessels from the arteries
into the veins. We can thus see how readily a rise or fall in the gen-
eral blood pressure may be induced by exercise of the muscles. If
they contract suddenly or violently they will tend to compress the
arterioles, and raise the blood pressure, while quite easy contraction
will have little effect in compressing the arterioles, and these, becoming
dilated, will allow the blood pressure to fall.

But (neue is still another factor which may tend to increase the blood
pressure during severe muscular exertion, viz, a quickened pulse for
stimulation of the nerve fibers extending from the muscles to the cen-
tral nervous system greatly accelerates the beats of the heart. In this
respect stimulation of the muscular nerves differs from that of the
cutaneous and visceral nerves, inasmuch as the latter tend rather to
slow than to quicken the pulse. The peculiar effect of the muscular
nerves upon the heart would, indeed, appear to be a provision of nature
for the purpose of maintaining an exceedingly active circulation during
the active calls upon nutrition which violent exertions entail. Muscu-
lar exercise, therefore, has a special tendency to raise the blood pres-
sure in the arterial system, and consequently to increase the resistance
which the left ventricle has to overcome. Moreover, in the case of the
ATO MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK.

intestinal vessels there is a special provision made for preventing their
contraction from causing too great a rise of arterial pressure. This
consists in the depressor nerve, which passes from the heart and tends
to produce dilatation of the abdominal vessels, and thus prevent any
undue pressure occurring within the heart from their excessive con-
traction.

In the case of the muscles, we have no such nerve. Its place seems
to be taken by the dilating fibers which occur in the motor nerves. As
I have already said, however, this effect of dilatation in the muscular
vessels may be at first more than counteracted by mechanical compres-
sion at the commencement of exertion, and thus the blood pressure in
the arteries, and the resistance which it opposes to the contraction and
emptying of the ventricle, may be unduly increased.

As a general rule the distention of any hollow muscular organ is
attended with great pain. How great is the suffering when obstruction
of the bowel prevents evacuation of its contents; or when a calculus,
in its passage down the gall duct or ureter, forcibly distends their wall.
One of the severest tortures of the Middle Ages was to distend the
stomach with water, and the Emperor Tiberius could imagine no more
awful punishment for those whom he hated than to make them drink
wine, and at the same time, by means of a ligature, to prevent the dis-
tended bladder from emptying itself. The heart is no exception to this
rule, and distension of its cavities brings on most acute physical suf-
fering. Its inability to empty itself is a question of relative and not
of absolute power; for a strong heart may be unable to work only
against enormously increased resistance in the peripheral arterioles,
while the heart, weakened by degeneration, may be unable to empty
itself in face of pressure little, if at all, above the normal.

When the contractile power of the heart is not, as it is in health,
cousiderably in excess of the resistance opposed to it in vessels, but
only nearly equal to it, a slight increase in the resistance may greatly
interfere with the power of the heart to empty itself, and bring on pain
varying in amount from slight uneasiness to the most intense agony in
angina pectoris. This is indeed what we find for a heart whose nutri-
tion has been weakened by disease of the arteries, and consequent
imperfect supply of blood to the cardiac muscle is unable to meet any
increased resistance if this should be offered to it, and pain is at once
felt. In such cases, unless they be far advanced, we find precisely as
we might expect, that walking on the level usually causes no pain, but
the attempt to ascend even a slight rise, by which the muscles are
brought into more active exertion, brings on pain at once. Yet here
again we find, as we should expect, that if the patient is able to con-
tinue walking the pain passes off and does not return. These phe-
nomena would be inexplicable were it not for Ludwig’s observations on
circulation through the muscles, but in the light of these observations
everything is made perfectly intelligible. Walking on the flat, by

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY'S WORK. AZ71

causing no violent exertion of the muscles, produces no mechanical con-
striction of the vessels, and thus does not increase the blood pressure.
The greater exertion of walking up a hill has this effect, but if the
patient is able to continue his exertions, the increased dilatation of the
vessels—a consequence of muscular activity—allows the pressure again
to fall and relieves the pain.

As muscular exertion continues and the vessels of the muscles
become dilated, the flow of blood from the arteries into the veins will
tend to become much more rapid than usual. The pressure in the
arterial system will consequently fall, but that in the veins will become
increased, and unless a corresponding dilatation occurs in the pulmo-
nary circulation, blood will tend to accumulate in the right side of the
heart, the right ventricle will be unable to empty itself completely,
shortness of breath will arise, and even death may occur. At first the
right side of the heart is affected, and the apex beat disappears from
the normal place and is felt in the epigastrium, but the left ventricle
also becomes dilated, though whether this is simply through nervous
influence tending to make it act concordantly with the right, or for
some other reason, it is at present impossible to say. Severe exertion,
even for a few minutes, may produce this condition in healthy persons,!
and when the exertion is overcontinued it may lead to permanent mis-
chief. More especially is this the case in young growing boys, and
it is not merely foolish, it is wicked to insist upon boys engaging in
games or contests which demand a long-continued overexertion of the
heart, such as enforced races and paper chases extending over several
miles. Intermittent exertion, either of a single muscle or of a group of
muscles, or of the whole body, appears to lead to better nutrition and
increased strength and hypertrophy, but overexertion, especially if it
continues, leads to impaired nutrition, weakness, and atrophy. If we
watch the movements of young animals, we find that they are often
rapid, but fitful and irregular and varied in character, instead of being
steady, regular, and uniform. They are the movements of the butterfly,
and not of the bee. The varied plays of childhood, the gambols of the
lamb, and the frisking of the colt are all well adapted to increase the
strength of the body without doing it any injury; but if the colt,
instead of being allowed to frisk at its own free will, is put in harness,
or ridden in races, the energy which ought to have gone to growth is
used up by the work, its nutrition is affected, its powers diminished,
and its life shortened. The rules which have been arrived at by the
breeders of horses ought to be carefully considered by the teachers of
schools, and by the medical advisers who superintend the pupils.

In youth and middle age every organ of the body is adapted for doing
more work than it is usually called upon to do. Every organ can, as
it is usually termed, make a spurt if required; but as old age comes on
this capacity disappears, the tissues become less elastic, the arteries

A772 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK.

become more rigid and less capable of dilating and allowing freer flow
of blood to any part whether it be the intestine, the skin, the brain, the
muscles, or the heart itself. Mere rigidity of the arteries supplying the
muscles of the heart will lessen the power of extra exertion, but if the
vessels be not only rigid, but diminished in caliber, the muscles of the
limbs and the heart itself will be unfit even for their ordinary work, and
will tend to fail on the slightest overexertion. This fact was noticed
by Sir Benjamin Brodie, who, when speaking of patients with degener-
ating and contracted arteries, such as lead to senile gangrene, said:

‘Such patients walk a short distance very well, but when they attempt
more than this the muscles seem to be unequal to the task, and they
can walk no farther. The muscles are not absolutely paralyzed, but
in a state approaching toit. The cause of all this is sufficiently obvi-
ous. The lower limbs require sometimes a larger and sometimes a
smaller supply of blood. During exercise a large supply is wanted on
account of the increased action of the muscles; but the arteries being
ossified or obliterated, and thus incapable of dilatation, the increased
supply can not be obtained. This state of things is not peculiar to the
lower limbs. Wherever muscular structures exist the same cause will
produce the same effect. Dr. Jenner first, and Dr. Parry, of Bath,
afterwards, published observations which were supposed to prove that
the disease which is usually called angina pectoris depends on ossifica-
tion of the coronary arteries. - - - When the coronary arteries are
in this condition they may be capable of admitting a moderate supply
of blood to the muscular structure of the heart, and as long as the
patientmakes no abnormal exertion the circulation goes on well enough;

when, however, the heart is excited to increased action, whether it be’

during a fit of passion, or in running, or walking upstairs, or lifting
weights, then the ossified arteries being incapable of expanding so as to
let in the additional quantity of blood, which under these circumstances
is required, its action stops and syncope ensues; and I say that this
exactly corresponds to the sense of weakness and want of muscular
power which exists in persons who have the arteries of the legs obstructed
or ossified.”!

But the syncope and stoppage of the heart mentioned by Brodie are
not the only consequences of impaired cardiac nutrition. The heart
may be still able to carry on the circulation, but the patient may suffer
intense pain in the process. The outside of the heart was found by
Harvey to be insensible to light touches, but the inside of the heart
appears to be much more sensitive either to touch or pressure.

A knowledge of the mode of circulation of blood through the muscles
enables us to understand not only the pathology of angina pectoris,
but the rationale of various methods of treating patients suffering
from angina pectoris or other forms of heart disease. In most cases our
object is a twofold one—to increase the power of the heart and to lessen
the resistance it has to overcome. In some cases we require also to aid
the elimination of water which has so accumulated as to give rise to
cedema of the cellular tissues or dropsy of the serous cavities. In our

‘Lectures on Pathology and Surgery, by Sir Benjamin Brodie, London, 1846,
page 360.
MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. 473

endeavors to produce these beneficial changes in our patients we employ
regimen, diet, and drugs, and it is evident that as in one case the con-
dition of a patient’s heart may be very different indeed from that in
another, the regimen which may be useful to one may be fatal to the
other. We have already seen that sudden and violent exertion may
raise the blood pressure and so lead to intense cardiac pain or to stop-
page of the heart and instant death, while more gentle exercises, by
increasing the circulation through the muscles, may lessen the pressure
and give relief to the heart.

The methods of increasing the muscular circulation may be roughly
divided into three, according as the patient lies, stands, or walks.
First, absolute rest in bed with massage;! second, graduated move-
ments of the muscles of the limbs and body while the patient stands
still; third, graduated exercises in walking and climbing.

The second of these methods has been specially worked out by the
brothers Schott, of Nauheim, and the third 1s generally connected with
the name of Oertel. It is obvious that in cases of heart disease where
the failure is great and the patient is unable even to stand, much less
to walk, where breathlessness is extreme and dropsy is present or
is advanced, the second and third methods of treatment are inappli-
cable. It is in such cases that the method of absolute rest in bed, not
allowing the patient to rise for any purpose whatever, hardly allowing
him to feed himself or turn himself in bed, proves advantageous. The
appetite is usually smail, the digestion imperfect, and flatulence trouble-
some; and here an absolute milk diet, like that usually employed in
typhoid fever, is often most serviceable, being easily taken and easily
digested, while the milk sugar itself has a diuretic action and tends to
reduce dropsy. But while simple rest prevents the risk of increased
arterial tension and consequent opposition to the cardiac contractions
which might arise from muscular exertion, such benefits as would accrue
from muscular exertion and increased circulation would be Jost were
t not that they can be supplied artificially by massage. This plan of
treatment, although it has only recently been revived, was known to
Harvey, who narrates the case of a man who, in consequence of an
injury—of an effront which he could not revenge—was so overcome
with hatred, spite, and passion that ‘he fell into a strange disorder,
suffering from extreme compression and pain in the heart and breast,
from which he only received some little relief at last when the whole
of his chest was pommeled by a strong man, as the baker kneads
dough.”?

This was a very rough form of massage, but the same kneading
movements which Harvey described have been elaborated into a com-
plete system, more especially by Ling, in Sweden, and made widely
known in America and this country by 8S. Weir Mitchell and Playfair.

ATA MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY'S WORK.

One might naturally expect that kneading the muscles would increase
the circulation through them in somewhat the same way as active exer-
cise, but, to the best of my knowledge, no actual experiments existed
to prove this, and I accordingly requested my friend and assistant, Dr. _
Tunnicliffe, to test the matter experimentally. The method employed

ras, in the main, the same as that devised by Ludwig and employed
by Sadler and Gaskell under his direction. The results were that dur-
ing the kneading of a muscle the amount of venous blood which issued
from 1f was sometimes diminished and sometimes increased; that just
after the kneading was over the flow was diminished, apparently from
the blood accumulating in the muscle, and this dimunition was again
succeeded by a greatly increased flow exactly corresponding to that
observed by Ludwig and his scholars.

The clinical results are precisely what one would expect from increased
circulation in the muscles, and cases apparently hopeless sometimes
recover most wonderfully under this treatment. For patients who are
stronger, so that confinement to bed is unnecessary, and who yet are
unable to take walking exercise, Schott’s treatment is most useful, and
it may be used as an adjunct to the later stages of the treatment just
described, or as a sequel toit. Here the patient is made to go through
various exercises of the arms, legs, and trunk with a certain amount of
resistance, which is applied either by the patient himself setting in
action the opposing muscles or by an attendant who gently resists
every movement made by the patient, but graduates his resistance so
as not to cause the least hurry in breathing or the least oppression of
the heart. Perhaps the easiest way of employing graduated resistance
is by the ergostat of Giirtner, which is simply an adaptation of the
labor crank of prisons, where the number of turns of a wheel can be
regulated in each minute and the resistance, which is applied by a
brake, may be graduated to an ounce. The objection to it is the uni-
formity of movement and its wearisome monotony. Oertel’s plan of
gradually walking day by day up a steeper and steeper incline, and
thus training the muscles of the heart, is well adapted for stronger
persons, but when applied injudiciously may lead, just like hasty or
excessive exertion, to serious or fatal results. In Schott’s method stim-
ulation of the skin by baths is used as an adjunct, and this may tend
to slow the pulse, as already mentioned. But in all these plans the
essence of treatment is the derivation of blood through a new channel,
that of the muscular vessels, and the results in relieving cardiae distress
and pain may be described in the same words which Harvey employs
in reference to diseases of the circulation: ‘* How speedily some of these
diseases that are even reputed incurable are remedied and dispelled as
if by enchantment.” !

There is yet another consequence of the circulation to which Harvey
has called attention, although only very briefly, which has now become

‘The Works of William Harvey, Sydenham Society’s edition, page 141.

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. A475

of the utmost importance, and this is the admixture of blood from vari-
ous parts of the body. After describing the intestinal veins, Harvey
says: “The blood returning by these veins and bringing the eruder
juices along with it on the one hand from the stomach, where they are
thin, watery, and not yet perfectly chylified; on the other, thick and
more earthy, as derived from the fieces, but all pouring into this splenic
branch, are duly tempered by the admixture of contraries.” !

Harvey’s chemical expressions are crude, for chemistry as a science
only began to exist about a century and a half after Harvey’s death,
yet the general idea which he expresses in the words which I have just
quoted is wonderfully near the truth.

Two of the most important constituents of the blood are chloride of
sodium and water. Chloride of sodium is a neutral salt, but during
digestion both it and water are decomposed in the gastric glands, and
hydrochloric acid is poured into the stomach, while a corresponding
amount of soda is returned into the blood, whose alkalinity increases
parl passu with the acidity of the stomach. Part of this alkali is
excreted in the urine, so that the urine during digestion is often neu-
tral or alkaline. Possibly some of it passes out through the liver in
the bile, through the pancreas and intestinal glands into the intestine,
where, again mixing with the acid chyle from the stomach, neutraliza-
tion takes place, so that neutral and comparatively inactive chloride of
sodium is again formed from the union of active alkali and acid. But
it is most probable that what occurs in the stomach oceurs also in the
other glands, and that it is not merely excess of alkali resulting from
gastric digestion which is poured out by the liver, pancreas, and intes-
tine, but that these glands also decompose salts, pour the alkali out
through the ducts, and return the acid into the blood.

We are now leaving the region of definite fact and passing into that
of fancy, but the fancies are not entirely baseless, and may show in
what directions we may search out and study the secrets of nature by
way of experiment. Tor what is apparently certain in regard to the
decomposition of chloride of sodium in the stomach, and probably in
the case of neutral salts-in the pancreas and intestine, is also probable
in that important though as yet very imperfectly known class of bodies
which are known as zymogens. Just as we have in the stomach an
inactive salt, so we have also an inactive pepsinogen, which, like the
salt, is split up in the gastric glands, and active pepsin is poured into
the stomach. But is the pepsin the only active substance produced?
Has no other body, resulting from decomposition of the pepsinogen,
been poured into the blood while the pepsin passed into the stomach ?
Has the inactive pepsinogen not been split up into two bodies, active
when apart, inactive when combined? May it not be fitly compared,

476 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY’S WORK. -

yielding sharp and even dangerous splinters when broken, although
these may again be united into a harmless whole?!

This question at present we can not answer, but in the pancreas there
is an indication that something of the kind takes place, for Lépine has
discovered that while this gland pours into the intestine a ferment
which converts starch into sugar, it pours through the lymphatics into
the blood another ferment which destroys sugar. Whether a similar
occurrence takes place in regard to its other ferments in the pancreas,
or in the glands of the intestine, we do not know, nor do we yet know
whether the same process goes on in the skin, and whether the secre-
tion of sweat, which is usually looked upon as its sole function,
bears really a relationship to cutaneous activity similar to that which
the secretion of bile bears to the functions of the liver. There are indi-
cations that such is the case, for when the skin is varnished, not only
does the temperature of the animal rapidly sink, but congestion occurs
in internal organs, and dropsy takes place in serous cavities, while in
extensive burns of the skin rapid disintegration of the blood corpuscles
occurs. It 1s obvious that if this idea be at all correct, a complete
revolution will be required in the views we have been accustomed to
entertain regarding the action of many medicines. In the case of
purgatives and diaphoreties, for example, we have looked mainly at the
secretions poured out after their administration for an explanation of
their usefulness, whereas it may be that the main part of the benefit
that they produce is not by the substances liberated through the secre-
tions they cause, but by those returned from the intestine and skin into
the circulating blood.

How important an effect the excessive admixture of the juices from
one part of the animal body with the circulating blood might have was
shown in the most striking way by Wooldridge. He found that the
juice of the thyroid gland, though it is harmless while it remains in the
gland, and is probably useful when it enters the blood in small quan-
tities in the ordinary course of daily life, yet if injected into the blood
will cause it to coagulate almost instantaneously and kill the animal as
quickly as a rifle bullet. What is powerful for harm is likewise pow-
erful for good in these cases, and the administration of thyroid juice
in cases of myxedema is one of the most remarkable therapeutic dis-
coveries of modern times. Since the introduction by Corvisart of pep-
sin as a remedy in dyspepsia, digestive ferments have been largely
employed to assist the stomach and intestine in the performance of
their functions, but very little has been done until lately in the way
of modifying tissue changes in the body by the introduction of ferments
derived from solid organs. For ages back savages have eaten the raw
hearts and other organs of the animals which they have killed, or the
enemies they have conquered, under the belief that they would thereby
obtain increased vigor or courage; but the first definite attempt to cure

a disease by supplying a ferment from a solid nonglandular organ of the
body was, I believe, made in Harvey’s own hospital by the use of raw
meat in diabetes.! It was not, however, until Brown-Séquard recom-
mended the use of testicular extract that the attention of the profession
became attracted to the use of extracts of solid organs. Since then
extract of thyroid, extract of kidney, extract of supra renal capsule have
been employed; but even yet they are only upon their trial, and the
limits of their utility have not yet been definitely ascertained.

But yet another therapeutic method has been recently introduced
which bids fair to be of the utmost importance, the treatment of dis-
ease by antitoxins. The discovery by Pasteur of the dependence of
many diseases upon the presence of mihute organisms may be ranked
with that of Harvey, both in regard to the far-reaching benefits which
it has conferred upon mankind and for the simplicity of its origin. The
germ of all his discoveries was the attempt to answer the apparently
aseless question, “Why does a crystal of tartaric acid sometimes
crystallize in one form and sometimes in another?” From this germ
sprung his discovery of the nature of yeast and of those microbes
which originate fermentation, putrefaction, and disease. These minute
organisms, far removed from man as they are in thei structure and
place in nature, appear in some respects to resemble him in the proe-
esses of their growth and nutrition. They seem, indeed, to have the
power of splitting up inactive bodies into substances having a great
physiological or chemical activity. From grape sugar, which is com-
paratively inert, they produce carbonie acid and alcohol, both of which
havea powerful physiological action. From inert albumen they pro-
duce albumoses having a most powerful toxic action, and to the poi-
sonous properties of these substances attention was for a while alone
directed. But it would appear that at the same time they produce
poisons they also form antidotes, and when cultivated without the body
and introduced into the living organism they give rise to the produc-
tion of these antidotes in still greater quantity.

The plan of protection from infective diseases which was first
employed by Jenner in smallpox is now being extended to many other
diseases, and the protective substances which are formed in th» body
and their mode of action are being carefully investigated. The intro-
duction either of pathogenic microbes or of toxic products appears to
excite in the body a process of tissue change by which antitoxins are
produced, and these may be employed either for the purpose of protec-
tion or cure. By the use of antitoxins tetanus and diphtheria appear
to be deprived of much of their terrible power. But it seems probable
that a similar result may be obtained by the introduction of certain
tissue juices into the general circulation. It was shown by Wooldridge
that thyroid juice has a power of destroying anthrax poison, and it
seems probable that increase of the circulation of certain organs will

A78 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY'S WORK.

increase their tissue activity, will throw their juices or the products of
their functional activity into the general circulation, and thus influence
the invasion or progress of disease. As I have already mentioned, we
are able to influence the circulation in muscles both by voluntary exer-
tion and by passive massage, and we should expect that both of these
measures would influence the constituents of the blood generally, and
such, indeed, appears to be the case, for J. K. Mitchell! has found that
after massage the number of blood corpuscles in the circulation is very
considerably increased.

Had time allowed it, I had intended to discuss the modifications of
the heart and vessels by the introduction of remedies into the circula-
tion, the power of drugs to slow or strengthen, to quicken or weaken
the power of the heart, to contract or relax the arterioles, to raise or
lower the blood pressure, to relieve pain, or toremove dropsy; but to do
this would require time far exceeding that of a single lecture. More-
over, the methods and results were admirably expounded to the college
by Dr. Leech in lus Croonian lecture, and I have therefore thought 1
showd be better fulfilling the wish of Harvey that the orator of the
year should exhort the fellows and members of the college to search
out the secrets of nature by way of experiment by directing their
attention to fields of research which have received at present little
attention, but promise results of great practical value. Lastly, I have
to exhort you to continue in mutual love and affection among your-
selves; and it seems to me that the best way of doing this is to direct
your attention to the examples of Harvey and of our late president,
whose death we deplore to-day. ‘They were beloved by their fellows
while they lived, their loss was lamented when they died, and they
have left behind them an example not only of goodnesss but of courage.
Harvey, seated speechless in his chair, distributing rings and parting
gifts to his friends while awaiting the approach of death, and Andrew
Clark, steadfastly determining to continue at work and die in harness,
in spite of the hemoptysis which seemed to threaten a speedy death,
afford us noble examples which ought to encourage us to follow the
directions of the venerable Longfellow, who, taking the organ Harvey
studied to symbolize such courage as Harvey and Clark showed, says:

Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,

Learn to labor, and to wait.

ANTS’ NESTS.!

By Dr. AuGusT FOREL.

A nest is a temporary or permanent, naturally or artificially formed
hiding place, which serves as a dwelling for an animal and its family
or for a more numerous society of animals. The nest is also intended,
at the same time, for protection against enemies and against the ineclem-
ency of the weather and of the temperature. There are, however, not
only purely natural nests (such as natural caves and hollows) and
purely artificial nests (such as blackbirds’ nests), but also, in many
cases, mingled forms, where natural hiding places are completed by
artificial help. Nests may also be divided into transient or season nests
and permanent nests.

Now, in the case of animals which live in large societies, such as
beavers, wasps, and ants, the nest becomes a complicated building or
labyrinth. There are also elaborate and rough primitive nests.

The ants, or Formicide, form a great family of the insect order of the
Hymenoptera. They number upwards of two thousand known species,
distributed throughout the whole earth, which form about one hundred
and fifty genera. All species of ants live in societies, and almost all
display a peculiar so-called polymorphism; that is, every species con-
sists, not only of a female, usually winged, and a male, usually winged,
differing extremely from each other in the whole structure of Heir
bodies, but also of other individuals without wings, which are offspring
of the female sex, and are called “workers.” The division, however,
goes still further in certain species, the ‘* worker” caste being subdi-
vided into two kinds—differing greatly in their physical strueture—
“workers” and ‘soldiers.” Between these there are species with inter-
mittent workers, the largest of which resemble the “soldiers;” that is,
form a phylogenetic precursor to the ‘‘soldiers.”

Most of the female and male ants are winged, and copulate in the
air or in the tops of trees; but at least one of the sexes is always
winged. The new colonies are almost invariably founded by a pregnant
female, or by several such, as has aleedy been stated by Bue and

ys

has been clearly proved in recent years by MacCook, Lubbock, Bloch-
mann, and others. These females live many years (eight to twelve
years, according to Lubbock’s experiments), and always remain prolific
without renewed copulation. They are the mothers of the whole
so-called ant colony, which, consequently, lasts many years and does
not die out annually like the wasp colony. It follows from the faets
stated that the ants must have permanent nests, and that these nests
must display great variety, both of which inferences are correct.

The ants have, moreover, the peculiarity of changing their abode
from time to time in order to move to a new one. They understand how
to change their dwelling and how to build anew.

Many species of ants understand likewise how to colonize; that is,
how to build new nests at a certain distance from their dwellings with-
out leaving their old nest. It is in this way that mighty colonies, with
numerous nests, are founded, resembling, to use Huber’s words, the
cities of one and the same empire. I have counted as many as two
hundred immense nests standing close together in our European Formica
exsecta NYL., and MacCook has counted as many as sixteen hundred
still larger nests of one and the same colony of Formica exsectoides
FoREL in the Alleghanies of North America. These latter ant kingdoms
have, in all probability, a population of 200,000,000 to 400,000,000
inhabitants, all forming a single community and living together in
active and friendly intercourse, while they are on hostile terms with all
other colonies of ants, even those of the same species. Certain kinds of
ants which live in trees form similar kingdoms by occupying numerous
trees of the same forest.

In addition to this, ants frequently construct annexes to their nests—
covered ways, Subterranean passages, stations, and flying camps—in
order to protect the plant lice which serve them as milk cows, and
also for other purposes. -

It is further to be remarked that there are courageous, warlike kinds
of ants, whose nests ere, consequently, open and easily discovered,
while other kinds are timid and live in concealment, in many cases,
because their colonies consist of only a few individuals. There are,
besides, ants with good eyes, which make their nests above ground,
and even on the boughs of trees, while there are blind and half blind
kinds which live hidden deep underground.

As I have formerly asserted (Fourmis de la Suisse, 1874), the chief
feature of ant architecture, in contradistinction to that of the bees
and the wasps, is its irregularity and want of uniformity—that is to say,
its adaptability, or the capacity of making all the surroundings and
incidents subserve the purpose of attaining the greatest possible econ-
omy of space and time and the greatest possible comfort. For instance,
the same species will live in the Alps under stones which absorb the
rays of the sun; in a forest it will live in warm, decayed trunks of
trees; in a rich meadow it will live in high, conical mounds of earth,

ANTS’ NESTS. A81

I will attempt to make a classification of the nests of ants, corre-
sponding approximately to that which I formerly made with a view
simply to giving an outline of the variety of the dwellings of ants.
Of course, taking into consideration the above-mentioned features of
ant architecture, it is impossible to be systematic.

I.—TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING CAVITIES.

Many ants use as nests simply the clefts and crevices of rocks and
the space between two stones. They wall up and barricade the exte-
rior of the clefts with sand, pebbles, and dry vegetable particles; they
divide the surface, more or less, into chambers, and leave only one ora
few doors (holes) open, to allow themselves egress. Many species of
the genus Leptothorasx live in this way, in small colonies, and Plagiolepis
pygmea LATR., Cremastogaster sordidula Nyu., Prenolepis longicornis
LATR., etc., in larger colonies, in the same manner.

Some such species have adapted themselves specially to mankind and
occupy the walls of our houses. They know how to avail themselves
there of the space between the stones; they bite away the mortar with
all their might and carry it away in order to procure for themselves
safe and warm lodgings in the neighborhood of our domestic stores,
which they pillage thoroughly at the first opportunity. Such ants
which have adapted themselves to the walls of our dwellings are Lasius
emarginatus LATR., Monomorium pharaonis L. (imported into seaports
from the Tropics), Pheidole megacephala FABR. These insects, as is
well known, become house nuisances.

But other natural cavities are also made use of, especially those made
by other insects. The species of Leptothorax and Colobopsis with us,
those of Polyrhachis and Cremastogaster in tropical countries, know how
to make use of the cavities of galls which have been abandoned by the
galltly for their nests.

Fig. 1, Plate LV, represents a stem gall from Delagoa Bay, South-
east Africa, one-sixth smaller than the natural size, which was inhabited
by a colony of Polyrhachis gerstdckeri FOREL, and which was sent to me
by our countryman, the missionary physician, Dr. Liengme, living there.
The Polyrhachis had affixed some of their weaving to the inside, B.
The egress opening made by the gallfly was the door of their nest.
Cavities made by bark beetles in wood are used among us as nests by
the species of Liometopum and Lasius, and especially by Lasius brunneus
Latr., Formica fusca, etc. In the same way the space between the
outer layers of the bark of trees (especially the conifers), the under
side of the bark of dead trees, the under side of beds of moss, ete., are
used as nests by the species of Leptothorax and other small ants. Ants
also live frequently in hollow fruits, potatoes, and, above all, in large
tropical fruits. Mr. Ortgies found the little Brachymyrmex heeri For.
in the lower part of the pots of the tropical orchids in the Zurich hot-
house, which were filled with moss, ete. My friend and colleague, Pro-

fessor Stoll, found the nests of Camponotus atriceps SM., race sterco-
rarius FOREL, constantly under the dried excrement of cattle, and
even inside of it, in Guatemala.

Pere Camboué, in Antananarivo, Madagascar, sent me a stalk of
Solanum auriculatum, the soft marrow of which, excavated and divided
nto compartments, served as a nest for Technomyrmex albipes SMITH
In this case the gnawing capacity of the ants had made the natural
object serviceable. A portion of this nest is represented in fig. 2,
two-thirds of natural size.

Dr. Goéldi, in Rio de Janeiro, sent me several specimens of Camponotus
cingulatus MAYR., a very handsome, rather large ant, as the regular
inhabitant of the hollows (internodes) of the bamboos there. Pere
Camboué, in Antananarivo, sent me Prenolepis ellisii FOREL from the
hollow stalks of one of the Malvacez, in which it lives. Major Yer-
bury, of Ceylon, sent me, by Mr. Wroughton, Camponotus reticulatus
ROGER, with its nest, which was also in a hollow stalk. Mr. Wrough-
ton, divisional forest officer at Poonah, India, sent me the nests of a very
small ant, Cardiocondyla wroughtonii FOREL, which he had found in
the space between the two surfaces of the leaves of a tree (Hugenia
jambolana), the parenchym of which (the green of the leaf between the
exterior membranes) had evidently been devoured by a very small cater:
pillar. This nest of Cardiocondyla wroughtonii is represented in fig. 3
by Mr. L. Schroter. ‘

The well-known ant nests in the hollow acacia thorns of tropical
lands also belong to this class; but more on this subject hereafter.

2.—EARTH NESTS.

Earth is the most usual material for the nest building of ants. It is
well known (Gould, Huber, ete.) that the ordinary earth structures
(mounds) of many of our ants are created by the workers mining under
ground after rainy weather, bringing the wet particles of earth to the
surface of the ground and pressing them into walls and vaults by means
of their mandibles and forelegs, using at the same time blades of grass,
etc., as pillars and inside walls. In this way are made the well-known
labyrinths, which I myself have watched innumerable times. It is,
however, an unsolved problem whether really, as Huber thought, water
alone always suffices as cement for the earth or whether it is not in
some Cases mixed with a secretion of the glands of the ants. The great
firmness of certain structures, for instance those of Lasius flavus, gives
some probability to the latter supposition, particularly when we
consider the fragile character of the structures of other kinds of ants.

Earth nests may be divided into three classes:

(a) Nests which are entirely excavated._In this case passages and
chambers are simply excavated in the ground, without the particles of
earth which are dug out being worked up into an artificial upper struc.
ture; they are merely thrown away. There are many kinds of ants

ay
oR

ANTS’ NESTS. 483

which mine only in this way, as, for example, Ponera contracta LTR.,
Myrmecocystus, all the Dorylides, Aphenogaster subterranea LTR., and,
in general, most of the blind and half-blind species. Besides these
many other species do it occasionally, such as Formica fusca L., Formica
rufibarbis F., Tetramorium cespitum L., species of Myrmica, ete.

One variety of the mined nests consists of those in which the ants
heap up the excavated earth in banks around the openings of the nest
so that crater-shaped openings are the result. This occurs most fre-
quently in sandy soil. These banks are not genuine upper structures,
although they often resemble them closely. We find them in the case
of Messor structor, Messor barbarus, species of Pheidole, Acantholepis
frauenfeldi, Pogonomyrmex, etc. A peculiar variety of this class is
formed by the crescent-shaped mounds of Messor arenarius FAB., first
noticed by me in the South Tunis desert near Cabes, which consist of
coarse but very perishable globes of sand. At certain times the aper-
tures of the Messor nests are, in addition, surrounded by mounds com-
posed of the hulls of the seeds which have been gathered, which hulls
have been thrown out of the nests. The little Cardiocondyla elegans
EM. and stambuloffii FoREL make small nests in the sand on the
seashore.

The subterranean structures of some kinds of ants are, in certain
cases, extremely interesting. Certain species dig passages which go
down very deep and branch off laterally, forming subterranean cor-
ridors, and in many cases leading to root plant lice (Lasius flavus) or
serving for other purposes. The underground hunts of the species of
Dorylus, or visiting ants, are partially carried on in this manner. These
are blind robber ants, which carry on an underground hunt after all
conceivable ground insects, aS I myself have observed in Tunis. They
are also called ‘visiting ants,” because they frequently make a sud-
den attack at night upon dwelling houses and destroy all the vermin
in them.

The species of Messor (Europe), Pogonomyrmex (America), and Hol-
comyrmex (India) construct under ground, at a considerable depth
(often at the depth of a yard), very large chambers or granaries, in
which they store the seeds which they have gathered. In the same
way the species of the American genus Atta excavate extremely deep
and extensive-passages and make immense chambers, in which they
store the leaves which they have cut from trees, in order to lay off upon
them the fungus gardens from which they supply themselves with food-
This discovery, which was first made by Belt and subsequently declared
by MacCook to be incorrect, has been recently confirmed by Dr,
Moller, of Blumenau, in its full extent and by superb experiments.

A great deal of interest is likewise attached to the underground
hunts carried on by the ants of the genus Lobopelta in India, after the
termites, according to the careful observations of Mr. Wroughton.
They feed upon these white ants, and pursue them in their own pas-
484 ANTS’ NESTS.

sages. I conjecture that the same thing is true of the various species
of the genus Leptogenys, and that they use their long, thin, pointed,
sickle-shaped jaws, which bear a strong resemblance to a curved
needle, to pierce the termites, which they then devour by the aid of
their comparatively powerful under jaw.

(b) Nests under stones.—As is well known, wherever there are stoues
on dry declivities, etc., immumerable ants’ nests are found under them.
The stone serves as a roof, under which are the most beautiful corridors
and chambers. Under these lies the mined nest. The stone serves,
above all, to produce a speedy warming by means of the rays of the
sun. The ants under it are always in the highest story, in damp or cool
weather, as soon as the sun shines or begins to penetrate. As soon as
the sun disappears the insects go below. They also go below when the
sun shines too strong.

The same species which mine, and which build earthen structures
above ground, also live under stones as soon as they find any. The stone
must be neither too small and thin nor-too thick and large. Stones of
2 to 15 centimeters in thickness are the most desirable, according to the
size of the ants and the extent of their colonies. They allow the best
regulation of the heat for the brood.

The species of Lasius, Formica, Myrmica, Tetramorium, Plagiolepis,
Pheidole, Camponotus, Aphenogaster, Bothriomyrmex, Tapinoma, and
other genera, are found in swarms under stones among us in Europe.
There are few genera of ants that never live under stones.

(c) arth structures above ground.—Many kinds of ants are excellent
masons, but by no means all. It is easier to mine than to construct
walls, vaults, and pillars.

I advise everyone who wishes to see one of the most beautiful dis-
plays of animal instinct and animal intelligence to equip himself with
an umbrella, and with patience, on some warm day in May, when it
begins to rain after a drought, or when it has just stopped raining, to
repair to-a meadow, and there, with the greatest perseverance, to
watch attentively the surface of the ant-hills and the actions of their
occupants. He must at the same time watch closely individual ants
and their work. He will then admire the skill and foresight of these
insects, and will see how the little architects and masons understand
how to turn every blade of grass, every stalk, every leaf, to account, by
means of their earth mortar, in the erection of vaults, pillars, walls, ete.
In this manner are made those no less numerous than wonderful earth
labyrinths which serve the ants in our meadows as conical super-
structures. Our fig.9 represents a fragment of the mound of an earth
nest of Lasius niger. It can be seen how blades of grass and leaves are
used in the masonry as pillars, arches, ete. The drawing, which is two-
thirds of the natural size, was made by Mr. L. Schroter, like all the others,
from the original piece, which I had hardened with a solution of silica.
I need not add that a mined nest always lies under the superstructure

ANTS’ NESTS. 485

of the mound-building ants. What purpose does the latter serve?
Judging from my own observations, the same purpose as the stones, to
wit, to procure warmth for the brood. The grass springs up in May,
and with it the ant mounds. These afford protection against the
dampness and the shade of the primeval forest; for such is a meadow
to the ants. Up there, under the roof of the mound, the rays of the
sun are felt. We have in Europe a small ant (Zapinoma erraticum
LATR.) whose perishable earth structures, first described by me, can,
to all appearance, serve no other purpose. It builds hastily around
the blades of grass a comparatively very high and steep mound of
earth, which consists of little more than the upper, superficial, thin
vault. Inside there are often only a few wretched thin chambers,
especially where the grass is thick. The ants hold their brood partly
in their upper jaws, partly lay them on leaves. They crowd together
under the mound to warm themselves in the rays of the sun. After
the harvest the mounds of the Tapinoma disappear, while those of the
other ants remain standing. The latter, however, also become more
and more flattened as autumn approaches. Our fig. 12 represents the
perpendicular cross section of a nest of Tapinoma erraticum LATR.,
from Vaux, Canton Vaud, Switzerland, which was strengthened and
preserved by me by means of a solution of silica, and is now in the
Entomological Museum of the Federal Polytechnikum, Mr. L. Schroter
has drawn the nest of two-thirds of the natural size. D, the temporary
earthen cupola; Min, the beginning of the underground mined structure.

Among us mounds of earth with labyrinths are built by all the spe-
cies of Lasius, with the exception of Lasius fuliginosus LYR., brunneus
LTR., and emarginatus OL.; also by Tetramorium cespitum, the species
of Myrmica, several of Formica and Camponotus, and the species of
Tapinoma; and in Tunis by Monomorium salomonis, Aphenogaster
striola, sardoa, testaceopilosa, crocea, etc. The best artist is the most
common of all ants, Lasius niger L., which swarms in all our gardens.
This ant also constructs covered passages along the stalks of plants,
where in this way it walls up its plant lice and cochineal kermes in
artistic stalls. The species of Myrmica frequently build earthen stalls
around the plant lice on the stalks of plants without putting them in
communication with the ant-hill by a covered way.

In the island of St. Thomas I saw earthen structures made by
Solenopsis geminata F. In Australia the large species of the genus
Myrmica, which are 20 to 28 millimeters long, build immense nests of
earth.

A seed-harvesting ant in Colorado, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis CRES-
SON, builds a very peculiar and isolated variety of the earthen mounds.
It plasters or paves the whole upper surface of its earthen mound
uniformly and in mosaic with a layer of small white stones, which,

according to MacCook’s observations, it frequently brings from a great

depth in the ground. The still unknown object of this paving is prob-
486 ANTS’ NESTS.

ably the same as that of the earthen mounds in general. It is extraor-
dinary that the little paving stones are placed side by side with great
regularity like a street pavement, while the interior of the cupola contains
no stones whatever. MacCook has even seen upon these mounds stones
containing fossil remains and native gold. Mr. Henry de Saussure, of
Gei1eva, made similar observations before MacCook among the genuine
Pogonomyrmex barbatus i. sp., SMITH, but did not publish them.

3.—WOOD NESTS.

There are also woodcutters among the ants, and in not a few cases
the same species knows how to make earthen structures and how to
hollow out w od, as, for instance, our Camponotus ligniperdus LATR.

The best woodeutters are those species of the genus Camponotus
Mayr, which have a short, broad head, rounded off in front, especially
the subgenus Colobopsis MAYR.

These ants frequently bore with their short, powerful jaws into the
very hardest wood, and construct secure and elegant labyrinths for
themselves in it. This is the case with Camponotus pubescens in Wallis
and Tessin, and Camponotus marginatus. The latter bores into the
softer layers of the wood when they are somewhat decayed and lets
the harder part remain, so that its nests are more concentric around
the center of the bough or trunk in their arrangement. Ihave noticed
them in cherry trees and Paulownias.

The smaller and very timid species of Colobopsis build themselves
nests in the hardest wood. These nests open outward by only a very
few small apertures, which are concealed by the irregularities of the
bark of the tree. These apertures are kept closed by the head of a
“soldier” sentinel, who permits only friends to enter. The soldier’s
head is broadened and rounded off in front, evidently for this very use.
The rounded surface (front view in fig. 11, magnified ten times) is
rough, of a dull-brown color; the feelers are planted back of the
rounded surface, so that the latter presents no hold and blocks up the
entrance to the nest like a living stopper. I first observed this fact
among our Colobopsis truncata SPIN. at Vaux, Canton Vaud (fig. 13,
drawn four-thirds of the natural size), but the similar structure of the
head and the habit of living in trees, which characterize the other
species of Colobopsis, lead us to infer that they live in the same way.

Fig. 13 represents a portion of the original piece of a nest of Colo-
bopsis truncata discovered by me in a very hard, dead bough of a pear
tree. Bis the bark of the pear tree; Ch is the chambers and pas-
sages of the nest; O is the exterior opening of the nest; behind it, in
the gallery of egress of the nest, stands a Colobopsis “soldier” as a
sentinel, keeping the door closed with his head. At W are seen two
Colobopsis workers, one hastening toward the door from the outside, the
other standing in the nest. The soldier will go back into the nest fora
moment in order to let the first worker come in (I have noticed this

ANTS’ NESTS. 487

among the living ants). That the part played by the Colobopsis “sol
diers” is that of a living stopper is further proved by the fact that there
are comparatively few of them, and that in contrast to the workers they
hardly ever goout. Fig. 19 represents a “soldier,” still more magnified,
standing at the door of egress.

Those species of Camponotus which live in a similar way, such as
Camponotus marginatus LATR., display the beginning of. a similar
rounded surface on the front part of the head, and always have a large-
headed sentry at the door.

Leptothorax acervorum F. cuts small, very simple nests, spread out
flat, with few chambers in the outer layer (the cork layer) of the bark
of the tree. Fig. 5represents such a nest two-thirds of the natural size
in the bark of a fir.

4.—COMBINED STRUCTURES.

The structures heretofore described are combined in a variety of
ways.

For instance, the hollow stalk of a large Arcangelica is filled from
top to bottom by Lasius niger with small earthen chambers and oceu-
pied by them. Decayed trunks of trees are made use of by ants which
elsewhere build in the ground, excavated, and worked up into nests by
Lasius niyer, Lasius flavus, Formica fusca, Myrmica levinodis, ete.
Here wood dust and earth are used as mortar in the construction of
chambers and galleries. Formica rufa L, excavates the softer portions
of the wood in half-decayed trunks of trees and builds in them laby-
rinths which form a part of its nests.

Lasius brunneus LATR. lives habitually in half-rotten trunks of trees
and beams, after excavating the moist, decayed wood. It also lives in
decayed woodwork in our houses, as do likewise frequently Lasius
umbratus NGL.

The architecture of the group of forest ants, Formica rufa 1, praten-
sis DE GEER, truncicola NYL., exsecta NGL., and pressilabris NYL., as
well as of their North American relatives, ’. exsectoides FOREL, integra
NYL., obscuripes FOREL, etc., is, however, more imposing and more
interesting.

These ants mine the ground, but cover their nests with dry vegetable
matter of the most varied kinds—pine and fir cones, dry leaves and
pieces of wood, snail shells, little balls of rosin; blades of grass, in a
word, with every kind of round and cylindrical materials. With these
they build the well-known immense mounds, with their singular frame-
work and the indescribable interior labyrinth, the most thoroughly
perforated part of which is in the middle, at about the level of the
ground. Earth serves partially as cement. The openings of the nest
are carefully closed with small pieces of wood at night or when it is
raining. They are opened by the workers in the morning and generally
in wari, fine weather.
488 ANTS’ NESTS.

The mound is gradually enlarged and strengthened by materials
dragged to it. It protects the interior perfectly against cold and rain.

Formica rufa i. sp. of the fir woods uses chiefly fir leaves; Formica
pratensis of the meadows builds flatter mounds and uses more pieces
of wood and blades of grass, pieces of dry branches, etc.; Formica
exsecta useS more particles of dry leaves, etc.; Formica sanguinea
LATR. builds mounds composed of the above-mentioned materials and
earth; its work is partly that of a carpenter and partly masonry; the
latter, however, which is executed by the ‘‘slaves” (Formica fusca),
usually prevails.

It is impossible for us to describe everything, and we refer our
readers to Huber’s admirable description of the way in which the forest
ants and the earthen-mound ants build their nests. It may well be
said that almost every species—either in earthen structures, in wood
nests, or in combined structures—has its peculiarities with regard to
the quality of the material, the fineness of the grain, the shape and
arrangement of the mound and the labyrinth, the comparative thick-
ness of the walls, the size of the chambers, etc., so that the species
may frequently be known by the structure.

Still the ants often rob one another’s nests, and this frequently
renders it difficult to recognize the architect.

There are species, it is true, whose architecture can hardly be dis-
tinguished, as, for instance, the little species of Myrmica.

5.—PASTEBOARD NESTS AND SPUN NESTS.

I have already, in the Mittheilungen of the Swiss Entomological
Society, Vol. VIII, part 6, 1891, given some information with regard to
the singular nests which are now to occupy our attention. <A well-
known European species, Lasius fuliginosus LATR., builds peculiar
pasteboard nests, which Huber erroneously thought to be excavated in
wood, while Meinert, Mayr, and others, including myself, have demon-
strated their true nature beyond a doubt. They are composed of the
finest particles of wood dust or of earth and small stones, which, by
means of a viscous substance secreted by the ants, are worked up into
so strong a pasteboard (see Forel, Fourmis de la Suisse, pp. 181-187)
that the partitions between the excavations are extremely thin (as
thin as visiting cards). These nests are mostly found in hollow trees.
That they are not excavated, but are composed of pasteboard, I have
clearly shown by microscopic cuts. Meinert first called attention to
the fact that in Lasius fuliginosus the glands of the upper jaw are
extraordinarily large, and conjectured that they are the glands which
secrete this viscous substance (cement). In facta comparative physio-
logical study of this gland which Wolff (‘‘The smelling organ of
bees”) erroneously designated as thesmelling-mucous gland, shows that
a discovery which has been misinterpreted by Wolff is of special value,
The substance secreted by this gland, both in bees and in aunts, and
ANTS’ NESTS. A489

also the secretion of the posterior glands of certain ants (the Dolichod-.
erides, with whom it serves as a weapon for smearing the faces of their
enemies), is immediately decomposed at the first contact with the air,
with a viclent production of gas bubbles and the development of an
aromatic odor which is very peculiar, As soon as this chemical decom-
position is completed the residue of the secretion is transformed into a
resinous, viscous mass, which is very sticky. There is no doubt in my
mind that the viscous substance formed in this way is not a smelling
mucus, as Wolff by a very far-fetched explanation, which is untenable
for many other reasons, would have it, but forms the cement with
which the nests and many other things are welded together.

What is still too little known, however, is the manner in which a
genuine phylogenetic evolution converts this gland cement gradually
into spun threads. The pasteboard of Lasius fuliginosus LATR. is very
rich in wood dust or earthy matter and very poor in cement, so that it
is very brittle. There is a drawing of it in my Fourmis de la Suisse, Pl.
Il, figs. 32 and 33. The pasteboard which Liometopum microcephalum
Pz. manufactures in the innermost hollow of venerable but, neverthe-
less, strong, handsome, hard, large trees, and which is also composed of
wood dust, is somewhat less brittle. They make it in oaks, poplars,
apricot trees, etc.,in southeastern Europe. Mayr gives a drawing of
it, taken from a photograph, in the Proceedings of the Imperial Royal
Zoological and Botanical Society of Vienna, June 1, 1892, Vol. X LU,
Pl. V, fig. 7. A great many species of the genera Cremastogaster LUND
and Dolichoderus LUND build only pasteboard nests on the boughs of
trees, and these nests vary very much in their nature. In some cases
the pasteboard is harder and more brittle, resembling wood, as among
the species just described; in other cases it is thinner and more elastic
or flexible, but at the same time has much greater power of resistance,
and is much more like paper or pasteboard, like thatof wasps. Cremas-
togaster stollii FoREL, of Guatemala, builds very peculiar galleries of
pasteboard along the trunks of trees between the projecting portions of
the bark. They were discovered in these galleries by my friend, Pro-
fessor Stoll, who communicated this circumstance to me. In Cremasto-
gaster ranavalone Forx#L, of Madagascar, the pasteboard of the inside
of the large, round, tree nest, is thicker and more brittle; that of the
outer portion is always thinner, more elastic, and finally, in the outer-
most layers, even perforated, having a reticulate appearance, somewhat
like loosely woven packing cloth. The nest of Cremastogaster ranava-
lone is represented in my ‘ Formicides de Madagascar” (from Grandi-
dier’s Natural History of Madagascar, Vol. XX, part 28, Pl. VI, fig 4,
4da,and 4b,and Pl. VII). The nest of Dolichoderus bispinosus OLIV.,
which is composed of the seed hairs of a tree of tropical America (the
wool tree, Bombax ceiba L.) woven together with gland cement, is very
similar in appearance to the outer portions of this nest, but still more
coarsely perforated and more net like. Fig. 18 represents a small piece
490 ANTS’ NESTS.

of this substance microscopically magnified. Fib represents the vege-
table filaments, which are only moderately dismembered, so that their
structure may easily be seen; Cem is the ant cement, the color of which
varies from yellowish to brownish, and which can be recognized by its
Shapelessness and its color; Mesh represents the empty meshes of the
network. Thanks to the coarseness of the substance, which is, conse-
quently, in an almost unscathed and unpulverized state, the ant cement
can be better distinguished from vegetable building matter in this case
than in the other kinds of ant pasteboard.

Fig. 15 represents, in one-third the natural size, the photographed nest
of Dolichoderus bituberculatus MAYR, of Bangkok, which was sent to me
by the late lamented and well-known turner, Mr. Heinrich Sigg, of
Zurich. This nest is composed of a compact (not perforated) but
fine-grained pasteboard, greatly resembling that of the nests of the
common wasp (Vespa germanica), but stronger. <A section of the nest
was taken off perpendicularly in order to show the structure of the
interior. The nest is resting in its natural position on the bough where
the ants had placed it. It can be.seen how the small branches and
leaves of the tree, glued together with pasteboard, are incorporated
into the nest, and how the main bough serves as an axle to support the
structure. It can be further seen how the labyrinth, constructed of
pasteboard, is built more or less concentrically around the bough.

Some species of the genera Camponotus (C. chartifer SMITH, traili
MAyR, fubricii ROGER, ete.), in South America, and Polyrhachis, in
the East Indies, manufacture a very similar pasteboard. Fig. 4 repre
sents a nest of Polyrhachis mayrt ROGER, of Ceylon. The whole nest
of most of the species of Polyrhachis consists of a single cavity of the
size of a walnut or of a hen’s egg, while the nests of other ants are, for
the greater part, divided into chambers and passages. The egg-shaped
nest of Polyrhachis mayri, which I received from Major Yerbury, of
Ceylon, through Mr. Wroughton, stands simply like the cocoon of the
silk-worm, on a leaf. The pasteboard of which it is composed resem-
bles that of a Cremastogaster nest, but is very weak and fragile, being
made of vegetable particles slightly glued together with gland cement.
A silk thread has never yet been discovered in any of them. The
cement is in the form of yellow or brownish flakes and crosspieces,
precisely like that of Dolichoderus bispinosus (fig. 18, the colored parts),
while the vegetable matter is entirely compact (without meshes) and
more finely dismembered, though still recognizable in its structure (not
pulverized); the walls of the nest are about half a millimeter thick.

Polyrhachis scissa ROGER, of Ceylon, builds its nest of exactly the
same materials; but it is irregularly formed, and is attached to leaves
rolled around galls, the crevices of which are closed with pasteboard.

I have received similar pasteboard nests of Dolichoderus gracilipes
Mayr and of a species of Cremastogaster tixed upon leaves, from
Ceylon, through Major Yerbury.

ANTS’ NESTS. 491

The nest of the Polyrhachis jerdonii! FoREL which I received from
Ceylon through Major Yerbury is very interesting. This species builds
upon leaves small nests, the wall of which greatly resembles in appear-
ance the shell of many Phryganeide larve. Pebbles, and especially
small fragments of plants, are cemented together by a fine web or
woven together, and form a rather soft and tough web-like nest wall
of a bright greyish-brown color. Fig.17 gives a microscopic picture of
this nest wall. Wesee here unmistakable small fragments of plants
(Schol.) bound together in a web by peculiar silk threads (Gesp),
These silk threads are found, upon a closer examination, to be of very
irregular thickness, often branching, and in many cases issuing from a
thicker crosspiece. Upon calling in the aid of the still more magnified
web of Polyrhachis dives SM. (also from the East Indies), in fig. 7, there
ean be no doubt that a viscous substance secreted by the glands, similar
to that which we have seen used as glue by the ants previously
described, is here simply drawn out into threads. In fig. 7 are seen
the thicker crosspieces of a still more shapeless mass of cement and
the more finely spun threads drawn transversely out of them.

Polyrhachis dives, however, no longer needs any foreign material. It
makes its nest wall out of pure silk web, exactly like coarse spun yarn
or the web of the caterpillar. The web is of a brownish yeilow, and
is fixed between leaves, which are lined with it and bound together.
Mr. Wroughton, of Poonah, India, sent me such a nest, simply between
two leaves.

A still finer, softer silk web, finer and thicker than the finest silk
paper, very soft and as pliable as the finest gauze, though much thicker,
of a brown color, is produced by Polyrhachis spinigera MAyR. Fig. 16
presents a microscopic picture of it. Here we find no more crosspieces,
but only silk threads. They are, however, still irregular, of varying
thickness, spun across each other into a web. This web is fixed in a
wonderful manner in the ground, where it forms the lining of a funnel-
shaped cave, which is widened out into a chamber at the bottom. The
honor of the discovery of this highly interesting nest is due to Mr.
Wroughton; he found it in Poonah, India, Mr. L. Schréter made the
somewhat schematic drawing of the nest, in its natural position, from

' Polyrhachis jerdonii (workers) n. sp. 44 millimeters in length, short and broad;
related to the Polyrhachis argentea Mayr, but still shorter, without silvery down,
with a much less arched thorax sharply edged at the side, the abdomen sharply
edged in front, with red mandibles, antenne, and legs (except the tarsi). The other
parts are of a dull black, thickly and irregularly punctate-reticulate, and with very
fine, yellow, sparse, recumbent, and almost no erect hair. The head is wider than
long, and broadens out very much behind. The clypeus is short, without flaps in
front, not carinate; the laminze diverge behind. The scape of the short frontal
antennie is somewhat in the shape of an 8, and hardly extends beyond the back
of the head. Scales between the spines, with a convex, emarginated upper border.
Spines just like those of Polyrhachis argentea. The sculpture of the head is like the
meshes of a net, with a dotted background. The body is dotted like a thimble.
492 ANTS’ NESTS.

an original sketch by Mr. Wroughton (fig. 8). We refer the reader to
the drawing and to the explanation of the plates.

The large nest constructed in the foliage of trees, between the leaves,
by Geophylla smaragdina FABR., one of the most common ants of trop-
ical Asia and tropical Africa, forms, however, the prototype of spun
ants’ nests. A great number of leaves are fastened together by a fine,
white web, like the finest silk stuff. This web, apart from the color,
has exactly the same appearance, both to the naked eye and under the
microscope, as that of Polyrhachis spinigera. The leaves are usually
fastened together by the edges. The nest is large, and the large, long
very vicious, reddish to greenish worker ants live in it, with their
grass-green females, their black males, and their whole brood. They
form very populous colonies in the branches of the trees. Fig. 10 repre-
sents a portion of the nest of Gcophylla smaragdina, with the web and
the borders of the leaves which are fastened together.

Now, how do the ants spin? This has, unfortunately, so far as I
know, never yet been observed sufficiently closely. Not even the way
in which the pasteboard of our European ants is made has been discov-
ered. Lasius fuliginosus has never consented to work before my eyes.
At all events, the spinning of Gfcophylla, which works in broad day-
light, ought to be the first to be seen, and, in fact, the only minute
observations on this subject known to me, by E. H. Aitken, in the Jour-
nal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 1890, Vol. V, No. 4, page
422 (‘Red ants’ nests”), now lie before me.

Aitken saw how Gcophylla fastened two leaves together. A worker
went to the base of the two leaves, at the point at which they began to
separate, placed his hind legs, which are furnished with sharp claws,
upon one of the leaves and drew the other leaf toward him with all his
might with his upper jaw. If the distance was too great, from two to
five ants chained themselves together for this task, each grasping the
body of one of the others, the first holding one leaf with his mandibles,
the last seizing the other leaf with the claws of the tarsi. While the
edges of the two leaves were held as close together as possible, simply
by these chains of ants working side by side, with the application of all
their strength in the utmost tension, as if by india-rubber bands, Aitken
saw other ants zealously engaged in binding the edges of the two leaves
together with strong silk threads or ropes, which they spun closer and
closer together the nearer the leaves approached each other. When a
sufficient number of leaves had been fastened together in this way by
their edges, the whole was rendered waterproof by a compact silk web,
and was divided into chambers and passages by asimilar web. Aitken
is a reliable and accurate observer. This bighly interesting observa-
tion of his is entitled to full credit. Only one thing is wanting to it, to
wit, the information from what part of the body of the ant the silk
thread issues. This must likewise be observed.

ANTS’ NESTS. 493

In my opinion, however, there is no doubt that the silk thread of
(eophylla and of the spinning species of Polyrhachis, like the cement
of the other species of Polyrhachis, many of Cremastogaster and Doli-
choderus, Lasius fuliginosus, ete., is formed from the so-called mouth
saliva, and most probably from the secretion of the glands of the upper
jaw. The cells of these glands, at least in Gicophylla, are large and
numerous.

6.—SYMBIOSIS AND KINDRED RELATIONS BETWEEN ANTS AND PLANTS.

By symbiosis, in the more restricted sense, is meant the mutual serv-
ices of two organisms living together, which, by a defensive alliance in
the struggle for existence, are so dependent upon each other that the
one can not thrive well without the other. The formation of special
morphological characteristics is usually combined with genuine sym-
biosis. There are, besides, all possible forms of imperfect symbiosis,
displaying transitions to parasitism, etc., above all, however, those in
which only one of the two organisms is really dependent upon the
other. For example, the small beetles Lomechusa and Atemeles can not
live without their ant host. On the other hand, the ant can exist very
well without such guests, and merely eats the secretion from the hair
clusters of the beetles as a dainty (see Wasmann’s elegant Observa- .
tions on the Biology of the Guests of the Ants). There are, however,
cases of still more imperfect, counterfeit symbiosis, where one organ-
ism entirely ignores the other, and, lastly, casual relations which are
erroneously regarded as symbiotic.

The relations of certain ants to certain plants give rise to very
peculiar forms of nests, of which we will speak briefly.

(a) Genuine symbiosis.—Dr. Fritz Miiller, of Blumenau, South Brazil,
has discovered the real relation of the Cecropia trees (the imbauba of
the Brazilians) to Azteca instabilis SmitH. The ant genus Azteca
ForREL, which is related to Liometopum MAYR, contains several Ameri-
can species, but the biology of Azteca instabilis only is known. Prof.
A. F. W. Schimper (The Varying Relations between Plants and Ants,
Jena, 1888) has given us in his excellent work his own observations in
South Brazil, which substantially complete those of Miiller.

Azteca instabilis lives only in the hollow trunks of certain species of
Cecropia, especially Cecropia adenopus, which trunks are divided into
chambers by transverse compartments; but Schimper has discovered
a species of Cecropia on the Corcovado, which never contains ants, while
Cecropia adenopus and others, as soon as they have grown somewhat
large (1 year old), are always inhabited by Azteca instabilis. The fol-
lowing is now further ascertained :

The pregnant females of Azteca instabilis seek out for themselves a
certam very thin and soft spot in the trunk of the Cecropia, which
always has the same situation in every internode, bore into it, and thus
get into the hollow, where they deposit their brood, if they are not
494 ANTS’ NESTS.

attacked by parasites (ichneumon flies), The opening then closes,
but is subsequently.opened again by the worker ants. This thinned
spot is an adaptation of the plant to the ant; it does not occur in the
Cecropia which is free from ants (that is to say, the corresponding bud
depression is not changed in texture and is not atrophied). On the
underside of the stem of the leaf of Cecropia adenopus and others is a
peculiar hair cushion, which is constantly secreting albuminous, egg-
shaped particles (Miiller’s corpuscles). These secretions are eagerly
collected and devoured by the Azteca; they are one of their chief arti-
cles of food (ascertained through Fritz Miller). The Cecropia which
is free from ants has none of Miiller’s corpuscles. The species of Cecro-
pia are much frequented in Brazil by the leaf-cutting ants (species of
Atta) and are terribly injured by them, as has been repeatedly ascer-
tained by Belt and others. All those which contain Azteca colonies are
spared, because the vicious Azteca pursue the Atta furiously and drive
them away.

All this is well ascertained. The plant, by an undoubted adaptation,
gives the ant food and lodging. The ant, in return, defends the plant
from its worst enemy. This symbiotic relation did not, of course, arise
all at once. Schimper found a Cecropia which is not inhabited by the
Azteca until later, and probably also less regularly. This Cecropia has
also, it is true, thinned boring spots, but they are not formed until
later, and it has not as yet any Miiller’s corpuscles. Last year in Bul-
garia I watched in oak woods and in old trees in general Liometopum
microcephalum Pz., of Europe, which lives in trees. The trunks of the
trees are there, too, covered with ants, which attack fiercely all that
approach them. We have not in Europe any species of Atta that cut
leaves, but, on the other hand, we have so many more beetles and other
insects which delight to destroy the old oaks. Iwas charmed at seeing
near Aetos the finest oak forest that I have ever beheld, with real, superb
giants. Almost all of them were inhabited by Liometopum colonies,
whose running workers covered all the trunks of the oaks. I have no
doubt that these fierce ants, whose carnivorous habits Emery has
described, drive away the enemies of the oak. The symbiotic relations
of the Azteca and the Cecropia were probably formed from these sim-
plez relations. Liometopum lives only in trees; the trees, however, do
not display the least adaptation to that ant.

Belt and Schimper have further proved, as to Acacia spherocephala
WILLD. and A. spadicigera CHAM. and SCHLECHT?, of Central America,
that ants of the genus Pseudomyrma LUND not only always live in the
hollow thorns, but, owing to a peculiar adaptation of that plant greatly
resembling that of the Cecropia, find sugar and albuminous food upon
them. These two species of Acacia possess so-called extrafloral necta-
ries, which furnish the ants with sugar, and.on the points of their leaves
Belt corpuscles rich in albumen (resembling the Miiller corpuscles of the
Cecropia), which supply them with albumen. Still a closer direct obser-

ANTS’ NESTS. 495

vation of the reception of the food by the ants is as yet wanting here.
The Acacias which are free from ants do not possess these peculiar
arrangements.

(b) Imperfect symbiosis.—Belt has ascertained that the species of
Pseudomyrma which inhabit Acacia thorns are fierce, warlike creatures,
and keep every foe at a distance from the plant, including the leaf-
cutting Atta, the forest destroyers of America. The adaptation of the
ant to the plant is ascertained as soon as it is proved that the respective
species always lives and can thrive only in the corresponding plant.
This has recently been sufficiently demonstrated in the case of Pseudo-
myrma flavidula and Pseudomyrma belti. With all this, however, it is
not yet proved that all Acacias inhabited by ants contribute anything
on their part to this arrangement. In fact, this is not yet proved in
the case of many species; in others, it is very doubtful or improbable,
because, on the one hand, there are many hollow Acacia thorns without
ants (Mr. Wroughtop has sent me such from India), and because, on
the other hand, many species of ants of the genera Pseudomyrma, Sima,
and Cremastogaster frequently inhabit these thorns, and frequently
make their nests in some other way. These hollow thorns with the
round aperture, which the ants make use of, and which are very similar
in appearance to that of the gall in fig. 1, have been often depicted,
and we do not, therefore, think it worth while to reproduce them here.
I found a thorn of Acacia fistula, which had been brought from Somali
Land by Prof. C. Keller, and which was inhabited by Cremastogaster
chiarintti EMERY, divided inside by pasteboard into a few small cham-
bers. In the case of Cremastogaster chiarinii EM., C. acacia FOREL,
and (C. ruspolius FOREL, there appears to be an adaptation of the
ant to the plant.

We must now speak of the celebrated pseudobulbs of the epiphytic
plants of the genera Myrmecodia and Hydnophytum of the Sunda
Islands. Fig. 14 represents, in half the natural size, the photographed
cross section of Hydnophytum montanum, which, with other magnificent
specimens of this plant and of its relative, Myrmecodia, which has
often been sketched, was sent to me recently from Java through the
kindness of my friend and colleague, Dr. Ad. Frick, of Zurich. The
enormous bulb of this plant, which lives as a parasite upon trees, is
always pierced by a hollow labyrinth, as represented by the cross sec-
tion in our figure. Now, this hollow labyrinth, according to the obser-
vations of Forbes, Beccari, Treub, and others, as well as that of
Myrmecodia, is always inhabited by ants, which issue from little open-
ings near the point of departure of the roots and fiercely attack every
one who approaches, so that the natives are very unwilling to fetch
these plants. Three species of ants, Iridomyrmex cordatus SMITH,
Cremastogaster deformis SM., and Pheidole javana MAYR, were found
in Myrmecodia and in Hydnophytum. While, however, Jridomyrmex
seems to make its appearance always in these plants only, Pheidole
496 ANTS’ NESTS.

javana is very widespread in the Sunda Islands, and makes its nests in
other ways besides. Emery is, therefore, of the opinion, which is
doubtless correct, that Pheidole merely robs the nests of Iridomyrmex
occasionally and is not adapted to the plant. On the other hand,
Emery regards Cremastogaster deformis as the constant guest of the
Hydnophytum. In all the Myrmecodia and Hydnophytum bulbs that IL
received in alcohol through Dr, Frick there was a colony of the smaller,
darker Javanese variety of Iridomyrmex cordatus SMiIrH (Var. Myrme-
codie EMERY), including males, a few pregnant females, and numerous
larvee and pup. All the specimens of the plant had the same hollow
labyrinth, looking like a nest built by ants. It must be added that the
genus Iridomyrmex is very closely related to Azteca and Liometopum,
but comprises many species which build nests of earth.

Now, Treub has ascertained (Annals of the Botanical Garden of
Buitenzorg, Vol. VII, 1888, p. 191) that Myrmecodia raised from seeds
in hothouses and in the botanical garden of Buitenzorg develop the
whole hollow labyrinth in their bulbs, to complete maturity, without
the presence of ants, just as well as those which, in a state of freedom,
possess ants. At the same time the plants thrive admirably. This
proves that the labyrinth is produced by the plant, and not by the ants,
though Beceari repeatedly found severed bundles of vessels in the com-
partments. Treub has, consequently, resorted to other attempts at an
explanation, and has regarded these singular cavities as the breathing
organs of the plant, and connected them with the interior irrigation of
their web (the compartments have a very watery web), which, in view
of the epiphytic situation of the plant upon trees with little foliage, is
plausible. My own opinion, however, is that Beccari’s observations
are correct, and that the ants lend their aid by connecting some of the
cavities by bored passages, as the natural cavities do not all appear to
me to have a natural communication with each other, such as the ants
require. Furthermore, the founders of the colony, the mother females,
must first bore in. At all events, only the adaptation on the part of
the ant is well ascertained—that is to say, in the case at least of
Tridomyrmex cordatus, which finds its exclusive, beautiful, and secure
dwelling in the plants of the genera Myrmecodia, Hydnophytum (and
Dischidia?). Botanists say that these plants furnish no special food to
the ants, at least nothing has been found corresponding to the Miiller’s
corpuscles of Cecropia. Since, however, most of the Dolichoderi keep
no plant lice, but lick up the seeretions of plants, or devour insects, a
closer investigation of the mode of feeding of Iridomyrmex cordatus
would probably bring some interesting facts to light. Besides, Treub’s
observations do not prove by any-means that the plant does not form
the labyrinth for the purpose of serving as a dwelling for the ants.
The fierce inmates certainly afford it protection against its enemies.
We must investigate, as Schimper did for Cecropia, whether there are
kindred species of plants, not inhabited by ants, with or without similar

=

labyrinths. It remains surprising enough, in spite of Treub’s later
explanation, that so small a plant forms such a colossal bulb, with such
cavities, to which a particular species of ant has so evidently adapted
itself. It seems to me that the possibility of an adaptation on the part
of the plant can not yet be decisively denied, and that we should await
further investigations into the biology of Iridomyrmex cordatus and
Cremastogaster deformis. The fact that in the botanical garden at
Buitenzorg Myrmecodia thrives without Iridomyrmex (Treub) proves
nothing, because, in the first place, the conditions of the struggle for
existence are entirely different there from those of the primeval forest;
and, in the second place, because other ants frequently take possession
of their dwellings in the Myrmecodia bulbs, and act as their represen-
tatives. Treub found no dangerous foes of Myrmecodia in the botanical
garden, but in the forest it can be eaten or otherwise destroyed by
mammals or other animals which are kept at a distance by the ants.
Skepticism is necessary and good, but denial and rejection are not
good without sufficient reasons.

In a shrub in Borneo, Clerodendron jfistulosum BECCARI, Beccari
constantly found a Colobopsis, whici Emery has named Colobopsis
clerodendri. Were the plant, which, like the Cecropia, has hollow inter-
nodes, likewise forms a round attenuated spot in its walls, which is
bored through by Colobopsis, and serves it as a door. The plant also
possesses innumerable extrafloral nectaries (that is to say, glands pro-
ducing a sugary liquid, which lie, not in the flowers, but in other
places). Still, 1am not yet entirely convinced, in this case, that there
is an adaptation on the part of the plant, because the species of the
genus Colobopsis, so far as hitherto known, are shy and cowardly, and
would, consequently, furnish no protectors to the plant. The similar-
ity of the shape of the head of the soldier of this species seems to me
to indicate that he stops up the round opening of the nest in the stalk
of the Clerodendron, with his head, in the same manner that the
soldier of our European Colobopsis truncata stops up the door of his
wood nest. All investigations on this subject, as well as on the ant’s
mode of feeding, are stil) wanting.

There are, besides, a number of similar incomplete or doubtful rela-
tions, noticed especially by Beccari, as, for example, that of the palms
of the genus Korthalsia to Camponotus hospes EMERY and korthalsia
EMERY; that of plants of the genus Triplaris to various ants which
inhabit their stalks, ete.; but minute investigations of them are still
wanting. The future will yet bring us many surprises.

(c) Casual relations.—We have already become acquainted with these
in that kind of nest in which the ants make use of natural cavities.
Hollow acacia thorns are also frequently used as dwellings by ants
which elsewhere make their nests in an entirely different way. Thus,
Mr. Wroughton once, in an exceptional case in India, found Sima nigra
JERDON living in an acacia thorn.

498 ANTS’ NESTS.

7.—COMPOUND NESTS.

In the Communications of the Swiss Entomological Society, Vol. I,
part 3, 1869 (Observations on the habits of Solenopsis fugax), I first
called attention to the fact that two hostile species of ants can live in
nests which are regularly intercalated. In my “ Fourmis de la Suisse”
(1874), I showed that such relations occur very frequently and more or
less accidentally among many species of ants, especially under stones
that are well adapted to nests and greatly in demand; while, in Solen-
opsis fugax LATR., “double nests” form a very ordinary, in fact, the
most ordinary, occurrence, at least in our meadows. Wasmann (The
Compound Nests and Mixed Colomes of Ants, Miinster i, W., 1891,
Aschendorff’s) has corroborated and supplemented my observations on
this subject. Instead of the name ‘double nests,” used by me, he has
introduced the more correct expression ‘compound nests” (to be trans-
lated into French by ‘‘nids composés”). In fact, these nests are not
unfrequently threefold, and even fourfold—that is to say, the nests of
from three to four different and hostile species of ants are built into
each other, without, however, having any open communication with
each other. If the partitions are destroyed, war ensues immediately.
The worker of Solenopsis fugax is a puny, yellowish ant, hardly 2 milli-
meters in length, but the females grow to an imposing size, and look
like giants by the side of the workers. This species is in the habit of
digging its nests in the thick walls of the nests of the ants of the
larger species, and in such a manner that,wherever there is room, large
halls are constructed (fig. 6, S),in which the females and the males are
comfortably lodged with their large pup and larvie, while small pas-
sages connect these halls. Extremely small passages, not visible in the
figure, afford the workers exclusively admission to the chambers of the
host ant (fig. 6, For). According to my observations and those of
Wasmann, Solenopsis fugax lives like a thief and little robber, at the
expense of its involuntary host. The little workers make their way
through extremely small passages to the pupa and larva heaps of the
large ants and devour them from underneath without being seen, thanks
to their small size. They also devour openly the forage supplies, as
well as the dead and sick individuals, of the larger species (mostly
Formica fusca L., but also Formica rufa, F. pratensis, F. sanguinea,
Polyerqus rufescens, Lasius niger, ete.).

ig. 6 represents a fragment of a double nest of Formica fusca and
Solenopsis fugax from the Zurich Mountain. By means of dissolved
shellac, which I poured upon the nest in fine weather, and then allowed
to dry, I succeeded in making it firm enough to be able to take it out
without injuring it. The fine-grained, polished interior walls of the
Solenopsis cavities are seen, in contrast to the coarse-grained and more
spacious Formica chambers. <As the ants take up the moist earth with
their mandibles in the form of small lumps, and then work it into shape
with their jaws and forelegs, in order to construct theiy masonry with

ANTS’ NESTS. 499

it, and as, moreover, the large Formica works with much coarser parti-
cles than the puny Solenopsis, the different character of the walls is at
once explained.

I have already explained the frequent occurrence of imperfect, more
accidental compound nests of other species of ant, by ascribing them
to the acquisition of favorable localities, especially the underside of
stones. From this competition frequently arise very murderous under-
ground wars, which I have often watched. I have noticed closely, in
glass apparatus, how they are carried on. The ants mine toward each
other. A battle begins where their work happens to meet. The con-
queror forces his way into the gallery of the conquered. The latter,
however, hastens, after he has retired a few millimeters or centimeters,
as the case may be, to stop up his gallery thoroughly with earth. The
victor does not then, by any means, always succeed in again finding the
entrance to it, but, in many cases, mines by the side of it, and thus
partial interlappings of the nests arise. The galleries of Solenopsis
Sugar are often broken through by the large ants. The little robbers
are, however, in the first place, very courageous and combative; and,
in the second place, they know how to mine rapidly and how to barri-
cade rapidly, and by this means to make a skillful use of all the parti-
tions, as I have been enabled to observe directly in the glass nest.
The digging and fighting spirit is at its highest pitch among the ants

‘in the first half of the summer, when the nests have to be enlarged for

the brood. It then ceases, and truces follow; in the autumn there is
abundant space for all, and peace prevails. It is not without reason
that the females and males of Solenopsis fugax do not swarm until Sep-
tember, when the swarming time of their host ants (July=August) has
long been past. They can then, in spite of their size, go to the upper
surface of the nest and swarm undisturbed, as I have seen myself,
whereas they could not have done so earler without great danger.

A peculiar variety of the compound nest is formed by the dwelling
of the guest ant Formicoxrenus nitidulus NYL., with Formica rufa and
Formica pratensis, which I first discovered in a fragmentary condition,
and which Adlerz subsequently found and described more fully. For-
micorenus hunts the large Formica, and even follows it up closely
throughout its changes of abode, as Wasmann first noticed, and as I
have verified. By Formica, on the other hand, it is merely tolerated
and supereciliously ignored. The peaceable guest constructs in the
walls of the nest of its large host ant little chambers and passages,
which are, however, only imperfectly closed, and open freely into the
chambers of the Formica. In these little chambers lie the brood of
the Formicoxenus. The Formicoxenus’s mode of subsistence is still

unknown.
8.—NESTS OF MIXED COLONIES.

The mixed colonies of the slaveholding ants and parasite ants (Poly-
ergus rufescens LATR., Strongylognathus testaceus SCHENK and S. huberi
FOREL, Anergates atratulus SCHENK, Yenomyrmex stollii FOREL) have
500 © ANTS’ NESTS.

nests which always display the architecture of the working ant (slave
or host), and have no further interest for us here. When Polyergus
rufescens seizes Formica rufibarbis and keeps it as its slave, its nesé
resembles a larger nest of that species; if, on the other hand, it enslaves
Formica fusca, its nest looks like the nest of Formica fusca, because
the so-called slave or auxiliary ants are the only builders.

The case appears to be somewhat different in the rare, natural, for-
tuitous mixed colonies (Formica pratensis or truncicola or exsecta, with
Formica fusca; Tapinoma erraticum with Bothriomyrmex meridionalis)
discovered by me (Fourmis de la Suisse), as well as in Formica san-
guinea LATR., which almost always keep slaves, but notwithstanding
also work themselves. Here the nest assumes a mixed architecture,
as both species of ant work on it, each in accordance with its instine-
tive art. And yet they do not interfere with each other. Each species
understands how to combine its work harmoniously with that of the
other, although the methods of the two are often very different, as, for
instance, with the mason ants, Formica fusca and Formica pratensis,
which work more like carpenters with their little branches and cross-
pieces. Fusca unites the wooden rafters of pratensis by means of moist
earth, and the whole lasts very well. I have also caused many artificial
mixed colonies to be founded between Formica sanguinea and F. pra-
tensis, etc., have even discovered naturally established colonies of these
two latter species, and have investigated their mixed architecture.

9.—MIGRATORY NESTS.

Belt (The Naturalist in Nicaragua, 1874) was again the first to dis-
cover the hitherto-unknown nest of the American migratory ants
(Heiton). He found in the forest an immense ant ball, from which all
the robber columns issued, and in which all the brood lay. Here was
a genuine nomad nest, a living nest without a house. Sceptical as we
had been with regard to the other discoveries of the genial Belt, we
remained so respecting this one, too, until I succeeded, in the year
1885, in interesting Fritz Miiller’s younger brother, Dr. Wilhelm Miil-
ler, who was residing at that time at Blumenau with his brother, in
this question. Dr. W. Miiller has published the results of his very
interesting observations in the first volume of Kosmos (1886, p. 81:
Observations on Migratory Ants). That which bears upon our subject
may be summed up as follows: The larger species of Heiton, which have
eyes (hamatum F., foreli MAYR, quadriglumis HALID. [=legionis SM.
—lugubre ROGER], ete.) do not build or exeavate any nests. They livea
wandering life and merely occupy with their extremely numerous colo-
nies spacious, naturally sheltered places, such as hollow trees or shrubs,
in which they live rolled up together in immense clusters (one cluster
of ants and brood, measured by Dr. W. Miiller, which did not compose
half the colony, measured in an etherized state 5,600 cubic centimeters).
The larvee and pup first collected by Dr. W. Miiller and examined by me

peck s
ANTS’ NESTS. 501

lie at liberty among the ants, and are carried by them. The robbing
expeditions are undertaken in the daytime, and the booty is carried to
the migratory nest, where it serves chiefly as food for the larve.
When one locality has been sufficiently pillaged the whole colony
migrates to another resting place. These latter migrations with bag
and baggage, that is to say, with the brood, take place exclusively at
night.

Far less is known about the nests of the blind species of Eciton and
the entirely blind migratory ant genera Dorylus and dinictus, whose
workers had previously, like the male of Hciton (labidus), been classed
as Separate genera (Typhlopone WESTW. and Typhlatta SMITH), because
their connection with the previously described males was not yet
known. Ihave myself seen Dorylus juvenculus, at Gabés, South Tunis,
hunting under ground. The winged males of Dorylus juvenculus FAB.
(badius GERST.), Eciton hetschkoi MAyR, and dfnictus wroughtonit
FOREL have been seen creeping out of the ground in company with
workers and flying away. The very nest of Dorylus helvolus was dug
up by Trimen, who found the female. Nothing more definite, however,
is known. Are the plundered nests of other ants used for the moment
as Inigratory nests? Are there here nocturnal migrations, too, and not
robbing expeditions only? The future must tell us. At all events,
judging by the observations made up to this time, including my own,
Dorylus and Anictus appear to prefer the neighborhood of human
habitations, and to fight under ground with other ants.

10.—ROAD BUILDING.

Certain European ants, Formica rufa, F. pratensis, and Lasius fuligi-
nosus, build genuine roads in our meadows. The finest and best finished
are those of Formica pratensis DE GEER. A meadow, as has already
been said, is a primeval forest to the ants. If the ants are like Formica
pratensis, rather large, and if they are compelled, like that species, to
drag home all kinds of timbers as building materials, as well as animal
booty, a meadow, which otherwise furnishes them with the finest hunt-
ing grounds, presents terrible obstacles. Formica pratensis is awk-
ward; we need only notice what inexpressible difficulty it has in
making its way with a load through the thicket of blades of grass ina
meadow, how constantly the load is getting wedged between them, and
what incredible patience and perseverance the insect displays in the
effort to go forward to understand the object of the roads. The road
building of Formica pratensis presents one of the most wonderful dis-
plays of animal instinet that I know of. Several such roads radiate with
great regularity from one of the larger nests of this species lying in
ameadow; I have counted from three to eight and even twelve of them
(so large a number is rare and occurs only in the case of very large
nests). It can be seen that these roads lead mostly to trees or shrubs
on which the ants climb up in multitudes in order to milk the plant
502 ANTS’ NESTS.

lice. The road itselfis kept very clean, is from 2 to 4 centimeters in
width, and is made more or less concave laterally. Not only is no
movable object allowed upon it, not only is it kept always clean and in
good order, but the ants, with the expenditure of incredible toil and
strength, saw off with their mandibles every blade of grass that
attempts to grow in the road, as they previously sawed off all those
which were in existence when it was first constructed. Where the
tufts of grass are too thick and strong, they go around them, it is true;
but the roads usually run comparatively straight to their destination.
Many of them are gradually lost in the grass; but as a rule they can
be followed to a distance of 20, 30, 40, and in many cases 50 meters
from the nest. One must watch long, closely, and above all in the
spring, to see and understand the road building, and to avoid the
impression that the road, as certain authors have thought, comes into
existence of itself through the footsteps of the ants. These roads are
very numerously frequented. All the building materials and forage
are first dispatched to the nearest road, so that they may be carried
comfortably from there to the nest. As Formica pratensis has very
defective powers of smell, and is not skillful in finding its way, the roads
are also of great advantage to it in this respect. There are only two
directions on them, and it is no longer compelled to search laboriously
for the right way. It can be seen, too, how rapidly and confidently the
ants move to and fro on their roads, in contrast to their behavior in the
grass. (Compare Forel: Collections of Swiss Zoology, Vol. IV, No. 4,
1888.)

The agricultural ants of Texas (Pogonomyrmex barbatus SMITH, P.
molefaciens BUCKLEY) make a large clearing around their nests, accord-
ing to Lincecum and MacCook, and numerous roads, in addition, by
sawing off the blades of grass, like our Formica pratensis.

11.—REVIEW—THE ANT WORLD—LANDSCAPE TYPES OF THE ANTS’
NESTS—POLYCALIC COLONIES.

Even among us in Switzerland, a close investigation of the meadows,
the dry declivities of the mountains, the clearings of the woods and
thickets suffices to show us speedily that almost everything is invaded
by the structures of ants. Where there are no actual nests there are
underground passages and galleries, open roads, covered ways, or, at
least, the inhabitants of neighboring nests, who are scouting around
and contending with one another for the possession of the plants con-
taining plant lice and cochineal kermes, of the trees, the flowers, and
the insect plunder. I have even seen young birds which had just
slipped out of the nest killed and devoured by Formica pratensis in
spite of the frantic rage of the parent birds. The ants certainly, no
less than men, fancy themselves the lords of creation, for, thanks to
their social organization, their numbers, and their courage, they have
few foes to fear; their most formidable enemies are always other

ANTS’ NESTS. 503

ants, just as men are for other men. In the tropical world the strug-
gle for existence is much fiercer than with us, and the ants, with their
immense number of species, play a much more important part. Their
nest structures there, too, are correspondingly far more varied, and
(display far more singular and complicated adaptations as the results of
the fight for life. The future will develop many still more astonishing
discoveries.

We will now only give a glance at the most ordinary ant structures
with respect to the nature of the ground.

In the meadows we find, above all, the mound structures of earth, but
side by side with them the mixed mounds of Formica pratensis, san-
guinea, and pressilabris, together with pure excavated nests. On detri-
tus and declivities, we find chiefly nests under stones, and the same
upon mountains generally. In the forest we find the mighty mounds
of Formica rufa, exsectoides, and exsecta, frequently gathered into large,
united kingdoms, containing many nests (polycalic colonies), and also
the tree nests of Lasius fuliginosus, L. brunneus, Camponotus hercu-
leanus, Liometopum microcephalum, ete. Genuine, that is to say free,
tree nests of pasteboard or web in the boughs of trees do not occur in
Europe. Lastly, in the forest clearings, the edges of the woods, and in
thickets we find a rich mixture of the three above-named landscape
types with respect to ants’ nests. The meadow type, the forest type,
and the detritus or declivity type are here mingled pellmell.

The nest structure in the desert, as I have been enabled to learn by
observation in southern Tunis, forms a peculiar type. There all is
excavated in the sand. There are neither mounds nor stones. but at
most hillocks of sand around the openings of the nests.

My object has been inerely to give, by the aid of drawings, a clear
view of our present knowledge of the nest building of the ants and to
communicate some new facts in connection with it. I trust that I have
succeeded.

To conclude, it is a pleasure to me to express my warmest thanks to
my friend Mr. Ludwig Schroter for his successful drawings; to Professor
Schréter for his kind assistance, his suggestions, and his advice; and
to the persons who procured me my excellent materials, especially my
friends, Mr. Wroughton, Dr. Frick, Professor Emery, Dr. Liengime, and
Professor Mayr.

THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY IN ITS
HISTORICAL ASPECTS. '

By R. D. MELVILLE.

The key to the enigma of the universe is found in the doctrine of
evolution. Far from being the purely modern theory, as which it is so
generally regarded, it is merely a redevelopment of the theory of a
certain school or system of Brahman philosophy—that of Kapila, which
dates from at least five hundred years before Christ. This system
“assumes the existence of a primordial matter from all eternity, out
of which the universe has, by successive stages, evolved itself.” So
our theory of evolution is no new idea after all, though perhaps much
more definite and particular than that of the Eastern philosophers.

To the physical, animal, vegetable, and even mineral worlds, the doe-
trine of evolution equally applies, and its significance is not confined
to a necessary connection between the terms “evolution,” “man,” and
“monkey,” so often nowadays found unalterably associated in the
minds of the ignorant. The doctrine is a fundamental conception of
all seience—mental, moral, and physical.

In the last of these divisions, viz, physical, with which our subject
starts, from the Ameeba, the lowest existing form of animal life (the
single-celled protoplasm), to the human being, the highest existing
development of protoplasmic organism and the most complex and com-
plete creation in nature, all is the history of evolution. The history
of the individual, with which our inquiry more particularly deals, is a
particular example of the universal history of the human family—the
story of the evolution of mind. And the story of mental evolution is
the history of the evolution of morals.

As we run up the scale of organism, passing from the simple to the
more and more complex, we are forcibly struck by the at once close
connection and: yet wide separation between mere animal and human
life. Organically and physically the same, the separation lies in that
mental constitution, using the term in a higher and more strictly philo-
sophical sense. Yet, where the physical ends and the mental begins is
impossible definitely to determine.

508 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

It is the history of that mental constitution in its development that
we propose here to trace in its general aspects. That history is the
story of the evolution of society.

To trace the evolution of society is to trace the growth of mind sub-
sequently to the evolution of the individual. Our task, however, is
somewhat easier thai it has been in the earlier stages of our inquiry.
We have larger facts and stronger evidences, while the periods of time
to be considered are infinitely more adapted to the grasp of the ordi-
nary mind. Instead of dealing with thousands and tens of thousands
of years, as ciphers, we work with centuries and decades. We employ
analysis, synthesis, and criticism; but our materials are larger. We
do not require such minute analysis, such exact synthesis, or such crit-
ical discrimination as were necessary in earlier investigation.

Society, as we shall use the term here, must be understood in its
widest significance—that aggregation of bodies of individuals, which
bodies in themselves constitute a “society” (in a secondary sense), a
“polity,” or a “state.” Each of those secondary societies or states,
which go to form the widest conception of society as a whole, are, in
our enlarged subject, as the individual is to the community in which
he is placed. We said that the individual was the highest point reached
in the evolution of organism, Society as a whole is the highest point
attained in the evolution of the individual, which is merely a further
stage in the evolution of mind.

Dr. H. D. Traill, whose name must be familiar to all in the field of
intellectual investigation, says: “Every civilized society is in the
nature of an organism, the shape and direction of whose evolution
depends in part upon the action of internal forces and in part upon
the influence of surroundings.” The fundamental principles of evolu-
tion—* struggle for existence, adaptation to environment, survival of
the fittest ”—all apply here, just as to the individual animal life.

The study of evolution in all its branches is the study of history ;
but history of different kinds. The study of the evolution of society
is history in its highest and truest sense. It is the study of man in his
advance from barbarisin to civilization, from civilization to culture, and
of the principles and institutions which have aided his upward march
and developed his present character. In it we read the story of prog-
ress. We see it, to use the common but appropriate metaphor, like a
little spring, bubbling up from the rocky soil, ever in danger of being
dried up. It moves on—a tiny rivulet—whispering and gurgling, yet
ever enlarging as it goes. The rivulet becomes a stream; the opposing
pebbles become great stones; the stream grows to a river, a great vol-
ume of water, deep, strong, and irresistible, cutting out channels for
itself, overcoming all obstacles, leaping, circling, and falling, till, as
Kingsley puts it—

Strong and free, strong and free,
The flood-gates are open;
Away to the sea,

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 509

and the tiny rivulet, swelled to a mighty river, “loses itself in the
infinite main.” It is difficult for us to realize that the man of the pres-
ent day—the bridger of ocean and air, the transcendental student of
the infinite, the scientific explorer of the universe—is “the selfsame
being, the same in form, in mind, in destination, as the poor, creeping,
untutored savage who ages ago, in his weakness and ignorance, looked
upon the little earth around him as the whole of creation, upon the
ocean as he knew not what, reaching he knew not where; and who
stood gazing with mingled fear and admiration as the fires of heaven
alternately rose and set, glimmered, and faded away.”

This is the conception of man—the individual, the protoplasm of
society—with which we enter upon our investigation; in the present
instance, a mere sketch. ;

Originating in the individual, society is represented in its first stage
by the family. This, as we know, formed the basis of the Hindoo com-
munity, the Grecian State, the Roman State; and we have analogous
evidence to prove that it was the foundation of all other earlier com-
munities besides. This was society in its patriarchal stage.

In our present investigation it is advisable to proceed upon certain
definite lines. We shall better attain our object now by tracing, by
general indication, the gradual growth and development of manners,
customs, religion, laws, industry, arts, learning, literature, scientific
knowledge, and institutions. These, in the order enumerated, I con-
ceive to be the outcome of social evolution. In its earliest stage—the
patriarchal—only the first two or three of these characteristics existed
or could exist in any definite form. Manners, customs, and religion, in
however crude a form, exist wherever we have the nucleus of a society.
Laws, as such, were a later development, their place in early communi-
ties being filled by custom—an arbitrary code sometimes marvelously
allied to natural justice, at other times subverting all modern concep-
tions of that moral law. The rule of life at this period was, generally,
“might is right,” the only rule practicable in an age when, according
to the philosopher Hobbes, all men were in a state of hostility te each
other, and each man took as he was able, by the strength of his arm.

The nature and general treatment of our subject enable us to pass
over the first beginnings of anything like a concrete society, and take up
the thread at that point where laws and commerce, being added to eus-
toms, manners, and religion; were beginning to mold the whole body of
society into something like a definite form. Arbitrary customs, prim.
itive manners, religious forms and ceremonies are now modified and
improved. The unwritten law of custom is now expressly stated as law,
and the first real step is taken in the practical organization of society.
We find this situation realized in Rome at the time of the republic, at
and for some time after the publication of the famous Decemviral Code
known as the Twelve Tables. At the same time intercourse with aliens,
for sale and barter and exchange of commodities, begins to exercise a

510 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

marked influence upon social development. From this point our course
is clear. We can not enter into particulars; that is impossible here;
neither can we trace, even in barest outline, the course of the history
of the world and its peoples. It is, however, generally understood that
the history of society—social, moral, and political—is the history of
European peoples; and of these the course of progress is traced in the
history of a certain few. Not that we can exclude Asiatic, African, or
American races from the conception of society as a whole, but only in
so far as these have advanced a certain length, while our inquiry is
from the lowest to the highest position yet attained, we must leave
these lagging societies behind, and follow that portion of the human
race in the van of the army of progress. Our course is marked by
many great landmarks, impossible to be mistaken, and every one sig-
nificant in a peculiar degree. These landmarks are social revolutions.
A certain writer (Edgar Quinet, I think, but can not at this time verify)
said that ‘‘ great revolutions are the prominent and enduring landmarks
on the highway of the world, far raised above all surrounding objects
pointing the progress not of particular nations but of the human
race.”

Our first halting stage is on the ruins of the Roman Empire.

The social question and society as we understand it to-day had its

rise in the feudal system. And this, for so long a net about the feet of
the world, was yet a benefit in disguise of an evil adapted to the age in
which it flourished. As snow enveloping the earth ina mantle of white
renders all external things bleak, bare, and unpromising, yet under its
cold covering keeps warm and living the seeds that, when the due time
comes, will burst and beautify the face of nature, so the feudal system
enveloped society for nine centuries in a cloak of darkness; yet under-
neath it nourished the spirit and the principles which, when the time
arrived, burst forth and blossomed into rational institutions and made
the world what it is to-day. But the feudal system had its rise when
tome had lost her greatness and been humbled in the dust; when the
Roman character as much resembled the ancient conception of old
Cato the Censor as an Anglo-Saxon of the Conquest resembles an Eng-
lishman of the present day.

When, in course of time, Roman conquests embraced every part of the
then civilized world and every king or prince yielded obedience to her
authority, then was the time that sealed her fate. The old Roman
character was sapped and enervated by wealth and luxury. The

toman conquests were maintained by mercenaries, her public offices and
funds were filled and controlled by aliens and self-seekers. Abandon-
ing herself to ease, yet with the lust of conquest stillas strong as ever,
she intrusted her rule to the hands of a few and watched the course of
events. Her Empire, spreading on every side, at last overbalanced
itself. She was drawing her life from her extremities. As these fell or
rotted away by corruption she grew weaker and weaker. Her officers,

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 51d

left: practically to their own discretion and resources, worked for their
own advantage. The rights of her people were one by one invaded.
Taxes were levied, growing heavier as the luxury and vice of those
in authority grew greater. At last all unity was lost, and the last
scene of the last act came. Rome tried to rise to the occasion, but her
strength had left her. Barbaric hordes poured in upon her from every
side and ingulfed her. “On the ruins of the splendid temple now
stood the hut of the savage, and in place of the polished and once noble
Roman now stalked the Ostrogoth, the Visigoth, and the Saxon.”

In the fusion of the Roman and Teutonic elements the feudal system
was born. The Roman Empire on its death bequeathed a precious legacy
to the world—a mighty intellectual influence, a noble literature, and a
system of law which changed the destiny of society. It is said that
many people do more by their death than by their life. The reason is
obvious. So it is with institutions and societies. Had Rome lived,
her rapid degeneracy would have polluted the world to all time. But
she died in time for her past greatness to be remembered and exalted
and for her shame to be forgotten.

After this the wave of progress swept over France and Germany and
across the English Channel, till it found a barrier and a basin in the
British Islands. In its course it left the places over which it swept
damp and dreary, but with a freshly moistened soil fitted to produce
great crops.

From the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries Britain is spoken of,
and truly, as ‘¢the keystone of history” and the battlefield of freedom;
and, to quote from an anonymous writer of vivid style, ‘the march of
religion, of liberty, and of improvement was - - - over the soil of
Britain.”

The second great landmark in our course is the Norman Conquest;
chiefly significant in its fusion of the elements which formed the char-,
acter of a nation second to none in power and wealth and influence at
any period of the world’s history. This is no mere boast. The impar-
tial observer can not fail to acknowledge the peculiar characteristics,
partly due to circumstances, partly to environment, and largely to
nature, which have enabled the British to win and hold an empire in
comparison to which that of Rome almost sinks into insignificance.
There was among the legacies bequeathed by Rome to the world one
destined to have a greater influence upon its fortunes than all the
others combined. This was Christianity, or the Church.

It is understood, of course, that, speaking generally, all these pro-
gressive influences worked through one great factor—knowledge. The
progress of this agency was slow but sure. After the fall of Rome it
was opposed by a vast wall of ignorance and barbarism, and for cen-
turies was at work unseen. It attacked the foundations of the barrier,
working silently, gradually making a passage, ever enlarging the same,
and as the passage got wider the stream grew fuller and stronger, till
512 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

at last the huge fabric, undermined, came crashing to the ground,
opening to view vas “tas and expanses hitherto undreamed of.

In the beginning of the ninth century Britain, in common with the
rest of Hurope, entered upon a long period of social darkness, which
continued almost unbroken until the fourteenth century—we might
almost say to the middle of the fifteenth century.

During all this time scarce a ray of light broke through the dark
mists of ignorance to throw ever so slight a light upon the chains of
feudalism.

This system was introduced into England by William the Conqueror
in the eleventh century, primarily to preserve his own sovereign power,
secondarily to secure national liberty, by putting a check upon the
strength of his great nobles, who in wealth and followers might with
some reason attempt to match their power against that of the King.
But in England the system, harsh as it was, never obtained the same
complete ascendency as over the peoples of the Continent; never so
completely obliterated the individual to the advantage of a select few.
Even at that early period the prerogatives of the sovereign were hedged
in by certain restrictions. For instance, after the Conqueror, we have
what is known as the Charter of Liberties, granted in the year 1100 by
Henry I expressly limiting the regal prerogatives, and declaring the
liberty of the laws, the people, and the church. Further, it had as
an end the repression or restraint of unlimited feudal rights amongst
the nobles, where they tended toward cruelty or oppression. To run
on a little way, and passing over the reigns of the unfortunate Stephen
and the hasty but too late repentant Henry II, and the chivalric Coeur
de Lion, we meet the first great landmark in our own history after the
Norman Conquest. This was the reign of the infamous John, whose
name is even yet a byword for cruelty and craft, scarcely less signifi-
cant than that of Nero or Borgia.

Through his reckless disregard of anything like rights, whether
natural or granted by charter under the sacred seal of the sovereign
oath, John brought about that which has been to our country what the
Twelve Tables was to Rome, the Magna Charta—‘‘the foundation,” to
use the words of Livy in regard to the former, ‘‘of all law, both public
and private.” At this time, too, we note the meeting of the first national
assembly of elected representatives in Britain, summoned by Stephen
Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, at St. Albans. Its object was to
reform the abuses rampant under the rule of John. It was based on
the charter of Henry I, which we have already mentioned. The sphere
of this paper does not allow us to enter into the details or terms of the
Charta, beyond stating that they aimed at the restraint of feudal
oppression, the impartial administration of justice, and the recognition
of the right of every individual to the protection of the laws. No
doubt, the system inaugurated by the Magna Charta was rude, unsci-
entific, and incomplete; and further, it can not with any truth be

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 513

designated as a “ popular” victory, according to our modern sense. The
barons at that time were the only “people.” T justices they sought
to have remedied, though affecting high and low, still primarily affected
themselves. Their honor, or their power, was threatened by the sov-
ereign’s arbitrary dispensation or disregard of justice, whether coming
directly to themselves or through their dependents. But the Magna
Charta of 1215 is important, inasmuch as it was the source of what
are at the present day the stable elements in the British national life
and character—the unsubduable love of liberty, the system of limited
monarchy, self-government, and universal representation. These are
the characteristics which have gone to form that great unwritten and
arbitrary code, the British constitution.

After this little digression we must go back and take up the thread
we have dropped. The significance of what we have just been regard-
ing will be evident, if not now, at any rate before we have finished.

The tenth century found Europe enveloped in almost total intellee-
tual darkness. Italy and Great Britain, destined (the first again) to
become afterwards the home of the arts, sciences, and culture, at this
time slept, overcome by pernicious fruits of servitude. France and Ger-
many were, if anything, intellectually brighter. Here and there a faint
gleam served to make the darkness visible. ‘‘Compared with the
seventh and eighth centuries, the tenth,” says Hallam, ‘was an age of
illumination.” Still, this chrysalis condition of society continued. The
twelfth century shows, in France particularly, some sign of an awaken-
ing mind. In this century, literature—the index of the mental condi-
tion—had its second birth. The chief sources of intellectual progress
at this time were, as enumerated by Hallam, (1) the institution of
universities; (2) cultivation of modern languages, followed by the mul-
tiplication of books and the extension of the art of writing; (3) the
investigation of the Roman law; and (4) the return to the study of the
Latin classics. These are due in large measure to the growth of what
is known as scholasticism, originating, it is Supposed, in the ninth, but
more generally attributed to Roscelin, of Compiéegne, in the twelfth
century. .

About this time the universities of Paris and Bologna were founded,
and a little later those of Oxford and Cambridge. From these points
the light of knowledge was diffused over the world till, from a few tiny
glimmering sparks, arose in time a brilliant illumination. The dark
clouds of ignorance and superstition were gradually melted and dis-
persed as the strong sun of reason rose higher and higher in the intel-

lectual sphere.

This brings us down, in a very general way, to the beginning of the
fifteenth century, the period known in history as the revival of learn-
ing, and, a little further on, to our third great landmark in the road of
social progress—the fall of Constantinople, in 1453, and its far-reaching
effects, constituting what we understand by the Renaissance.

SM 94——33
514 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

This period is important and significant in the history of the evolu-
tion of society. Europe now began to shake off the fetters of ignor-
ance. From this time onward progress is by leaps and bounds.
Certain events contributed much to the general awakening of intelli-
gence and inquiry. These were the momentous invention of printing
by Gutenberg, of Strasburg; the discovery of America in 1492; the
voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498, and, latest and greatest, the Refor-
mation of 1517. The Reformation is our fourth landmark, another of
pur intellectual revolutions, and this brings us to an interesting and
important inquiry. We said a little earlier that what was destined to
be the greatest influence bequeathed by Rome was Christianity, to
which we shall refer generally, since we are dealing with Europe, as the
church. For fifteen hundred years this power had existed, and now
it asserted itself. Where during all this age of social darkness was this
revolutionizing power? Alas! that I have to say it, like many another
great and noble power, debased, distorted, prostituted! That which
should have been to society through all this time what the pillar of cloud
and fire was to the wandering Israelites, a guide and a support, was a
snare anda pitfall. The church—religion—was made to serve as a cloak
to worldly sin and ambition. For these ends, while attempting to
maintain an outward appearance of purity, it fostered superstition and
ignorance. ‘Till at last Luther arose, preceded, like the first and great-
est of all reformers, Christ, by his forerunner, Erasmus. This is the
greatest and most significant of all our landmarks. It marks a mighty
revolution, fiercer and more thorough than any succeeding ones. It
was a mighty stimulus to intellectual growth and social development.
Till now it had been the world and the church; from now it was the
world with the church.

A real society can only exist where the rights of every individual
member as such are recognized and protected. Nor can this be until
the individual has recognized his own position and his own rights.
This was what the Reformation effected. In Britain the despotic reign
of Henry VIII, the feeble reign of Edward VI, the bloody and bigoted
reign of Mary, and the beneficial and epoch-marking reign of Elizabeth,
all tended indirectly toward this result. The rapid growth of the spirit
of liberty, and intolerance of oppression in the guise of sovereign care,
is markedly manifest in our fifth great landmark and revolution—the
overthrow of the monarchy in Britain and the establishment of the
commonwealth. We see here, what we have not seen before this event,
a power of combined action and unity among the people. This was
what was required before they could ever hope to cope with hereditary
individual or oligarchical authority.

And here let us pause and look back over the rough and stony road
we have come along. We see from our higher elevation and with our
clearer vision the great expanse of time covered with the feudal mists
of the Middle Ages; yet where we can distinguish anything at all we

PO ee eee ee le

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 515

see men, as Campbell puts it, “‘ Yoked to the brutes and fettered to the
soil.” We hear the ceaseless tumult of war, see from every point the
lurid glare from burning homesteads, or the dead, black emptiness of
devastated fields.

Although we say that indirectly the feudal system was a benefit to
the world in the end, yet, regarding it in itself, we can not but acknowl-
edge its evil effects at the time of its greatest power. It tended to
obliterate the individual; to choke all spirit of Independence, of pride or
patriotism, in the people; to elevate a few at the expense of the many.
What there was of pride or patriotism was rather a blind devotion toa
particular bead, and where the pride or patriotism of that head inclined,
there the devotion of his servants followed.

Yet the people themselves were to blame for this unnatural state of
society. They, in common with their masters, were under the despotic
rule of custom, styled by Pindar “‘ King over all mortals.” If they
made no effort to free themselves, it is not likely their masters would
do it for them.

In this connection we have Shelley’s splendid lines, in his Ode to
Liberty:

He who taught man to vanquish whatsoever
Can be between the cradle and the grave,
Crowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain endeavour!
If, on his own high will, a willing slave,
He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor.

In the Middle Ages, too, when lite depended practically on the prod-
uce of the soil, the constant warfare and feud formed an insuperable
obstacle to social progress. When the summer was far advanced, the
air clear and warm, and everything giving token of the time when the
face of the country should have been golden with ripe, waving corn,
and the air melodious with the songs of the reapers, then perchance
there would be a wide expanse of blackened fields and ruined home-
steads. The lord’s bugle had summoned his vassals from the plow,
and the harrow lay rusting and neglected.

Improvement can only come when men have time and liberty to
think. I would especially emphasize the significance of the latter of
these terms—viz, liberty. Prof. Sheldon Amos, in his treatise on the
Science of Law, has very well expressed what I am desirous of impress-
ing here. ‘It implies,” he says, ‘rest, meditation, imagination, slow
and steady culture of the faculties, combinations and associations for
all sorts of purposes, and especially that slowly formed belief in the
certain power of carrying resolutions into action on which so much of
human greatness depends. Liberty, in itself, is a negative term denot-
ing absence of restraints; on its positive side it denotes the fullness of
individual existence.” This privilege was, all the time of which we are
treating, in the hands of a few secluded hermits—dead to the world,
yet living factors in its history. Under the protection afforded them
by ignorance and superstition in the cloak of religion, these pursued
their labors and their studies unheard, unheeded, and unseen.
516 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

Industries at this time there were none, to bring the people together
and let them feel ‘‘the beating of the selfsame heart in each.” War
and religion were the only professions. Cultivation of the soil was
often an impossibility; hence poverty and pestilence stalked every-
where, feasting on thousands of victims.

I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus, ‘
The cries of agony, the ceaseless groan,

Which, through the ages that have gone before us,
In long reverberations reach our own.

* * * * *

Is it, oh Man, with such discordant noises,
With such accursed instruments as these,

Thou drownest Nature’s sweet and kindly voices,
And jarrest the celestial symphonies ?

Yet there were, latterly, small communities, outside the power of the
feudal lord, which formed the nucleus of future towns. It is there we
must look for all the intellectual advancement, for the theoretical and
practical organization of society upon a basis more in keeping with
man’s mind and mission. Their growth was rapid and their influence
proportionate. Little by little the conception of a state was altered
from that of a sovereign, omnipotent and divine, fountain of all mercy
and justice, and a people, a collection of atoms, whose duty it was to
support the sovereign in whatever caprice might lead him to periorm,
to that of a people, a collection of individuals, whose combined desires
were represented and executed in the will and actions of a sovereign.

This is the modern conception of society, and brings our view some-
what beyond the point at which we last halted—the establishment of
the commonwealth in Britain.

From now our view becomes so extended that we must either restrict
ourselves to a bare outline or swell our investigation beyond all
proportions.

European states now began to assume a more definite form. Still
they were far from agreeing with our present-day conceptions of what
a State should be. Louis XIV,in France, was rising to the height of
his power. His subjects, carried away by enthusiasm and repeated
victory, were devoted to him. But it was not a true devotion; it was
a false enthusiasm. For all his magnanimity—and he had much—the
people had no more power than before. Louis lavished gifts, encour-
aged commerce and art, and rewarded men of letters. Yet all the
power was vested in the King. Success depended on the King’s
favor and caprice. Ali these efforts were spasmodic and ill-timed;
many were fruitless, and their failure but increased the general confu-
sion. It was impossible that, in a period of constant warfare and con-
tinual change, there could be any consistency or definiteness in the
aims of society. The age of Louis XIV represents the state of Kurope
in the seventeenth century—an age of unrest, warfare, and diplomacy,

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 517

yet we must say development. The conditions then existing—the
interrupted harvests, the overwhelming taxes, the constant drain upon
the manhood of the countries, the capture and recapture of towns, and
ali the horrors, external and internal, consequent on war entered upon
for the gratification of the caprice or pride of an individual—all tended
toward a beiter and truer condition of society. Every additional
lmpost, every new levy, was a step nearer the recognition by the people
of their true position and their proper rights; toward drawing them
together in the bonds of social unity; toward the downfall of tyranny
in the guise of custom.

While the progress of society on the Continent was impeded by war
and dissension, it was steady and uninterrupted in Britain. Not that
we were without dissensions too. But our warfare was of such a nature
that it tended to draw the people together for common ends. The civil
war of 1642 and the revolution of 1688 were mighty factors in our own
social history and that of the world at large. These were essentially
contests between the Crown and the people, between arbitrary power
and individual right. And these events are of the greater significance
in that they could ever have happened. The victory was there won by
unity and the courage of the conviction of the goodness of the cause.
For the time, all private or sectarian animosities were forgotten.
Bishop, noble, squire, merchant, artisan, and plowman, High Chureh-
men, Low Churchmen, Nonconformists, and Quakers, worked together
for a common end—liberty, the inalienable right of each and all.

While this was going on in Britain, Europe looked on askance.
But it was only that species of half admiration and half fear with
which the community regards an individual who is the first to venture
to do what no one ‘else would dare. Soon others will follow; it only
needs example. So it was in the seventeenth century. Hence the sig-
nificance and influence of British history of that time. When the
crisis was passed, and men once more allowed their petty jealousies
and animosities to have sway, they found themselves upon a new foot- -
ing. They knew their own rights and the rights of the sovereign, and
the limits of these. Moreover, they were flushed with victory and full
of conscious strength. The effects were rapid. Towns arose, com-
merce developed, industries increased, wealth multiplied, and comfort
spread. Societies, associations, guilds, and councils began to exercise
an influence, representing in miniature the theory of the state.

In political government, too, a great end was achieved by more thor-
ough representation.

Under the new conditions, learning and culture began to thrive
enormously. Britain took the lead in social progress, and she has ever
since retained it.

The eighteenth century is in Britain a record of intellectual and,
with it, social progress. The barriers of custom and prerogative were
ever falling before the conviction of natural right and equity. On the
518 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

Continent progress was much slower. But the crisis could not be long
delayed. The dark and smooth surface of society but served to con-
ceal the current underneath.

Still waters run deep.

The close of the eighteenth century marks the end of what is known
in history as the ancient régime. It was signalized by the most drastic
and, in its immediate effects, the greatest social revolution we have to
deal with. It was the bursting of the pent-up storm of misery. It
was preceded by a fearful calm. Then the tempest broke out, relent-
less and irresistible. It spared neither old nor young, father, mother,
brother, sister, husband, wife, or child. It cared nothing for associa-
tions and sentiments, the work of genius, or the toil of years. As the
whirlwind swept across the country—shrieking as if in mockery liberté
and egalité, it left in its track ruin and desolation.

Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, like death angels, guided the storm,
yet were powerless to control it.

The Revolution did its work cruelly, but thoroughly. Every vestige
of the old was swept away—king, crown, home, and kindred. Men
could start afresh on a new system. The tempest of the Revolution in
France reached Britain only as a great ground swell. Society there
was agitated, but nothing more. Hadit been one hundred years earlier,
I tremble to think what our country might have been to-day. Kings-
ley says, “‘The human race owes more to the eighteenth century than
to any century since the Christian era. This may seem,” he goes on to
say, “to be inconsistent with my description of the very same era as
one of decay and death. But, side by side with the death there was
manifold fresh birth; side by side with the decay there was active
erowth; side by side with them, fostered by them, though generally in
strong opposition to them, whether conscious or unconscious.”

Again, in another place, Kingsley remarks: ** We shall find through-
out the eighteenth century a stirring of thought, an originality, a
resistance toe circumstances, which would have been impossible had
circumstances been the true lords and shapers of mankind. Had that
latter been the case, the downward progress of the ancient régime would
have been irremediable.”

Yet again, talking of the French Revolution, he says that one of the
doctrines then specially proclaimed was that “in each man there is a
God-given individuality, an independent soul, which no government or
man has a right to crush, or can crush, in the long run.”

The eighteenth century drew to a close in storm and darkness.
Society was moved to the roots—strained and torn. But when a new
century dawned the clouds of revolution were dispelled before the sun
of liberty, and all gave token of a glorious noon. And men were not
mistaken.
Se Eee

EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 519

This brings us to our furthest and our highest point. From the
height now attained we have an almost boundless view over the ages
that have gone before, and we can survey them with the tranquillity of
the scientific observer.

The progress of society, the gradual emancipation of the individual,
the steady development of mind and resource, and che spread of their
influences to all classes of society, had its active rise in the fifteenth
century. By the seventeenth century the development had assumed
marked forms and signally asserted itself. By the eighteenth century
it had grown to proportions against which the old order of things could
not possibly hold out, and it inaugurated the nineteenth century with
a revolution of society more direct, drastic, and immediate, if not more
thorough or momentous, than the Protestant Reformation.

The political history of the present century—which is always the
reflex of the internal social workings—is a record of universal awaken-
ing. This undoubtedly was hastened by Napoleon’s vast attempt to
restore despotism. The whole of Europe, upon which the influences
we have been tracing had been long working, was roused into action.
Napoleon staked the cause of despotism at Waterloo, and lost. Shortly
before this Holland had shaken off the foreign yoke; Greece, once
more, for a brief space, something like her old self, after Missolonghi
and Navarino, regained her independence from the Turks; shortly
after, Belgium was declared free; and, later still, we follow the noble
efforts for freedom in Italy, under the patriot Garibaldi; and we behold
them crowned with success. Surely these events—revolutions in a sec-
ondary sense—are deeply significant. They were the natural fruits of
the forces at work from the earliest period of human history.

The influences in Britain at this time were no less marked, though
they were not characterized by the same violence. That stage had
been passed two centuries before. The changes were of a semipolitical
character, in which sense [ mean that they more immediately concerned
the people themselves than their relations with the rest of the world.
Social and parliamentary reform formed the basis of the agitations.
The immense increase of wealth and spread of knowledge had thrown
open the roads to places hitherto jealously guarded. The common
bond of individuality and natural freedom had been irrefragable. It
was no longer mere birth that ranked before worth. Thus united,
society became molded into a solid and clearly defined body.

Intellectual progress in the seventeenth century was great; more so
in the eighteenth. But the nineteenth century has surpassed all in the
purity and clearness of its intellectual sky and the intensity of its
intellectual sun.

This is amply evidenced by the paramount importance attached to
education and the universal desire for the same; the enormous increase
and perfection of industries; the growth of vast cities; the extent of
international relations, political and social; the spread of and height
520 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

attained in all the fields of higher intellectual investigation in science,
art, and literature; in the current thought of the day; in all these
questions now vexing and wearing us—social, religious, and economic.

I have purposely refrained from doing more than mentioning the

most outstanding points in our subject of investigation. In no place
have I gone into particulars. Our field is so vast that our view can
only be general. I might have treated the subject from a purely socio-
logical point of view. But that might have been too technical and
uninteresting; and besides, when we think of it, sociology is merely a
generalization of the evidences of history. We have sketched, or at
least indicated, the growth and influence of customs, manners, religion,
laws, industry, commerce, science, literature, and art, and their respective
points of beginningandending. Wehaveseenthe human atom develop
into the human unit, the single-celled social protoplasm grow into the
complex and multiform organization of present society. In tracing the
evolution of society we have traced the evolution of the individual;
we have traced the evolution of mind. One fact must have been patent
to us all along, and that is the measure in which the individual acts
upon society and in which society reacts upon the individual. I know
that I am throwing myself open to opposition when I say that the whole
history of the human ‘race is a record of constant, though varying,
advance. The world is working toward an end of self-realization; to
this all is tending. Every revolution, every reformation, every change
is a necessary step to this end. It is our destiny that impels us.
“ The world to-day has reached a position never hitherto attained.
Our standards and conceptions of morality are higher and truer and
our methods surer. Sin and vice still exist; some say as heinous as
ever. Thatis not so. Not only is there less sin and vice, but what
there is is only equally heinous with that of past ages in that our higher
standards and sensibilities are the more easily shocked. Our means of
restraining vice and crime, of alleviating misery, and of securing hap-
piness are more universal and efficient.

All this is the outcome of our truer conception of man’s place in
nature and position inter se.

If anyone doubts the truth of our conceptions and the actuality of
things, he has only to look around upon the world of yesterday and of
to-day to see the waste moorland converted into rich fields or thriving
cities; to watch the busy throng of workers, all eager with what they
may imagine to be their own concerns, but nevertheless each in his
sphere, however humble, contributing his quota to the general fund.
Selfish, some will say! True, there is much self-seeking, much selfish-
ness, but we must form our conclusions from the feelings and acts of
the combined community, not from those of the individual. The indi-
vidual contributes to them, but the combination is a modification.

We have seen the human thing become a human being. We have
witnessed the triumphs of mind over matter and circumstances. We

may fitly close by quoting those spirit-stirring and appropriate lines of

Campbell:

Eternal Nature, when thy giant hand

The wave upheaved and fixed the trembling land,
When life sprang startling at thy plastic call,
Endless her forms, and man the lord of all—

Say, was that noble form, inspired by thee,

To wear eternal chains and bow the knee?

Was man ordained the slave of man to toil,
Yoked to the brutes, and fettered to the soil,
Weighed in the balance with a tyrant’s gold?

No, Nature has cast us in a heavenly mould.

She bids no wretch his thankless labour urge,
And, trembling, take the pittance and the scourge.

Tyrants, in vain ye trace the wizard ring,
Ye can not limit Mind’s unwearied spring.

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST: A STUDY IN THE
PEOPLING OF AMERICA.!

By OT1s TUFTON MASON.

THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.

In the struggle for existence our species has waged a double contest,
the one against decay, disintegration within the human body or the
society; the other against destructive forces from without.

The chief contest for the inner man has been to appease the insati-
able cravings of hunger and thirst.

The chief contest for the outer man has been to resist the blistering
rays of the sun, the biting frost, the pelting storm, savage beasts, and
still more savage men. For this latter contest man created clothing for
the body, the home for the family, the camp for the clan, the fortress
and armor and weapons against the beasts and the enemy.

The elements of activity in this double contest were :?

1. The exploitation of the earth for materials and resources.

2. The transformations of materials and the subjugation of force.

3. Transportation and conveyance, the carrying industry.

4, Barter, commerce, and exchange, the pursuit of wealth.

5. The arts of consumption and enjoyment. F

The activities just mentioned divide themselves into two sorts with
relation to place—the stationary industries and the migratory activi-
ties. We shall attend now only to the latter.

MIGRATION AND ITS MOTIVES.

By migration is meant intentionally or unintentionally leaving a spot
and not returning to it. This term is frequently confounded with
those movements throughout the year which have been called ‘“ the
circle of activities,” the ground covered being the sphere of influence
or total culture area. This sort of orbital or annual movement has
had much to do with those permanent migrations of which we are now
speaking.

524 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

The law of the circle of employments and of permanent migration
may be called the maxima and minima of effort—that is, men have
always bestirred themselves the year round and moved about the world
on lines aud to places where there seemed to be promise of the great-
est comfort and security for the least effort on their part.

In this paper especial attention will be paid to this maxima and
minima in relation to the food quest, though it will be seen that follow-
ing this line conducts also to the best results in the other activities
mentioned and to the supply of other needs.

Migration 1s caused not by one motive, but by all possible motives.
Collect all the influences and wants that have actuated individuals m
going about. These same, acting on a family, a set of men, a horde, a
clan, a people, have caused migration. They have acted by compulsion
and by attraction, from within and from without, through nature and
through man.

Taking these motives for change of habitation all in all, they may be
Sharply divided into two classes, the attractive and the repulsive forces.
Some migrants are drawn, allured, enticed to move. They go because
they want to; nobody compels them. They have in themselves the
energy, the ambition, the vigor, the desire to go, and these are the
peoples that have dominated the earth.

Other migrants are crowded, driven, compelled to move. They are
afraid or too weak to stay where they are. Such people are cowardly
or unfortunate, retrogressive, dying out. They shrink into the suburbs
of the world.

Uniting these concepts of attraction and repulsion with the notion
of subjective and objective causes of struggle, we have a quadruple set
of migratory forces working together or apart:

A. Subjective motives, vis ab infra.

1. Desire, hope, appetite, ambition, energy.
2. Weakness, fear, aversion, cowardice.

B. Objective motives, vis ab extra.

3. Advantages, supplies, comforts, satisfactions, aeting a fronte
or a tergo.

4, Discomforts, compulsions, failure of resources, a fronte or a
tergo.

Accidents, superstition, calamities play their part with substantial
causes in this composite set of motives.

According to the laws of mechanics, bodies move in the lines of least
resistance, with momentum proportioned to the vis a tergo. They have
no souls, no desires; they do not move, but are moved.

With animals and men the ease is different. They move in a paral-
lelogram of forces.

1. In the lines of least resistance in front.

2. In the lines of greatest pressure behind.

3. In the lines of greatest desire within.

—
MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 525

4, In the lines of greatest pull, or attraction, or supply from without.

do. In the lines of greatest effort or volition subjectively viewed.

After all, it is the cheerful, hopeful migration, stimulated by desire
and encouraged by propitious surroundings, allurements, and forces,
that effects new cultures. Doubtless shipwrecked mariners, lost wan-
derers, and outcasts have now and then left a happy thought or sugges-
tion upon receptive aboriginal minds; but these random surf beats are
not what Tennyson calls—

The great waves that echo round the world:
FOOD AREAS AND FOOD SUPPLY.

The greater part of the earth’s surface was sterile and repellent as
abiding place to primitive man or to the living forms upon which he
depended, to wit:

The deep sea, out of sight of coastal plains and meadows.

The arid deserts, barren to man and plant and beast.

~The mountain tops, then as now, inaccessible and unproductive.

The frigid zones, above the lines of food and furs.

The great plains and prairies, away from waterways.

The dense forests, jungles, tundras, and swamps.

But all of these were provocative of migration and long journeys.

Both man and his purveyors had to walk at first in those terrestrial
paths which had been marked out by Nature and provisioned for his
journeys. By following the trails of supply he got into the green pas-
tures and encamped by the still waters that invigorated him. It so
happened that the trade winds and gulf streams were conterminous
with the marine feeding grounds; that the inland rivers, bays, and
lakes on which he could journey with greatest facility were the catch-
ment basins of surrounding fertile lands and the feeding ground of
innumerable creatures yielding food to him in largest abundanee.

The rich meadows and valleys were the débris of degradation. Their
loam was once on the inaccessible tops of mountains and was only
halting a little way onits journey to the great littoral feeding grounds.
It was on this stream of dry land between mountain and shore that
great herds of ruminants were developed, and to them early men were
attracted for the easiest and most abundant means of support.

The greatest natural food supply for the least effort, with few excep-
tions, was in the water. This saying is true for all the five elements of
activity of which I have spoken previously, to wit:

1. Hxploitation.—The easiest food to take for human aliment is in the
waters. It frequently comes to man’s hand spontaneously.

2. Transformations.—The early manufactures, arts, industries, and
divisions of labor over the products of the sea are more varied than
those of hunting or gleaning.

3. Transportation.—By far the easiest primitive conveyance of man
and transportation for the products of his activities were by water, and
even now water transport is the cheapest.
526 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

4. Barter.—The oldest form of money, the world over, is shells from

the water. For the most part primitive folk do not go far away from .

the water and the greatest cities are most accessible thereto.

5. Consumption.—The preparation and serving of sea food, in variety,
in persistence throughout the year, in relation to cooking, drying, salt-
ing, and smoking, answer the demands of human desire as well as
either of the others mentioned. And much of it is eaten raw.

FOOD AND MIGRATIONS IN AMERICA.

In the North American Review of October, 1869, and January, 1870,
the Hon. Lewis H. Morgan wrote upon Indian migrations over the
continent of America as influenced by existing physical conditions,
principally food supply.’ Because the region about the mouth of the
Columbia River was possessed of the most abundant materials of this
character, Mr. Morgan made that the starting point of migration over
the continent and worked out a scheme for the movements of the prin-
cipal stocks of aborigines.

J propose to take up the investigation of the distinguished ethnolo-
gist by the aid of such new light as the studies of twenty-five years
have acquired. At present we may leave the question of the spread of
stocks in America to the eminent gentlemen of the Bureau of Ethnol-
ogy and to other scholars who are on the list of honorary members of
our Anthropological Society, and inquire whether there be a practicable
route from Indo-Malaysia to the Columbia River or to any other point
near by on the North Pacific Coast.”

THE ROADS TO AMERICA.

There are two possible routes from Asia to America, one of which
has been often discussed; the other is, so far as I am aware, to be now
for the first time proposed.

The first mentioned is the Aretic or hyperborean route, across that
culture region, or oikoumene, which I have elsewhere denominated the
interhemispheric area. It is the land of dogs and reindeer, of snow
and snowshoes, of fur clothing, marine and Arctic mammal food, under-
ground dwellings, birch trees, and the arts springing therefrom, skin
and bark boats, harpoons, sleds, all the way uninterruptedly from
Kast Greenland to the Land of the Midnight Sun, in Norway. This
might be called the land or the snow-and-ice route.

The route which I now propose might have been nearly all the way
by sea. It could have been a continuously used route for centuries.
Until interrupted by later civilizations, it might have been traveled
over for thousands of years. It lies absolutely along a great circle of

lies of animals and plants with families of aborigines.

the earth, the shortest and easiest highway upon the globe. I omit here
the supposed route from Europe to Greenland, simply because it
demands certain geological changes, all of. which the writer is now
trying to avoid; also those lines straight across the parallels from
Polynesia, because the food supply was inadequate and the motives
not apparent. Migrations of this sort are not denied or aftirmed;
they are simply laid aside for the present.

A HYPOTHETICAL CASE.

The Haida Indians of British Columbia annually voyage as many as
500 miles southward to Puget Sound to lay in a supply of dried clams
and oysters for their own consumption and for trade.

- Let us imagine a company of them or of their ancestors, no matter
how many centuries ago, setting out from the Indian Ocean in an open
boat no better than the one they now employ, and governed by the
same commonplace motives. The peoples that our Haida would have
to encounter now, or, better, those among whom the investigator would
have mingled four hundred years ago, would have been—

1. Malay-Polynesians, who would have transported him to the con-
fines of Japan.

2. The Japanese, and many hundreds of years ago the primitive
Koreo-Japanese or their ancestors, or the primitive peoples of the islands

‘and peninsula. Their plate armor and hexagonal weaving he would

encounter as far as numbers 8 to 10 on the map.

3. Riding astride of reindeer, drawn by dogs or reindeer, in bark
canoes and dugouts, and at times in canoes lashed together or walking
on snowshoes, the traveler might have gotten as far as Norton Sound,

4, The Eskimo would have been his companions from Plover Bay in
Asia to Cook Inlet, or to East Greenland, and their dress, often in
Asiatic reindeer skin, as well as the identity of their industrial appa-
ratus, would have prevented any shock in passing to the other side
of the world.

5. As soon as Mount St. Elias was reached and the area of the great
cedars was encountered, the traveler would again enter a dugout canoe,
whose lines and means of locomotion would not be strange to him. He
would see men clad in plate armor, wearing greéaves on their legs as
they did in Japan. All sorts of fishing apparatus and traps, and even
the tales they told him, would appear familiar.

6. On the Columbia, the salmon-eating peoples would seem old time
friends. The canoe, pointed at both ends under water, would remind
him of the Amoor, and hereabout he would meet the northern division
of the Uto-Aztecan stock, in whose company he might travel as far
south as the borders of Chiriqui.!

7. With the Maya, the mixed tribes of the isthmus, the Chibcha, and
the Aymara-Kechua tribes he would complete his journey, passing
through the lands of potters and stonecutters.

528 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

In order to make the problem of their voyaging as simple as possible,
let us not at present imagine any submergence of the ocean bed nor
any geological nor physiographical changes, nor any accidents out of
the daily human experience. We may be allowed to restore to the
waters and to the land such creatures as we know to have been
destroyed out of them in recent centuries by the exigencies of enor-
mously multiplied populations and the demands of modern commerce,
but no more. It will make our inquiry much simpler and more scien-
tific if we have no experiences introduced or imagined that any man
may not repeat at his leisure as in a laboratory.

The separate marine inclosures or areas in the progress of a migra-
tion from the Indian Ocean to the Columbia River and southward about
a great cirele of the earth are roughly— :

1. The Indian Ocean, especially that part of its drainage toward the
east.

2, The Indo-Malayan archipelago.

3. The South China Sea and parts adjacent.

4, The Kast China and the Yellow Sea.

5. The Japanese and the Tartary Sea.

6. The Okhotsk Sea and its environs.

7. The Bering Sea and its drainages.

8. The Alaskan sea and British Columbia islands and coast lands.

9, Vancouver island and the Columbia basin and the head waters of
the Mississippi drainage on the west.

10. The great interior basin of the United States.

11. The Pueblo region.

12. Mexico.

13. Central America.

14. Colombia and Ecuador.

15. Peru, its coast, mountains, lake region, and the head waters of
the Amazon.

16. The basin of*the La Plata.

This general line is a great circle of the earth. On a Mercator map
the straight lines are commonly taken for shortest distances, which
they arenot. Again, it sohappens that the great circle here mentioned
is the principal earthquake and volcanic line and the natural boundary
of the Pacific Ocean.

NECESSARY CONDITIONS.

TIshe conditions into which the candid student would be bound to
inquire concerning such a route would be the following:

1. Food supply.—Could our imaginary Haida crew of men and women
travel, say, from the Andaman and Nicobar islands to the Columbia
River, a distance of 10,000 miles, and live on the natural resources all
the way? Are the situations and movements of this food supply such
as to toll or invite wandering people steadily and continuously onward?

2. Conveyance.—W ere the aboriginal means of conveyance in vogue
in the Malay-Polynesian area adequate to such a journey? Could the

modern Haida great canoe, the Hast Indian or the Malay-Polynesian
craft stand such a trip? Are there landlocked seas all the way, such
as Kast Indians, Malays, and Haidas paddle in at home, at the present
moment? Had either people, before contact with whites, the appliances
and the skill for such an excursion ?

3. Currents and highways.—In which direction do the ocean currents
move along the route indicated—toward America or from America?

4. Winds and temperature—What winds blow along the Asiatic
coast, about Bering Sea, and the archipelagos of the northwest Amer-
ican coast? What is the effect on the atmosphere of the winds which
blow from these currents and from the Tropics in respect of climate in
the countries along the route? Would these winds gradually move
peoples toward or away from America? If a boat without a crew were
set adrift in the South China Sea, to what point would it drift?) What
series of isotherms are included in this area?

5. Suggestions and barriers.—Are there any insurmountable barriers
to our Haida Indians or Malays—that is, what would be the most diffi-
cult places for them to pass by reason of distance from land to land,
exposure to open sea or adverse winds, failure of provisions, or greater
allurements in other directions?

6. Blood.—Admitting that the aborigines of America are from the
Eastern Continent, what peoples of the Old World are most like those
of the New, anatomically and anthropometrically, by which is meant
in skeleton, in muscular development, height, weight, physiognomy,
color of the hair, eyes, skin, ete.?

7. Social structure.—The aborigines of the Western Contiment had a
social structure built up on the gentile system, practicing endogamy as
regards the tribe and exogamy as regards the clan. Now, should our
Haida Indians find any peoples about the Indian Ocean or elsewhere
along the route who had the very same or nearly the same social
structure?

8. Language.— What testimony does language bear to the kinship of
American aborigines with Eastern peoples? To what languages in
the Eastern Continent are the American tongues nearest akin? Does
the present condition of the language problem close the door of inquiry
concerning migration from Asia to America?

9, Arts.—In the arts of practical life and the arts of pleasure, what
similarities should our company of Haida Indians find? It is freely
admitted and indisputable that similarities arise in these respects by
stress of the earth and stress of a common brotherhood of man; but
such similarities are more or less functional or general or codrdinated.
The more that things or customs agree in minute structure, the more
specifizaliy are they akin and have had the selfsame originators. In
other words, the greater the similarity, the less the probability of
diverse origins. Are there any arts so akin structurally as to make the
theory of independent origin improbable?

sm 94——__34

5a0 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

10. Remains and historic evidence.—What relies of primitive oceupa-
tion should our voyagers encounter that would remind them of home,
and what testimony have we of such aboriginal peoples? Or, to put
the question in another form, if one of our distinguished archeologists,
Morse or Putnam or Holmes, or an historian, such as Brinton, made the
journey with the Haidas, would he come across any shell heaps, aban-
doned dwelling sites or work places, or ancient documents entirely
inexplicable by the present inhabitants, but quite plain to one skilled
in the antiquities of our own continent?

11. Religion and folklore.—What is the testimony of comparative
mythology concerning the inhabitants of the spirit world and their con-
duct as believed in throughout the several neritic areas mentioned ?
In the cult of these regions what similarities exist in sacred places—
houses, images, and worships? What folk customs seem to be akin?

12. Modern witnesses.—Not only trained ethnologists, but naval offi-
cers, navigators, travelers, and missionaries are constantly testifying
and declaring their convictions of the commerce and blood relationship
between the two sides of the Pacific. Any one of these witnesses might
be entirely inadequate; but what weight is to be given to the cumula-
tive testimony?

In brief, the conditions demanded for aboriginal communication are
the following:

1. Abundant supply of food and clothing all the way.

2, Easy means of transportation and conveyance.

3. Impelling oceanic currents and highways.

4. Favoring winds and temperature.

5. Encouragements rather than discouragements, invitations and not
barriers.

6. Resemblances of ethnic kinships.

7. Similarities in social structures and functions depending on
kinship.

8. Homologous types in language.

9, Similarities in arts otherwise inexplicable.

10. The favorable witness of archeology and history.

11. The same traditions, folklore, mythology, and cults.

12. The confirmatory testimony of ethnographers, travelers, obsery-
ers, ete.

Let us examine them in order.

A DEFINITE PROPOSITION.

In order to test the foregoing questions the following concrete
hypothesis is advanced for examination:

That during the centuries in which Europe was working out of her
earliest stone age into her renaissance, certainly for three thousand years
or more, America was being steadily and continuously peopled from
Asia by way of its eastern shores and seas from the Indian Ocean. Sub-

sidiary movements in the way of offshoots from this migration, contribu-
tions to it, and barriers to its progress were effected up and down the
rivers and in the seas of India, China, Mongolia, and Siberia. That
such a movement was practicable, consider the following arguments: —

I.—ABUNDANCE OF FOOD.

In each of the areas mentioned there are a great number of species
of food plants and animals; the individuals of many species are of
great size, and of all the species there is prodigal quantity.

In the Indian Ocean and South China seas the animals are tropical
and the natives are expert in their capture.

In East China Sea and Japan Sea are inexhaustible supplies of shad,
herring, mackerel, cod, and local species. Besides these, food plants,
water fowl, and marine invertebrates still abound for every need of the
people.

Before the Russians began their operations in northeastern Asia
the peninsula of Kamchatka supported 60,000 inhabitants; but under
their rule the using up of the food supply and the introduction of
fatal diseases decimated that number. At the present time the sea
of Okhotsk would yield salmon and other aquatic food in abundance
for any aboriginal needs; and prior to one hundred and fifty years ago
the Rhytina afforded the absolute maximum of aliment for the least
effort. There was also no limit to subsistence in Bering Sea. J'urther-
more, no sooner do we approach the latitude where the rigors of the
climate demand extra clothing and fuel for the body than we find
marine mammals and land mammals superabounding. Whale, seal,
walrus, and sea lion in the water, and elk and reindeer and bears on
land, are even more serviceable than the fish, for they are house and
furnace and clothing and food all in one. In no region of the world do
food-fishes and land and sea mammals exist so abundantly and so
accessibly.!

I1.—THE NAVAL POSSIBILITIES.

To investigate the second topic, namely, the possibilities of such a
voyage or journey with the appliances at hand, it will be necessary to
inquire as to—

1. Its length and directness.

2. The quality of the ships and other modes of conveyance.

3. The ability of the mariners and native travelers.

4, The depth of water and the character of land routes.

5. Whether the environment is such as savages are accustomed to.
1. Length and directness.—A]] modern steamships travel on the great

tion. The writer acknowledges his obligations to Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr.

circles of the earth as the shortest distance between two points. The
Canadian Pacific steamers skirt the Aleutian chain on the way to Vic-
toria from Yokohama. A great circle of the earth between the Straits
of Malacea and the Columbia’s mouth passes through every one of the
shallow food-stocked areas named, and, continuing onward, is in touch
with the buffalo feeding grounds at the sources of the great rivers, with
the pueblo region, Mexico and Central America, and the highlands of
Peru and Ecuador. The Aztecs, Mayas, Chibchas, and Kechuas were
the antipodes of the ancient inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago.

2. Modes of conveyance.—As for the ships, it will be admitted that
the aborigines of this continent were possessed of every form of boat
known in the Eastern Continent except the outrigger canoe—kaiak,
umiak, pirogue, bark canoe, coracle, skin float, raft, and reed float. They
were singularly poor in appliances for land travel south of the dog and
snow line; indeed, they kept to the waters closely. By a system of
portages they had connected the Arctic Ocean and the Columbia’s
mouth with the Atlantic and the Gult of Mexico. On our great circle,
in areas 14 and 15 on the map, the American camel assumes the role of |
burden bearer.

Upon the Asiatic side the aborigines have been greatly disturbed by
Russians, Japanese, and Chinese; but in the Malay Peninsula are
craft as varied and as effectual, and the lines of the vessels are strik-
ingly like to those of our western coast; and the natives now journey
from Bering Straits southward to Japan by dogs and on snowshoes.

3. Mariners and native travelers.— When Europeans visited the Indian
Ocean and the Pacific these waters were covered with hardy navigators.
I am even tempted to suggest that the turning aside of a stream of pre-
Malays, who were the Phoenicians of the Orient, by the Mongoloid intru-
sion from inland may have led to the peopling of the archipelagoes of the
Pacitic after America was fairly settled and a northward migration was
interrupted.

4. Water and land routes.—All the way from the Straits Settlements
to Vancouver, as will be seen by the Challenger map and the British
Admiralty charts, we have shallow water. There is a broad bench con-
stituting the marine feeding ground, where the series of outlying islands
and archipelagoes fence in the neritic areas. The conditions are perfect.
And inland, where navigation is the least perilous, food becomes the
more abundant.

5. Nature of environment.—Each one of these environments is within
the capabilities of savages. The landmarks were their light-houses;
the inlets were their harbors innumerable; the grass and the color of
the water were their barometers; the mammals, fishes, and birds were
their pilots. They were scarcely subjected to the terrors and dangers
of the fathomless sea.!

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 533

IIIL—OCEAN CURRENTS AND FOOD SUPPLY.!

In following this line of enormous food supply our voyagers would
be materially aided by the ocean currents. The equatorial stream of
the Pacific flows westward between the Tropie of Cancer and the
Micronesian archipelagoes. On reaching the South China Sea it is
split, a part going southward and westward into the Indian Ocean and
a part northward and eastward, like our Gulf Stream, skirting the
outer rim of the seas that I have mentioned all the way to the Columbia

tiver. Within these seas counter currents and eddies help to equalize
the temperature of the adjacent lands. The effect of this Kuroshiwo, as
the ocean current is called, is much greater upon the food supply than
upon the people. Bringing millions of tons of tropical silt and low sea
forms in its stream, this Nile of the Pacific deposited them over the bed
of the landlocked areas, acting like a top-dressing upon soil and a feeder
of the aquatic food fauna. The lowering of temperature northward
naturally would give the migrants an increased advantage in life’s strug-
gles as the climate became more stimulating, fecundating, and strength-
ening.

IV.—PREVAILING WINDS AND FOOD.

As for. the prevailing winds, the trades blow westward in the
Tropies. On reaching the Pacific shore they would follow some such
law as that of the waters, but during the months of May to October
the simoom from the Indian Ocean pushes northeastward and drives
the trades along Asia northeastward. As we proceed the ocean current
is Spread out, and the winds blowing from warmer latitudes exert their
benign influences on the coast of southeastern Alaska, British Colum-
bia, and the State of Washington. The temperature of the whole route
is equalized.’

(1) Arctic America, sweeping below the circle at Hudson Bay; (2) Greenland above

534 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

V.—ENCOURAGEMENTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS.

Morgan says that barbarians, ignorant of agriculture and depending
upon fish and game for subsistence, spread over large areas with great
rapidity. Under the operations of purely physical causes they would
reach in their migrations the remotest boundaries of a continent in a
much shorter time than a civilized people, with all the appliances of
civilization.'

The same is true of the seas so long as they are unimpeded. Even
after the first occupancy new peoples constantly wedge themselves in,
as they have done in Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.

Two things would modify ie track of migration which we are dis-
cussing, to wit:

1. The intrusion into the neritic areas along the Asiatic side of peo-
ples that were sedentary and who assumed ownership of them, turning
the highways into possessions and blocking further progress of migra-
tion. This intrusion ended at the North with Russia and the United
States, 1728-1894. The white race in 1498 first set its greedy eyes upon
the east, and Magellan died on the Philippines in 152

2. The intrusion of foreign elements into the stream of northeast
movement. To continue the figure of the Haida voyagers, supposing
they had replaced, as they went from sea to sea, any who died, whether
men or women, with recruits from the shore. In a long voyage the
complexion of the crew on arriving at Victoria would be greatly modi-
fied; also they ay have left at the mouths of the Canton, Yangtze,
Yellow, and Amoor rivers one or more pairs of their passengers. All
of these things would have been perfectly natural to do.

But supposing that instead of a single canoe load of fifty Indians
there were a stream of canoe loads flowing for thousands of years,
when the eastern part of Asia was like the west coast of America fifty
years ago; then colonies would be dropped in every favorable place
and the peopling of eastern Asia would go on from the sea up the
rivers and not from the land down the rivers. These peoplings may
be described as waves, and we might speak of—

1. The American wave leaving the Japanese shell heaps.

2. Eskimo, Aleut, Jenessai, Ostyak wave.

3. Hyperborean Asiatic wave, peopling Siberia.

4, Aino wave, quite as likely to have followed our route as any other,

5. Mongoloid waves from inland seaward, ending in permanent indus-
trial settlements and the cessation of migrating.

Imagine eastern Asia at the beginning of our era, or a thousand years
before that, the abode of teeming populations of aborigines, living,
moving, trading along these landlocked highways abundantly provided .
with food. They were fishers and hunters. Contemporaneously, in the

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 55D

Nile Valley, in Syria and Mesopotamia, in China and India, cereal,
pastoral, and mechanical industries have been developing. Many of
the peoples practicing them push to the east; they divide the coast.
The aborigines disappear; they leave their shell heaps and move north-
ward, then eastward and westward, following the winds and currents,
and take the shortest and most inviting path onward.

There came to the eastern side of America three hundred years ago
the nations of Europe. They crossed the continent and eireumnavi-
gated it. They severed our aboriginal Pacific Coast culture in many
places: :

1. The Russians in Bering Sea nearly severed the native commerce
of the two hemispheres.

2. The Hudson Bay Company enlisted the movements of the Indians
in their behalf and destroyed the aboriginal migratious and commerce.

3. The American fur traders projected their operations between the
stocks of Oregon and California.

4, These were followed by explorers, settlers, and miners in our
century.

5. The transcontinental railroads and the creation of independent
states obliterated all vestiges of: former aboriginal movements.

VI.—THE RACE PROBLEM.

The opinion of such scholars as Morgan and Brinton as to the unique-
ness and homogeneity of an American breed or race is not gainsaid,
but surely the last word has not been said upon this theme. It can not
be denied, however, that this race is a mixed one fundamentally, and
that there enter into it varied anthropometric characters. This is not
only true of the living tribes, but of the banes from the graves. It has
even been averred that Polynesians may have crossed from the Pacifie
archipelagoes, moved northward and mixed with long-headed northern-
ers, forming a mesocephalic type.

Now, I would beg leave to suggest a different solution for these mys-
teries: Following the most abundant food supply along the seas in
which primitive men were best equipped to obtain it, following currents
of earth forces that would furnish incitement and even motive power,
the ancestors of Malays, Polynesians, and Indians could have come
from the equator to America, traversing for nearly the entire distance
a series of landlocked seas of shallow water, abounding in food supply
of fish and birds and marine invertebrates, and part of the way with
innumerable vertebrates, as we have seen.

As to cranial index, the Eskimo are among the longest-headed peo-
ples of the world, ranking with Abyssinians, Caroline Islanders, Hot-
tentots, and some Polynesians. Most Americans are mesocephalic, as
are the Malay-Polynesians, but the northern Mongoloids are the
shortest-headed people in the world. In nasal index Topinard places
536 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

the redskins next to the yellow races of Asia, and in his general
scheme the redskins follow the Polynesians.!

VII.—THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIOLOGY.

All the tribes in America except the Eskimo were found living under
a peculiar system of relationship. Each tribe was endogamous, but it
was split into gentes that were exogamous. Connected with this was
a system of classific relationship, descent in the female line, and other
social and political regulations that were new to the explorers. Mor-
gan found that each great ethnic group had its own marital and polit-
ical system, and these he has classified in his monumental work. He
says: ‘The system of the Seneca-Iroquois Indians of New York is
identical, not only in radical characteristics, but also in the greater
portion of its minute details, with that of the Tamil people of south
India.” It is not to be supposed that the Tamil and the Iroquois are
for that reason brothers. But they are in possession of a common
social expression that came to them both from a common source.

VIII.MAMERICAN AND ASIATIC LANGUAGES.

Linguistically speaking, the Bering Strait is not the dividing line of
two continents, since the Eskimo extend also into Asia, having, accord-
ing to some, gone over from America. Contiguous to the Eskimo in
America are the Athapascan family on the west and the Algonquin
family on the east. Contiguous to the Eskimo in Asia are the Chukchis,
and these are joined to other unclassed peoples. Now, the Chukchi
language and the Athapascan language and the other Asiatic and
American languages are noted for their lexical and grammatical differ-
ences and not for relationships.

But there were one hundred and twenty separate families of Janguages
in America. The peculiar family system of the American aborigines,
restricting marriage in the tribe, was more conducive to the rapid mul-
tiplication of languages than any other that could be devised. In that
dispersive, centrifugal period of human history which preceded the
invention of a written language changes must have gone on rapidly.
Furthermore, philologists have not had the material upon which to
work in forming a solid theory of linguistic relationships, and the latest
researches do not justify the assertion that the American languages
stand alone in morphology.

While it is true that identity of language is a good proof of the kin-
ship of peoples, in the present state of knowledge the lack of proof of
identity is no disproof of relationship or acquaintance in times remote,
or proof of nonrelationship by consanguinity or contact.

Progress,” in Smithsonian Annual Reports, 1885 to 1893. The writer does not now

IX.—SIMILARITIES IN ARTS.

To attempt in a short address to elucidate the whole subject of simi-
larities in arts along the two shores would consume too much time.!
The speaker will sufficiently orient himself in the minds of his readers
by saying that there was scarcely an original fundamental idea
developed upon the Western Hempshire. Every one of the industrial
and wsthetic arts here can be matched by one from Asia or Oceanica.
The differences are varietal, regional, tribal, special, natural. Many
American arts also tally with those of prehistoric Europe, but these
also came from that common ancestral source that supplied both Europe
and Asia and America.

There is nothing unnatural or improbable in the supposition that the
original migrants to a country should lay aside an art on the way and
pick it up again in succeeding generations. ‘Tribal memories do not
die because demands cease or resources temporarily fail. This does not
controvert Tylor’s proposition, that a people that has acquired an art
never loses it. I am now speaking of a stream of migration starting
out from the equator and passing northward out of one culture area
of mineral, vegetal, and animal supply, and of aerial, marine, and ter-
restrial conditions, and moving northward into and through a series of
different supplies and conditions as far as there is a motive, and then
repeating the process southward on another continent. This would
require centuries. In one region a peculiar exigency evokes the art of
working in hard stone; in a series of regions beyond, the absence of
material, or of the proper tools, or of a demand for the product, inter-
rupts or converts this art into something else. By and by the descend-
ants of this people come upon new quarries, demands, and appliances.
The art or folklore breaks forth again in such striking similarity to the
old as to raise the inquiry among ethnologists whether some unfortu-
nate castaway may not have been thrust ashore here and taught all the
people a foreign art. This is highly improbable. The naturalists have
no difficulty of accounting for such occurrences in nature, and they
eall them atavism. Technical atavism, or the revival of an industry
that has lived in tradition,? then may aad does account for the recur-
rence of some ancient Asiatic arts in America and of the same art in
America in regions wide apart.

X.—THE WITNESS OF ARCH AOLOGY.

Archeology has begun to bear testimony upon these possible migra-
tions. Morse discovered shell heaps in Japan, and his researches
were followed up by Kanda upon the stone implements: The ancient

'The author is preparing fon ietione an Ricca paper on ane = ae the —
sides of the Pacific, in which the matter will be minutely discussed.

2 This is excellently illustrated by Rae, in Jour. Anthrop, Inst., Lond., 1878, Vol.
VII, pp. 130, 131, with reference to the Eskimo house.
538 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST.

Japanese stone implements are identical with the American in tech-
nique and strikingly similar in shape. Even the esthetic forms are
wrought in precisely the same manner. It is well known that several
waves of aboriginal occupation preceded the present Mongol dynasty
in China, and students are waiting with interest to know more about
them and the paths by which they entered the celestial domain.

XI.—RELIGION AND FOLKLORE.

I think that all American myths point to northern origin. They are
filled with stories of the sea; but there is little ground now, in the
infancy of the science of folklore and mythology, upon which to build
theories.

I mention in passing the Easter Island images, the New Zealand
and other Polynesian wood carvings, and the general suggestion of the
Northwest totem devices in the Japanese areas.!

Father Morice says that the western Déné about Stuart Lake, in
British Columbia, have a tradition that “days were formerly so very
short that sewing the edge of a muskrat skin was all that one woman
could do between sunrise and sunset.”? Boas says that the Kwakiutl
on the Pacific coast of British Columbia tell of a place where the sun
does not shine, where there are no trees, and where people ride in
boats made of skins. These people tell of a place where the trees are
all hollow in the middle so that they carry water in the trunks. As
a matter of fact, though it may not count for much, the same tribe
make gashes in a plank and convert it into a box with invisible joints
precisely as the Chinese work in bamboo.

On the other hand, no northern tribe has the slightest conception
that they have relatives in the south.

Boas, who has studied the west coast myths more than anyone else,
points to their Asiatic origin.

XII.—THE TESTIMONY OF ETHNOGRAPHERS AND OTHERS.

Finally, and I do not think that such cumulative evidence is to be
despised, all intelligent travelers are struck with the similarities exist-
ing between our west coast Indians and existing eastern Asiatics. It
is true that those who have noted these resemblances have resorted to
untenable theories to account for them, but false theory and good
empiric data are not incompatible. It is well known that our Eskimo
have peopled a portion of northeastern Asia, following the dominating
instinet for aliment and comfort. The proposition I wish to defend is
that this close connection between the two continents has existed for
thousands of years, during which the contact between western Amer-
ica and eastern Asia was more and more close and extended and

EE —————

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 539

unbroken as we proceed backward in time. Or, to put the matter in
another shape, there never was known to history a day when the two
continents were not intimately associated. The evidences of the past
seem to confirm the opinion that as we go backward in time the geo-
eraphie conditions were more favorable and the contact more intimate.

In conclusion, the author has not here undertaken to do more than to
clear the way for a specific study of the civilizations of America and
those of eastern Asia.

Such a study will require a great deal of patient inquiry on the part
of students cooperating systematically and scrupulously only to know
the truth. The investigations of Dr. Walter Hough show that the fire
drill, consisting of a vertical revolving shaft and a horizontal hearth
piece, exists uninterruptedly from Australia to Tierra del Fuego, and
that besides this common apparatus, on the contrary, in the Malay
area, have also been invented the fire plow, the fire saw, and the fire
syringe. Wherever the better modes of fire making have superseded,
as in Japan, the carpenter goes on boring holes with reciprocating
motion between his palns.

Dr. Hough’s studies in plate armor point to its existence in the entire
stretch from Japan to the Columbia. If anyone will study carefully
Von Schrenk’s Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande, third volume,
and compare the figures and plates with similar illustrations from the
Aleutian Islands or east Greenland, he will at every turn be arrested
by seemingly useless similarities. The curious ivory ornaments on the
sea otter hunter’s wooden hat, made at great cost, are only explained
by the patterns cut from bark and attached to their clothing. The same
odd fashion is in full play in east Greenland. The harpoon of the
east Greenlander and the central Eskimo, with line hole through the
toggle head effected by two diagonal holes bored in the flat side, is
almost precisely that of the Gilhak. The canoe of bark pointed at
both ends below the water line is identical on the Amur and the Koo-
tenay, and so on.

The author protests against closing the door of investigation per-
emptorily, believing that it is the privilege of all to open any question
anew. He desires to lay aside for the present any arguments relying
upon continents that have disappeared, upon voyages across the pro-
found sea without food or motive, upon the accidental stranding of
junks, or upon the aimless wandering of lost tribes. These may all
have entered into the problem of the aboriginal life of America. They
are historical and geological questions and must be decided by the
methods of these two sciences. It is here essayed to show that when
the continent of America was peopled, it was done by men and women
purposely engaged in what all sensible people are now doing, namely,
trying to get all the enjoyment possible out of life for their efforts, and
that the present condition of the earth and of peoples offers all the
opportunity necessary for such peopling.

THE GUANCHES: THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF
CANARY,!

By Capt. J. W. GAMBIER, R. N.

Much has been written of late and much said of the merits of the
Canary Islands as health resorts, but as yet the attention of the gen-
eral public does not seem to have been drawn to the extremely inter-
esting problems as to the remote past of the human race which a
study of the manners and customs of the ancient inhabitants of these
islands affords. Various spots on the face of the earth have been
claimed by: scientific men as the cradle of the human race, and different
nations adopt different names for the three or four recognized types
which have been discovered in long barrows and round barrows, in
caves, and deep under the soil; but practically it comes to the same
thing, by whatever name they may be known, if we can only identify
these people with others bearing the same structural peculiarities, and
this, as regards the Guanche race of the Canary Islands, we are enabled
to do. We trust, therefore, that the following remarks and sketches
may enable those who are unable to visit those extraordinarily inter-
esting places in person to form some idea of what our earliest ancestors,
or at least their contemporaries, were like.

The habitations of these ancient people, who were of what we call
the Iberian race, were mostly caves excavated in the sandstone rock,
which crops out in some parts of these otherwise almost entirely vol-
canic islands. But the stone implements of ruder form, preserved in
the museum of Las Palmas, were no doubt the workmanship of people
long ago antecedent to those who scooped out these very symmetrical
caves. Who or what they were is lost in the din uncertainty of the
past, and nothing but their bones and their skulls and their rude imple-
ments remains to us. In some few instances the caves were hollowed
out of the easily worked tufa, or voleanic deposit; but as to the great
majority of these caves in the tufa it may be said that they are merely
accidental holes utilized by the earliest aborigines, and are not nearly
so interesting as the sandstone dwellings. As to these sandstone caves,
it must have been a most laborious work for people to produce them
whose only tools were implements of stone. It may be accepted as a
generally well-ascertained fact that in some of these caves we are actu-

ally standing in the cave homes of those inhabitants of our globe who
lived in the Paleolithic age—that is, the age of the unpolished stone;
the age immediately succeeding the most primeval race of which we
have any trace at all; a race whose antiquity is measured by the light
of modern science as coexistent with the last glacial epoch, and which
possibly existed even before that period. Nor is this, in the case of the
people we wish to describe, mere supposition, for by anthropometrical
observation, as well as by craniology (the twin sciences of human meas-
urements of bones and skulls), we are brought face to face with the
fact that in the slow and eternal evolution of the human race certain
structural peculiarities belong to these early races whose remains we
find in these islands, which have either been modified to suit an altered
environment or have entirely disappeared, as no longer necessary either
in the struggle for existence or in the enjoyment of life—the two most
potent factors in all the complex processes of evolution.

As regards this structural alteration, it may be briefly said that a cer-
tain peculiarity in the elbow joint—which doubtless served some purpose
to ourarboreal progenitors, but which in
parts of Europe where races have been
morerapidly mixed, or wher civilization
has made more rapid strides, and conse-
quently the process of evolution become
more determined, has ceased to exist—
existed among the Guanches, and is still
found among their descendants to this
day in a proportion far exceeding that
in any other known race. In England, in our days, this peculiarity is
practically extinet—in some parts of the world it reaches 2 per cent of
the population—but here, among the Guanches, it has been ascertained
by actual observation to reach to the astonishing number of 20 per cent,
showing arace who have been so little intermixed and so direct in descent
from the Stone age as it would be difficult to find except in the most
isolated parts of the world, among races such as the Aztees, or the inhab-
itants of some of the Pacific Ocean islands, or among the natives of Aus-
tralia. This is one of the peculiar interests of the Guanche race.

This sketch of the arm bones shows the peculiar bone structure
referred to above. It should be observed that the ordinary arm bone
has no hole init at all. (Fig. 1.)

Again, the craniology of these people has been identified by Dr. J.
Cleasby Taylor, the resident English physician at Las Palmas, as prov-
ing their Iberian descent, belonging as they did to the Dolichocephalic
branch of the human race. So that, whether the Guanches owe their
origin to some primordial race of men coexistent with the earliest genesis
of man, or whether they brought these strongly marked structural ehar-
acteristics from Berber or other mainland races, does not affect the
question of their antiquity.

The skulls illustrated (Figs. 2, 3) are drawn from specimens in the
collection of the museum of Las Palmas. The first is a purely Iberian
type, belonging to one of the three or four great divisions of the human
race—those large groups or nationalities which had gradually formed
from out of the primordial and half-simian swarms that had preceded
them. These Iberians inhabited the greater part of western Europe in
an infinitely remote period, probably toward the termination of the last
glacial epoch, which some would place at
eighty to ninety thousand years ago.
‘These men lived and died among the gigan-
ticanimals nowextinet; among mammoths,
the giant elk of Iceland, the cave bear, and
so forth. In England and in most parts
of western Europe (except Germany, where
they never penetrated) the remains of this
race have been found in what are termed
the long barrows, as distinguished from the
round barrows, which belonged to the
round-headed, a stronger race, who gradu- ;
ally eliminated the weaker. This long- ii Bik:
headed race are known asthe Iberian; they DOLICHOCEPHALIC SKULL.
inhabited the Basque provinces, Spain,
northern Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the Canary Islands, and
it is the same race who, by some yet unsolved problem, found their way
to Mexico. These Iberians, however, gradually gave way before the
stronger races—the Aryan, the Seandinavian, and the Ligurian—but
in these remote Canary Islands they lived on less molested, less influ-
enced by more dominant races, and hence have transmitted to a com-
paratively recent time their structural peculiarities. For this reason
the caves and places of sepulture, which the
Spanish discovered here in the early part of the
fifteenth century, still retained the remains of
the most ancient race known to us—still indi-
cated their modes of life, and brought down
the manners and habits of the Stone period to
within three hundred years of our time.

A glance at the two skulls as drawn here will
show the difference between the two types of
skull. The first, it will be observed (an ancient
Guancheskullof the Iberian race), 1s long behind,
low in front, and has the jaw hardly at all advanced from a perpendicu-
lar line down from the eye-socket. This, in scientific parlance, is the
Dolichocephalic and orthognathic type—that is, long-headed and weak,
or Slightly protruding chin. The other skull, it will be at once seen, is of
a different type—rounder, bolder, with more frontal development, and
with the jaw coming well forward. This is called the Brachycephalic

and prognathic type, two words describing the above properties. Now,
these Brachycephalic types of the human race are those that have super-
seded the weaker race almost all over Europe, and it is from these that
the great Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, and, generally speaking, Teu-
tonic and Latinraces have come. Of course, there existed intermediary
types, brought about by intermarriage; but these are few, and in the
eternal process of evolution the stronger naturally prevailed.

The mummified head, of which we give a sketch, is that of an ancient

Iberian. Itis quite impossible to assign a date to any of these Guanche
mummies, for they have no accompanying writing of any kind, and
have left no record behind them. (Fig, 4.)
The mummies of the Canary Islands present some very interesting
peculiarities, and have been found in great numbers in the caves that
have been used indifferently as places of sepulture and as the abodes
of theliving. The art of embalming must have been learned from stray
Egyptians or Phoenicians, and there is a legend
that in the thirteenth century before Christ
the then Egyptian ruler sent a colony to these
islands, who settled here. The Guanche mumn-
mies, however, differ from the Hgyptian in sey-
eralrespects. The bodies were sewn up in many
folds of goatskin (twenty to twenty-five in some
cases), and the legs were sometimes bent back
and doubled onto the breast. The bodies, after
a little preparation, were sun-baked, and were
then sewn up with lumps of balsam laid in the
folds. They have been found in a perfect state
of preservation, though many can not be less
than 3,000 years old. Up to what date the Guanches continued to
muminify their dead it is difficult to say, but there is reason to sup-
pose that the practice has been extended here far longer than any-
where else in the world. All their dead were not, however, mummified.
The lower orders of the people were buried in cairns, the body laid
ona heap of lava and covered over with stones. Thousands of these
have been found, and have afforded most valuable anthropometrical
information.

Fig. 4.
HEAD OF A GUANCHE MUMMY.

Our sketch shows the mummy of a young woman of the early type,
long headed, and with nonprojecting jaw. She must have been about
5 feet 1 inch, and apparently in perfect proportion. She was a mother,
and her infant baby was found in the case with her, and still lies near
her. The covering skins have been opened for examination. (Fig. 5.)

We must picture to ourselves the ancient Iberians slowly giving up
cannibalism, slowly learning to use fire, which the volcanoes of these
islands, that were active until recent days, must have early taught them
to apply to some purpose; or we must think of them as struggling with
gigantic animals, which by constant warfare through thousands, possi-

bly millions, of vears they finally exterminate, and we must watch them
gradually improving in such rude arts of fashioning stone as we know
them to have possessed. Then the next stride would have been by
making their cave homes, employing still better implements of stone,
polishing basalt, and shaping many things which indicate both skill
and imagination in their design, and so on, until they begin to adopt
pastoral habits, to breed flocks and herds, and with some gradually
dawning ideas of what we term modesty, stitching the skins of their
goats and sheep into garments. Thus slowly these islanders drift on,
forming themselves into families, and: into village communities, and
unconsciously evolving some patriarchal kind of government; take to
having one wife, and one only; discover and enforce those main princi-
ciples of virtue to which even all our civilization has added nothing,
naminely, courage, truth, and chastity. We must also picture to our-
selves that in other parts of the world infinitely more rapid strides were
being made; for whilst these ancient Canariaus were only beginning to
polish their basalt hatchets, the Etruscan and pre-Hellenic races, the

GUANCHE MUMMY.

Ligurians and our own Celtic ancestors, were already fashioning bronze;
Homer’s heroes were fighting, and were being buried at Hissarlik; and
warriors, whose mythical names seem to have reached our day, were
conquering still earlier races in our own islands, And still greater
changes soon took place among more forward races in Europe and Asia.
Tron was supplanting bronze; the mythical personages of pre-Hellenic
days were giving way to historical men and women; civilization was
rushing forward; the perfect government of early Greece was forming
itself; dynasties in Egypt were rising and falling; the Pheenicians
were peopling Spain, and driving out, or becoming identified with, the
Iberians of that land; and even the Celts in our islands were giving
way before the powerful red-haired, strong-jawed Scandinavians. But
here in Canary things stood still. The people were apparently per-
fectly content with their own mode of life, and lived on in their cave
dwellings, undisturbed by the strife and bloodshed which inevitably

accompany civilization.
The sketches we give illustrate the rude stone implements used by
these people in excavating their cave homes, the very same caves that

are still inhabited by the islanders of this day. They were held in one
hand and used as we use a pick; but from the shape of one of these
sketches it will easily be observed that a hammer-shaped instrument
yas also used. These ail belong to the Paleolithic age. They are gen-
erally chipped roughly out
of blue lias, weighing 4 or 5
pounds each. A larger kind
weighed as much as 8
pounds. (Fig. 6.)

The next group belong
to the Neolithic age, and it
would seem that in this age
greater precision of work-
manship was obtained in
cave making, as is only
natural with improved. in-
struments. What interval
of time elapsed between
these periods is naturally merely conjecture. These neolithic instru-
ments are generally of lava or some hard trap. They were smaller,
and many were of the ordinary spear and arrow head form found all
over the world. (Fig. 7.)

But now we come to a classic period in this Guanche life. For though
they remained untouched by what was going on in the world, the world
itself already began to feel a deep interest in these “ Fortunate Islands,”
especially the Greeks and Phanicians, to whose influence it is not
to be doubted the islanders owed some advance in their ceramic art,
and possibly improvements in their mode of life. Tor these were the
islands of the Hesperides, and the peak of Teneriffe was the Atlas
that bore up the heavens; and to these very islands Homer made
Jupiter send Menelaus as a reward for
all his wrongs and all that he had suf-
fered. They were the Elysian Fields,
‘“‘those blessed isles where the bitterness
of winter is unknown, and where the
winds of the ocean forever freshen the
balmy air.” ‘This, too, is the home of
Plato’s vanished Atlantis, his ideal -re-
public.

It thus becomes a strange speculation
as to how around the lives of these simple ‘Fig. 7.
islanders, people only half emerged from ae one ignper ot
the actual condition of primordial man, the most exquisite myths and the
most deeply suggestive legends of old days have grouped themselves.
Here were a people who scarcely knew vice. Paid vice was unknown; and
the Spaniards record with wonder that they never lied! But to return

to the historical: In later days Pliny, historian of Pompeii, mentions
an expedition sent to ‘the Fortunate Islands,” which brought back
its “goiden apples” (oranges), and alludes to those wonderful dragon
trees, whose age has been computed by
Humboldt as not less than 10,000 to 12,000
years. One of these enormous trees stood
within recent times at Orotava. It was the
largest tree probably in the world, and
was considered especially sacred. It was
the meeting place of all the islanders on
religious and political occasions. We
give a sketch of it, which has been copied
from a small original sketch in the museum
at Las Palmas, taken before the tree was
destroyed in 1868 bya storm. But before
this nearly two-thirds of the tree had al-
ready been cut
down. (Fig.8.)
And now for
upward of thirteen hundred years after
Pliny’s account of them these islands are
lost to sight, emerging again by their re-
discovery in the first years of the four-
teenth century, when a Norman of the
name of Bethencourt once more visited
their shores and took possession of them
in the name of the King of Spain. - -— -

of pure British descent developmg or reproducing the features and
walk of the red Indian—the high cheek bone, thin hooked nose, arched
instep, slouching gait, and nasal intonation. But alas! if the
physieal qualities of their Guanche ancestresses have been trans-
mitted, their purity and sweet gentleness have not been so successtully
handed down.

When the Spanish invaded these islands they found a condition of
affairs that must have been quite ideal and possibly unique in the
world’s history. To the simplicity of the savage these people had added
all the highest virtues; indeed, viewed from the standpoint of nine-
teenth-century morality, it 1s a mere travesty to describe the customs
and habits of the Guanches as in any way pertaining to what we are
pleased to consider as civilization. The men were brave, a lie was an
unheard-of crime, and the treachery and fraud of the Spaniards a revela-
tion to them. The women were notoriously chaste. Men had but one
wife, and paid the profoundest respect to their fathers. Their food was
simple—the flesh of goats, with milk and fruit, and gofio (still the main
food of the islands), which consists of the grain of barley crushed and
roasted and mixed with milk or with water, according to their cireum-
stances. Life in every form was as precious as if is to a Brahmin, and
they looked with horror on those whose vocation it was to destroy it.
As is the case in China to this day, a butcher was an outeast, generally
a criminal, who expiated the enormities of his crimes by having to
imbue his hands in the innocent blood of animals.

The consequence of this extended humanity was that the very birds
of the air in these islands were tame, and the astonished Spaniards saw,
not unmixed with awe and superstition, nature’s most timid creatures
playing amongst the feet of the children. These people had no profes-
sional priests, and in consequence had no idols and no fetich. They
believed in one Supreme Being, in future punishment and rewards, and
all their God asked of them was a pure life and a reverent attitude of
mind.

Social problems among the Guanches seem to have been most admi-
rably thought out. So as to insure an equality of wealth, the land was
distributed at the death of the head of a family. There also existed a
peculiar order. of self-directing Sisters of Merey among them, devoted
to a simple life of nourishing the poor and needy, clad lke all the rest
in their garb of goatskin, and only distinguishable from their lay
sisters by lives of abnegation. They remained vestal to the end of
their days, and were rightly esteemed to have merited, and were
believed to have earned, the highest reward hereafter. And as there
was no pelf for the priests, there was naturally no building set apart
for mystic rites and ceremonies. They bwilt dolmens, as we see
them in. Wales, Cornwall, or at Stonehenge, and here the people
assembled and knelt in circles with their hands lifted to heaven in
silent prayer. - = -

i.

THE GUANCHES. 5A

As regards the ancient language of the Guanches, it is generally
accepted that the traces of it are very obscure. Very learned treatises
have been written on the subject, with the usual result that most of
these doctors disagree. That the Spaniards found several languages
in existence is beyond doubt, and some authorities maintain that that
spoken in the island of Teneriffe was the only true Guanche language
in existence at that time. But the most rational solution of this babel
of tongues is that the languages spoken in the different islands were
dialects of the same mother tongue, which tongue must have been of
Berber origin. Sir Edmund Scory (temp. Elizabeth of England) says:
“The language of the old Guanches, which remayneth to this day
among them in this [sland in their towne of Candelaria, alludeth much
to that of the Moores of Barbary.” The root of the language was
Aryan, but it is, or has been, so intermixed and overlain by many
others that very little of it is really known; and that little is a very puz-
zling subject to the philologist. Upward of a thousand words, how-
ever, are known to us, and from these may be gained a very fair view
of their religious, social, and moral tenets. Thus the word Acaman,
also appearing as Atamam and Atuman, and meant indifferently, God,
the sky, or the sun, showing that the Giver of Light was their primi-
tive conception of a God, the usual sun worship of all early religions.
Another title of the Deity was Acquayaxerax, or ‘“*The Sustainer of
All,” an exquisitely poetical designation. Their belief had nothing in
common with the Jehovistic idea. The Guanches seem to have had
some dim idea that their God was part and parcel of His own works,
inseparable from them—coexistent and coeternal with nature. This
may be inferred from the fact that God was also known in Guanche as
Guarirari, or “The Indweller of the Universe.” But again, on the
other hand, He was also known in one of the islands as Achahuerahan,
“God the Creator,” bringing it back to the old difficulty. The word
Achimaya, ‘* mother,” is of special interest, as it seems to contain the
germ root for that sweetest of all words in so many and widely diver-
gent languages. There is clearly some connection between ‘‘ maya”
and mater, and the ‘“‘maia” of Buddha. Here, also, is a curious resem-
blance: Haran, “a fern,” which by the ordinary change of h into f
becomes “faran.” Cabuco, “a goat fold,” resembles ** caper” or “ capra”
in Latin. The name for the moon, Cel, seems to contain the germ of
the Greek cel7jvy. Another curious resemblance is found in the word
Magada, “ a virgin;” Gothic, Magath ; old German, Magad ; modern
German, Magd; English, Maid. A prefix to this word, Hari, meant a
vestal virgin, Harimagada. Is this Hari the same word as the German
Heilig ?

Perhaps an entire sentence may be of interest, for which, together
with the preceding Guanche words, I am indebted to a paper on the
language of the ancient natives of these islands by the Marquis of
Bute: “Achoran, nun habec, Sahagua reste quagnat, sahur banot gerage
550 THE GUANCHES.

sote,” which is translated: ‘I swear by the bone of him who has earried
the crown to follow his example and to make the happiness of my sub-
jects.” ‘*Janaga quayoch, archimenceu no haya dir hanido sahee chungra
petui ”—“*The powerful Father of the Fatherland died and left the
natives orphans.”

These sentences give an idea of the language to which these ancient
aces were accustomed, and also point out how poetical were their
ideas.

In many respects this primitive language seems to have been singu-
larly fortunate, for the Marquis of Bute observes as to their verbs,
“There is only conjugation, and it seems to be beautifully developed,
as though upon a purely logical basis, like an ideal generated from a
philosopher’s thought.”

As regards the cave dwellings, though many are seattered through-
out all the islands of the Canary group, the chief are at Atalaya, in the
Grand Canary, about 7 miles from the port and town of Las Palmas.
This City of Caves is situated on a peculiar-shaped lime and sandstone
hill, which projects into a wild, rugged valley, overlooking a great
expanse of country, the sea lying far below, and the main mountain
range of the island, some 7,000 to 8,000 feet high, rising behind. The
road to it, after leaving the modern and excellent Spanish carriage
road, is rough and fatiguing, and is probably as ancient a track as has
been ever trod by human feet. Over this road for countless thousands
of years these troglodytes have traveled on their way up from fishing
in the sea or from the cultivation of the lower lands, and over these
same tracks still travel their half-breed descendants in search of work
in the towns and the vineyards.

The hill of Atalaya forms two round heads, both honeycombed with
ancient caves, which vary in size, the smallest not more than 8 to 10
feet square and 6 feet high; the largest, with two apartments, both of
which may measure 18 feet by 12 or 14, and 8 or 9 feet high. It is
evident that in many cases existing natural caves were utilized, being
squared off inside and shaped to suit the convenience of the inhabitants,
but many others are entirely the work of man, scooped out with infinite
pains from the solid sandstone rock. The most primitive races of all
probably did none of this scooping, but were content to live in the
natural caves in the same way as their simian brethren.

Some idea of the extent of the cave communities may be formed when
it is stated that even to this day, with many hundred caves empty or
utilized as storehouses, there can not be less than 1,500 inhabtants in
Atalaya, besides numbers of goats, pigs, donkeys, and mules, who are
also provided with cave accommodation, without trespassing on the
sleeping room of their masters, as in Ireland. Many of these cave
rooms are very comfortably furnished and are inviting to look at. Some
are particularly clean, well whitewashed, and the floors thoroughly
swept, whilst beds with snow-white covers and little tables with rough

lace work on them for cloths, a few books, the inevitable Madonna,
some candlesticks, and the always picturesque pottery give an air of
refinement that we may search for in vain in the coarse homes of too
many of our own peasantry. As to the healthiness or comfort of these
dwellings, of course it is a matter of habit. The only ventilation is the
door, and as that is tight shut at night it seems difficult to understand
how the people can breathe. There must also be a considerable disre-
gard of les convenances as to their habits, for apparently both sexes
of all ages occupy the same room. The sanitary arrangements, it need
hardly be said, leave much to be desired. There is a staggering sim-
plicity and freedom in their treatment. }

The present dwellers are very gentle and extremely ignorant. The
men go out all day to look for work or work in their own little patches

of cultivation; small terraces of reclaimed land walled up below. The
women all work at pottery, using no wheel, and reproducing the simpler
patterns, as are found in the tombs of thousands of years ago. The
clay used is very strong and has much adhesive power. It bakes into
a fine dark red. They now never color their pottery, nor do they mark
it with the stamps, as in the old days. Many of the best shapes are
lost and those that remain are strictly utilitarian.

As to their personal appearance, among these cave dwellers may
often be seen strikingly handsome faces; their forms are good and
their movements graceful. It has been said that they are often rude to
visitors, and carry the importunity of begging (for they are msatiable
beggars) to the limits of rudeness and menace. It certainly is unad-
visable for ladies to go there alone,

PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.!

3y ALFRED BINET.

Everyone of us, whether aware of it or not, has experienced illusions
of the senses; they do not always tell the truth. The eye, the ear,
deceive us, and even the hand, that we instinetively extend to test the
evidence of our other senses, has often played us false, though, to speak
more accurately, it is the mind and not the senses that is at fault.
The senses make known but one thing, the sensations. The eye merely
communicates the different shades of light or color; the hand, sensa-
tions of contact and movement. The mind interprets these sensations,
draws conclusions, and with these conclusions constructs exterior
objects endowed with numberless properties. When we say this isa
chair, a table, a dog, a house, we not only indicate what the eye has
perceived, but we reason it out. Yet if this automatic and rapid
reasoning be at fault we have had an illusion of the senses.

Prestidigitation is an art which has in view a singular aim, that of
seeking out and developing all influences which could lead us to be
deceived in what we see. A person witnessing experiments in presti-
digitation and understanding nothing of the means employed is easily
made to believe that he sees an object in one part of the room when it
is really elsewhere; he sees that which does not exist and sees not that
which really does exist.

One can readily understand the interest of the psychologist in the
study of the means employed to produce these illusions, for it enlight-
ens us as to the process by which the mind perceives exterior objects,
and makes known likewise the weak points of our knowledge. Before
entering into the details of our analysis it may be well to determine by
certain general considerations the nature of the error produced by the
art of the prestidigitator.’

'Translated from Revue des Denx Mondes, October 15, 1894.

°"We have borrowed the principal elements of this study from the old works of
Jacques Ozanan, Guyot, Decremps, Ponsin, and from the more recent books of Robert
Houdin. Some authors, Mr. James Sully (Illusions des Sens et de l’Esprit) and Mr.
Max Dessoir (Open Court, 1893), have treated the question from a psychological
point of view, and we have borrowed from them useful indications. We have above
all tried to give the reader a clear idea of the performance of these tricks by con-
sulting professionals and requesting them to execute before us, in different condi-
tions, tricks in which they very obligingly showed us that which they are in the
habit of carefully concealing. We will cite with pleasure among these benevolent

coadjutors Messrs. Arnould, Dickson, Mélies, Pierre, and Raynaly.

556 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

1p

Mr. James Sully, the eminent English psychologist, has made a
distinction with regard to the illusions of the senses which presents
real philosophical value. The illusions of the senses, he says, should
be divided into two categories, the active illusions and the passive
usions. The passive illusions are general; they are those which are
experienced under the same conditions by all individuals; they are
inherent in our psychic organization, and no one can escape them. It
is a law that we see objects in a perpendicular position, notwithstand-
ing the fact that their image is reversed upon the retina of the eye. A
stick plunged into the water has to us the appearance of being broken.
From these errors, common to all, we must distinguish those Mr. Sully
calls active, those that are productions of the spontaneous activity of
the mind; these remain individual unless they take the epidemical form.
They are the result of our temperament, the state of our mind and our
belief. Hence it is by an active illusion that while awaiting a person
on the roadway we fancy we recognize him in a person approaching in
the distance.

Without going so far as to say that all belonging to the active illu-
sions present a certain gravity, it must not be forgotten that it is
illusions of this kind and not the others that are near relations to the
hallucinations of madness.

Unquestionably illusions of prestidigitation form a part of the pas-
sive illusions, and, as it were, normal, which dominate all well-consti-
tuted persons. Subsequent analysis will confirm this affirmation, in
showing on which precise point the error of the senses bears. Mr.
Max Dessoir has discusssed this question a propos of an interesting
experience. He supposes an illusionist taking an orange, and after
having shown it to those around him, throws it up into the air and
then catches it in his hand as it descends. He repeats this perforim-
ance once, twice, and the third time, after having placed the orange in
his pocket without the knowledge of those looking on, he makes a pre-
tense of again throwing it up in the air. Mr. Dessoir thinks, and we
think with him, that many of those present misled by this action would
believe they again saw the orange being tossed into the air as on the
two other occasions, and would be greatly astonished at not seeing it
descend as they had reason to believe it would. Whatis the nature of
the illusion in such a case? What name must be given to it? To see
an object in a place where in reality it is not, is an hallucmation. Mr.
Dessoir has good reason to discard this injudicious interpretation. The
word hallucination, as we have frequently observed, must be used only
with reference to an illusion that can have no explanation in exterior
things; it 1s a disorder of the senses, not a normal error. If the spec-
tators believe they see the orange, then they yield, as we will explain,
to a pretense on the part of the conjurer; they give themselves up to
PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION, ‘SC

the illusion, without troubling themselves to investigate it, which
would only destroy the appearance and therefore the pleasure.

’ It must be observed that the greater part of these illusions which
owe their existence to the art of prestidigitation must have for a neces-
sary condition the cooperation of the public, or at least their willingness
to oblige.

The public do not go to the prestidigitators for the purpose of pick-
ing to pieces, as it were, a scientific experiment. They ask only one
thing—to be deceived; that is to say, to experience that astonishment,
that slight cloudiness of ideas or intellect which the sight of a phe-
nomenon contrary to all natural laws excites within us. In order that
this particular mental state should be produced one must give one’s
self up to the illusion, and not endeavor to lay hold of the mechanism
which prodnees it. If by chance we discover the secret of the trick
we must keep the discovery to ourselves, as propriety demands. We
would not dream of such a thing as questioning the prestidigitator
while in the exercise of his profession, nor of taking precaution to see
through his magical performances. If the magician places his hands
behind his back at a eritical moment we would not call out to him
as did the fox in the fable, “I beseech of you, sir, turn round.” The
reserve of the first instance comes from a sentiment of discretion;
that of the other from a certain timidity. These illusionists are well
aware of this; as for instance when they wish to have a certain card
chosen from the pack they invariably address themselves to a lady, as
a@ woman is much more given to reserve than a man; and should she
perceive the fraud, she dare not raise her voice to demand an explana-
tion for fear of attracting attention to herself; her timidity makes her
the artist’s accomplice. For that matter the magician has more than
one means of mastering a Skeptical and unyielding public. In perform-
ing a trick he goes through one part of it before one person and to
complete it he turns to another who has as yet seen nothing of the
first part. It is necessary for the same person to witness the entire
trick in order to understand how it is done. Thus one person is made
to mark a piece of money and another farther away is to keep it, who,
not having seen it marked, is not aware that it has been changed.

With regard to those who are requested to come upon the stage in
order to examine closely the actions of the magician, they exercise a
control essentially deceptive. The prestidigitator takes particular
care only to choose those from the audience whose countenance express
artlessness and simplemindedness, when they are not confederates.
The magician allows these witnessess to see only as much as it is
convenient for him to have them see; they are also at liberty to do,
whether they be aware of it or not, only that which he wishes them to
do, and can not undertake to find out anything for themselves without
the artist’s permission. This is the conclusion arrived at lately in a
curious contest. One of the audience wished absolutely to know what
558 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

was going on behind a screen, and on being called upon the platform
he raised the screen, and immediately great excitement was evinced
on the part of the artist and his assistants; a hand-to-hand combat
ensued, and it ended in a law suit. The audacious offender was made
to pay heavy damages for having exceeded the rights the magician
had granted him. One may judge by this example how difficult it
would be to make scientific observations at a public representation.
Notwithstanding the difficulties of control, the public is the dupe of
the illusions presented to him only in a certain degree, as he considers
the fact that he is attending a seance of prestidigitation; if it is
unpossible for him to understand the secret of a trick, this would not
be a reason for him to believe that the laws of nature had been over-
thrown. Should a nutmeg appear suddenly as if it sprang from the
artist’s finger ends, without the spectator being able to understand
how it was done, he would not from this believe it possible for nut-
megs to spring from one’s finger ends. The illusion exists, we may say,
only for the sense of sight; our reason contradicts if.

In seeking to analyze the different processes by which the illusion is
produced in these feats of sleight of hand, and the spectator prevented
from discovering the truth, we find it most difficult to give clear and
satisfactory definitions, as there exists not only one process, but many,
and they are of a very complicated nature. The illusion of each trick
is not merely the result of one single cause, but of many, so insignifi-
cant that to perceive them would be quite as difficult as to count with
the naked eye the grains of sand on the seashore. I will not enter too
much into detail, but will confine myself to exposing the principal arti-
fices resorted to by the prestidigitator. The illusions of the senses
which we will study may be divided into two principal groups, positive
and negative. Modern researches in hypnotism have familiarized us
with the term and with the phenomena they indicate. We know that
the positive illusions with which we will begin our description consist
in seeing that which does not exist; they give rise to appearances with-
out reality. Persons in a hypnotic state have these illusions; they are
one of the very first steps of this artificial condition of the mind.

A person hypnotized can be commanded to see anything by the per-
son who hypnotizes him. For instance, he says: ‘ Here is a bird!” in
a’ persuasive or commanding tone of voice. Immediately the subject
imagines a bird is in the room; he sees it, he touches it, he hears it
sing, catches hold of it with awkward but expressive gestures, and goes
through other like performances caused by the suggestion of a bird:
We cite this example of hypnotic illusion because there is a resemblance
between it and the iliusions of the prestidigitator by the important fact
of its being the result of the influence of one mind over another, But
———— a ee

lay aside this fundamental resemblance and what a difference we find
between the two cases! When we wish to surround a hypnotized
person with illusions the operation is one of the greatest simplicity.
We merely pronounce a word in an authoritative tone to make the
illusion a reality tohim. ‘Here is a bird,” we say, and without further
explanation the subject sees a bird as if it were in reality present. The
prestidigitator must resort to a more subtle means of arriving at the
same end; he must deceive the spectators without their being aware of
the deception that is being practiced upon them.

The first necessary condition for all these operations is holding the
attention of the audience. Before commencing a trick the operator
should endeavor to have the attention of each one of the spectators, in
order that their minds may enter into relation with his. This is what
in hypnotism is called “entrer en rapport,” giving a convenient term to
a phenomenon the existence of which is certain, but the nature of whieh
it would be most difficult to define. We all know how to attract and
retain the attention of a person with whom we wish to speak. It is
instinct with us. We were never taught the different insignificant
means employed to arrive at this end, such as raising the voice, placing
the hand upon the shoulder, or making use of an interjection. We all
know that a great deal depends upon the personality of the individual;
for instance, there are some who find it impossible to hold the attention
of an audience or even of an individual, while there are others who by
the mere utterance of a few words, such as “I do not know” or “I beg
pardon,” command immediate attention. The prestidigitator who has
doubtless never reflected upon the means he uses to hold his audience,
nevertheless knows well how to exercise this influence to attract the
eyes and close attention of everyone present to his hands, his eyes, or
to whatever part of his body it is necessary for his project that they
should be attracted.

Robert Houdin makes an observation the truth of which will be
readily recognized by those who are accustomed to speak in public and
to enter into communication with a large concourse of individuals.
He says that the first and most important quality of the prestidigitator
is to possess a steady eye; certain people have a timid, vague expression,
and while conversing with them should one look them frankiy and
steadily in the face they feel embarrassed and turn away their heads as
if they dreaded the intimacy of such looks. This timidity of expression
is contagious; it is a great stumbling-block to conversation, and pre-
vents the orator from exercising any influence over his hearers. The
prestidigitator, says Robert Houdin, must have a frank, bright, pene-
trating glance, which he must concentrate boldly upon the eyes of the
spectators in such a manner that their eyes become riveted on his, and
a feeling of mutual sympathy arises. When the artist accomplishes
this he can at will turn the eyes of his audience in whatever direction
he sees fit.
560 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

The means employed to produce positive illusions is the making use
of feint or pretense.

The feigning of an action is the mere outline of the action. A feint
is made of taking something from the table; the hand is extended
toward the table as if to remove the object. A femtis made of throwing
an orange into the air, when in reality it is still retained in the hand.
Feigning an action consists 1m performing only the first part of a well
known and expressive action, and the end is concealed; the hand is
hidden, for example, behind a table, a screen, or behind the body dur-
ing this second part of the act, which must be executed with dexterity.
The spectator not anticipating anything of the sort, having seen the
first part of the action completed, but not the second, although he is
not aware of it, believes the operation to be correctly and completely
executed. The psychologist is not at a Joss to explain the mechanism
of these operations, which rests upon the laws of habit or the laws of
association of ideas. When one of two actions or two perceptions,
which as a rule follow one another, presents itself to our eyes, our mind
is so constructed that the presence of the one act, or the one perception,
irresistibly suggests the other. From the time we perceive the first
act we suppose the second, because it is the logical consequence, or
simply the habitual accompaniment. We do more than suppose it; we
represent it so vividly to ourselves we believe we see it.

These explanations are more directly applicable to sleight of hand,
which is the basis of prestidigitation. Sleight of hand consists in com-
pletely concealing an object in a sudden and brusque manner before
the astonished gaze of the lookers on and in giving the idea that it was
suddenly transferred to a certain place, when in reality it has not been
removed. The prestidigitator takes an object in his right hand, a piece
of cork, an egg, a piece of money, it matters not what, provided it can
be easily handled. He holds the object up to view and then makes a
pretense of slipping it into his left hand, and he imitates the action so
cleverly that everyone present is persuaded that it is no longer in his
right hand, but reposing in his left. Not only are they persuaded that
he has made the exchange, but they fully believe that they saw him do
it, and more than one will be willing to vouch for the truth of it on the
testimony of their eyes. The illusion for those who do not know how
it is done and have not attempted to analyze it is absolutely irresist-
ible. It misleads not only children and ignoramuses, but grown men
and renowned’ scholars. I myself have known men accustomed to
scientific observation completely duped by these tricks. The savages,
as Robert Houdin relates, do not escape these illusions any more than
the civilized inhabitants of the globe, and they explain them to them-
Selves in attributing to the prestidigitator a supernatural power. Even
animals, we may add, are sensible of these illusions. I have frequently
experimented upon dogs by juggling away sugar plums, which excites
their interest sufficiently to make them attentive to the tricks.
PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 561

The art of sleight of hand is not dependent upon ecaprice, but is gov-
erned by fixed laws known for more than a hundred years, and which
can no longer be modified. Nowadays one learns to juggle just as
to dance or to play upon the piano. The manipulation of the fingers
is most complicated, and to be able to perform these feats without the
assistance of a box, or a string, with only one’s own dexterity to aid,
is the highest aim of the prestidigitator. It is not only necessary to
practice before the looking glass for days or weeks, it requires years to
become an expert in this art. We do not consider it as straying from
our subject in thus giving a rather minute description of this sleight
of hand; the illusions which are the result are purely psychological.
Many people believe the magician conceals the objects he makes use of
in his sleeves; this false opinion has been frequently contested, but
it is nevertheless tenacious. The truth of the matter is that apart
from such experiments as the “vanishing cage,” etc., the sleeves are
rarely used by professionals. One of the most famous conjurers,
Boseo, worked with his arms perfectly bare.

Almost every operation consists in retaining the object in one hand
and making believe it is resting in the palm of the other.

It is necessary for a prestidigitator to practice a very long time before
he becomes an expert in thus retaining objects in his hand. He begins
by practicing with small objects, such as nutmegs, dimes, nickels, small
corks, and afterwards with more voluminous objects, as billiard balls
and eggs. There are different ways of retaining the objects in the
palm of the hand with the hand open; and the professionals distin-
guish several different ways of accomplishing this feat. Sometimes
the palm of the hand is alone used, and at others the first joints of the
fingers. A nutmeg, for instance, can be held between the root of the
middle finger and that of the ring finger, and there are many other
ways; each one has his preference. The difficulty appears to be to slip
the object supposed to disappear to the place where it is to beheld. It
is held up at first for the inspection of the audience between two fingers,
and these fingers should move slowly so as to propel the object into its
place of concealment.

The number of objects that ean be held in the palm depends greatly
upon circumstances; it varies as the objects are real or imitation,
whether they are attached together by a cord, whether they have been
juggled, whether the wand or a handkerchief must be held in the hand,
or whether the hand must be open or be half closed.

In the trick that is called “ hunting the pieces” (la chasse aux
pieces), twelve pieces at one time are held in the hand, but the hand
is almost closed. A good prestidigitator can hold in his hand at once
five 5-frane pieces with the hand hanging loosely at his side in a per-
fectly natural position and with which he is able to gesticulate, ‘‘ couper
le jeu,” ete. This being granted, we will now give a compiete descrip-
tion of a feat of sleight of hand, chosen from among several varieties.

SM 94——356
562 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

I borrow this description from Poncin, who is really the classical author
of this art: *‘Take a regular juggler’s ball (small size) between the
thumb and index finger of the right hand. Bend the index finger,
which will make it draw back and cause the ball to roll a little, which
ought then to rest upon the first joint of the middle finger. Bring the
ring finger inside the hand so as to make a greater space between it
and the middle finger. Roll the ball with the thumb into the space,
raise the ring finger, and the ball should be then just between the
joints of the middle and ring fingers and near the roots of both.”

This trick will never be perceived, because it is invisible to the audi-
ence, the back of the hand being turned toward them, and although
the object is in the palm, the hand appears relaxed expressive of inac-
tivity andrepose. But what would augment the illusion considerably,
and give it even an irresistible effect, is that while juggling the ball
in the right hand we make a gesture as if placing it in the left hand;
we then bring both hands together, describing a half circle if it be
necessary to augment the distance, and therefore give more time to the
securing of the ball in the palm, and as soon as the fingers of the right
hand touch the palm of the left hand, we close the left hand, as if
holding an object which we did not wish to let fall. This gesture suf-
fices to make those looking on believe the object is really in the left
hand; and the illusion will be all the more perfect if the artist shows
himself a good comedian. Our advice is to repeat the act frequently
before a mirror in order to become expert in its performance. More-
over, the effect of the act is increased by the words with which he
accompanies it, his affirming that the object is in his left hand, the
manner of looking at his left hand, and, in fact, his whole expression
of countenance, all go to increase the force of the illusion. Of course
it is necessary not to overdo it by putting too much zeal in the action
of the hand, or wearing an unnatural expression of countenance, as
this would only arouse suspicion in the minds of the audience.

There exists another artifice, to which we may have recourse to
heighten the effect of the trick, which is for the artist to treat his audi-
ence to a little set speech he has all prepared for the occasion, and
which has on the minds of the audience an effect most favorable to the
illusion. If the artist announced beforehand that a nutmeg would
disappear while he was bringing both hands together their eyes would
become so fixed on the movements of his hands as to cause him no little
embarrassment, and no doubt some among them would perceive the
fraud. ‘To throw them off the scent, he envelops the trick in a sort of
mystery. Heannounces to them, for example, that by squeezing a nut-
meg in his right hand he has the power to melt it, and cause it to
evaporate and disappear; everyone present, of course, knows this to
be impossible, but such is the power of the human speech that we are
almost compelled to give our best attention to the act the magician
announces he is about to perform, and in consequence we keep a close
PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGIJTATION. 563

watch on his right hand when he finishes juggling, but while he was
juggling and making a pretense of passing the nutmeg into the right
hand, when he was holding it secretly in the left hand, we had only
looked on mechanically. This part of the operation remained in
shadow, as it were; it is perceived in a semiconscious manner, as an
act void of all importance, and the illusion that results becomes all
the stronger, no one being aware of the exact moment in which it was
produced.

All these details go to show that positive illusions produced by a
pretense or feint have peculiar qualities of their own; the illusion is not
a durable one, as that of the bent stick in the water—the false appear-
ance lasts only for a moment. We would not say, while looking on at
the performance, “I see the ball passing from one hand to the other;”
we would say “I saw it; { am positive that it passed ”—an illusion of
memory rather than of the senses.

Heck

We meet with another class of illusions in the tricks of the presti-
digitators, to which we may give the name of negative illusions, in
contrast with the preceding ones. ‘The first and best examples of
these singular illusions have been made known to us through hypnotic
experiments. These illusions consist in not seeing, in not hearing,
in not feeling, and which abolish the perception, be it either of an
object or of a class of objects. We place, for instance, before the
person hypnotized a real, material, tangible object. Suppose it to be
a person assisting at the experiment; the subject is commanded not
to see this person, and the command is sufficient to cause the disap-
pearance of the person—of his becoming invisible, as it were. This last
class of illusions is much more difficult to understand than the first.
Authors have not given, it must be admitted, a perfectly satisfactory
explanation of it. Wedo not know what is taking place in the mind
of the subject hypnotized who is commanded not to see a person imme-
diately in front of him. We have difficulty in understanding the proc-
ess by which the person hypnotized, while being perfectly sincere
with himself and not in any way “‘making believe” or endeavoring to
play a joke, can arrive at that state of not being able to see a person
immediately in front of him with whom he is well acquainted. Negative
illusions are frequent in seances of prestidigitation; we will endeavor
to ascertain how a person perfectly sane and in possession of all his
faculties is prevented from seeing objects placed immediately before
his eyes.

The objects from which it is necessary to divert the attention of the
lookers-on vary according to circumstances. In certain feats it is a
corner of the conjurer’s table. In other tricks it is a goblet or a pack of
cards. As arule it is the hands of the prestidigitator himself, to which
the too close attention of the audience must not be given. It must be

understood that it is not always an easy matter to escape the vigilant
watch of the spectators. They come to the performance to see, and
from the moment the curtain rises and the artist appears on the stage
all eyes are riveted upon him, and as he is entirely surrounded by light,
how is it possible to prevent the spectators from directing their atten-
tion to the particular spot where the illusion is to be produced ?

To accomplish this the prestidigitator has recourse to a psychologi-
cal law, of which he no doubt knows nothing, and which he has never
heard explained. Prestidigitation rests on psychology. We have just
shown how the law of association of ideas explains positive illusions.
Those that come under the head of negative illusions are explained by
this other Jaw, which can be expressed thus: We have a tendency to
perceive only exterior objects which attract our attention. All percep-
tion is optional with us; ntimerous sensations are constantly vibrating
our organs of sense; we neglect the greater part of them, because they
are of no interest; we fix our attention only on certain ones, the signifi-
cant ones; these alone traverse the threshold of our mind; they become
the objects of our reasoning, suggest to us past events, and play a part
in our interior life. Although each one’s individual attention is more
particularly attracted by this or by that, for instance, this one is apt to
be more observant of forms, that one of color, and so on, yet there are
certain rules of perception which are general; a priori we can desig-
nate certain objects which command our whole attention and certain
others which are only perceived with the corner of the eye and neg-
lected and quickly. forgotten. This uniformity of reactions before the
same spectacles is known to prestidigitation and it profits by it. When
it is particularly important that certain peculiarities of a trick be not
observed, even in the broad light, matters are so arranged that the
attention of the spectators is drawn to another point at the decisive
moment or an appearance of insignificance is given to the act, which
produces a relaxation of attention. The attention is thus distracted
and deadened; these are the two principal means of rendering invisible
a spectacle which is perfectly visible to all eyes.

The distraction of the attention will be easily understood by a few
examples. When the eyes of all the spectators are directed toward
the artist he may easily divert their attention to another point by him-
self looking in a perfectly natural manner toward this point; should
he turn to the right all the spectators will obediently follow his gaze.
It is understood, though, he must not turn too quickly; it is best

to make the movement slowly and naturally. This is the A B C of.

the art. Should the artist wish to play a trick with the right hand let
him turn toward the left; to conceal a movement made by the left hand
he must turn to the right. Thus the attitude of his body indicates to
the spectators in which direction their attention should be directed.
The mere fact of speaking causes the removal of attention. Mr. Max
Dessoir has already observed that when the artist takes up a pack of

ey ee ee

PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 565

cards all eyes are fixed upon his hands; let him speak and immediately
every eye flies to his face and give his hands the opportunity of profit-
ing by the occurrence to go through maneuvers which are witnessed
by no one.

There is still even a surer method of diverting the eyes and attention
of the spectators by performing some act which of itself wili interest
them or hold their attention. In tricks of importance some such
movement is always arranged beforehand. For instance, an object is
deposited in an impressive manner on the corner of the table, and
the artist announces that this object will be used in the execution of
the trick. Suppose it to be a hat through which he proposes to pass ¢
handful of silver; irresistibly all eyes become riveted on the hat and do
not see the hand which in the meantime lays hold of an object concealed
behind the table in a secret pocket or drawer; or he announces that he
will make an object appear upon a certain piece of furniture on which
he taps with the magic stick and gives a little discourse similar to this
one Robert Houdin delivered: ‘You all doubtless are aware of the
power of the magic wand, with which one has merely to tap gently
upon an object in order to cause to appear whatever one wishes; behold,
for example, we will try to make it produce not here (he taps the table
with the stick), but here (he taps his hand) a crystal ball; here it is!”
His object in tapping on the table was to attract the attention of the
audience to the table, so they will not see his hand which he places in
his pocket for the purpose of getting the ball, which he keeps hidden
in his palm until the desired moment. There is a simpler method of
diverting the attention of the audience without using the magie wand,
a mere remark on the part of the prestidigitator is sufficient. A pres-
tidigitator writes me: “In a little discourse which I deliver with great
seriousness, [ exclaim, in designating a certain place at a distance from
my table: ‘Authentic pieces, which are not here, demonstrate with
evidence . At these words, ‘which are not here,’ the eyes of the
spectators turn from me to look where I tell them there is nothing.”
The diverting of the eyes is still more certain and even necessary and
fatal when the artist takes the precaution to perform some little inter-
esting act. I borrow this novel example from Robert Houdin. The
prestidigitator declares he is about to divide a glass ball in two. This
ball, he affirms, showing it, is of pebble; it is heavy and very hard; but
hard as it is he hopes to divide it. During this time he throws the
ball up in the air and catches it in its descent to attract the attention
of the spectators. “It would be an impossibility,” observes Robert
Houdin, “for the eyes of the audience not to follow it in its ascension.”

In the same order of ideas we will cite some experiments which take
place in succession, one after the other, in order to enable the artist to
prepare the following experiment at the very moment when the whole
attention of the audience is fixed upon the trick which has just been
concluded.

566 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

In an amusing trick, called the birth of flowers, the prestidigitator
makes bouquets appear in different objects, in his buttonhole, in a box,
in a glass,in a hat; and at the moment that the flowers appear in one
of these objects, and the audience is suffused with admiration and won-
der, the prestidigitator profits by their attention being directed from
him and places a bouquet in the next object to which he wishes to call
their attention.

In fact, in many tricks played with cards in which it is necessary for
one of the spectators to choose a card, it is customary to ask him a
question which will necessitate his answering, and thus for a moment
divert his attention from the hands of the artist. Mr. Arnould gives a
curious example: “In a little trick with cards, which I have submitted
to you,” he writes us, “it is necessary for me to know the fourth card
of the pack; everyone is looking at my hands; I am sitting down;
there is no means of turning my body in order to conceal the movement
I wish to make from the audience (the operation consists in gently
raising the card in order to see its face); there is no pretext for my
touching the ecards. I hold myself in readiness and put this point-
blank question to the spectator immediately in front of me: ‘Can you
count up to 60?’ The person addressed of course looks at me in
amazement, not exactly knowing how to take my question; the others
in the audience, much amused, look in his direction; this all occupies
about one second, ample time for me to look at the card.”

The greatest variety of tricks can be played in this manner. We
will leave it to the ingenious mind to discover new ones. The presti-
digitator has very seldom to himself invent; the tricks he plays are
like the classical pieces at the Theatre Francais, accompanied by tra-
ditions which indicate in the minutest possible manner what is to be
done at a given moment to remove the gaze of the spectators, and the
means are so powerful that scarcely anyone escapes their influence.

Instead of diverting the attention there are ways of making the audi-
ence lose interest just when the most important and decisive part of
the trick is being accomplished, and the means employed are numerous.
In certain cases to hide a movement, it must be made brusquely, by
surprise, so that no one would have time to prepare attention; the
movement must be so rapid that the eye will have no time to follow it
in detail. There are some interesting observations to make on the
tricks of dexterity. Certain tricks performed by the hands appear as
perfect enigmas when they are performed with great rapidity. Mr.
Raynaly performed at our laboratory “le saut de coup des deux mains,”
and such was the rapidity with which he accomplished this trick and
such the foree of the illusion that after having seen him repeat it
twenty times not one present could detect the secret. Mr. Raynaly held
in his hands a pack of cards; he first made us notice that the bottom
card was a face card, for instance, the king of hearts; when suddenly
we perceived a slight movement of the hands and there before our eyes

PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 567

the king was transformed into the ace of spades. ‘There were four of
us present—men accustomed to observation. We were dumfounded
and absolutely unable to understand how it was accomplished. The
disappearance of the cage was also performed for our benefit by Mr.
Arnould. This trick also produced a most curious illusion, though not
so forcible as the preceding one. We can not dispute the fact that the
rapidity with which the movement is made is the cause of its invisi-
bility. The proof is that should the artist consent to go through the
operation slowly we would have no difficulty in detecting the mechan-
ism. But at the same time it must be observed that the question is
very complex. The invisibility is not dependent solely upon the short
duration of the sensation received by the eye. Numerous experiments
have been made in late years in order to measure the time necessary
to perceive a letter or a color. The experiment has been made by
placing the observer behind an aperture, the opening and closing of
which can be regulated. To perceive and recognize a letter it requires
some hundredths part of a second. In witnessing a trick the difficulty
of perception is even greater than to recognize a letter or color, for we
must be able to understand and divine the mechanism of an act often
very complicated, as “le saut de coup des deux mains.” The time this
operation occupies, though much longer than would be necessary for
us to perceive a color (it occupies fifteen hundredths of a second), is
not sufficient for the spectator to grasp it. There are, then, two causes
which concur to produce the illusion—the rapid movements of the
hands and the complicated and inexplicable character of the operation.
From the time this second cause of the illusion is done away with the
illusion disappears. The artists, whose names I have just mentioned,
having been good enough to decompound their movements, I could
afterwards, when they went through the trick with their accustomed
rapidity, account for each movement of their hands; I saw the move-
ment because I had learned to know it, and consequently I knew the
exact points to which I should pay the most attention.

It is by considerations of this sort that we explain what I will eall
‘the screen system.” There are an indefinite number of tricks in which
to render an object invisible we hide it entirely, absolutely, by placing
it behind another object which forms a screen. At first sight it seems
impossible that the spectators do not suspect the artifice. But they do
not, as in everyday life we are constantly losing sight of the object at
which we are looking, and we fill up these short eclipses of the object
by a rapid reasoning; if, for instance, while watching a little child
playing at ball we suddenly lose sight of its hand, it would seem ridiec-
ulous for us to conclude that the child had suddenly become one-handed.
A detailed mental image which remains constantly alive completes the
sensation and prevents our taking note of the gap. The artifice of the
prestidigitator consists in taking advantage of such gaps; he surrounds
himself with certain material conditions which, for a very short space
568 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

of time, hide his hands or the objects he holds, without our noticing
the interruption in the course of our perception, and it is during these
interruptions that the decisive act is executed.

Let us suppose, for example, that the prestidigitator in a certain
trick wishes to substitute one card for another, which is called “filer la
earte.” To conceal this operation he proceeds as follows: He stands
not behind the table, but in front of it, between the audience and the
table, which of course necessitates his turning a little when he places
the card upon the table. This slight change of position conceals his
hand and enables him to change the cards. There are many secret
movements made by the prestidigitator on returning to the stage after
having been among the audience. His back being turned, it is very
easy for him to substitute other objects for those confided to him,
Otten, also, the artist arranges matters so that at a certain part of the
trick it become necessary for him to go to the other end of the hall in
order to procure an important object, and during this time the substi-
tution is made; sometimes, also, to give himself more time, he pretends
to be eagerly looking jor something which he has not in reality let fall.
There is a trick during which pretended search a watch is wrapped in
paper and placed in a double-bottomed box. Better still, the substi-
tution can be made by confiding the object to an aid and then asking
him for it again. [or instance, it is a live bird with which we have
just concluded a trick; we give it over to the “servant,” telling him to
replace it in its cage, and then, as if on second thought, we say, ‘No;
hand me the bird; I wish to use it in a new trick.” The aid, who
has had his back turned for one moment, and, moreover, whose move-
ments no one thought of watching, has made the exchange. <A live bird
was given to him; he gives in its place a dead one, and afterwards the
spectators will be astonished to perceive the substitution, inasmuch as
they fully beleved that the bird had not been out of their sight.
Another example of substitution similar to the preceding one: An
object has been borrowed by the magician, which he wraps up under
the spectators’ eyes, and he wishes to replace it by a similar object—
that is to say, similar only in appearance, as it is one of his “trick”
objects which he has secretly placed in the crown of a hat. The pres-
tidigitator says simply: “I place the object in this hat; or, rather, I
will confide it to this person.” In saying the first words he rapidly
introduces the little object into the hat and takes out the one already
there. He does the act in a careless, negligent way, even avoiding
casting his eyes into the hat, and the consequence is that when he
changes his mind the spectators are not aware of the secret action.

In many tricks it is convenient to hide the hand at times behind a
screen or some other object. Should we wish to relieve ourselves of a
handkerchief, for instance, which we have in our hand, we draw near
an armchair and let the handkerchief fall behind it, without the aud1-
ence knowing that the chair has for a moment hidden the prestidigi-

tator’s hand and he has profited by it. The table which the artist uses
is of the greatest service to screen his hands. This table is nearly
always provided with a pocket and other contrivances on the side turned
from the audience, in which the objects he wishes to make disappear
fall without the sbghtest noise, and from which objects can be taken
without the knowledge of those looking on. The prestidigitator passes
his hand carelessly in making a gesture, and, without arresting the
movement behind the table, takes the object from the pocket or relieves
himself of it, as the trick requires. This process is so simple that it
suffices to mention 1t to have it understood; but one would never
suspect the services it can render. It is very easy when one has confi-
dence in one’s self to place the hand which holds the object unaffectedly
on the edge of the table; one has only to open the fingers slightly and
the object falls noiselessly into the pocket, and the trick is done. The
simpler the means the less suspicion it arouses.

There are even cases when we may conceal an object as large as
15 centimeters in diameter. This object, which is called a “bullet,”
is of black hard wood; 1t is hollow, and has in it a little hole just
large enough to pass the finger through. The bullet, which should
be tilled with all sorts of objects beforehand, should be surreptiti-
ously introduced into a hat borrowed from one of the audience, in order
that the prestidigitator may transform it into a horn of plenty. It is
not an easy matter to conceal the ball on account of its dimensions;
but the hat is used for the purpose of covering it and no one perceives
it. Behold how Robert Houdin describes this classical trick: ‘¢The hat
is held in the right hand with four fingers only, the middle being left
at liberty. The operator goes behind the table, at the same time talking
and gesticulating in such a way with the hand that holds the hat that
the hand becomes reversed and placed a little above the ball or bullet.
In this position the left arm is put forward on one pretext or another
to take something from the front of the table. In accordance with this
movement the body comes forward a little, and the right hand is lowered
to the level of the table; the middle finger is then inserted in the
bullet, raises it. and introduces it subtly into the hat.” Necessarily
the spectators can not suspect any of these maneuvers, which are made
under the hat and which are hidden from them. <A curious feature is
that the spectators do not perceive that the aperture of the hat has
been hidden for a moment, and the artist has profited by it to introduce
something into it. Another manner of concealing objects frequently
resorted to is in passing them from one hand to another. Should we
wish to introduce a box, a puppet—no matter what the object happens
to be—into a handkerchief just borrowed from one of the audience,
the handkerchief is held in the left hand, the object is held in the right,
and with a very natural gesture the handkerchief is passed into the
right hand, or the object in the same way placed in the left. The
gesture is so insignificant that it awakens no suspicion; and, on the
570 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION.

other hand, it is impossible for the spectator to see the trick, as the
hand remains constantly closed.

The magic wand is of great service in tricks of this kind, as the very
fact that the wand is in the hand is reason enough for the hand
remaining partly closed, and therefore making it possible to conceal
many objects in its palm. Moreover, the prestidigitator does not hold
the wand in his hand all the time; when it becomes necessary for
him to use both his hands in presenting an object to the view of the
spectators, he lays his magic stick on the table; a moment afterwards
he takes it up and raps with it as a signal that the illusion is about to
take place. These movements appear to have so little significance
that the spectators have not only neglected to look at them but they
dowt really perceive them. Nevertheless, they are decidedly impor-
tant. In placing the wand on the table the prestidigitator relieves
himself of the embarrassing object; taking up the wand, he possesses
himself of another object. The lookers-on have seen nothing and sus-
pect nothing.

LAE

The preceding analysis demonstrates how very difficult it is, even for
an intelligent observer, to see everything that takes place in front of
him. To see everything it is not only necessary to open the eyes wide,
for the human eye is not like the photographer’s plate, which reflects
without discernment all the details of the reality. The mental percep-
tion of objects is subjected to influences which cause certain objects
to be seen correctly, others not to be perceived, and still others
which do not exist are so vividly imagined that we believe we see
them. To complete our study we thought it would prove interesting
to have recourse to photography, which to-day is the natural, almost
indispensable, accompaniment of visual observation. Thanks to the
cooperation of Mr. Georges Demeny, Professor Marey’s clever assist-
ant, we have not been compelled to content ourselves with one or two
isolated examples. Mr. Demeny, with the aid of the new chronopho-
tographic apparatus willingly photographed several tricks of presti-
digitation. This apparatus, of which a description was given at the
Academy of Sciences, is capable of taking as many as thirty instan-
taneous photographs of one movement; each one of these photographs
is separated from the other by an equal space. The series of the
experiment gives at the same time the form of the phenomenon and
the length of time it occupies. It is well known that chronophotog-
raphy has found numerous applications in the domains of physical
and natural sciences. It is to photography we owe the analyzing of
many complex movements which, on account of their rapidity, escaped
the analysis of the eye, for instance, the flying of a bird, the differ-
ent gaits of the horse, the step of man while running or walking, and
in general, all physical exercises.

PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 571

Two artists, Messrs. Arnould and Raynaly, consented to execute
before the apparatus their very best tricks with cards and with juggling
balls. We thus photographed “le saut de coupe Vune main, et de deux
mains,” “le filage,” ‘le rayonnement,” ‘la carte & l’oil,” and also the
vanishing cage, nutmeg, egg, etc. Hach of these tricks, which occu-
pies about a second, often less, was detailed by a dozen photographs.
The egg trick, which takes exactly a second and a half, can be studied
in a series of fifteen photographs, each of which is as complete in every
detail as if the artist had sat for it alone.

On examining this photographic collection we are surprised at not
finding the illusion so forcible as when the trick is executed before
our eyes; in looking over, for example, the numerous pictures which
indicate the position of the hands in ‘un saut de coup,” we seize the
mechanism of this complicated operation, but we can not understand
how the illusion was produced. This series of photographs revealed
to Mr. Raynaly, who had executed the trick, a detail which he had not
perceived before. During “le saut de coupe,” which he performs in
about fifteen hundredths of a second, he places one of his hands in front
of the cards to screen them from view; but the whole trick is executed
with such rapidity that the spectator does not perceive this action,
and, what is still more curious, the artist himself was not aware of it.
The photographs of the artist juggling an egg has also curious results;
one can follow attentively the successive attitudes of his hands in pre-
tending to pass the egg from the right to the left. We have not for
one moment the impression that the exchange has actually been made.
Weare even surprised to see that the pretended movement resembles
the real movement only ata distance. Notin one of the pictures has the
hand the natural movement it should have in laying hold of an object;
the trick is done so rapidly that a gross imitation is sufficient to give
the illusion. If the photographic proof destroys so completely the
illusion, it is because it does away with all the adjuncts necessary for the
illusion which we have enumerated: The rapidity of the trick, the little
discourse given by the artist, the maneuvers which cause a diversion
or a diminution of attention, etc. Thanks to photography, we can
make a division between these elements of all perception which are so
often confounded the one with the other: Brute sensation and the inter- —
pretation of the mind.

A DISCOVERY OF GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN THE
MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.!

By WM. HENRY GOODYEAR.

Forty-four years have passed away since Francis Cranmer Penrose,
then an architect just beginning life, published, with the aid and coopera-
tion of the Dilettanti Society of London, his epoch-making work on the
Principles of Athenian Architecture. It was, therefore, in 1851 that
the world of science was first advised of a series of facts regarding the
construction of the Parthenon and other temples of the Greeks which
are still a perpetual source of wonder and of speculation to the special-
ist, to whose knowledge even the existence of these facts is still very
closely confined.

The observations and measurements of Penrose were undertaken in
1845, and were completed in 1846 and 1847. Up to those years the
Greek temple was supposed to be what to the superficial observer it
appears to be. Its horizontal lines were supposed to be level and were
consequently supposed to be straight; its vertical lines were supposed
to be perpendicular; its corresponding and apparently equal dimensions
were supposed to be equal, and its corresponding spaces and distances
were supposed to be commensurate. ‘To discover an exact Iathematical
ratio in its main proportions was the constant effort of the archeologist.
The mathematical ratios had not been discovered exactly; but this was
thought to be the fault of the modern and not the fault of the Greek.

On a sudden the measuring rod of Penrose revealed that no two
neighboring capitals or abaci of the Parthenon are of corresponding
size, that the diameters of the columns are unequal, that the inter-
columnar spacings are irregular, and that the metope spaces are of
irregular width. His plumb line showed that none of the apparently
vertical lines are really perpendicular. The columns alli lean toward
the center of the building. The side walls also lean to the center.
The pilasters or ant at the angles of the building lean forward. The
architrave and frieze lean backward and away from the imaginary
perpendicular. The cornice and the fillet between the frieze and archi-
trave, as well as the acroteria and antefixe, have their faces inclined
forward of the imaginary perpendicular. Finally, the main horizontal

lines of the building are constructed in curves which rise in vertical
plines to the center of each side, but these curves do not form parallels.

Three main facts appear throughout all these various phenomena:
First, an unquestionable purpose and intention, whatever the purpose
and intention may have been; second, an avoidance of all exact ratios
in proportions, of all exact correspondences in the presumably equal
objects, sizes, and spaces, and of all mathematically straight, mathe-
matically perpendicular, and mathematically parallel lines; third, an
avoidance of all such irregularities as are easily detected, or as are
obtrusively conspicuous to the eye. i

As regards the curves, they are inconspicuous to the eye unless
sighted for from some one angle of the building and along the line of
the steps, or of the exterior line of the stylobate (the platform on which
the temple rests). As viewed even from such an angle, they are so deli-
cate as not to be obtrusively conspicuous. As seen from other points
of view, especially opposite the center of the ends or sides of the build-
ing, they may be detected by close observation, but there is no point of
view from which the eye is not naturally disposed to discount the effect
as one of perspective. As there are no straight lines, but only delicate
curves when straight lines are viewed in perspective, it is natural for
the eye to discount the effect of a delicate curve; for this is what the
eye constantly does when the actually straight line is curved by nat-
ural perspective. As regards the appearance of inclination in the col-
umns, we have the testimony of Mr. Penrose that he was months in
Athens before he could determine by the eye without plumbing which
way a given column jeans, and this fact will describe the delicacy of
other deviations from the perpendicular.

As regards the variations in size of presumably equal objects, or of
spacing in presumably equal distances, it may be said that noneof them
san be definitely asserted to exist on purely ocular testimony, and that
the surveyor’s work is necessary not only to determine their amount,
but even to determine their existenee. Here again the difficulty in
definite ocular detection depends on the fact that all objects of exactly
corresponding size vary in apparent size according to the point of
sight. Hence, when an element of delicate irregularity of size or
spacing is artificially produced it is impossible for the eye to avoid
discounting this irregularity into perspective effect. Let it be noted
here that I do not use the words “ perspective effect” as necessarily
implying an inerease in effect of magnitude. If a Parthenon capital
nearer to the eye be smaller than one next to it, and farther away
from the eye, the effect in so far would be to diminish apparent distance
between the two capitals, but this would still be an illusive effect of
perspective appearance, because the ordinary effects of perspective
would prevent the eye from appreciating an exact equality of size if it
had existed. Then, again, if a spectator be facing two unequal adja-
cent capitals at exactly equal distances from each, in which case they

would naturally appear equal, the difference of size indicates to the
eye a deflection in the line of the building, or, in other words, the
spectator appears, in so far, to be nearer to the large capital than he is

to the smaller one.
i;

We will now specify some of the maximum cases of irregularity
according to the measurements of Penrose, which are given in feet and
decimals of a foot. The curve of the Parthenon entablature on the
flanks, about 228 feet in length, is 0.507 (decimals of a foot). At the
sides of the building it is 0.171 in something over 100 feet. (The flattest
curve in Greek art is the entasis of the Erechtheium columns, which is
0.0195 in 21 feet.) The Parthenon columns lean 0.228 in 30 feet, an
inclination of one unit in 150 units. In other words, as the columns
lean to the center of the building they would, if sufficiently prolonged
in height, meet at a height of 5,856 feet above the level of the pavement.
The ante have a forward Teun of 1 unit in 82, and the acroteria and
the antefixie have a forward lean of 1 in-25. A maximum devia-
tion in spacings of the metopes is 0.325; the measurements of these
spaces being 4 feet andover. The maximum deviation in intercolumnar
Spacings is over 2 feet, but this amount of deviation is only found at
the angles where the columns next the corner are that much nearer the
corner. At these points the spacings narrow from 8 feet and a decimal
to 6 feet and a decimal. Aside from the angle columns the maximum
intercolumnar deviation on the north flank is 0.186, in measurements
which are all over 8 feet with decimal variations. A maximum devia-
tion in the diameters of columns (of corresponding lines and sizes) is
0.23 in measurements giving diameters of 5 feet and a decimal. A max-
imum deviation in size of the capitals is 0.312 in measurements of 6 feet
and a decimal.

These instances will give an idea of the amount of actual irregulari-
ties according to actual measurement, and we will add that instances of
two adjacent measurements being equal are almost absolutely unknown.
We can occasionally trace some scheme in the variations by comparing
two halves of one end, or one side of the building, but when such a
scheme appears it does not repeat itself in any two different series of
measurements on one side or one end of the building. For instance,
in the metopes of the east front the spaces widen from the angles
toward the center, but this does not hold of the intercolumnar spacings,
where the only perceptible scheme is that which makes the corner
intercolumniations narrower by 2 feet and a fraction.

That all these remarkable deflections and irregularities were ineended
has been proven by masonry measurements and masonry observations.
Penrose places the maximum deviation, due to error or carelessness in
the Parthenon masonry, at one-fiftieth of an inch. The two ends of the
building are of equal width within that fraction. The difference of 0.02
(inch decimal) in 101 feet points out “the degree of error which may
576 GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.

have arisen from inaccuracy of workmanship in the Parthenon.” To
quote his own words again: “In the measurement of modern or even
Roman buildings an attempt to obtain the original measurements of con-
siderable distances to the thousandth part of a foot would be fallacious,
but in a building of the best Greek workmanship it can be done satis-
factorily if proper care be taken to select such measurements as have
been least exposed to the action of the weather, for, owing to the perfect
jointing of the stones, the errors occasioned by any small shifts, which
may have arisen from earthquakes or the violence of human agency,
ean be corrected most satisfactorily.” To illustrate the refinement of
masonry jointing he mentions the observation of Stuart that the stones
of the steps under the columns of the Parthenon have actually grown
together. ‘On breaking off parts of two stones at the joint he found
them as firmly united as though they had never been separate.” This
is explained as due to molecular attraction of two surfaces ground
together to a very smooth finish, on the principal which explains why
two panes of glass may adhere to one another. For an account of the
methods by which this wonderfully fine fitting and jointing were
obtained, the work I am quoting must be consulted.

i

Although the ultimate topic of this paper is the discovery of Greek
horizontal curves in the Maison Carrée at Nimes, which I made in
1591, I have considered it necessary not only to include an account
of the existence of the Greek curves themselves, but also a rather
explicit mention of all the irregularities connected with them; not only
because incommensurate intercolumnar spacings and leaning faces and
members are included in my observations at Nimes, but also because
the existence of the Greek horizontal curves is one of a series of facts
whose startling significance and importance can not be wholly grasped
until all of them are made known. This point again reacts on the
importance of all observations which tend to supplement or accent cer-
tain explanations of any one set of these phenomena as against some
certain other explanation. It will presently appear that my discovery
at Nimes has the result of agitating the still undetermined purpose or
purposes of the Greek optical refinements in masonry, and that it tends
to minimize the importance of the explanations offered by Penrose in
favor of those which have been offered by certain other students. It
also, as we Shall see, throws a strong side light on the probable Egyp-
tian origin of the Greek curves, and thereby again tends to throw new
light on their purpose on account of certain peculiar features of the
Egyptain examples.

_ We will, therefore, draw nearer to my ultimate aim by degrees, and
by considering in the next place the history of the discovery of the
Greek horizontal curves, whose confirmation and detailed demonstra-
tion if was the great mission of Penrose to accomplish.

The measurement of the horizontal curves was the greatest achieve-
ment of Penrose, but their existence was not his discovery, as many
of the facts were which I have just enumerated. In all cases it is the
measurements of Penrose which have established the facts as not being
accidental and as being in masonry construction; but the observation
which discovered the curves was made in 1837 by Mr. John Penne-
thorne, and in the same year and about the same time the curves of the
Parthenon were noticed by two German architects, Hofer and Schau-
bert. These gentlemen were the first to publish the discovery in 1838.
This publication appeared in a Viennese architectural journal, the
Weiner Bauzeitung.

What is the peculiar constitution of the modern eye which had over-
looked the existence of these curves till 1837? What is the peculiar
constitution of the modern reader who had anxiously been conning his
Vitruvius since 1500 without considering the passage in which this
Roman author directs the construction of these curves? Why is it that
when Wilkins made his excellent translation of Vitruvius in 1812 he
added a footnote to the passage on the curves to say that “this great
refinement suggested by physical knowledge does not appear to have
entered into the execution of the works of the ancients”? Why is it
that Wilkins did not do in 1812 what Pennethorne did in 1837—that is,
test the author by the buildings?

Here at least are the facts. It is forty-four years only that the world

of science has had the proper ‘measurements of the Greek temples.
Stuart and Revett had measured the whole Parthenon as far back as
1756. Lord Elgin and his workmen had had their scaffolds on it in the
early nineteenth century, and yet the curves had not been seen. It was
not even known until 1810 that the Greek columns had an entasis.
This was the discovery of Cokerell, but he did not notice that ail lines
of the entire building exhibited a similar refinement. Donaldson dis-
covered in 1829 the lean of the columns, but it was left for Penrose to
discover the inward lean of the door jambs and forward lean of the
ante and the inclined faces of the entablature.

Let us, then, emphasize for a moment the discovery of Pennethorne as
leading to all the later ones, and crowning all the eartier ones, and let
us relate the way in which hemadeit. Mr. John Pennethorne, who was
then a young architect, had first visited Athens in 1832, and he did not
then make this discovery. In 1833 he made a trip to Egypt and was
astounded to find in the Theban temple of Medinet Habou a series of
convex curves 1n the architraves of the second court. On his return
from Egypt he visited Athens a second time in 1835, again without
observing the existence of the curves in Athens. Itappears that after
his second return to England the passage in Vitruvius attracted his
attention. He says that he saw no reason-to doubt the implications of
the passage in Vitruvius, and thus was lead to make a third visit to
Athens and reexamine the Parthenon. Thus was the discovery made.

SM 94——37

It should no doubt be added that the long sides of the Parthenon have
lost the main central portions of their entablatures by the gunpowder
explosion of the seventeenth century, and that consequently the curves
can not be studied here. At the ends of the building, which are shorter,
it is not so easy to notice the curve of the entablature. The most
favorable location for the observation is on the long sides of the stylo-
bate. Here, then, is the place to point out that this platform of the
temple and also the temple steps had been covered by rubbish down to
1837, and that observations of the curves on their lines had been previ-
ously impossible in the Parthenon. But we may also point out that
the Theseum at Athens has its long sides and upper entablatures intact.
Here at Jeast the curves might have been noticed before 1837. The
curves have since been noticed in a number of other ruins which had
been visited by students and measured before 1837. The laying bare
of the stylobate of the Parthenon in 1837 assisted the discovery of
Pennethorne, but it does not explain why some other student had not
previously made the observation for the Theseum and for numerous
other temples.

The reader will notice that | am working gradually toward an expla-
nation of the fact that the curves of the Maison Carrée, in southern
France, were not noticed as being in construction until 1891. We have
a parallel fact for the Athenian temples. Those buildings had been
studied and carefully measured for a period of over eighty years before
their curves were noticed. In 1756 were begun the measurements of
Stuart and Revett; in 1837 were made the observations of Pennethorne
and Hofer.

What, then, is the explanation for the oversight of these phenomena
in either case? Clearly there are two. The modern eye is dull and
blunted as compared with the eye of the Greek. People look, but they
do not see. But, above all, the effect is discounted by theeye. What-
ever may have been the purpose of the Greek curves, there are only two
possible effects. From certain points of view (it may be from all points
of view) a perspective enlargement—from other points of view an
optical mystification, if not a perspective enlargement.

We will illustrate the direct perspective effect of enlargement by
assuming a point of view opposite the center of one of the sides or of one
of the ends of the building. From sucha point of view the lines will fall
in perspective on either side, and as their change of direction is purely an
optical effect, in which each point of the line changes position according
to its distance from the eye, it follows that this line must be a curve down-
ward in each direction away from the center. On this head we can
have only one opinion from all experts in curvilinear perspective.

We will illustrate the optical mystification by assuming a standpoint
opposite one of the angles of the building. I will not assert absolutely
that there is a perspective increment from this position. It is my opin-
ion that the already recognized principles of curvilinear perspective

may involve this position, but it would be a position so far not familiar
to experts, and I prefer not to debate it here. I will, however, most
positively assert that from the given point of view one of two results
must follow, either a direct perspective increment, or else an optical
mystification owing to the contradictory optical effects of two sets of
phenomena—one of which effects is artificial, wbile the other effect is
natural.

For our present purpose it makes no difference whether optical
mystification or perspective increment, or both, are the results of the
Greek horizontal curves. My present argument is simply to the end
that in either case the effect is discounted by the eye. The cause is
therefore not perceived.

We may therefore assign three causes for the long failure of the
modern eye to detect the Greek horizontal curves: First, inferior
sharpness of vision and inattention to art forms. It is admitted that
Greek art and Greek taste were superior to our own. This amounts to
admitting that the Greek eye was more acute and more highly trained.
Second, the effects of the curves, whether they be perspective effects
or simply mystifications, or both, tend to prevent the detection of the
underlying facts and causes. Third, the curves are so delicate as not
to be obtrusive to the eye under any circumstances.

We are prepared therefore to understand why the curves of the
Maison Carrée have not been noticed sooner.

I have so far carefully avoided making any reference to the purpose
of the Greek curves. I have only asserted that they have certain
results, without debating the question whether these results were
intended. It will now bring us nearer to our ultimate topic and aim
if | announce my own observations for horizontal curves in Egyptian
temples and connect them with those of Mr. Pennethorne, which I
have mentioned for the Theban temple of Medinet Habou.

TET:

It is, then, a fact to be once more noted that the discovery of curves
in Greek temple construction was preceded by a discovery of curves in
Egyptian temple construction and that the same person made both
discoveries. It is also a fact to be noted that the curves of the Greek
temples (as so far discussed) are curves in elevation, curves in the
direction of the altitude, while the curves at Medinet Habou are curves
in plane, convex to the line of vision. They are curves lying in hori-
zontal planes as distinct from curves lying in vertical planes. It would
appear reasonable, considering the growing conviction of scholars that
Egyptian art and culture had in many important ways influenced the
Greeks, that any theory as to the purpose of the Greek curves should
be a theory which would also include Egyptian curves in its explana-
tion, but this has not been the case, strange to say. The reasons for
this are not only curious but they are also important to our argument,

Mr. Pennethorne’s discovery of the curves at Athens was not imme-
diately published by him, aside from a pamphlet printed for private
distribution, nor was it published by him for many years. His own
publication was delayed until 1878, twenty-seven years after the publi-
sation of Penrose, and forty-one years after his own discovery. ‘This
delay appears to have been owing to lack of encouragement in his
special studies and to the abandonment for many years of his chosen
‘vareer. He tells us that he took up the pursuit of agriculture soon
after his return to England. Most curious of all, he did not know until
1860 that the curves which he first discovered had been measured by
Penrose in 1846. It was not till 1860 that the work of Penrose pub-
lished in 1851 came to his knowledge. It was not until 1878 that he
announced the curves at Medinet Habou, and meantime all the theories
so far made known as to the curves of the Parthenon had made their
appearance and had been advanced without this important knowledge.
Not only that; when Mr. Pennethorne did publish, it was in a book on
The Opties and Geometry of Ancient Architecture, which costs a large
sum ($35), and which, being a specialist book devoted to Greek arechi-
tecture, has apparently so far not come to the notice of one single
Egyptologist. There is not a single book, guidebook or any book oth-
erwise known to me, which relates to Egypt which mentions the curves
at Medinet Habou. I have never met an Egyptologist who knew of
their existence, and it appears to have been reserved for me to make
the first observations and measurements for curves in three courts—at
Luxor, in the great court at Karnak, and in the court at Edfou.

Mr. Pennethorne tells us in 1878 that he did not, when in Egypt, give
the further attention to the subject and attach the importance to it
which it deserved, but the temple at Ediou where I have observed the
curves was not cleared out till twenty-seven years after Pennethorne
was in Egypt. Down to 1860 this temple was covered by an Egyptian
village. The courts of Luxor were not cleared out till 1891, the year
when I was in Egypt, and no one could have previously made measure-
ments there. As for the court of Karnak, it is still buried in rubbish
and observations can only be made in an imperfect, but I think
convineing, way on the lines of the architrave.

It is, however, a most significant thing that the curves at Medinet
Habou are generally unknown in 1895 to the world of science and of
travel. They amount on the short side of the court to 8 inches deflec-
tion in the architrave in a length of 80 feet 9 inches, and, on the long
side, to 44 inches in a length of 104 feet 9 inches. They can be sighted
on the roofs of the portico with the greatest ease and are most posi-
tively wholly constructive and not accidental, as already shown by
Pennethorne. And yet Iam acquainted with at least one very sharp-
sighted architectural expert who has been in this court without noting
the curves and I am acquainted with many travelers who have not
noticed them. Is it not, then, clear that all these persons have dis-
counted the effect of the curve? What this effect is for standpoints

nearly opposite the center of any one side for that given side is indi-
cated. by one of Mr. John W. MeKecknie’s drawings herewith. This
gentleman is an expert and instructor in perspective and the reader may
be assured that there are no uncertain theories whatever involved in
this picture. Remember, we are not debating whether the Egyptian
architect intended this effect. Weare not even debating at this moment
whether the construction is accidental. We are concerned with the
actual optical effect of the given phenomenon. All architectural lines
which are curved in horizontal planes, convex to the position of the
spectators, produce the effect of curves in elevation, as shown by the
diagram. At an angle of 45 degrees, 8 inches curve in plan gives an
effect of 8 inches curve in elevation. Inside the angle of 45 degrees,
the apparent height increases rapidly and is something enormous on
near approach, according to the dictum of another expert in perspec-
tive. In order to relate our text to the diagram we are speaking of
points of vision opposite or nearly opposite the center of any one side
of the court. In such a position the natural downward direction of the
architrave in perspective is exaggerated by two causes—first, there is
the exaggeration in height at the center; second, the receding line of
the convex curve gives the effect of an extra downward bend to the line,
as shown by the bird’s-eye view.

There is a similar result from other points of view, possibly compli-
cated by optical mystifications due to the contradiction between effects
of natural perspecture and the effects of artificial arrangement. The
grand fact remains that a convex curve of 8 inches in 84 feet in the
architraves at Medinet Habou has passed wholly unnoticed by an enor-
mous number of modern travelers, and that it is wholly unknown to
Egyptologists as far as Lam aware. I should be able to name several
such, and the absence of literary mention in books on Egypt, which are
generally so quick to point to connections with Greece where they are
obvious, is something phenomenal. I will not say at present that the
Egyptian builder intended an optical illusion, but I will definitely say
that he did produce one. Certainly not one man can gainsay me who
has been in this court without pe: ceiving the curves, and among those
men is the leading perspective expert of this country.

EV:

All these explanations seem to me of value as helping us to under-
stand why the convex curves in the architraves of the Maison Carrée
at Nimes were not measured or noticed as in construction till the year
1891, when I had the pleasure of making this discovery. We under-
stand, for instance, that scholars had studied and measured the Par-
thenon for all the years between 1756 and 1837 before its curves were
noticed, and we understand that the existence of curves in plan in
ancient architecture had been wholly overlooked, as distinct from the
existence of curves in elevation.

No doubt an occasional student or observer has noticed these curves
582 GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.

in the Maison Carrée and set them down to the score of masonry dis-
placement, a fact so common in old buildings that the first thought of
every architect and builder would naturally be that the timbers of the
roof had thrust out the cornice and that the curve was not in the
original construction. This is why I took pains to arm myself, when at
Nimes, with certificates from the official architect of the city and from
his predecessor in office, the latter being especially familiar with the
roof and upper masonry of the Maison Carrée, to the effect that these
curves are in the masonry construction, although these gentlemen had
not previously observed the fact.
Herewith are the certificates:

“The undersigned, Engene Chambaud, ex-architect of the city of
Nimes, after examining the curved lines of the Maison Carrée with Mr.
Goodyear, has verified the existence of these curves as being in the said
construction, with the proviso that the curve on the east flank has been
exaggerated by a thrust of the roof timbers, but also verifying the fact
that there has also been a curve on this side in the original construction,
considering that the line of bases in the engaged columns is curved on
this side as it is on the other, and that there has been no thrust here;
considering also that the movement (owing to thrust) 1s far from hav-
ing been sufficiently great to produce the curve of the cornice. He con-
siders the theories of Mr. Goodyear regarding the perspective effects of
the curves as a reasonable one, and remarks that the theory regarding
the perspective effect of a convex curve is new but possible. “He has
observed with him that the variations of intercolumnar spacing on three
sides of the monument would undoubtedly have a perspective eftect,
according to Mr. Goodyear’s ideas. The joints of the cornice on the
west side where there is a curve of 114 centimeters, as measured by Mr.
Goodyear, are intact with one exception, which is not important for the
question of the curve. ‘EK, CHAMBAUD.

‘“NimEs, February 23, 1891.”
“FEBRUARY 20, 1891.

‘The measures herewith have been taken with the assistance of Mr.
Augiére, architect of the city of Nimes. He witnesses to having
observed the curves with Mr. Goodyear, and he verifies the fact that
there has been no thrust in the cornice of the west flank. As professor
of perspective he wishes to say that he considers the theory of Mr.
Goodyear regarding the perspective effect of a convex curve in plan
new but reasonable. As to the effect of a concave curve in plan it is
familiar to experts in perspective. “A, AUGIERE.”

I must add that on one side of the Maison Carrée the curve has been
exaggerated by a subsequent movement of the masonry, and that on
this account I confined myself in measurements for the cornice to that
side where the masonry is in thoroughly good condition. For measur-
ing the cornice curve I employed tin roofers, who sealed the building
by ropes and dropped a plumb line to the pavement below. The curves
of the cornice, wholly due to masonry construction, are in horizontal
planes convex to the position of the spectator, and measure about 5
inches.

I also made measurements on the line of the stylobate which show
slight corresponding curves in the line of the temple wall, and of its
engaged columns along the plinth line. I have no hesitation in saying
thet even on the line of bases of the engaged columns resting on the
stylobate there are slight convex curves in both temple walls on the long
sides. It is also certain that the great increase of the curve above was
obtained by leaning out the walls and engaged columns at the center.

It now remains to say what is the importance of this observation on
the Maison Carrée: First, it overthrows the presumption of scholars
that the Greek curves were unknown to the time of the Roman Empire,
whose taste has been so far considered too coarse for this refinement.
This observation, therefore, carries the history of the Greek curves from
the time of the fifth century before
Christ, down to the time of the
second century after Christ. It ti ae
extends the life of this Greek re-
finement seven centuries later than

as previously known. Second, it Se
reopens the question as to the pur- =
pose of the Greek curves. The
explanations which have been pre-
supplemented to some extent, be-
cause the explanations previously

the curves of the upper lines were
intended to accent and exaggerate the effects of curvilinear perspec-
tive and thus give increased dimensions to the building when seen from
a point of view facing the center of either side, but he also considered
them as giving life and beauty to the building, and as superior to the
more monotonous and colder effects of mathematically straight lines.
This latter view is the one which has mainly figured in the standard
compendiums of the Germans; for instance, in those of Kugler, of
Schnaase, and of Jacob Burckhardt. It has not been abandoned by
the publication of Thiersch,! whose essay is the only contribution to the
optical and mathematical questions involved, aside from those of Pen-

rose and Pennetborne. Thiersch, however, in the main accents and
develops the point of view of Penrose. The views of the latter as to the
theory of the curves have naturally been most familiar to English and
American students, and as his measurements are our only authority for
the facts, his theories have naturally been generally accepted by his
English and American readers. The explanation of Penrose moves
from the accepted fact that there is a tendency to optical downward
deflection in the straight line of an entablature below the angle of a
gable or pediment. It is his theory that these lines of the entablature
were accordingly curved upward in order to counteract this defection.
As to the curves of the flanks, Penrose regards them as a consequence
incident originally on the methods pursued for the entablatures under
the pediments, and then adds:

‘‘We may attribute the use of this refinement to the feeling of a

greater appearance of strength imparted by it, to the appreciation of
beauty inherent in a curved line and to the experience of a want of

harmony between the convex stylobates and architraves of the front
and the straight lines used in the flanks of the earliest temples. And
further, if we may suppose the first examples of its applic: ation on the
flanks to have occurred in situations like those in which the two
temples above mentioned (viz: the Parthenon and Olympian Jupiter
Temple) are built, the presence of a delicate, but not inappreciable
curve in what may be considered as Nature’s great and only horizon-
tal line may possibly have combined with other causes to have sug-
gested its use.”!

Although Penrose is distinctly of the view. that the hardness and
dryness of modern copies of Greek architecture are due to the absence
of these refinements, his effort is in each case of the various refinements
quoted at the opening of this paper to look for an optical correction as
distinet from an optical illusion; and yet for the most important curves
of all, viz, those of the long sides of the temple, he does not even sug-
gest that an optical correction was needed.

We come finally to the views of Boutmy, Philosophie de l Architec-
ture en Gréce, 1870, who returns to and revives the idea of Hoffer of a
perspective illusion, but still confining his explanation to an effect from
one point of view, viz, that opposite to the center of the sides or ends
of a temple.

Now, the importance of the observation of curves in the Maison
Carrée is that they were not applied to the pediments at all, but exclu-
sively to the sides. The theory of an optical correction is therefore
‘insufficient, and the theory of a perspective illusion appears to be the
only one left us; but this theory has never previously been announced
as an explanation for the construction of curves in plan convex to the
point of vision. It is, however, clear that all curves in plan convex to
the line of vision produce an effect of curves in elevation. I am indebted
to Prof. William R. Ware, of Columbia poleee) for the information that

THE MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.
From a photograph taken for the author to show the curve of the cornice.
GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES. 585

at an angle of 45 degrees a curve of 5 inches in plan, when not perceived
by the eye, will produce an effect of 5 inches curve in elevation. From
all points of view further removed the effect will be less, but the build-
ers of the Maison Carrée and of the second court of Medinet Habou
seem to have purposed to make this good by making the curves corre-
spondingly heavier to begin with.

In the Parthenon the curve is under 4 inches in 228 feet. At Med1-
net Habou the heaviest curve 1s 8 inches m less than 100 feet, and at
Nimes it is nearly 5 inches in about 100 feet.

To the above points we must now add the general revision in the atti-
tude of archeology to the question of curves in ancient architecture,
which is probably involved in my observations for curves in plan in the
courts at Karnak, at Luxor and at Edfou. The conservatism and habits
of repetition in Egyptian art would under any circumstances make it

highly improbable that the curves in Egyptian architecture were con-
fined to the one temple of Medinet Habou, but we have seen that,
owing to the late announcement by Pennethorne (1878) and the general
oversight by Egyptologists of this announcement, their existence even
here is still generally unknown to science. <A few words, then, as to
my own observations in Egypt. My trip here was made in the interest
of other studies and the subject of lotus ornament and its influence on
Greek patterns. My measurements and observations were consequently
hurried and imperfect. Still, here are the facts. Although the great
court at Karnak is so filled with rubbish that one can climb in several
places to the top of the architraves, Iam able to announce, as far as
these architraves are concerned, that curves convex to the court are
visible. At Luxor the columns of the largest court on two sides have
leaned forward so far as to threaten downfall and have been shored up
586 GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.

accordingly by beams during and since the excavations not quite com-
pleted in 1891. Measurements taken by me in all three courts at Luxor
show curves in all lines of columns at the bases, all convex to the cen-
ters of the courts, varying from 14 to 7 inches. It is clear at Medinet
Habou that the lower curves in the lines of the basis and in the lines
of columns near the bases were comparatively slight and that the curve
was obtained in the architrave and cornice (as it was at Nimes) by
leaning forward the center columns. This would explain the movement
of the masonry which has required the columns at Luxor to be shored
up by timbers.

All earthquakes and other forces tending to disintegrate these build-
ings, such as pulling down and destroying the accessible parts of the
temple, would tend to exaggerate the lean of the center columns and
bring about the threatened downfall now imminent at Luxor. My
observations at Edfou point the same way. On all four sides of the

court I have measured curves in the line of the bases of 14 inches on
each side of the court. Very heavy curves—of 10 inches in one case—
appear in the cornice lines, but the cornices have moved forward and
the original lean of the center columns has been exaggerated by acci-
dental tipping. The joints of the columns have parted at the rear, and
it will require careful examination and survey at Edfou to show how
much of the upper curve is due to movement of the masonry and
how much is due to construction. One main fact remains to be men-
tioned for Egyptian temples. Although their curves have so far been
utterly ignored and neglected, excepting by Pennethorne and myself,!
the existence of other perspective illusions is admitted for Egyptian
temples by Egyptological experts.

It is noted by a number of authors that the temples were generally
built with pavements rising toward the sanctuary and with roofs grad-

'T must make an exception for Prof. Allan Marquand, of Princeton, who has briefly
noticed in the American Journal-of Archeology the discovery of Pennethorne at

ually lowered in the same direction, and that this was done for per-
spective illusion. Maspero is one of the authorities who mentions this.
Mentions are also made of this by Rawlinson and by Prof. Reginald
Stuart Poole.

Vv.

Although these various observations point to a perspective purpose
in the Egyptian and Greek curves, I do not wish to appear to antagonize
the view that optical refinements were used in Greek architecture to
correct optical illusions, for I believe that they may have been so used;
but I wish to point out that the theories which are confined to correc-
tion are insufficient to meet all the facts, and that the theories which
have considered the creation of optical illusions to have been one
purpose of the refinements are now materially strengthened.

The existence of a temple at Nimes having curves on the flanks
without having them in the entablature of the pediments tends to
antagonize the view of Penrose that the correction of a downward
optical deflection below the pediment was the first cause of the intro-
duction of the curves in Greek architecture. The temple of Neptune
at Paestum is quoted by Penrose, in support of his view, as having
only curves under the pediments, but strange to say, this temple at
Paestum has been subsequently announced by Jacob Burckhardt to
have convex curves on its flanks in horizontal planes.' This observa-
tion is also quoted by Thiersch. Thus I close my paper by pointing
out that we have at Paestum one ancient Greek precedent for the
curves in plan at Nimes, and that both point to Egyptian influence.
The city of Nimes was settled by a colony of Alexandrian Greeks from
Egypt. It appears therefore probable that the curves in Greece were
derived from Egypt and had the same purpose, but that the curves in
the Egyptian courts were generally changed to curves in vertical planes
by Greek art. This was a more refined expedient for attaining the
same end, less conspicuous in buildings using colonnades for exterior
porticoes as distinct from buildings using colonnades for the interiors
of courts. It is comparatively easy to sight for a bulging curve on the
exterior of a building, but more difficult to sight for it in the interior
of a court. I was not able, for instance, to sight for the curve at
Medinet Habou without going on the roof of the portico, but at Nimes
I was able instantly to sight for the bulge on the long sides from the
level of the street. These facts, therefore, coincide with the view that
the general purpose of the curves in Greek art was connected with the
wish to have them inconspicuous, and that the curves at Nimes repre-
sent either a direct influence from Egypt or the coarser taste of the
Roman period. On the other hand, the flank curves of the Neptune
temple of Paestum, which is a very early Greek building, will represent
the period of direct Egyptian transmission to Greece.

1 Der Cicerone.
588 GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES.

It is generally conceded that Vitruvius drew his matter from earlier
Greek authors whose works have perished, and that he did not always
fully comprehend the ideas of his sources. I have omitted any argu-
ment concerning his direction that the stylobate curves are to prevent
an effect of ‘“alveolation” (i. e., downward deflection) at the center of
the stylobate. The only modern author who has attempted to explain
this direction by optical theories is Thiersch. This author gives his
reasons for supposing that a spectator standing near an angle of the
stylobate and below the level of its platform might experience an
optical effect of downward deflection in the lines of the stylobate which
an upward curve would correet, but inasmuch as a bulging curve in
plan could not correct this effect for the standpoint near the angle, I
have not considered his theory in this paper, and I only mention it as
giving one more illustration of the new light thrown on the Greek
refinements by the discovery of curves in horizontal planes. There are
very valuable remarks in Boutmy’s work as to the general unreliability
of Vitruvius for a comprehension of the Greek curves, and one purpose
of this paper is to accent the value of Boutmy’s contribution to the
philosophy of Greek architecture. His work also contains quotations
from Greek authors on the optics of architecture, showing that inten-
tional optical illusions and intentional optical corrections were alike
familiar to them.

There is one thing more to be said before I close. The credit for the
original suggestion that there is a historic connection between the
Greek curves and those of Medinet Habou belongs to Mr. Pennethorne,
as does the credit for both discoveries. The wholly original part of
this paper as regards historie facts is that which points to the fact that
two classic buildings—one early Greek at Paestum and one late Roman
at Nimes—show convex curves in plan which are identical in character
with the curves in Egypt. The wholly original part of this paper as
regards observations is that which relates to Nimes, Karnak, Luxor,
and Edfou. The wholly original part of this paper as regards the
effect of the Greek horizontal curves is that which shows the optical
results in actual historic buildings of convex curves in horizontal
planes. Iam willing to leave the question of purpose to the expert
and to the general reader.

THE METHODS OF ARCH HOLOGICAL RESEARCH.!

By sir HENRY HoOwoRTH, KOC. 1B: D.C.L., MP. E.R.S., B.S. A.

I should forfeit your good opinion of me if I did not confess to feeling
embarrassed by the position in which, by your favor, I find myself. The
honor and distinction of fillmg a chair which has been occupied by so
many better men than myself is qualified with every doubt and diffi-
culty. When I look round this room I see before me not only those
elfted with greater knowledge than I possess, but who have had greater
opportunities, and have not had the work which they love continually
interfered with by manifold cares and duties. You will accept this as
my apology for the disinterested and elementary remarks which I shall
impose upon you.

In selecting a subject on which to address you I have felt it would
not be profitable or interesting to merely index the progress of arche-
ology during the last twelve months, nor to condense the county his-
tory of Shropshire into a necessarily dry and compressed guide to local
antiquities which you must know better than I can know. I have
thought it more profitable to devote a little time to considering some of
the methods of archeological research, as they have been enlarged and
developed in late years, and to condensing some of the more general
conclusions that have been reached, and more especially to illustrate
them from my own desultory studies.

The Archeological Institute has always been a most catholic mother.
In her ample Jap she has welcomed every kind of fruit which the
cornucopia of research has poured out to illustrate the drama of human
life. Her aim and object have been, as far as possible, to give a picture
of the sometimes gay and sometimes gloomy procession which our race
has formed as it has tramped along the avenues of time from the land
of mist and cloud to the land of darkness. Every fact, however recorded,
whether preserved in words or graven in the universal language
with which the ruins of art are enshrined, has been welcome. It has
taught the lesson that history means something more than philosophy
teaching by examples; it means painting the pictures of the past, and
piecing together the broken pieces which have escaped its heavy foot

into a mosaic, in which we may see how our fathers lived, as well as
what their aims and ideals were; how far they had progressed in mak-
ing life tolerable and decorating 1t with sunshine, as well as unriddling
the meaning of the terribly tragic chapters in which we read how
mighty empires, in which greatness and glory were combined, and in
which prosperity seemed anchored as firmly as one of the brave oaks
of your own country, were leveled to the ground, their people slaugh-
tered and destroyed, their palaces and temples reduced to dust, and
their fertile fields once more occupied by the pelican and the jackal.
It was once the custom to despise some of these lessons. The antiquary
was a connoisseur, whose studies were dominated by taste and not by
knowledge. To admire, to study, and to review the masterpieces of
Greek art; to do the same with the masterpieces of the Italian renais-
sanece—these were his aims, Phidias and Michael Angelo his ideals. It
was only when the tide was flowing highest that it was deemed _ profit-
able to study it. Hence why the collection and the museums gathered
in former centuries are so wanting in historic value. They represent
the phases of taste as applied to the acts of other days, and the various
measures and standards which this change of taste has created, some-
times inspired by nature alone, and sometimes by nature bewigged and
bepowdered, We have advanced from this position, We have learned
that the ebb as well as the flow of the tide is of supreme interest to us,
perhaps of even more interest. Hence, while we admire and rejoice in
some masterpiece like the Hermes of Praxiteles, we are constrained to
devote a corresponding study to the rude bas-reliefs from the temples
of Copan, and the ruder and more homely products of the old stone men.

We can scarcely realize that hardly a generation has gone by when,
at the British Museum, it was the fashion to admit only classical antiq-
uities as worthy of collection, and that the priceless treasures dug up
by Faussett and Rolfe were treated as rubbish, unworthy of a place
in that sanctuary of the arts, and had to seek a home in a provincial
museum. Fifty years ago a man who had devoted his time, his purse,
and his knowledge to creating a worthy department of British antiqui-
ties would not have been rewarded with the Order of the Bath, but
would have been treated by the students of so-called high art as a bar-
barian and a phillistine, fit only to consort with people hike you and
me. We have changed all this, but its mischievous results still remain.
If we go to the British Museum we shall find the noblest collection of
Greek art in the world. Taken altogether it is quite unapproachable,
thanks to the labor, the zeal, and the taste of many good men, and nota-
bly of the late and the present curators of that department. But when
we turn to Rome—Rome, the mother of modern Europe; Rome, the
Britain of old days, the great type of practical good sense in govern-
ment; the Rome whose roads and bridges, whose colonies and towns,
whose laws and municipal institutions are only rivaled by our own, and
which ruled the world for a thousand years and more—where are we to

THE METHODS OF ARCHZOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 591

look for an adequate picture of the life her citizens led and of the vast
colonial dependencies she controlled? We have a few busts; we have
a room devoted to the antiquities of Roman Britain, and then we find
the mistress of many legions and the mother of us all treated every-
where as a sort of Cinderella to her more favored sister of Greece, a
mere outhouse and barn attached to a Greek palace. Our contention
is that there ought to be in our great museum, if not a special depart-
ment of Roman antiquities, at least special room devoted to them worthy
of the fame of Rome and of its importance in human history. For many
of us who love art, but also love history, it is quite as important to
know what were the surroundings of Tiberius and of Mareus Aurelius
as of Pericles and Alexander the Great. What is true of the earlier
Rome is much more true of Byzantine Rome, the Rome of the Mosque
of St. Sophia, the Rome which inspired St. Mark’s at Venice and the
glorious buildings at Ravenna and Spoletro, which shook hands with
the East, and by this means wedded fresh ideas to those which were
becoming stagnant. Because Gibbon entitled his work the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire, we have acquired an entirely mistaken
perspective in regard to the part played by Byzantium in the history
of art. Byzantium lived, thrived, and flourished for a thousand years
after the Goths had taken Rome. Nor are the code of Justinian, the
histories of Procopius and Constantine, and the magnificent buildings
dating from this time and scattered all over the 4 gean, signals of
decay and decrepitude, but the reverse; and yet where are we to look
for an adequate collection of objects to illustrate Byzantine art, its
rich barbaric sarcophagi, its enamels, silver plate, ete.

My object in naming these things is to point a moral. Iam afraid
the old Adam, if he be not still among us, has left his shadow behind,
and there remains much for the great and powerful society to urge and
to press. Archeology is the study of history by its monuments, and
not a branch of «esthetics. Let us by all means guard our taste and
accumulate the highest and best, but let us also be eclectic and catholic,
and realize that the highest and best of all phases of art are of supreme
value; and, further, that what we mean by history is not only the his-
tory of kings and armies, of great nobles, and great philosophers and
of the arts they patronized, but also that of the crowd, by whose con-
tinuous labor the world has been, and continues to be, subdued, and
whose homely and prosaic surroundings have ‘a dramatic interest of
their own. If this be one great lesson which the wider horizon of
modern archeological study has taught us, another and an equally
important one is that of the continuity of art. What Herbert Spencer
and Darwin have pressed upon the students of natural history, we anti-
quaries learned long before in regard to art, namely, that there are no
jerks and jumps in its history, but a continuous flow, and not only a
continuous flow, but something more. It was formerly the notion that
when art took an apparently new departure, and became rejuvenated
a4 THE METHODS OF ARCHZOLOGICAL RESEARCH.

after a long period of stagnation, it was a spontaneous movement from
within. We now know that in almost every case this rejuvenescence
was due to contact with some new ideas which came in from the outside.
A new graft into the old tree was the real source of better fruit.

Let us take some examples. When the Mongols, who were then
masters of China, conquered Persia, they imported great numbers of
Persian workinen, and the result was a complete change in the decora-
tion of Chinese porcelain. The vases made by the Moors at Majorc:
and Valencia were probably the immediate daughters of the art fabries
of Egypt. and were certainly the mothers of Italian majolica. The
blaze of flowers and ribbons which suddenly broke out this year in the
hats and bonnets of English women, without any apparent motive, can
be traced to the influence of a famous city on the banks of the Seine,
where an explanation of the change is forthcoming. The Japanese are
said to have lost their eye for color and form because their old art has
changed recently for the worse. They have been, in fact, inoculated
with European taste, as they have been flooded with European products.
The story is apparently universal. We see the river come out of its
mountain fountain and flow down blue and sparkling. Presently we
find the color of its water change to milky white, and realize an expla-
nation when we trace the new color to some affluent watering another
soil which has come and joined its waters; and sometimes, as in the
sase of the Rhone after it enters Lake Geneva, the milky and the blue
streains flow side by side, as the new bonnets and hats of every fantastic
shape and color are mingled with older and more chaste designs on
older and more sensible people. The great lesson of all this is continuity.

Again, to take another illustration from natural history, a lesson of
these later times in archeology has been that of “survival.” We find
all kinds of archaic survivals—in our speech, in our fairy stories, in our
clothes, everywhere, in fact—crystallized bowlders of older strata of
human life, which have been preserved accidentally in another matrix,
and to those who are willing to read their lesson, reflecting ummistak-
able features of another time. When we see the Italian peasant going
on pilgrimages to different altars of Our Lady to be cured of different
human ills, are we not reminded of the similar practices in an age
when Venus and her shrines were scattered over the same country, and
each shrine had its own Venus, just as each altar has its own ‘** Lady”
endowed with different healing powers? How curious it is to go toa
Kermiss in some old Dutch town, such as Middleburg, or Delft, to see
the women with their: curiously shaped lace caps, and to be told that
it is quite possible to distinguish the Roman Catholic families from the
the Protestant ones, the distinction in the caps having arisen in the
fiercer days of the sixteenth century. We may then examine the bags
full of curiously shaped and colored cakes sold in the booths, and see
the roundabouts and rude swing boats loaded with perfectly sane peo-
ple, many of them 60 or 70 years old; and then turn to Tenier’s great
THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 593

pictures at Amsterdam, and see precisely the same cakes and the same
roundabouts figured there! Are not the wooden houses colored with
red ocher which dot the Chrisenier the very same as were introduced
by the Dutch therein the grand old days of the Norwegian herring
fishing in the seventh century? Are not the bull fights in Spain direct
survivals of the exhibitions in the circus, no doubt introduced every-
where by the Romans, just aS Spain was the most essentially Roman
of all the colonies?

Have we not our own fossil customs everywhere? The aldermen and
the common councilors of London when decked in their state robes
might be hving in the Plantagenet times, and the beef-eaters in the
time of Henry VIIi. The two ridiculous buttous at the back of our
coats and the bands we barristers wear are useless relics of once useful
garments, the one dating from the time when there was necessity for
buttoning back the flaps of the long coats when’ George III was king
and the other remains of the long collars of King James’s time. Are
not our judges’ wigs directly traceable to the baldness of Louis XIV?
These useless things, like the many useless and monstrous and offensive
adjectives used by cabmen and sometimes by schoolboys, are mere sur-
vivals of things once usefully put on. The games played by the school
children in the gutter preserve the ritual of primeval worship and the
sociai customs of primeval times. Hence, as I have always urged, it
becomes important and interesting not only to trace the origin of things,
but also their final departure. Our dictionary makers are the most
diligent hunters of the first usage of words. Would it not be wise if
they were also to record the last use of the obsolete words, the dying
flicker of a living light? The very fact we are referring to has sometimes
perverted archeological reasoning. Because the Shetland islanders
still use stone lamps and cups, it does not follow, as some have urged,
that a Stone Age in Britain is entirely a mistake. It only means, of
course, that in remote corners the very old art has lived on, just as.in
the names of the old mountains and rivers the language of the earliest
inhabitants has frequently been preserved. These touches of poetry
in our very prosaic lives are as much fossil relics of an old historical
horizon as the fossils which have been found by the German geologists
in the far-traveled limestone bowlders which strew their country, and
belong to an age not directly represented in the solid strata of the dis-
trict. The lessons we are discussing are notably prominent in the more
recent works on philology, in which loan words and terms foreign to
the language have been carefully sifted out, and we have thus been
enabled to find not only the origin of many arts and customs but the
stage and culture at which different connected races had arrived at the
time when they separated. This we can do by comparing their common
names for homely or other objects. The same with folklore, and the
Same with the rituals of different religions, all of them being among
the most conservative institutions. This multiplication of avenues by

which to approach the thoughts and works of the old men has no doubt
made our inquiry more complicated and difficult; but it has at the
same time made the materials almost inexhaustible, and the possibility
of solving problems once deemed insoluble much more hopeful.

Let us now turn to some of the concrete results which our more
powerful analysis has enabled us to compass. In the first place, we
have learned that 1t is a mistake to confuse art with race. We can not
change our race—that is indelibly stamped upon us by nature. But
art—art of every kind—including language, is not an inheritance from
nature, but is as much acquired as are our hats and coats. We learn
all our arts. Hence, we must be perpetually on our guard against the
fallacy that because art has taken a new departure, therefore we are in
the presence of a new race.

Archeology is a science which can only be profitably studied on
inductive methods. Of this a very notable proof is the discussion on
the “ Origin of man,” a subject upon which there was much specu-
lation twenty-five years ago. It has not the same living interest for
us now. The fact is we realize that materials are wanting at present
to enable us to carry the study very far in this direction, and the newly
fledged hopes of a quarter of a century ago have not fructified. The
origin of the human race, so far as archeological research goes, is abso-
lutely beyond our ken, and those who are determined to reach some
result in this direction must go to the geologists for their facts and for
their arguments. The moral for the archeological vista is this: Wecan
take up the various specialized and elaborated civilizations which men
have produced and trace them up to simpler and less specialized forms.
We can separate the tangle created by their mutual influence upon each
other, and trace the enormous changes due to the gradual introduction
of new ideas and new processes, of new weapons and new tools. We
can trace the complicated pedigree until we reach an age when all
men used very similar materials and had very similar arts. The
cramping influence of having to use these often stubborn materials com-
pelled a monotony of form and of ornament which is in itself bewildering,
Eventually we reach a stage where it is most difficult to discriminate
among races or their characteristics by their art alone. Tor example,
the polished stone axes left by the Caribs, those found in some parts
of Europe and those found in some parts of eastern Asia, are almost
indistinguishable. Yet, how widely separated these races are in every
respect! We may thus be only too easily deceived in supposing that
we are getting nearer to the solution of the problem of the origin of
man when our goal is the inevitable one, that with his primitive
weapons primitive man in many latitudes was constrained to surround
himself with very similar surroundings. A corrective to this 1s very
speedily reached when we turn to other fields of research, such as
language and mythology, and physical constitution. We can trace back
the languages of Egypt, of Babylonia, of India, and China for a long

THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 595

distance beyond the occurrence of regular annals in those countries—
back, in fact, to the Stone Age in each, and similarly with the mythology,
and the result is that, instead of apparently reaching a common origin
and common elements in them, the gap between them seems to get
wider as we go further back, until we have to confess that if there was
a common fountain to the various streams it must have been at a period
so remote that we have no material at present by which to trace them
to it. The men who wrote the Book of the Dead, those who wrote the
Epic of Sargon the First, those who wrote the Vedas, and those who
wrote the Chinese classics, if they were descended, as we believe, from
common parents, must have been isolated from each other for a long
period in order to become so differentiated at such an early date.
These are only mere samples.

If we range further afield we shall find the same lesson meeting us
everywhere. It is said that among the Indians of North and South
America there are ninety languages spoken which are unintelligible to
each other. The same problem meets us in the Caucasus, in Siberia, in
Indo-China, and elsewhere. ‘The existence of these languages is a per-
petual warning to us to be careful of dogmatizing. Towcan we explain
them except by postulating a long period, during which they have been
gradually diverging from each other? We can not measure this period
by any scale or measure. When we compare Icelandic with Norwegian,
and remember how long ago it is that Iceland was colonized—when we
compare the Mongol language, still spoken by the Buriats in Mongolia,
with the language of the letters of the Mongol Khans written to the
French kings in the thirteenth century, we shall havea measure of the
slowness with which these changes sometimes accrue. If it has taken
sixteen centuries to convert Latin into the various Roman languages
how long has it taken for the diversion of the various Aryan forms of
speech from one original language, and how much longer to converge
the Aryan, Semitic, and other families of language upon a common
mother? The very question is full of romantic difficulty, and assuredly
we are a long way from any satisfactory answer to it. The evidence of
language and mythology is supplemented and confirmed by that of the
physical features of our race—features which seem to be so conservative
and so difficult to alter. If we examine the very earliest human pic-
tures which have been preserved in the tombs of Egypt we shall find
representatives of the various races which then bordered the valley of the
Nile, and we shall find that in the features and physique they are undis-
tinguishable trom the tribes still occupying the same districts. The
Negro, the Nubian, the Coptic Fellaheen, the Semetie inhabitants of
Palestine and Arabia, are there pictured as we know them now.

The earliest monuments of Babylonia similarly discriminate clearly
the various types of men in Mesopotamia. It is so, also, with the
early monuments of China, of India, of Mexico, and Peru, and of the
borders of the Mediterranean, and this evidence of the monuments is
596 THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH.

supported by the shapes and contours of the skulls which have been
found in the earlest graves, and which show not merely sporadic vari-
ation, but variation affecting great classes. All this assuredly requires
us to postulate a long period during which fresh changes were incubat-
ing and were being carried forward. We have no means of knowing
how long this was. We can only very naturally conclude that since so
little change has taken place during the last four thousand years in
the languages, the customs, and physical features of so many different
races, we must go back a long way if we are to explain the differences
as they exist.

We have no chronology of any kind for these misty regions. Dates
entirely failus. In Egypt and in Babylonia anything like positive
chronological data fail about 2500 B. C., while, as you know, the Bible
dates are, before a certain period, not only based upon those of Baby-
lonia, but they have been preserved in an entirely different shape in
the Masoretic, the Samaritan, and the Septuagint versions, and there
is no means of rectifying them. All we can say is that the Masoretic
numbers, upon which Archbishop Ussher’s chronology was based, and
which was the basis of the calculation in the margins of our Bibles,
are the least trustworthy of all, and can be shown to be sophisticated
and altered. If I may be pardoned for referring to a work of my own
in this behalf, namely, that which I have entitled The Mammoth and
the flood, I claim to have shown that all the evidences we possess—
geological, paleontological, and archeological—converges with singu-
lar force upon one conclusion, namely, that at the verge of human
history there was a great and widespread catastrophe, which over-
whelmed a large part of the temperate regions of the earth and which
caused great destruction of men and animals. This widespread
catastrophe has left its mark upon the traditions of many and widely
scattered peoples. It possibly accounts for the isolation of many races
in our own day, notably in districts without great natural frontiers,
which isolation is due, in all probability, to the destruction of all inter-
vening links between the various human colonies which survived. It
is a remarkable proof of this catastrophe that whereas man is the
most elastic of creatures in his capacity for facing and overcoming
difficulties, there is, nevertheless, an absolute gap in his history in
large areas in Europe unbridged by any remains or by any evidence.
How are we to explain this?) Once man has occupied the ground he is
not likely to abandon it entirely and suddenly. Wherever we find
one set of men driving out and superseding another, we have evidence
of gradual change (of overlapping). In the hill forts of Dorset we
have Roman remains mixed with those of Britons. In the Kentish
cemeteries we have Roman remains mixed with Saxon. In the case
before us, however, it is not only human art which shows a gap, but a
whole fauna suddenly*changes. Not a single mammoth or a rhinoceros
has ever occurred with the remains of a domesticated animal, Since
THE METHODS OF ARCHA OLOGICAL RESEARCH. aN

there are no traces of a transition, it is clear one set of men and ani-
mals did not absorb the other. To myself this sudden hiatus and gap
means the occurrence of some sudden and widespread catastrophe
which desolated a wide area, and destroyed its living creatures in
great numbers, and the recolonization of the wasted area by migration
from elsewhere. ‘To this great catastrophe the traditions of mankind
go back, as do the geological reference we can collect. It forms the
great divide in early human history.

We must not, however, be misled. Soine wild writers have argued
as if human beings were quite different in kind before and after the
divide. I see no evidence whatever of this. The human skulls found
with the remains of extinct animals by Lund in the caverns of Brazil
have all the characters of Indian skulls, while those found with the
extinct animals in Europe have the characters of European skulls, thus
showing that at this period the native races of America and of Europe
had already been differentiated, and it is extremely probable that the
so-called paleolithic, or as I prefer to call them, the antediluvial men
of Europe did not belong to one race, but to several races. Those who
find certain resemblances to simian skulls in those of antediluvial man
overlook the power of drawing shown in the etchings of animals on
pieces of bone found in the French caves, which is quite unmatched in
after times until we reach a much later period, while the harpoons, the
needles, etc., are most skillfully fashioned. Whether the simian origin
of man be a factor or not, it is clear we have no evidence in archeology
as yet to bridge the gap. If we want a key to the whole position we
must turn our backs upon civilized man and explore the fertile fields
of ethnography and the multiform types which we find among savage
and semisavage races. Many of these have survived from the time
before the great catastrophe, which did not in fact affect the Tropics.
In these latitudes we can find abundant material to study, showing
how man with very rude tools fashioned for himself very respectable
surroundings. These various tribes of savages are generally ignored
when we study history and archeology. No greater mistake could be
made. Assuredly they present us with survivals on a great scale by
which we can measure and test the phases of human progress in its
earlier stages, and some time, perhaps, we may be able to get them all
into one pedigree, and to show how a real continuity combines them
all. Two lessons of great moment we may learn from them. One is
that all these varieties of language, of ornament, of dress must have
taken a very long time to develop; and, secondly, when we come into
actual contact with them we are struck by the further fact that they
are desperately conservative. The so-called mug money which marks
one of the very early chapters of our archeological history still survives
in northeastern Africa. The ornaments and the customs of ancient
Egypt may be still found living in western Soudan and among the
tribes of Ashanti, while, if we turn to Australia and Tasmania, we
598 THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH.

shall find human arts still in their very infancy, and so far as we know
and can judge, the arts of these races have remained unchanged and
unaltered since those primitive times, when the Australians first intro-
duced the dog into Australia, which means, when the Australian
animals were still living, while we shall find among the very backward
Bushmen and Eskimos a power of drawing animals, ete., comparable
with that of the cave men, and languages remarkable for their structure
and capacity.

A third lesson which we learn is that it is quite possible, and in facet
an everyday occurrence, for two civilizations which have reached very
different stages to coexist alongside of each other contemporaneously
in the same area. The Australian and the Englishman live alongside
of each other, as the Lapp and the Norwegian; nay, to come nearer
home, as the gypsy and the sedentary Oxford professor; and we are
led from this fact to the induction which has been too often forgotten
or overlooked, that the same thing must always have been. We talk
of a Stone age, of a Bronze age, and of an Iron age, and these are
excellent terms when we apply them to some particular area like Sean-
dinavia, to which they were first applied; but they are misleading
when universally applied. Many savages are still living, or were quite
recently, in the Stone age, the Shell age, or the Wooden age, like the
Australians, the Marquesan Islanders, and the Indians of the Amazons,
while alongside of them were living the emigrants from Europe, who
were not only living in the Iron age, but had learned to harness steam
to iron, and to multiply human labor tenfold. Not only so, but it is obvi-
ous in such cases that there may be a great jump in civilization from a
very low to avery high step on the ladder without the necessity, or the
possibility even, of intermediate steps. A Bronze age or a Copper age is
not at all unlikely to intervene between the hewers of rude stones or of
polished stones in the Pacific and in many parts of America and their
adoption of iron; and, in fact, it may be said that the stage we some-
times associate with Paleolithic man (very wrongly, as I think), namely,
that in which the Tasmanians and Australians lately lived, may be
immediately followed by an Iron age. I say wrongly, because we can
not argue that the men who lived in our prehistoric caves and were
contemporaries of the mammoth, whose portrait they scratched on
ivory, were the same race as the low type of men discovered in Tasma-
nia. Diogenes was a philosopher, and not a dog, as he called himself,
although he lived in something very like a kennel, and the men who
invented and elaborated the Vedanta philosophy, although living with
the simplest surroundings, are not to be measured with the untutored
and unreclaimed wild hunters of the Kurdish Mountains, anong whom
the arts of life are at least as much advanced.

Let us now apply this lesson a little more concretely to the compli-
cated story of human progress. If wetake our archeological telescope
and look back through the avenues of time, we shall reach a period

THE METHODS OF ARCHAZ OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 599

when the great civilizations of the world were still incubating, and
when in Europe, in north Africa, and in Asia the many scattered
tribes were living very much as we can see tribes living now in savage
countries, some by hunting, some by fishing, and some, no doubt,
leading a pastoral life. This stage in Europe and its borders is marked
archeologically by what we call the paleolithie or antediluvian man.
Some have compared him with the Eskimo, because the Eskimo,
like him, has artistic instincts and can draw well, and because his sur-
roundings are supposed to have been of an Arctic character. All this
is very doubtful and, in fact, misleading. So far as we know, the cave
man of Europe was completely exterminated, as his companions, the
mammoth and the hairy rhinoceros, were, and has left no descendants.
His remains as found in the caves are cased with stalagmite, which
effectually separates them from their successors. The immigrants who
succeeded them are recognized by their iong, narrow skulls, by their
employing domesticated animals and cultivated plants, and by their
burying their dead in long barrows. Whence they came we can not
positively say, but we may reasonably conjecture it was from some
country where the animals and plants just named were indigenous in
the wild state. In their graves in Britain no metal objects have been
found, no tangled or barbed arrowheads, while the pottery is of the
rudest character, marked by cylindrical shapes.

In one respect these long mounds present us with a puzzle. Wecan
hardly doubt that among barbarous races few things are more likely
to have been closely studied and more important than the ritual of
burial, and yet we find the practices of burial and of cremation both
in vogue. It has been thought that the two practices were, in fact,
contemporary from the commencement. In this I can not agree. In
the south of England burial was almost universal among the long bar-
row men. In Scotland, on the contrary, cremation; but Mr. Anderson
has shown that even there burial seems to have preceded burning, and
it seems to me that burning the dead bodies was distinctly an innova-
tion introduced by the men who had succeeded those with the long
heads, and that originally it was unknown among tiese men. Again,
there is another curious distinction, which is apparently a superficial
one. When stone was not‘to be had the bodies were laid in the ground
in a more or less crouching attitude and covered in. Otherwise, cham-
bers were built up of bowlders or other rough stones, which were
approached by long galleries open to the outside, apparently simulating
underground dwellings, in which whole families or clans were buried.
These again were supplanted when the new men with round heads
came in by stone boxes or cists closed all round, the introduction of
which was, in general, coincident with that of burning, although there
was undoubtedly some overlapping. Who, then, were these long-headed
men? The early long-headed race of Britain has, according to fair evi-
dence, left its trace in Europe in the long-headed, dark-skinned, black-
600 THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH.

haired Basques, and in Britain itself they seem to have survived in the
Silurians of Glamorganshire (described by the Roman writers) and in
the small black haired people of south Wales and parts of Ireland.
Traces of the Basque language have been said to be found in the Celtie
languages, but this particular branch of the field has been hitherto
very little explored, nor have the local place names in those districts
where the race may be supposed to have survived. Here, then, we
seem to have a clue which points to the men with the long heads having
come from the southwest. The Basques have their nearest relations in
north A friea, where a race which buried and did not burn its dead once
occupied the country, whose remains are still to be found among the
Berbers and the Kabyles of the Atlas range and among the Guanches
of the Canary Islands. And these races of the Atlas take us on again
to the valley of the Nile, where the early Egyptians are now recognized
to have had close relations of blood, ete., with them, and who were, as
you know, almost fanatically devoted to the practice of burial, as con-
trasted with burning in disposing of their dead. In this behalf it is
curious to remember the distribution of the so-called cromlechs, which
are merely chambered tombs of another form. They are found all round
the northern part of Africa, in Spain, in the maritime parts of Gaul, and
all over Britain, where they have not been displaced by the plow and
harrow. They abound in Holland and occur again in Scandinavia,
specimens of their primitive stock having migrated from west to east
in Europe along the seaboard. This line of migration leads us to the
Nile Valley as a goal, and it seems to some of us that the earliest
inhabitants of that valley were first cousins of our long barrow men.
There, under favorable conditions of a pure climate and access to the
necessary tools and weapons of culture, there developed a rave which,
although unacquainted with metals, produced a wonderful culture—
that of the Egyptians of the old empire.

We have as yet found no traces of a beginning of this culture on the
spot, and until quite recently, when Professor Petrie has made some
remarkable discoveries at Coptos, which may throw some light on this
issue, we seem to have in the monuments of the fourth and fifth dynasty
every kind of excellence we associate with Egyptian art fully devel-
oped, including its hieroglyphical writing, its strange mythology, ete.,
and all the while Egypt was still in what the Scandinavian antiquaries
describe as the Stone age.

Whether this art was imported with the race which developed it in
the Nile Valley, or was entirely indigenous, we do not know. It may
be that it was the discovery of the ancestors of the tribes who are now
represented by the Bishirins, Hadandowahs, and other wild tribes of
the eastern Soudan, or by the Berbers of the Atlas range, who border
the Nile Valley on either hand, and must have done so for a very long
period. One thing seems clear, that for a very considerable period the
art of the Nile Valley was isolated, and does not seem to have affected
THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 601

that of itsneighbors. To us this art is supremely interesting, because
we can trace its progress step by step through manifold vicissitudes
for four thousand years.

Let us now return again to our own country. The long-headed
people here were displaced very largely by a race with round heads,
who burned their dead and put their ashes in beautifully constructed
urns, and then deposited them in stone cists or boxes in round or
saucer-shaped mounds and not in long barrows. As we have said,
there was considerable overlapping between them and their predeces-
sors, who adopted in some cases their customs, including that of bury-
ing in round mounds or barrows. The shape of the skulls of these new
men shows us what a profound racial difference there must have been
between them and their predecessors. They apparently came from
another direction, and with different surroundings. So far as we
know, they were the first wave of that migration of tribes from the
east which have successively followed each other in Europe, and are
represented by the earlier Celts in central and southern France, and
large parts of Spain, and by the Irish and Scottish Gaels, just as
their art remains proved the round-headed folk to have mingled with
their predecessors, the Basques. If we follow our maps eastward, and
track the steps of those races who burned their dead, we shall find them
linked step by step—if not by race by a certain relationship in their
arts—to the early dwellers in Mesopotamia. There a similar develop-
ment to that we all know so well in the Nile Valley, and likewise in
the Stone age of culture, took place in the valleys of the Euphrates
and the Tigris. Here, however, we seem to have evidence that the
culture was not hemegrown, but there are reasons for believing that
the men-who founded the earliest known communications with
Chaldea brought with them the arts by which we know them from the
Elamitish Mountains to the east, whence they seem to have sent colo-
nies westward into Mesopotamia and eastward into China. This
curious and most interesting induction is one of the most important
discoveries of recent years. It enables us to link the culture of the
furthest east to that of the west, and it also enables us to conclude
that the arts are not the peculiar heritage of any one race, for here we
seem to be compelled to admit that the foundation of that culture
which we call Aryan or Indo-European is really to be traced to the
now despised ‘Turks and Finnish races. It was a race very nearly akin
to the Turks and Finns which certainly invented the cuneiform writ-
ing, and apparently developed the earliest religious system in Chaldea.
From this race it was directly learned by the Semitic races, whose origi-
nal home was Arabia, and whose enterprise and vigor distributed them
far and wide. One thing we must remember, that so far as our present
evidence goes, the arts of Babylonia were as different from those of the
Nile Valley as were the language, mythology, and the appearance of
the people.
602 THE METHODS OF ARCH OLOGICAL RESEARCH.

These Semitic peoples founded the successive kingdoms of Babylo-
nia and Assyria, but it was the Phenicians who were chiefly instru-
mental in multiplying and distributing the wares which the older men
of Mesopotamia had made. They were to be found trading and traffick-
ing everywhere from far-off Britain to far-off Thule, and still farther
to that land of mist and snow where the griffons were supposed to
guard the gold deposits of Siberia, Their settlements and trading
ports were to be found all over the Mediterranean. These same Phe-
nicians were also great metallurgists, and if not the discoverers of
bronze, which added so much to the resources of the early craftsman,
they were so far as we know the great distributors of the knowledge of
the making and also of the materials of bronze.

Let us revert once more to northern Europe, and notably to our own
country. It was during its occupation by round-headed people that
the use of bronze was first introduced here. Gold was apparently their
own discovery, but bronze, IL believe, was an imported art, and had
nothing to do with the introduction of a new race. The bronze workers,
as we know from the numerous hoards which have occurred, and also
from the numerous molds which have been found, were traveling
tinkers and metallurgists, such as the metal workers of Finland still are,
and as the mediaval goldsmiths in Scotland were. The weapons, orna-
ments, and tools are of the same type, differing in slight details only
from one end of Europe to the other, and showing that the art was
spread over a wide area occupied by many races, and it seems to have
spread from the Mediterranean lands, perhaps by the agency of those
traders who took Baltic amber to Greece and Italy, and who in the
first instance were probably the Phoenicians. It is curious that this
bronze culture should have advanced to very different stages of style
and elaboration in different areas. In Spain it advanced only toa small
degree, as we may learn from the explorations of my friends, the broth-
ers Siret; in England and France considerably farther; in Scandi-
navia and Hungary farther still, and I would suggest as an explanation
that the reason is that in Spain and the western countries bronze was
displaced by iron at an earlier date. Thus, while in Scandinavia we
have no reason to suppose that iron was used until about the Christian
era, in Britain it must have been used several centuries earlier. Thus
the later and more developed bronze culture of Denmark and Hungary
corresponded in age aud was synchronous with the earlier use of iron
in Britain, and probably also in Gaul and Spain, and hence it represents
a later and more developed art. As I have said, the introduction of
bronze was the introduction of a new art, and not a new race, and it is
a great mistake for people to talk of the bronze folk as if they were
something different to the men who used stone.

The next art revolution in these latitudes did, however, mean the
importation of anew stock. This was coincident with the introduction

of iron. This problem as it presents itself in Britain, is one of the
great puzzles of early archeology, for it means a great deal more than
the mere introduction of iron for the cutting of weapons and tools; it
means the introduction of an entirely new style of ornament, a style
of ornament apparently quite indigenous, consisting of the most grace-
ful serolls, known as trumpet scrolls, of endless variety and taste.
Alongside of this we have the most wonderful skill in metallurgy.
Nothing can exceed the delicate manipulation with which the old
artificers fashioned the objects of manifold shape, and of entirely new
designs—bone trappings, shields, helmets, swords and dagger sheaths,
spoons, mirrors, ete., and the dexterous way in which they ornamented
them with enamel, which they were, apparently, the first to discover
and to apply. These objects have occurred in the gretest number in
Great Britain, and in Ireland; but they have also been found in Bel-
gium, in eastern France, and in certain parts of Switzerland, such as
La Teue, etc., and it would seem, therefore, that they reached us by
some migration down the Rhine. One important fact about this art
is, that we know its relative date. We know that it was living when
the Romans conquered Britain. The remains of the early Roman con-
querors are found mixed with objects of this date in the hill forts of
Dorsetshire, ete., and the descriptions of Czesar apply to this chariot-
eering people. Not only so, but it survived the Roman Conquest in
that part of these islands untouched by the Roman Conquest—namely,
in Ireland. The art of Ireland, until it was displaced and_ sophisti-
cated by the Norsemen, was a mere development and growth of this
art, and it is found abundantly displayed in the ornaments illustrated
by Westwood in his work on Irish MSS. How long it has flourished
here before the Roman Conquest, and at what date it displaced the art
of the Bronze people we do not know. As I have said, this same art is
found in the Rhine Valley, and in Switzerland; it is not found in Den-
mark and Germany, where the objects of the Iron age have an entirely
different history. Nor, again, is it found in western France, nor in
Spain, and the only avenue, therefore, by which it can have reached
Britain is that suggested by my very acute friend, Mr. Arthur Evans,
namely, the valley of the Rhine. In his original and suggestive mem-
oir on this subject, he traces this art to Switzerland. There it seems
to have incubated and developed itself in contact with the art of the
Etruseans, with which at some points it has some analogy; but as a
whole its inspiration is not Etruscan, but it goes back further to that
primitive Mediterranean art which, for lack of a better name, we call
Mykenean—the art of the Homeric poems. It is in the Mykenean
objects that we find the same scrolls and the same dexterous manipula-
tion of metal, and the use also of enamel. The distinction, of course, is
that the use of iron has meanwhile been introduced. This, however,
was only for cutting objects; the ornaments, the sword sheaths, the
604 THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH.

shields, helmets, mirrors, etc., all continued to be made of bronze. The
introduction of iron merely displaced the kind of metal, and did not
affect the art.

To revert for a sentence or two, the people who developed and usec
this later Celtic art also used coins. These coins have been traced
partially to the coinage of Philip of Macedon, large quantities of whose
gold staters were probably taken back by the Gauls after their inva-
sion of Greece. The gradual sophistication of these Greek models has
been traced and followed out by Sir John Evans with his usual inge-
nuity and acumen. On another side we seem to have evidence that
Druidism, which differed from the old polytheistic religion of the Gauls
and Germans, which was related to the religions of Rome and Greece,
was imported from the far East, and, having apparently reached
Thrace, was carried back with them by the Gauls who had invaded
Greece, and who thus acquired the notions of metempsychosis, ete.,
and I am not at all sure that the old notion of Godfrey Higgins, which
has not had many adherents lately, is not true that Druidism was
largely the outcome of the teaching of the Buddhist monks, who, we
know, penetrated into Persia and Syria, as they spread their ideas and
the artistic instincts of India all the further east from Japan to Java.
But to return to Europe. The art I have been describing, which has
been styled Neo-Celtic by Sir A. Wollaston Franks, who has done so
much to illustrate it, was imported by a new wave of population, to
which the name Belgie has been given, and whose original home was
apparently in Switzerland and South Germany. This race is now best
represented by the Welsh, but we must not forget that it also had
large colonies in Ireland, where Neo-Celtic art became predominant
and where it outlived the Roman domination elsewhere. In Great
Britain, as on the Continent, this art was displaced, as so much of the
art of the world was, by the Romans, itself a daughter of Greece. It
is not my purpose to discuss such a well-known subject as Roman art.
I would only point out to you how the newer school of archeology
has shown that Roman art was very largely the art of the Roman
provinces, and not so much Italian. Alexandria was a great center of
the silversmiths’ and other artistic metal work; Treves and Cologne
and Lyons and Clermont of pottery, of glass, and also of metal work;
and there can be no doubt that Greece, both continental and insular,
continued to be under the Roman domination a fertile mother of
sculpture, architecture, ete.

Rome was the great assimilator and distributor of these various pro-
vincial wares, as her language became the lingua franca of half the
known world; her laws embodied and displaced other forms of juris-
prudence; her generous Pantheon welcomed the foreign gods, and her
military system mixed and mingled the natives of very different coun-
tries and climates. I would like to say, by the way, how necessary it is
that we should have a complete survey of Roman Britain such as has

a ee

been so well begun at Silchester, and how much some of us long to see
the spade put into your own Uriconium. When the Roman capital was
removed to Byzantium new and fresh ideas were apparently developed, or
perhaps old ones which had been localized there were distributed in all
directions. In one direction Parthians and Sassanians drank at the
well, and it is not possible now to say whether the embroideries, the
damasks, the silver bowls, ete., which we associate with these Eastern
people were Byzantine or not. In another direction the art of Byzan-
tium spread all over the Teutonic world. The art we call Teutonic is
really Byzantine. The tribes which were planted on the various fron-
tiers of the Empire and were largely in its service and its pay were all
directly indebted to Byzantium for their art. Hence, why we find the
same art with slight local differences among the Goths of the Crimea,
the Lombards in Italy, the Burgundians in Austria and Switzerland,
the Alemanni on the Rhine, the Merovingians in Gaul, the Angles and
Saxons in Britain, the Visigoths in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, and
the earlier Scandinavians in Denmark and Scandinavia. The cloissonee
jewelry, the interlaced dragon patterns, ete., all of which have such a
common likeness, have an equally common likeness with the work
which we can trace to the Queen of the Bosphorus; and as Lindin-
schmidt was never tired of preaching, there is no Teutonie art. The
art of all the Teutonic tribes who founded the modern States of Europe
was in reality the art of Byzantium, and this was so in later times also.
The art of the Carlovingian Empire and of the later Anglo-Saxons
was the art of the exarchate of Ravenna, just as the art of southeastern
Europe, as preserved in the churches of Kief, was the direct daughter
of Constantinople. The enamels, the bronze work, the ivories, the
illuminations in books, the jewelry, etc., are all directly traceable to
the same opulent mother.

But it was among the Arabs that the seeds of Byzantine art flour-
ished and thrived the most. The Arabs themselves in regard to art
were always a sterile race. Like their own sands, they do not seem to
have had the instinct for art; but they had the instinct of government,
and at Bagdad, at Cairo, and at Granada they founded communities
which are as famous as any in the world’s history, . They had the Semitic
instinct, too, for making money, and, having made it, for spending it
freely as munificent patrons; but they initiated nothing. When we
speak of Arab art we mean the art of Byzantium, which had a curious
renaissance of its own under the impulse of fresh ideas gathered together
from every wind of heaven by the enterprise of these Arab traders,
who crossed all the known seas from China to the Straits of Gibraltar.
Cresarea, Antioch, Damascus, and Alexandria, the mother of Cairo, were
Byzantine cities with flourishing arts before the Arabs annexed them,
and, so tar as we know, the artsof Damascus and Cairo were the daugh-
ters of Byzantine art. The.mosques of St. Sophia and of Omar were
Christian churches before they became the models for the stately build-
606 THE METHODS OF ARCHHOLOGICAL RESEARCH.

ings of the later caliphs. Embroidery, pottery, and glass and metal
working, including damascenert and bronze casting, all passed from
Byzantine craftsmen to those of Arabia, and the chief development they
received was in response to the injunctions of the Prophet against the
making of graven images and of painted representations, which coin-
pelled those employed by the Arabs to devote their energies to devel-
oping conventional ornamentation and so-called arabesque work, Their
contact with the Chinese and the Hindoos enabled them in pottery, and
probably also in bronze work, etc., to supplement the lessons they learned
nearer home with fresh lessons from the farthest East. Then came a
curious phase. As is often the case in the modest life of our homes, the
daughter, having outgrown her mother’s teaching, returned some of the
lessons, and in turn became the fruitful mother of new ideas and of new
inspiration. From Egyptand from Syria art workmen found their way
to Venice and Pisa and other Italian towns, and started men along new
roads by presenting them with new models. The glass, the brass work,
and the pottery of Venice, when Venice headed the renaissance of the
industrial arts, were all the children of eastern workmen imported by
the rich ROUHDNe: Another wave of Mohammedan art influence passed
through north Africa into southern Spain and its islands. There the
lustered wares known as majolican had, if not their origin, their great
development, and thence they were Hanebianten to Italy. The fine
tiles which the Moors made were widely imitated, as their azulejos by
the Spaniards; and thence also largely came the astrolabes, the clocks,
and other inventions which Arab science had produced.

One feature in the panorama we have hastily traced is obvious,
namely, that it has been the nations and the peoples with great mer-
cantile enterprise who have not only been rich enough to patronize but
who have also been in contact with fresh ideas which have given art
its new departure. The Flemings at Bruges and the Hanse traders all
over the Baltic accumulated and developed ideas which they picked up
at Novgorod and in the far-off districts of Perm, ete. On the other
hand, the Venetians and the Genoese had their Rr nien all over the
Black Sea and among the isles of Greece. They shook hands there
with the caravan traders from China and from the far countries of
Siberia, and had to supply each other in return with objects suitable
to their taste and needs. The Mongols were masters of the greater
parts of the Asiatic world. Their ruthless conquests drove the artif-
icers of Persia into India and into Egypt, and in either country a
great rejuvenescence of the arts took place at the same time in the
same style, and it is a most curious piece of history, as well as interest-
ing in art, to compare the tombs of the caliph at Cairo with those of
the Pathan sultans at Delhi. Then the Mongols themselves became
civilized and settled, and their artificers crowded back and brought
new ideas with them, and at Tebriz and Sullania erected buildings and
decorated them in a manner previously unattained, Not only so, but

THE METHODS OF ARCHAOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 607

the great masses of workmen were transported eastward and westward
under the control of the same exacting masters, and thus the designs
on Chinese porcelain—phoenixes and dragons, etc.—invaded Persia,
and similarly the Chinese learned how to make what we eall blue and
white porcelain, which they did not know until the time of the Ming
dynasty.

To take one more illustration: We can not wander about the
glorious ruins of your county—such ruins as Wenlock Priory—without
being reminded of the sermon in every stone. We realize how much
we owe to Gregory and to Augustine, who planted Christianity here,
as wellas to Benedict and St. Bernard, and their indomitable disciples
and scholars, who reared aloft high standards of purity and simplicity
of work and of duty in a community which was disintegrated under
the influence of a barbarous soldiery and of brutal and uneducated
manners. We are further reminded, as we can almost hear the jingling
spurs and iron-incased feet of the knights tramping down the aisles,
that it was the romantic enterprise of the crusading nobles, prelates,
and monks which brought back the genius of Gothic architecture to
Europe, and the taste for poetry, for sentiment, and for art, which
they had learned from the Saracens, followers of Saladin, and it was
very largely their handiwork that flooded western Europe with new
ideas, which blossomed into magnificent forms in our ministers, and the
equally fresh and novel ideas which Froissart and Chaucer and Malory
enshrined in immortal verse and prose; and if we turn over the medal
and look on the other side we shall realize the reflex influence of the
crusades upon the East.

I do not propose to carry this disintegrated story further. My pur-
pose and object have been to press home as a universal factor of human
progress the element of continuity which we all concede in regard to
particular cases, and also to press home the lesson that we can not do
justice to our subject if we limit our horizon, as we are apt to do, to
our parish, our county, or our island. These are only outlying pieces
of much larger areas, and the true way of studying and profiting by the
study of art is not only to be catholic but to be continually conscious
of its interdependence and continuity. Lastly, one lesson let us carry
away with us, lest we forget the humility which becomes the students
of the venerable past. If it is true that we are the heirs of all the ages
it is true also that the memory of much of our inheritance is blighted
and sophisticated. It is not exhilarating to our vanity and self-respect
to think that human progress is not a continual growth—that men reach
levels very often which those who come after can not emulate. The
men who built the Parthenon no less than the unknown architects of
so many of our great ministers, the artifieers who manufactured the
lovely embroideries, the matchless tiles, the radiant decorations of the
Alhambra and the Taj at Agra, have left no heirs, and we are mere
scholars sitting at their feet. Our strength is not great enough to bear

the lamps which they carried in so many ways. Every generation of
men, it may be, has its triumphs; yet it is not altogether reassuring to
think that in the great meeting in the happy hunting grounds beyond
the screen of night it will not be the nineteenth century which will
occupy the foreground. Homer will still lead the procession of the
poets, Socrates of the moral philosophers, Phidias of the sculptors,
Raphael of the painters; and not only so, but we shall have to give
place to many unknown and unchronicled masters of their crafts in the
days of old. When that day comes I know not what I shall say to the
archeological giants, whose disciple alone I can claim to be, for my pre-
sumption in addressing you in this incoherent fashion, save to remind
them that if the men of Shropshire have not all the gifts of their fore-
fathers, they still command the virtues of patience and long suffering,
of urbanity and kindness; and I may be allowed to conclude with the
hope that the sun may continue to shine brightly on your homes—
Floreat Salopia!

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN|!

By W.. (GowiLAnp, Aj R.S.. M., EF. C.S.,. Fo S.A;

Late of the Imperial Japanese Mint.

The art of casting bronze has been practiced by almost all nations
from very early times. In Europe at a remote period, long before the
dawn of history, we have numerous examples of the skill of primitive
man as a founder of bronze. Weapons of defense and implements of
the chase are the chief specimens of his earliest work; but later, when
other wants arose beyond the bare necessaries for his existence, we
find, together with these, objects for personal adornment and domestic
or ceremonial uses.

In Asia the earliest practice of the art is shrouded in the mists of
extreme antiquity. Certain bronze figures from Chaldea are attributed
to a period not later than 2000 B. C., and, although of very archaic
form and rude execution, indicate that the casting of bronze must have
been followed in that country even for many centuries before that
remote date.

In Japan the founder’s art has a much less antiquity; it does not
extend back to these distant periods; in fact, no remains of any
metal castings, even of weapons of defense, have been found there
approaching in age even those of the early Bronze period in Europe.

The Japanese do not appear to have migrated to the islands they now
occupy earlier than perhaps seven or eight centuries B. C., and the
aboriginees whom they found there were totally unacquainted with the
use of metals. Hence all objects of metal of the earliest times which
have been discovered are Japanese, and are not older than that time.

The evidence afforded by tumuli and dolmens, and the remains found
in them of the early history and. civilization of the Japanese, demon-
strates clearly that in prehistoric times there were two periods, which
are more or less clearly defined by the progress which they made in the
art of metallurgy, viz, a Bronze and an Iron age. The Bronze age
begins with the immigration of the race, and terminates about the
second century B. C. The Iron age then commences, and extends to
the present time.

610 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

It is worthy of note here that the Bronze age and the first period of
the Iron age are also characterized by two distinct forms of sepulchral
monuments, the former by barrows, or simple mounds of earth, and the
latter by megalithic dolmens and highly specialized forms of chambered
tumuli. There is no evidence whatever of a Copper age preceding that
of Bronze, but contemporaneous with the early Iron age, and up to
the sixth or seventh centuries A. D., we find copper in more extensive
use than bronze. Iron swords, trappings, and bits for horses, decorated
with thin sheets of copper, coated with gold, are found in abundance,
while objects of bronze are rare. ’

THE BRONZE AGE.

The castings which represent the early Bronze age in Japan consist
solely of swords and arrowheads, the wants of the people then being
evidently few and simple; and although objects for personal adornment
were in use, they were made exclusively of steatite, jasper, quartz, or
other stones. The swords are found in barrows or merely buried in
the ground, and never along with objects of iron; the arrowheads, on the
other hand, occasionally occur also in dolmens, associated with iron
swords, and thus connect the Bronze with the Iron age. These bronze
swords are undoubtedly the most ancient castings in Japan. They are
simple two-edged weapons, resembling in form the short sword of the
ancient Greeks. In some examples the blade is cast in one piece with
the hilt, but in others with a tang, to which a hilt was subsequently
attached. The mold was of stone and was made in two pieces. — Illus-
trations of a mold and sword are exhibited. This is the oldest mold
for casting bronze in existence in Japan. It was found by a Japanese
archeologist in use by some farmers as a hone for sharpening their
sickles. (I may say here that on my visit to Seoul, the capital of Korea,
I found stone molds in use for casting simple silver articles, the stone
being an indurated tuff.)

I was unable to obtain any fragments or even scrapings of these
swords for analysis, as there are but few existing, and they are highly
prized, but a fragment of an arrowhead which I examined consisted
of copper and tin, and did not contain lead as an essential constituent,
and the swords are probably of the same alloy.

EARLY IRON AGE (FROM ABOUT THE SECOND CENTURY B. C. TO
ABOUT THE SIXTH CENTURY A. D.).

In my explorations and studies of the remains which occur in the
ancient Japanese dolmens and chambered tumuli I have always
observed a marked scarcity of castings of bronze. Cireular mirrors,
small bells, and arrowheads occasionally are found, but they form an
insignificant part of the contents of a dolmen, the chief objects being
swords, arrow and spear heads, horse furniture, and other articles of
iron, many of which are plated with thin sheets of copper, coated gener-

<a se I a a iS

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 611

ally with gold and sometimes with silver. The bells, which are of the
form called by the Japanese “suzu,” are simple hollow spheres with a
slit cut in the lower half, and contain a loose piece of metal or a small
round pebble to serve the purpose of a tongue. They rarely occur
singly, but are usually cast in groups on the edges of a flat support,
furnished with a hole and tang for attachment probably to a staff or in
some cases to the trappings of a horse. They appear also to have been
used as ornamental appendages to garments and the hilts of swords.

Several plates illustrating their forms and use are exhibited. The
mirrors are the earliest examples of art castings found in Japan. Many
are decorated with very elaborate designs, and the excellence displayed
in the execution of all denotes a very advanced stage in the art of
molding and casting. Some are undoubtedly Chinese, and others are
probably native copies of the Chinese designs, but not a few are of true
Japanese workmanship. An engraving of a mirror bearing a date— the
dynastic title Wangmang—9-23 A. D., is exhibited.

The five mirrors from the province of Higo, in Kijushu, shown in the
lantern slide, are said by Japanese archeologists to be of Chinese origin.
It is impossible to assign an exact date to the older specimens; the
curator of the Imperial Museum, Tokyo, attributes the Chinese forms
to the period Han (25-220 A. D.), and I am inclined to agree with him
in this attribution. Three specimens (Gowland collection, British
Museum), which I obtained from the province of Yamato, were associ-
ated with “magatama” and other very ancient stone ornaments, and are
probably not later than the above period. These are almost certainly
Japanese. The simple geometric designs with which they are decorated
bear no relation to the more elaborate patterns seen on Chinese forms.

The largest castings of the early Iron age are curious bell-shaped
objects which are of special interest from their form and archaic orna-
ment. It has been conjectured that they are temple bells, but they
present no points of resemblance to these or to any instrument or object
connected with the ceremonies or observances of Buddhism, and are, in
fact, of earlier date than the introduction of that religion into the coun-
try. Moreover, none show any signs of having been hung. <A consider-
able number have been found—always buried in the ground—chiefly
in Yamato, Kawachi, Totomi, and the neighboring provinces.

As early as 669 A. D. the discovery of one is recorded, and this was
even then regarded as being of such a great antiquity that it was pre-
sented tothe Emperor, The designs with which they are ornamented —
the simple geometric line patterns common to many primitive races—
are also evidences of their great age. They vary in dimensions from
1 or 2 inches to 54 feet in height, those measuring 1 foot 6 inches to 3
feet being most common, and all are of extreme thinness compared with
their size. Their exact use is still a subject of dispute among arche-
ologists.

The example shown in the illustration (Pl. LXIV) measures 4 feet 6

612 TH ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

inches in height and 1 foot 8 inches in diameter at the base, and does
not exceed three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness. It is an excellent
casting, and must have been cast in a heated mold.

SEVENTH AND EIGHTH CENTURIES A. D.

Two events of marked importance in Japanese annals, on account of
their influence on the development of the arts and culture, occurred
during this period. Buddhism, which had been introduced about 552
A. D., had been adopted as the religion of the country through the
energy and enthusiasm of Prince Shotoku Taishi (593-621 A. D.), and a
fixed capital and court had, for the first time in Japanese history, been
established at Nara (709 A. D.). These two centuries form a brilliant
epoch in the history of the art of bronze founding, as in that of the
sister arts of painting and sculpture. Numerous temples—some on a
scale of great magnificence—were erected for the services of the new
religion, and the skill of both native and foreign workers in bronze was
specially enlisted for their decoration, as well a8 for the production of
statues of the divinities of Buddhism and of vessels for the ceremonies
of its ritual.

Stimulated and supported by the priesthood in their efforts to produce
objects worthy of the services of the church, the bronze founders
achieved results in those early times which have not since been sur-
passed. Unfortunately many of their works have been destroyed by
conflagrations and in the frequent spoliation of the temples during civil
wars, but a few have been preserved which are masterpieces of the art
of the modeler and founder.

Many tales record the enthusiasm with which the founders of the time
were supported by their patrons and of the stubborn manner in which,
after many repeated failures, they overcame the difficulties which beset
them. The Empress Koken (749-758) herself is said to have aided the
founders in stirring the molten metal for a statue of a Buddhist saint,
which was only completed after six unsuccessful attempts. The devel-
opment of bronze founding and the encouragement of its artists during
this period was entirely due to Buddhism, and even for many centuries
later the chief works of the art founders were executed for the adornment
of its shrines. The survival of most of the older bronzes is also solely
due to the care with which they have been preserved in temples and
monasteries by the priests of that religion.

Japanese records and traditions relating to the works of art of this
epoch, whether of the painter, sculptor, or founder, invariably speak of
the help afforded in their production by Korean or Chinese artists, and
not a few of the ancient examples which survive are even attributed
solely to them.

It is very difficult to determine how far these traditions relating to
Korean artists are trustworthy, as no traces of similar works have been
found in Korea itself; yet they all present such a close agreement on
the point, that we are almost compelled to acknowledge that, if not

perhaps true in the details they give of individual artists, yet, broadly
speaking, they may be based on facts, and that the Japanese owe to
Koreans, or probably rather to Chinese who may have come through
Korea, the first great advances which they made in the casting of bronze.

Besides the intluence which the neighboring countries—China and
Korea—had on the technique and motives of the Japanese bronze foun-
der, we have also abundant evidence of the inflnence of the art of more
distant regions. Among the treasures of the temple Horyuji (near
Nara, Yamato) are several Indian statues in bronze of Buddhist saints
and deities, and a curious ewer, which are said to have been in the pos-
session of the temple from the date of its erection in the early part of
the seventh century. The characteristic pose of the figures, the model-
ing of their features, and their jeweled headdresses have been fre-
quently copied with more or less modification, and can be distinctly
traced in many ancient Japanese statues, as well as in some of com-
paratively modern times. The ewer, a bronze casting of graceful form,
is decorated with figures of winged horses of the form of the Pegasus
of the ancients. According to Longperier (Gonse, ‘“L’ Art Japonais”) it
is undoubtedly Sassanian and of earlier date than the seventh cen-
tury. An illustration is given of it in the ‘‘ Handbook” of the ancient
articles in the temple Horyuji, which will be found on the table. This
ewer is of special interest, as, by the kindness of my friend Mr. Alfred
Cock, I am able to show you a bronze incense burner, which has been
modeled probably during the last century from one of the pegasi with
which it is ornamented. Other bronzes of foreign origin are also to be
seen in the treasure houses of several of the ancient temples in Yamato.

During the epoch, especially that part of it which has been styled the
‘Nara period” (the seven reigns during which Nara was the capital,
709-784), the great development in bronze founding was not the only
advance made in the working of metals, but the art of incised and
repoussé work in gilt copper, which had been practiced during the
early Iron age, was brought to a stage of perfection beyond which it
has never passed. A specimen of this work will be found on the table,
and others are illustrated in the colored plates near it.

The examples contained in the following list I have selected as rep-
resentative specimens of the art of bronze founding during this period
(seventh and eighth centuries).

Date 690 to 702 A. D.—Three bronze figures representing a Buddhist
trinity—Amitabha, Kwanyin, and Mahasthama—that of Amitabha
being about 9 feet in height. They resemble the Indian examples at
Horyuji in being originally gilt, but the bronze of which they consist
is of a different composition, not containing zine as an essential con-
stituent.

Date 690 to 702 A. D.—A colored seated image of Yakushi (the heal-
ing divinity), about 6 feet high, with two attendant deities, cast of a
copper-tin-lead bronze.

All the above are in the temple Yakushiji in Nara. Illustrations of

the latter group are given in two plates from the Pictorial Arts of
Japan, by Prof. J. W. Anderson, which are on the table.

Date 705 A. D—A spherical box of gilt bronze, bearing this date,
which was found in a stone sarcophagus at Ten-0-ji, near Osaka, is inter-
esting, as it is probably the oldest dated piece of Japanese metal work
in the country.

Date 708 A. D.—Bronze coins, ‘‘Wado6-zeni,” the earliest coinage in
Japan of which there is any record. According to Japanese histories
copper is said to have been discovered in the country only in 698 A. D.,
but the accuracy of this statement, for many reasons, is open to doubt,
and the discovery chronicled doubtless only relates to the finding of
deposits of ore of more than usual extent and richness. The issue of
this coinage, which was cast from copper from these deposits, was
regarded as an event of great national importance, and to commemo-
rate it the ‘“‘nen-go,” or name of the period by which the series of years
are distinguished in Japanese chronology, was altered to ‘* Wa-d6,”
which signifies Japanese copper. Besides these there were three other
distinct coinages during this century.

Date 732 A. D.—The great bronze bell of the temple Tédaiji, in Nara.
Its approximate dimensions are, height, 13 feet; diameter, 9 feet; thick-
ness, 8 to 10 inches. Its weight can not be easily determined, as its
thickness is variable, but at the lowest estimate can not be much less
than 40 tons.

Date 749 A, D.—Colossal image of Rochana or Vairotchana, in the
temple of Todaiji, commonly known as the Nara Daibutsu.

This is the largest bronze figure in the country. It has not, however,
been cast in one piece, but is constructed chiefly of numerous pieces of
comparatively small size. Some of the lower portions have been cast
by building up the mold on the parts already finished, but the greater
part of the image consists of separate castings, which have been united
by running in an alloy containing large proportions of tin and lead
between their edges.

The following dimensions are those given on a wood engraving of the
image—one of which is exhibited—sold by the priests of the temple, and
may be considered as only approximately accurate: Height, 53.2 feet;
breadth of face, 9.4 feet; length of eye, 5.9 feet; thickness, variable,
3 to 12 inches.

The figure is seated on a huge lotus flower with fifty-six external
petals, each of which measures 10 feet 6 inches by 6 feet, and appears
to be a single casting. Twice it has been partially destroyed by con-
flagrations and once by an earthquake, The present head, cast in the
sixteenth century, is extremely ugly, destitute of any trace of the
grace and refined expression of the earlier statues, and not at all in
harmony with the ancient parts of the figure.

The authorities of the temple state that the image is composed of
‘““shakudo” (a copper alloy containing gold). They also give the weights
of the copper, tin, gold, and mercury, which were used in casting it, and

ee eee

these statements have been repeated by many writers. They are alto-
gether without any foundation in fact. I have had many opportunities
of examining it, and although I never succeeded in getting a portion
for analysis, yet from the streak, hardness, and color of the metal it is
undoubtedly a variety of ‘‘karakane” (a copper-tin-lead alloy), and the
gold and mercury said to have been used in its manufacture were sim-
ply employed for gilding its surface and not as constituents of the alloy
of which it is east. Four hundred and fifty tons of metal are said to
have been used in its construction. If its average thickness is as
much as 7 inches, and it is probably less, its weight must be less than
300 tons. The two following objects are examples of the smaller works
of the period:

Date 749 A. D.—Bronze bell, with curious ornamental tongue, now in
the temple Todaiji (Nara). Dated 2d day, 5th month, Ist year Tembyo
Sho-ho. This is of importance, as it is another of the earliest bronzes
which bears a date, but, unfortunately, no artist’s name.

Date eighth century.—Lantern of bronze and incised gilt copper in the
courtyard of the same temple. Its eight sides are decorated with Bud-
dhist figures, conventional representations of hares and other animals,
and fine arabesques in open work. A photograph of this lantern is
exhibited. .

A gong-shaped bell, suspended between two well-modeled dragons
belonging to the temple Ko-buku-ji, in Nara, is attributed to this period.

A Buddhist image from the collection of M. Bing, of Paris, of the
the same period.

FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE NINTH TO THE END OF THE TWELFTH
CENTURY.

Near the close of the preceding epoch the court was removed to the
city of Kioto, which from that time (794 A. D.) up to 1868 continued to
be the imperial capital. This removal of the court was a severe blow
to the art life of the ancient city; and the works and traditions of its
old bronze founders soon appear to have been forgotten or neglected in
the new metropolis.

From the beginning of the ninth until near the end of the twelfth
century, a space of nearly four hundred years, we have a period of stag-
nation if not of decadence in all art, yet, strange to say, it embraces
the golden age of literature, during which the famous classical romances
were written. Its first half, as shown by these romances, was marked
by effeminacy; during its second the country was plunged in civil war.
The romances gives us but little information of the individual and art
life of the people, and the pages of its histories are solely devoted to
records of the jealousies and feuds of the great families of Fujiwara,
Taira, and Minamoto.

Until near its termination we have no record of the erection of any
temple of note or of the execution of any great art work; and I have
been unable to find any examples of the art of the bronze founder
616 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

during the entire period, excepting two insignificant boxes for holding
seals (dated respectively 998 and 1098 A. D.) and nine distinet coin-
ages of bronze money (from 810 to 958 A. D.). After this last date even
the coinage of money appears to cease, and is not resumed until 1457
A, D.—five hundred years afterwards.

THIRTEENTH CENTURY.

During the last years of the twelfth century, when peace was estab-
lished throughout the country by the victories of Yoritomo, there are
the first signs of a revival of the old art of the Nara period. From
1190 A. D. up to the date of his death (1198 A. D.), this remarkable
warrior devoted all his energies to the cultivation and advancement

of the arts of peace. Stimulated by his example and enthusiasm, the -

artistic spirit of the people was aroused from its dormant condition,
and for nearly a hundred years we have a notable period of renaissance
in art, a period chiefly remarkable in the history of bronze for the
casting of that magnificent masterpiece the colossal image of Amit-
Abha, usually called the Daibutsu of Kamakura. This image, one of the
finest examples of bronze founding, can not be adequately described
by any word painting; it must be actually seen in the midst of its
grove of conifers and evergreens to appreciate fully its grandeur and
beauty, its soberness of design, and noble expression of majesty and
repose. It stands alone and incomparable among all the chefs d’ceuvre
of Japanese bronze founders.

Although slightly smaller than the great Buddha of Nara, it far
excels it in artistic execution. Like it it has been cast in segments,
but these have been “burned together” with bronze of similar compo-
sition to that of the image itself, the exterior of the joints having been
subsequently finished by chiseling.

Japanese histories relate that it was cast about the middle of the
thirteenth century (begun 1252 A, D.) by Ono Goroyemon, one of the
first bronze founders whose name is recorded. Its dimensions, taken
from a woodcut sold to pilgrims who visit its shrine, are as follows:
Height, 49 feet 7 inches; length of face, 8 feet 5 inches; breadth from
knee to knee, 35 feet 8 inches.

The measurements of both this and the Nara Buddha, however,
require revision; the heights in both cases are, | think, exaggerated,
and should have 6 or 7 feet deducted from them. Its thickness is vari-
able, ranging from 14 inches to 3 or 4 inches, or even more in some of
the castings, and its weight will not probably exceed 150 tons.

Other bronze images of the divinities of the Buddhist hierarchy, of
less colossal proportions and of varying degrees of excellence, were
made for the temples of Yamato and Kioto, one of the chief groups
being a trinity for the ancient monastery Horyuji. Several bells were
also cast, one at Kamakura being worthy of note, as the record given
of it indicates the source of the metal from which they were occasion-
ally made. It is said that 300,000 copper coins, which had been

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 617

collected by the priests of the temple, were melted down for casting it,
and the metal being insufficient, the casting was a failure; 30,000 more
coins were then collected for addition to the defective bell, when it was
remelted. It is also recorded that copper coins were similarly melted
up for casting Buddhist images and ornamental utensils, hence it would
appear that it was not then deemed necessary to use a different alloy
for bells and art castings than for coins.

FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.

During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we have again a period
of decadence, with the exception of two short brilliant intervals, the first
during the supremacy of the Ashikaga Shogun, Yoshimitsu (1368-1493
A. D.), and the second during that of Ashikaga Y oshimasa (1440-1471 A.
L.). For the greater part of this period the country was again in a state
of unrest and intestine conflict, and the arts of peace found but little
encouragement, excepting so far as they contributed to the needs of war.

Workers in iron are brilliantly represented by one of the greatest of
the famous forgers of sword blades, Masamune, and by several dis-
tinguished armorers and smiths of the renowned Miochin family; but
the bronze founder was not in request. His chief work during these
two centuries was a colossal figure of the Buddha Vairotchana, cast
during the time of Yoshimasa for the temple at Hase (Kamakura). I
have not seen this image, but it is said to be an admirable casting and
to measure 30 feet 6 inches in height.

Two bronzes which were exhibited at Nara in 1888 represent the
smaller castings of the period, one an incense burner, which was pre-
sented by the hero Kusunoki Masa-shige (first half of the fourteenth
century) to the temple at Hase (Yamato), and a war bell also given by
him to the Emperor Godaigo.

SIXTEENTH CENTURY.

In the last decade of this century, after another period of civil war,
the patron of art and culture is again a famous warrior, Hideyoshi
(often known as Taiko Sama). Although then engaged in war with
Korea, the closing years of his life were devoted to peaceful pursuits at
home, and in imitation of Yoritomo at Kamakura, he erected a huge
Buddha and a temple to contain it at Kioto. On the destruction of
the image, which was of wood, by an earthquake only eight years after
its erection, he contemplated replacing it by one of bronze, but the
execution of this was delayed by his death (1598 A. D.), and was only
accomplished by his son and widow sixteen years afterwards.

No large bronzes of importance appear to have been cast during this
century. ‘Two specimens of the smaller bronzes are exhibited, one a
a figure of Yakushi (the healing divinity), belonging to my friend Mr.
Alfred Cock, in which the deityis represented holding a erystal ball, an
emblem of purity,in his left hand. It bears the names of its dedicators
to the temple and the date 1569.
618 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

The other is a bell of the form known as “ waniguchi,” crowned with
the figure of a tortoise encircled by the coils of a neue kindly lent by
my friend Mr. Harding Smith. It also bears the nameof its dedicator
and the date 1595.

Several specimens of dedicatory bronzes of this time are to be found
not only in Buddhist temples but alsoin Shinto shrines. Two examples
of the latter may be mentioned, although they are notable rather for
the fame of their donors than for their artistic excellence; a gigantic
bell of similar form to the last offered by Hideyoshi to the Shinto shrine
at Nachi (Kyushu) and a large mirror (3 feet diameter) dedicated to
the Tenjin Miya at Kitano (Kioto) by Kato Kiyomasa, one of Hideyoshi’s
noted generals in the Korean campaign.

I can not omit to show you on the screen a magnificent bronze in the
famous Cernuschi collectionin Paris, which is attributed to this period.
It is supported on a pedestal of rich open work, and is decorated with
gourds and an heraldic representation of the leaf and flowers of the
Paulownia imperialis.

Another splendid example of “cera perduta” casting of this period
is a group of egrets, standing upon an inverted lotus leaf, which has
been kindly lent by my friend Mr. Alfred Cock.

SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND FIRST HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH.

In 1603 Tokugawa Iyeyasu, a man of remarkable ability, both as a
warrior and as a statesman, succeeded to the Shogunate, and by his
wisdom and foresight established on firm foundations the Japanese
system of feudalism, which, under the rule of his successors, gave
absolute peace to the country for more than two and a half centuries,
and resulted in an advance and development of the arts LL EIB e
in any previous age.

During the supremacy of these Tokugawa Shoguns, the painter, the
lacquerer, the potter, and the founder were encouraged and stimulated
as they had never been before to bring their respective arts to the high-
est point of excellence; and it is in nosmall degree owing to the works
which they produced during this period that Japan owes the promi-
nent position which she now so deservedly occupies in the world of art.

The first great works of the bronze founders of the seventeenth
century were a colossal figure of the Buddhist divinity Rochana, in
Kioto, to replace the wooden image destroyed by an earthquake in the
previous century, and a huge bell for its temple.

The figure is said to have been 584 feet high, and from the records
regarding the first attempt to cast it, it would appear that it was cast
in situ and in segments, the mold being built up on the parts already
finished. It would thus, when completed, have been practically a
Single piece of metal. This attempt was a failure, as when casting
the lower part of the head the wooden scaffolding was set on fire
by the operations and the image partly melted, It was successfully
completed in 1614, but only forty-eight years afterwards, like its wooden

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 619

predecessor, it was destroyed by an earthquake. According to official
records its fragments were melted in 1668-1683 and cast into the
bronze coins (Kwan-ei-tsu-ho) then current.!

This record is interesting, as it affords another proof that the alloy
used by bronze founders did not differ much in composition, if at all,
from that in use at the time in the mints for coins. I have analyzed
these coins, with the following results: Individual coins differed con-
siderably from one another in composition, the percentage of copper
present varying from 69.8 to 86.8, a variation not greater, however,
than might be expected from the nature of the alloy and the mode in
which it was cast. Hence, in order to ascertain their average composi-
tion, 7,600 pieces were melted together, and the resulting metal was
analyzed and found to consist of—

We may hence not unreasonably conclude that this represents,
approximately, the composition of the alloy which was used for
casting the colossal Buddha.

The bell is the largest in
Japan. Its dimensions are, ap-
proximately, height, 14 feet;
external diameter at the mouth,
9 feet; thickness at the rim,
102 inches. In section these
bells differ from European
form in having the rim thick-
ened internally, so that their
mouths are constricted. (lig.

tion which causes the gentle
rising and falling tones which
characterize the boom of all
Japannese bells. It is hardly

from the bell tower and swung like a battering ram. The point
struck is a low boss, which sometimes has the form of a lotus flower.

1There is another record of the conversion of Buddhist statues in coins in 1450-1470.
620 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

Two other similar bells were cast during the first half of this century,
seventeenth, details of which are given in the following table:

« The weight of this bell is often erroneously given by writers as 74 tons.

The exact average thickness of these bells can not be ascertained
without special measurements, which are not permitted, but it can not
exceed 8 inches, the thickness I have assumed for the above calcula-
tions, and may possibly be somewhat less. The casting of a large bell
in old times in Japan was an important event, and was accompanied by
religious ceremonies and popular rejoicings. On the day appointed for
running the metal into the mold a grand festival was held at the tem-
ple in the grounds of which the founding operations were performed,
and people of all ranks came from far and near with contributions, many
with offerings of mirrors, hairpins, and metal ornaments, to be added
to the bronze in the furnaces. On one occasion, that of the founding
of the great bell of Z6-j6-ji, the Shogun himself (Iye-mitsu) was not
only present, but took part in the direction of the operations. In
succeeding years the day was not forgotten, but its anniversary was
celebrated by temple feasts.

The fame and repute of this “ golden” period in the bronze founder’s
art does not however rest on the above castings, which are chiefly
remarkable for their size and weight, but on those now to be described,
many of which are masterpieces of design, modeling, and technical
skill.

The oldest of these are the bronzes cast for the mortuary chapels and
tombs of the early Tokugawa Shoguns and members of their families.
At the famous mausoleum at Nikko there are some grand examples, one
of the most notable being the tomb of Lyeyasu (the first Tokugawa Sho-
gun, died 1604 A. D.), a fine casting in bronze, with bronze gates, dis-
tinguished by impressive simplicity and chasteness of design (PI. LXV).
In front of the tomb are the three ceremonial ornaments (Sangusoku) of
the Buddhist altar, viz, a vase, incense buruer, and candlestick, all of
the severe style of the period.

The gates (Pl. LX VI) are splendid examples of bronze founding.
Almost their whole surface is covered with delicate diaper and floral
patterns, upon which ground the bolderornamentation is molded in relief.
These consist of representations of the “chakra,” or Buddhist wheel of

the law, and floral designs, most of which are coated with gold. In
front are the two fabulous animals (Koma-inu and Ama-inu) supposed
to represent lions.

The tomb of Iyemitsn (third Tokuwaga Shogun, died 1649 A. D.)
closely resembles that of Lyeyasu in form, but the reliefs on its bronze
- gates are simply Sanscrit characters in medallions. These tombs are
situated in a grove behind the chapels and oratory, and their simplicity
presents a striking contrast to the magnificence of these edifices, which
are the most richly decorated shrines in the world. It is said that their
plain and simple design is intended as a concrete expression of the
Buddhist aphorism that ‘at death there is an end to all magnificence.”

Numerous large standard lanterns (toro) of bronze (PI. LX VII), con-
tributed by the territorial nobles, who vied with one another in thus doing
honor to their departed chiefs, line the courtyards of the shrines. Many
hundreds of these “toro,” which were favorite votive offerings of the
wealthy both to Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, were cast during
this period of revival in bronze founding. They adorn the approaches
and grounds of every temple of note in the country, those of Z0-j0-ji
(Tokyo) alone number more than two hundred!

Each group or pair differs from any other, yet in outline and decora-
tion all are in harmony; and if no other examples of bronze founding
were in existence, the gracefulness of form and fertility of design which
characterizes all would alone mark their modelers and founders as art-
ists of the firstrank. It will be noticed that both of these in the illus-
tration, although of the same general form, differ entirely in decoration.

The mausolea of other Tokugawa Shoguns also afford some fine
examples of the bronze founders’ art, notably the tombs of Iye-tsuna
(1650-1680), and Tsunayoshi (1681-1708), at Uyena (Tokyo), and of Iye-
nobu (1709-1712), at Shiba (Tokyo). They are of similar form to those
at Nikko, differing from them chiefly in the more elaborate decoration of
their gates. Finely modeled dragons and the armorial badge of the
Tokugawas ornament the gates of Lye-nobu’s tomb, while in the tomb
of Tsunayoshi—who was a noted patron of art—there is still a further
departure from the simple style of earlier times, the symbolical combi-
nations of the fabulous unicorn (Kirin) and pine tree, the phoenix (H00)
and paulownia, and of the pine, bamboo, and plum being perhaps
almost too lavishly employed.

Another important bronze at Nikko, representative of the period, is
a bronze column (1649 A. D.), termed s0-rin-to, 42 feet in height, a form
of the Indian “stupa,” as introduced into Japan through China. Before
removal to its present site it stood near the tomb of [yeyasu, and was
doubtless erected there in accordance with the Chinese superstitious
beliefs in the efficacy of such structures in warding off evil influences
and insuring the protection of Heaven. Besides these, four huge lotus

petals, for the base of the image of the Daibutsu at Kamakura, were
cast at the beginning of the eighteenth century (1717). A small bronze
of the seventeenth century I am enabled to show you through the kind-
ness of Mr. W. Cleverly Alexander; it is an incense burner, in the
form of two rats, by Meiho. Also a candlestick for the Buddhist altar,
decorated with a dragon coiled round its stem, from the collection of
Mr. Alfred Cock. Two other candlesticks of the seventh century, or
probably earlier, have been kindly lent by Mr. E. W. Hennell.

FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY UP TO THE
PRESENT TIME.

Hitherto the skill of the bronze founders had been chiefly exerted in
the preduction of colossal images and other huge castings for the tem-
ple of Buddha, and in giving a severe beauty to the forms and orna-
ments of utensils and implements for ceremonial purposes; but during
this period, with the continuation of peace, their art found a wider
range in the designing of objects for secular use for the decoration of
the home and the everyday needs of life.

Shortly before, the okimono, or ornament, a thing of no practical
utility, but only of display, had been introduced, and this specially
opened up to the artist a rich and unlimited field for the exercise of his
ingenuity and skill in the art of ornament and design. The vase, too,
formerly used only as a ceremonial vessel of the Buddhist altar, now
became a necessary object for the adornment of private life, and in its
form and decoration the artist was no longer hampered by the old trad1-
tions and rules of the church. The founders of this period hence are
not chiefly notable, as in earlier times, for the works destined for the
services of Buddhism or the embellishment of its shrines, although
many remarkable castings were made, principally standard lanterns,
dedicated as votive offerings to temples and monasteries, and torii, or
gateways of Shinto shrines, but owe their world-wide fame to the skill
and fertility of design exhibited in the objects above mentioned for
household use, many of which are masterpieces of form and ornament.
The following characteristic examples of Buddhist art can not, however,
be omitted from my account of this period:

Date 1736 A. D.—A fine image of Sakya-muni, in the grounds of
Zojoji (Tokyo).

Date 1765 A. D.—A colossal figure of Kwanyin, 9 to 10 feet high,
near the post town of Futagawa, on the Tokaido.

Date 1778 A. D.—An image of Sakya-muni (7 to 8 feet high?), in the
courtyard of Jo-shin-ji, Tokyo.

End of eighteenth century.—Animage of Amitabha, formerly at Meguro,
near Tokyo, now in the Cernuschi collection (Paris). Height from the
base of the lotus flower to the top of the nimbus 14 feet 9 inches.

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 623

Mr. Alfred Cock, is an excellent example of the Buddhist art of the
period.

The period is also marked by an important naturalistic monument
in the schools of both pictorial and glyptie art.

They had up to this time followed the older men in basing their
designs on the traditions of Buddhism and the forms and motives of
Chinese and occasionally of Indian art, but now they began to break
away from the trammels by which they were bound to these old con-
ventional forms and motives, and to go to nature for their inspirations
and models.

It should, however, be remembered that much as the works, espe-
cially of Chinese artists, were admired, mere slavish copies were never
or rarely made of them; thus in the bronzes even of the early days, the
figures of Buddhist divinities, there is a serenity of expression and
graceful arrangement of drapery which we look for in vain in the mas-
terpieces of Chinese art. Nearly contemporaneous with the establish.
ment of the Shijo-rui—the school of naturalistic painting—in Kioto,
by the famous painter Okyo, we find the art founders adopting these
new motives and new modes of representing the old. Stiff geometric
designs give place to those based on natural forms, and even in repre-
sentations of the mythical dragon we see, as has been pointed out by
Professor Anderson, ‘distinct evidences of direct study of snake form.”

Students of natural objects, of plant’and animal life, were now made,
the designs of the naturalistic painters were followed, and an impulse
was given to the art of bronze founding greater than had been known
since the Nara period.

For a little more than three-quarters of a century we have another
golden age in its history, during which a succession of brilliant artists,
distinguished by marvelous technical skill and originality of design,
worthily maintained the best traditions of the founders’ art, and Japan
attained a position in cera perduta casting which she had never reached
before.

Two men, Seimin and Toiin, stand out prominently during the closing
years of the last century and the first quarter of the present. Others,
among whom should be mertioned Harutoshi, Kunihisa, Kamejo, Teijo,
Taiichi, approach these great masters in skill, even occasionally proving
their equals. The work of these famous artists is well represented by
the specimens on the table, the most important of which are from the
collections of my friends Mr. Alfred Cock, Mr. Mills, Mr. Alfred Par-
sons, and Mr. J. M. Swan, and by Pl. LX VIII, fig. 1, a group of tortoises
from the collection of Mr. J. M. Swan, and Pl. LX VIII, fig. 2, a brazier

In examining their works it will be noticed that, as among the paint-
ers, several were specially distinguished for their skill in the repre-
sentation of certain motives—Sosen as a painter of monkeys, Ganku

of tigers, Okyo of carp, etc.—so among the founders several are
similarly renowned; thus Seimin chiefly owes his fame to the perfect
modeling of his tortoises, Toiin Somin for the vigor and life expressed
in their dragons, and Kamejo for the delicate and truthful rendering of
her quails. It is needless to say that they did not confine themselves
to these, but executed other works not less demonstrative of their skill.

The human figure, however, does not form part of their naturalistic
studies. The forms and movements of lower animal life are expressed
with a truthfulness which has never been surpassed, but in representing
man they seem rarely to have been able to free themselves from the
conventionalities of the art dogmas of the old Sinico-Japanese schools,
and seldom show even traces of that close observation of nature which
characterizes their other works.

One of the finest examples is a seated figure of Ban-kurobé in the
garb of a pilgrim, cast by Murata Kunihisa, in 1783 (now in the famous
Cernuschi collection, Paris). Pl. LXIX.

Portrait statues are of extreme rarity, those representing famous
personages being merely conventional creations which are supposed to
portray the type or class to which they belonged rather than the indi-
viduals themselves. This example would seem to be one in which an
attempt has been made to produce with truthfulness a characteristic
likeness of the man whom it is intended to commemorate.

With the death of the last representative of this brilliant group of
art founders near the end of the first half of the present century, the
art gradually passed into a stage of decadence, the lowest depths of
which it but recently reached, and from which it is only just emerging.

Vast numbers of bronzes have indeed been cast, but they are too
often of meretricious design and tawdry ornament, er debased copies
of the creations of Seimin, Toitin, and their distinguished contempora-
ries. Fortunately there are a few notable exceptions to this later
statement. In the first decades of the second half of this century.
Dosai, Gid6, Somin, Joun, Tanchosai, Toryusai, and Izan (specimens of
whose works are exhibited) did much excellent work, and ably sustained
under considerable difficulties the reputation of their famous predeces-
sors. Among more recent founders, a distinguished position should be
given to Suzuki Chokichi (now living), whose well-known magnificent
example of cera perduta casting isin the South Kensington Museum.
It is an ancient incense burner with doves and peacocks, the doves
especially being masterpieces of modeling, and an embodiment in
bronze of the highest developments of the naturalistic school, of which
Chokichi is an earnest and ardent follower.

And I here should like to say a word on the excessive crude and vul-
gar ornament which disfigures too many modern Japanese bronzes.
Such ornament is never found on any vase, brazier, or other object
intended for use by the Japanese themselves, but is confined to those
articles specially made for sale to foreigners. (The collection exhibited

to illustrate the forms and ornaments of Japanese bronzes before the
opening of the country to foreign trade amply demonstrates this.)
These are all veritable ‘“ pot-boilers ” vast by men often capable of doing
better things, who earn more by the production of these vulgar mon-
strosities for exportation than others who still endeavor to follow the
simple canons of Japanese art. Modern Japanese bronze founders,
like their brethren in pictorial art, hence work in an adverse environ-
ment, and under many disadvantages unknown to their predecessors.
In the early centuries religious enthusiasm, the quiet seclusion of the
monastery, and the patronage of a powerful priesthood stimulated,
fostered, and supported the old artists in their work, so that all their
powers were put forth in the execution of the grand masterpieces of
those times.

In later times the same result was achieved under the system of
feudalism which prevailed in the country. Workers in bronze were
attached to the courts of the greater daimyos (territorial noble);
their incomes were secure, they were free to work out their designs as
they wished, and need only do so when they felt inspired.

During recent years the Emperor has done much for the encourage-
ment of a select few of the chief art workers in bronze in the revival
of their old art, the result being that some of the objects of modern
work which adorn the imperial palace are of extreme beauty, and
equal those of the older masters in gracefulness of form and sobriety
of ornament. But for the great majority there is no such patronage,
yet the bronze founders must live, and to live means for too many that
they must waste their talents in producing work in designing which they
are hampered by the demands of commerce and the chief, or rather sole,
end of which is merely pecuniary remuneration. Up to the eighteenth
century we rarely find the name of the artist or founder attached to
any bronze. Most of the existing specimens of the earlier bronzes
were made, as we have seen, for use in the ceremonies and ritual of
the Buddhist religion, and were not usually allowed to bear any name,
excepting when they were ex voto offerings, and then only the names
of the donors. The records of the temples are also silent, with few
exceptions, even on the authorship of the grand masterpieces to which
they often owe their popularity and fame. The dedicators alone are
remembered and the artists forgotten. Being almost invariably men of
plebeian origin, the bronze founders occupied a lower status in life than
the caligrapher, painter, or armorer, and their lives have not been
thought worthy of record. All the knowledge we have of even the
great masters of the last generation is derived solely from their works

Several charming specimens of both the larger and smaller bronzes,
especially of the latter, as late as the last hundred years, are unfortu-
nately not signed (see especially the candlesticks of fine open work lent
by Sir Trevor Lawrence), and many of equal merit are signed by artists
whose names do not appear in the lists of noted bronze workers. So

that the materials for a history of the men themselves, such as has been
compiled of their fellow-artists the painters, do not exist; and are but
scanty and incomplete, even for a record of their works.

This will conclude the first part of my paper. I must apologize for
the fragmentary character of the account I have attempted to give you
of the rise and development of bronze founding in Japan, and will ask
you to regard it merely as a collection of notes which may be of use in
the compilation of its history when further materials are brought to
light. I have purposely omitted from it the consideration of the guards
(tsuba) and other furniture of the sword, because they are more partic-
ularly the work of the chaser and carver of metals than of the founder,
‘and also because the subjects of their designs and their technical exe-
cution extends over such a wide field that a special paper would be
required for their adequate treatment.

THE TECHNICS OF JAPANESE BRONZE FOUNDING.

Several methods of casting metals have been practiced by the Jap-
anese. In the earliest times molds of stone, in which the shape of the
object was cut, sufficed for the simple forms of their ancient weapon;
and although they are no longer employed in the casting of bronze,
their use still survives in the casting of lead for some industrial pur-
poses, and of small silver bars, which have subsequently to be worked
with the hammer into jewelry and ornaments. Somewhat later, molds
of clay were introduced, probably by Chinese, and it is almost certain
that contemporaneous with their adoption the method of cera perduta
casting was first practiced.

Casting in molds of sand or loam is also of an early date. In 708
A. D. it was in use in the mint for the production of bronze coins. At
present it is chiefly employed for small or flat objects—plain or only
roughly ornamented—and for castings for industrial uses.

These methods have been followed in some form or other by almost
THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 627

all nations, but I may mention en passant—although it hardly comes
within the scope of this paper—another method which is essentially
Japanese, i. e., the casting of refined copper in canvas molds in hot
water. Specimens of copper so cast for the use of the bronze founder
are on the table. It is also used occasionally, but rarely, for silver,
never for bronze.

One mode of casting they have never practiced, that is, what is
called the “ascending” method, in which the ingates are so arranged
that the molten metal enters the mold at its base and gradually rises
and fills its cavity. They have, however, introduced a modification in
the “descending,” or ordinary method—which will be described later—
to minimize some of its disadvantages, the chief of which are, as is well
known to founders, the occasional formation of ‘cold sets”! on the
core and sides of the mold, and unsoundness in the castings due to the
entanglement of air in the streams of metal when falling from the top
of a high mold.

It will be seen from the descriptions which follow of the operations
of the Japanese bronze founder that, while in their general features
they have much in common with those of the bronze founder in Europe,
they present some differences of greater or less importance, differ.
ences which are chiefly found in certain details of manipulation which
are the results of the conditions under which the Japanese founder
has worked, the composition of his chief alloy, and the nature of his
training.

Before proceeding to consider these operations, we will first glance
briefly at the founder himself. He was—as I have stated above—
almost without exception of the plebeian class of the people, and
although many at various periods were men of marvelous ability and
of the highest merit as artists, yet they seem never to have ranked
higher than artisans. Several sculptors in metal, who were specially
distinguished for their skill in the design and ornament of the furni-
ture of the sword, and many noted smiths, forgers of famous blades
and of armor, were indeed elevated above this grade, and had the
honor of receiving complimentary titles in recognition of their ability;
but I have not succeeded in finding a single example of an art founder
having been similarly honored.

No special courses of study, such as were followed by painters, were
open tohim. A knowledge of the principles and practice of his art had
to be obtained under a system of apprenticeship, whicli had much in
common with that in vogue in Europe during the latter part of the
Middle Ages, and in which drudgery and household work absorbed not
a little of his time. As an apprentice he was bound to serve his master
for a fixed term of years, during which his duties were not only to assist

628 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

in the actual work of the foundry and studio, but also to attend to the
personal wants of his master. He lived in his master’s house, was fed
and clothed by him, and became in fact a minor member of his family.

During his apprenticeship he was taught every branch of the found-
er’s art, from the rough work of mixing and tempering clay for molds,
and the making of crucibles, to the highest stages of designing and
modeling objects in wax and of subsequently casting them in bronze.
After long years of faithful work, if distinguished by special ability,
he might be selected by his master as his successor, and at least was
entitled to receive from him a modest sum of money, either as a loan
or a gift, sufficient to enable him to establish a small atelier of his own.

The foundry of the artist always now forms part of his dwelling
house, and doubtless this was the case in earlier times. Special rooms
are set apart for drawing, modeling, and the preparation of the molds,
the rougher operation of molding being carried on in sheds at the side
of the garden or yard. The foundry itself, in which the metal is melted

-and cast, is also situated in the yard. <A special feature in many is the

well-arranged garden on which the modeling rooms open, so that the
artist works amid cheerful surroundings, which must influence his work
for good. The working staff consists of the artist, his apprentices, the
members of his family, all of whom, even the children, assist in some of
the operations, and one or two workmen. Castings from models designed
by the artist himself form sometimes the sole work of the foundry, but
generally other work is undertaken, and castings are then made of
objects which have been modeled by other artists who send their molds
ready prepared merely to be filled with metal.

The Japanese processes of casting bronze and the appliances and
materials used, which I shall now endeavor to describe, are those which
I have seen from time to time in the art foundries of Osaka during
my residence there, and I have to ask for your indulgence if I burden
you with some dry and apparently trivial metallurgical details which
may be uninteresting to those who are not specially concerned with the
melting of metals. I will, however, try to deal with them as briefly as
possible.

This part of my subject may be conveniently divided into the follow-
ing sections:

1. Preparation of the mold and core. In clay; in sand or loam.

2. The furnace and foundry appliances.

3. The operations of casting.

4. The alloys used.

5. Stains and patinas.

1.—PREPARATION OF THE MOLD AND CORE (IN CLAY).

The materials used for modeling and the preparation of the mold and
core are as follows: Vegetable wax, prepared chiefly from the fruit of
Rhus succedanea; it possesses great fluidity when melted, but has the

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAY. 629

disadvantage of being extremely brittle in cold weather; beeswax;
resin, obtained from various conifers, chiefly Pinus massoniana and
densiflora; clay, raw and burned; river sand; chopped rice straw;
rice husks. Various mixtures of vegetable wax and resin, to which
beeswax is sometimes added, also of beeswax and resin alone, are used
for modeling, according to the character of the design of the object, and
the extent and nature of its ornament. For castings of the highest
class, and especially for those with delicate lines and forms or ornament,
the latter mixtures are always employed, the former being used only for
large or common works of simple shapes, with rough or little decora-
tion. The clays used in Osaka and Kioto are obtained from the hills
of decomposed granite in the neighborhood. They are extremely plastic,
but are not very refractory, as they contain considerable amounts of the
alkalies.

Great care is devoted to their “tempering,” which is effected by many
months, even years, of exposure to the weather, with frequent turning
over in the yard or sheds of the foundry. They are always mixed for
use with varying proportions of old fire bricks in both fine and coarse
powder, and when employed for large or solid cores with coarsely
chopped rice straw, rice husks, and river sand. Special importance is
attached to the use of the oldest clay for the preparation of molds and
hollow cores, as it has been found by experience that they are then
much stronger and less liable to crack than when made of newer mate-
rial. The amount of rough usage these molds will bear without injury
is very surprising. I have seen them rolled over the rough floor of the
foundry from one end to the other and yet yield perfect castings. The
core, which is one of the most important parts of the mold, possesses
some curious features which are specially characteristic of Japanese
foundry practice. For small figures it is generally solid, and these differ
but little from those in common use everywhere; in other cases it is
always hollow.

The hollow core—this is used by the Japanese whenever possible—is
of two kinds, in one of which it is closed at one end; in the other both
ends are open. The chief peculiarity of the former is its thinness,
compared with similar cores in Europe, otherwise it does not differ
much from them. I will hence only describe in detail the latter, or
open core, as it has many peculiarities, and is particularly distinctive
of the methods of founding adopted by artists. In its usual form
its thickness is not much, sometimes not at all, greater than that of
the outer shell of the mold; in fact, it merely forms its inner wall;
and, in order that this kind of core may be employed almost all
castings, even of vases, braziers, and similar objects, are cast without
a bottom, the bottom being cast separately and subsequently attached
by means of solder. It is usually fashioned on a wooden framework,
the parts of which are ingeniously arranged, so that it can be with-
drawn as soon as the entire mold has been finished and dried. This

framework, an example of which is shown in plan and section in fig. 2,
is constructed as follows: A sufficient number of flat strips of wood,

REMOVABLE CORE FRAME.

A A, resembling templates, are
prepared, their external edges
being roughly cut to the shape
of the interior of the article to
be cast. Two circular disks of
wood, B B, each in two seg-
ments, and furnished with a
central hole, are also prepared
to form the top and bottom of
the frame. The above strips
are then arranged around the
peripheries of the disks, and
are kept in position by means
of wires or cords. A bar of
wood, C, of suitable length, is
then passed through the aper-
ture in the disks, and the frame-
work is firmly attached to it
by wedges. The object of this
bar is to enable the core to be
moved about or revolved, and
so to facilitate the work of the
modeler. Thin strips of bam-
boo, or sometimes a cord of
straw, or both, are now bound
round the exterior of the frame.
The core is then molded on it
to the proper thickness with a
mixture of burned and raw
clay, and rice husks applied in
several layers, the lower layers
being coarser and more porous
than those above them, and
the exact form is given to it
by one or two final coatings of
clay mixed with sand. After
the core has been dried the
vase or other object is modeled
on it in wax of the proper com-
position (see above). Wooden
or metal stamps are sometimes

used for molding Chinese characters and parts of the ornament, but
only for the commonest articles, the whole of the modeling of all others

being performed by hand.

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 631

A drawing or rough model is sometimes used by the artist for his
guidance, but not unfrequently he works without either, and even when
using them he does not merely copy their lines or the exact details of
their ornament; in fact, often he departs from them altogether, if he
feels that by a modification of their outlines or decoration the beauty
of his subject may be increased.

In preparing this model on the core he exerts his utmost skill; no
plaster casts are made from it; if the casting is a failure, his work—it
may have been a masterpiece—is lost, but if successful, it bears in
imperishable bronze all the subtle and delicate touches of his hand.
When the model is completed the ingates or openings C C C C and
D D D (fig. 7), through which the metal is poured into the mold, and
the necessary outlets for the escape of the air and gases and for running
out the wax, are molded on it, and in some objects pins of bronze are
inserted in it to aid in keeping the core in position. The ingates for
castings of moderate size, especially for those of considerable height,
are not placed only at the top of the mold, but also in one or more tiers
around its sides. Thus in fig. 7 we have four ingates (A A A A) a
little above the middle, and three (B B B) on the top of the mold. The
object in thus placing them being to diminish some of the disadvan-
tages of the ‘‘descending” method of casting which have been pre-
viously alluded to. For thin castings this practice is extremely
successful, a much smaller proportion being defective from vesicular
structure caused by entangled air, from burned patches. and from “cold
sets,” than when the ingates are all at the top.

The wax model is now coated with a thin layer of fine clay, applied
with a brush with great care. After drying, other layers are similarly
applied, until the crust is sufficiently thick to permit additional layers
of somewhat coarser clays to be put on with the hand and tools, to give
the requisite strength to the mold. The mixture of clays for the first
layers is very carefully prepared, and is sometimes mixed with finely
powdered porcelain, to prevent them from being melted by the molten
metal. The formation of a fused crust on the casting, which is always
difficult to remove, destroys its surface, and mars the sharpness of its
designs, is thus avoided.

The mold is then dried very slowly in a warm part of the foundry.
When dry, the wooden core is removed and the wax is then melted out
by means of a carefully regulated charcoal fire, by which both the hol-
low core and the outside of the mold are heated, and at the same time
all traces of moisture are expelled and its walls baked hard.

PREPARATION OF THE MOLD (IN SAND OR LOAM).

Molding in sand or loam has not been extensively practiced by the
Japanese for artistic castings, with the exception—as I have stated
above—of flat objects, such as coins and mirrors, and others of simple
forms in which no parts of the ornament are in undercut relief. Hyen
632 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

in many cases in which the use of a sand or loam mold was perfectly
admissible, a clay mold seems to have been preferred because it could
be heated before it was filled with metal,.a point to which much
importance is attached. Their methods of molding in sand do not
differ greatly from ours; I will hence only deseribe that followed in the
old mint about sixty years ago, where this kind of molding was
brought to a high state of perfection for casting the bronze coins
known as ‘‘tempo.”

Specimens of these coins and of mirrors cast in the same way are
exhibited.

The model, or ‘“‘mother” coin as it was termed, was prepared in
bronze, either by the ‘cera perduta” method or by cutting and engray-
ing. For mirrors and similar objects this or a model in wood was used
as the “pattern,” but for coins, when many had to be cast, the “pat-
terns” were prepared first by casting from the *‘ mother” coin what were
termed “seed” coins in pewter, and then from these the actual working
“patterns” in bronze.

Lantern slides were shown illustrating the operations of molding
and casting in the old mint in Yeddo in 1835, as follows:

Filling the mold frame with sand.

Molding by means of the metal patterns.

Smoking the molds.

Pouring the bronze into the vertical sand molds, see Pl. LXX.

The “flask” or frame for holding the sand was of wood, without
transverse or longitudinal ribs. It was placed on a flat board on the
floor of the molding room, where it was filled with damp sand—the sand
being well trodden to consolidate it—the excess was scraped off and
the surface made level and smooth. Upon this surface, which was
first dusted with charcoal powder, two bronze rods to form the ingates
and main feeding channels were placed, and on each side of them a
row of the metal ‘ patterns,” all being carefully pressed into the sand.
Another frame was then placed upon it and filled with sand, which
was also very carefully trodden. The frames were then separated,
the “patterns” removed, and a small channel was cut from each cavity
in the mold leading to the main channel. They were now placed on an
open frame and their inner surfaces were smoked with burning pine
wood held below them in a brazier. After being again fitted together
they were placed between two boards and firmly braced up, and then set
up vertically in the melting room to receive the bronze.

2.—THE FURNACES AND APPLIANCES OF THE FOUNDRY.

The furnaces and appliances which are used by Japanese artists for
melting and casting bronze are of a very simple character. They con-
sist of a series of cupola furnaces in segments, several crucible fur-
naces, and two kinds of blowing machines.

Reverberatory furnaces were not employed by the old founders, but

during recent years several have been erected from my designs in Gov-
ernment and other establishments, chiefly, however, for the production
of ordnance and castings for industrial purposes.

When small castings only are required the bronze is generally melted
in crucibles, but for those of larger dimensions a cupola furnace, or
more than one, is always employed.

the casting operations to be described subsequently, is represented in
fig. 3.

It is very ingeniously constructed of cylindrical segments. The
lowest, which forms the hearth, consists of a cast-iron pan lined with
fire clay and a coating of brasque, composed of clay and charcoal. It
is furnished with an aperture, G, in front, for tapping out the metal,
and another at the back for the insertion of the twyer, through which
634 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

the blast is introduced. Each of the other segments consists of a cyl-
inder of fire bricks or slabs, cemented together with fire clay, and firmly
bound with iron bands. The number and size of these segments used
in erecting a cupola depends on the quantity of metal it is intended
to melt at each charge, and as a considerable number of various sec-
tions and degrees of taper are kept on hand, any form can be given
to the interior of the cupola. In all well-arranged foundries these seg-
ments, with their accompanying hearths of various sizes—generally
from 1 foot to 2 feet 3 inches in diameter—are always ready, so that
a furnace can be built up without delay at any time for either large
or small meltings.

The cupola is erected by placing the hearth segment on a platform of
brick about 1 foot high, so that the tap hole may be of a convenient
height for tapping. Upon this segment one of the ethers is placed and
luted to it with fire clay; another is placed on this and similarly luted,
and others are added if necessary until the furnace is of suitable
height. The advantages which this method of erecting cupola furnaces
possesses for small foundries, where the work is of an irregular char-
acter, and where castings are often urgently needed which are too
large for crucibles and too small to justify the lighting up of a large
permanent cupalo, are self-evident.

There is only one twyer, and this is the chief disadvantage of the
larger sizes of these furnaces, as it causes an unequal distribution of
heat in the zone of fusion, the results of which are undue volatilization
of lead and zine in the overheated spaces and an unnecessary waste of
blast and fuel. There is no special charging door, the fuel and metal
being simply thrown into the open top of the furnace.

Portable furnace for melting bronze.—Another furnace which is not now
in use in Japan, but is still employed in China, resembles the hearth
segment of the cupola I have just described. It 1s, however, made light
and portable, stands on three feet, and is fitted with sockets in its
sides, into which long handles are inserted, so that it can be carried
by two or four men. It is placed in front of a bellows, as shown,
and then charged with charcoal and bronze. When sufficient of
the latter has been melted it is carried to the mold, the fuel raked
off, and the molten metal poured through a beak-shaped opening in
its side.

For objects of small size and complicated forms and of delicate model-
ing the bronze is melted in crucibles in small furnaces, which, like the
cupola, are worked by means of a blast. This form of furnace consists
of a simple cylindrical chamber, with a lining of fire clay, generally
partly embedded in the ground of the melting room, and fitted with a
movable clay cover. Its sides are pierced with four or six or more
holes, about 3 to 5 inches above its base, for the admission of the blast.
The fuel used is charcoal. Recently air furnaces connected with chim-
ney stacks, similar to those of Europe, have been erected in many

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 635

foundries, but the above form is still in extensive use in the melting
rooms of artists.

The crucible used (fig. 4) consists of a thin inner crucible of porcelain
inclosed in an outer one of fire clay; and its construction affords a good
example of the ingenuity of the Japanese in overcoming the difficulties
arising from the nonrefractory character of their fire clay. As has been
pointed out already, granitic clays, not very infusible, are alone avail-
able for metallurgical purposes in Japan, porcelain clays being expen-
sive and reserved for the potter. If the crucible were made entirely of
the former it would soften and crack at intense heats; hence it is lined
with a cup of difficultly fusible porcelain just at that part where,
owing to the position of the twyers, the temperature of the furnace is
extremely high; so that, even if the outer part is partially fused or
destroyed the metal will not be lost, but be retained by the porcelain
cup within it.

Blowing machines.—The machines used for producing the blast can not
be passed over without notice. They are of two kinds, both of which
are peculiar to the East, and although defective in many respects when
compared with the more perfect forms of blowers,
such as Baker’s and Root’s, in use in this country
and also in the large commercial and Government
works in Japan, yet their convenience and efficiency
is sufficiently great to enable them to hold their own
in the art foundries, where, indeed, they are still
universally employed. One of these, called the
‘“‘fuigo,” is Shown in the lantern slide. It is used for
producing the blast for the crucible furnace pre-

viously described, and also very extensively for other crucieie ror mevrine

metallurgical operations, such as copper, lead, and gor as

tin smelting. As the Chinese form, with which it is almost identical,
has been described more than once, I will not trouble you with a
detailed account of it. It is essentially a rectangular wooden box, fitted
with a piston, which is worked horizontally, and with four valves so
arranged that it is double-acting, a blast being produced by both the
forward and backward motion of the piston. The air chamber generally
measures about 3 feet by 1 foot 10 inches by 7 inches.

The other blowing machine, which is called “tatara,” appears to have
escaped the observation of foreign writers, as it has not hitherto been
described. - Fig.5 represents it in plan and sections. It consists of two
air chambers A A, in some cases constructed of wood, in others of clay
with merely a lining of wood at their sides. The bottom of each cham-
ber is an inclined plane sloping from a central ridge. The top of this
ridge is fitted with metal bearings, in which the axle of the pressure
board B works. The pressure board is made of wood and is fitted with
two valves, C C, opening inwards, one being placed at each end. Its
edges are sometimes lined with a packing of fur or feathers, so that it

may fit closely to the sides of the chamber and leakage of air be pre-
vented.

About eight or ten persons are required for working one of these
machines in melting bronze, and often the whole of the artist’s house-
hold—men, women, and children—aid in the operation. A rocking
motion is given to the pressure board by the workers stepping alter-
nately on and off either end (fig. 6), and the air is thus compressed first
in one chamber, then in the other, and passes to the blast outlet E

through a channel at the bottom and front of each. At the junction of
these channels with the blast outlet a flap valve, D, closes either channel
when the opposite half of the pressure board descends. The workers
are aided in stepping on and off by ropes hanging from the roof, which
they grasp with their hands, and in keeping time—and the efficiency of
the machine depends greatly on this—by singing songs which have been
specially composed for them. t

volume; and the effective power of a machine worked by eight men does
not exceed 1 ton of cast iron melted per hour, the cost of the labor,
however, being only about 8 pence.

3.—THE OPERATIONS OF CASTING.

The metal used for the charges of a cupola furnace when a “cast”
has to be made consists either of old bronzes and defective castings, or
more generally of a mixture of these with new alloy. The separate
metallic constituents of the bronze, viz, copper, tin, lead, or zinc, do
not form part of these charges, but the alloy is previously prepared by
melting them together some days beforehand. The alloy then obtained
is cast into thin plates, which are broken up while hot, and the frag-

ments are used for the casting charges. When crucibles are used, the
alloy is however frequently made at the time of casting, although for
castings of special importance bronze which has already been once or
oftener cast is always preferred.

For my description of the operations of casting I have selected the
casting of a brazier in the mold shown in fig. 7, as it is a typical exam-
ple of Japanese practice, and I was present in the foundry during the
whole of the operations.

The bronze was melted in the cupola furnace (fig. 5). Charcoal was
used as fuel, and the blast was produced by a *‘ tatara” worked by eight
persons.
638 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

From an early hour in the morning and while the melting was pro-
ceeding the foundry staff was engaged in preparing the molds for the
reception of the metal by heating them to redness. This was effected
in the following manner: The mold (fig. 7) was placed on five or six
bricks, H H, to raise it above the earthen floor of the melting room.
Its ingates, C C C C and D D D D, were closed with stoppers of
clay and the conical tubes, F F, were fitted over its air outlets, E HE,
to prevent any fuel from falling into them. <A wall of fire-clay slabs,
G G, was now built up around it, the slabs being kept in position by
hoops and bands of iron and an external luting of clay, a space about
3 inches wide at its narrowest part being left between the inside of
the wall and the outside of the mold. A charcoal fire was then made
on the floor below the mold,
and the space between the
wall and the mold was com-
pletely filled with burning
charcoal, which was mixed
with fragments of bricks
and crucibles to prevent the
heat from becoming too in-
tense. The interior of the
core was also partly filled
with the same mixture, and
two clay tubes were fitted
above it to serve the pur-
pose of chimneys. The tem-
perature of the interior was
regulated by partially or

time the metal was nearly ready. The wall of clay slabs and the
draft tubes were now rapidly taken down and the fire was raked
away. The bricks H H, supporting the mold, were carefully removed,
and the holes through which the wax had run out stopped up with fire
clay. During their removal the floor below was sprinkled with water
and softened by shoveling, and on this the mold was allowed to rest.
Large stones were now piled around its base to steady it and the stop-
pers were removed from the ingates. The ingates, of which there
were seven—four about the middle of the mold and three at the top—
were fashioned in the form of small cups of fire clay about 2 inches in
diameter, each having three apertures, half inch in diameter, opening
into the channel leading into the mold.

The mold was now ready for receiving the metal. On looking into it

ii or ae

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 639

through one of the ingates it was seen to be a dull red heat. The
bronze was then tapped into four iron ladles, each of which was held by
a workman, and a small quantity of wood ashes was thrown upon its
surface. The workmen then took up their positions opposite the lower
ingates and on a signal being given poured the contents of their ladles
simultaneously into the mold. The quantity of metal had been very
accurately estimated, as it just reached about half way up each ingate.
These ingates were then closed with clay stoppers luted in with fire-
clay. Three of the ladles were filled again and poured in the same man-
ner as before, but into the upper ingates, completly filling the mold.
During pouring very finely powdered rice bran was thinly sprinkled on
the metal as it flowed from the mouths of the ladles. The mold was
allowed to stand for six hours before breaking it from off the casting.
Several other smaller molds were then filled in a similar manner, and as
one ladleful of metal was sufficient to fill each, they had only one ingate
and one air outlet. While the bronze was being poured into them
they were rather vigorously tapped with a short stick to dislodge any
air bubbles which might have adhered to their sides.

For castings of very large size ladles are not used, but the bronze
is run from one or more of cupola furnaces, first into a receptacle
lined with fire clay, and then from this through an aperture in its
bottom into the mold. The outflow is regulated by means of a plug, so
that a considerable depth of metal is always retained in the receptacle
in order that scoriv and oxidized scums may be prevented from enter-
ing the mold. To prevent oxidation as far as possible, the surface of
the metal is kept carefully covered with a layer of charcoal or of par-
tially carbonized straw.

A subsidiary but often necessary part of the founder’s work, and
one in which the Japanese exhibit very great skill, is the repairing of
any defects that the castings may show on their removal from the
molds. Thus, for example, occasionally the rim or other part of a vase
may be imperfect owing to the retention of air in the mold when the
metal was poured in. In this case the imperfect part is carefully
remodeled in wax on the defective casting, a clay mold is made over it
in the usual way, and the wax is melted out. A certain quantity of
metal is then poured in and allowed to run out until the edges of the
defective part have been partially melted, when the outlet is stopped
and the mold allowed to fill. When it has solidified the clay mold is
broken away and the excess of metal filed off.

Handles and ornamental appendages, which have been separately
cast, are frequently attached to objects in this manner. Separate
parts of complicated greups and of colossal figures are similarly united,
and often this is so skillfully done that it is impossible to say whether
the whole is a true single casting or is composed of several pieces which
have been separately cast.

Rude as the appliances and methods of the Japanese art founder
640 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

which I have just described may seem to us, he has produced with
them castings in bronze on all scales which, with all the modern equip-
ments of our foundries, it would be difficult for us to excel. The sim-
plicity, adaptability, and portable character of his appliances have
been of special advantage to him in his remarkable achievements in
colossal castings. Thus, when a huge image of a Buddhist divinity or
a bell of unusual weight was .equired for a temple in any locality, the
whole of the operations were conducted on the spot. Temporary sheds
for the modeling were erected inthe temple grounds. The furnace and
blowers were transported thither in segments; sometimes the latter
were even made by the local carpenters. If the casting had to be made
in one piece the necessary number of cupola furnaces, each with its
blower, were erected around the mold. The cost of the blast was nil,
as the services of any number of eager volunteers from the crowds
which congregated at the temple festival on the day of casting were
readily obtained for the meritorious work of treading the blowing
machines. In this way the great bells and colossal images were cast.
It may be interesting to note here that the methods of heating the
mold and of repairing defective castings were in use in Europe during
the tenth and eleventh centuries, and doubtless at a very much earlier
date. They are described by Theophilus in his valuable treatise, De
Diversis Artibus, written in the early half of the eleventh century,
and his description is practically identical with that I have just given
you of them as they are practiced in Japan.

4.—THE ALLOYS USED.

The success which the Japanese artist has attained in the execution
of his famous masterpieces in bronze is not, however, solely due to his
methods of modeling and casting, but is largely dependent on the
physical character of the alloys he has used. His alloy, par excellence,
is called “‘karakane”—which signifies ‘Chinese metal”—this name
having been given to it because it is believed not to have originated mn
Japan, but to have been introduced from China. The exact date of its
introduction is unknown, but there is little doubt that it was not later
than the seventh century, when the bronze coins in circulation in the
country were chiefly Chinese, and it was probably in this form that the
Japanese first became acquainted with it. The name ‘*“ karakane” does
not, however, designate any definite alloy. It has a generic rather
than a specific signification, and is applied to a very varied group of
mixtures of metals of the copper-tin-lead series, in which the propor-
tion of copper may range from 71 to 80 per cent, of tin from 2 to 8 per
cent, and of lead from 5 to 15 per cent.

The Table II which follows contains all the analyses of the alloys
bearing this name which have been published by various analysts, as
well as some which I have made myself of typical specimens. It also
includes several other allied alloys which are not in such general use as
‘“ karakane,” but are valuable for special purposes:

And as a comparison of the alloy “ karakane” with similar alloys of
other countries is of considerable metallurgical as well as historical
interest, I have given in Table III some analyses of several ancient
objects, which will enable this comparison to be made.

IT would also call your attention to a very valuable series of analyses
of oriental art metal work made under the direction of our chairman,
Professor Roberts-Austen, who has won special distinction for his
researches on alloys, and published by the science and art department.

It will be seen from Table II that the presence of lead, as an impor-
tant constituent, is one of the characteristic features of the composi-
tion of the Japanese bronze ‘‘karakane,” although, as is shown in
Table III, it is not peculiar to them. Several reasons have been
advanced for the origin of the presence of this metal in copper-tin
alloys; those, however, we need not discuss here. One thing is cer-
tain, that even in very early times the relative properties of copper-
tin and copper-tin-lead alloys were known, as in almost all specimens
which have been analyzed swords and weapons in which strength and
hardness were essential consist of the former (copper-tin), and coins,
decorative objects, and figures, in which these properties were not
necessary, of the latter (copper-tin-lead).

The wide range in the proportions of the constituents of ‘‘ karakane”
is fully demonstrated by the analyses given above. This variability
in composition is not solely the result of attempts on the part of the
founder to produce special alloys, as might be conjectured, but is chiefly
owing to the practice, universally adopted, of mixing considerable
quantities of old metal “scrap” of unknown composition with the
furnace charge, even when the copper, lead, and tin of the same charge
have been carefully weighed in definite proportions, a practice not alto-
gether unknown in this country. In the case of the temple bronzes, it
is generally due to their having been cast from accumulations of ex
voto offerings of the most heterogeneous character.

A few words on the purity of the metals used by the Japanese in pre-
paring their alloys may not be out of place here. The copper, as will be
seen from the following analyses, is almost without exception extremely
free from the injurious metals—arsenic, antimony, and bismuth:

644 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

_Imperfectly refined copper, containing larger proportions of sulphur
and iron than those given above but still comparatively free from
arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, is sometimes used. When Japanese
castings are unsound from vesicular cavities, the unsoundness is gen-
erally due to the sulphur in such copper. The sulphur becomes oxi-
dized, during melting and pouring the alloy, to gaseous sulphurous
anhydride, and the cavities are formed by bubbles of this gas being
retained in the casting during solidification. In our own foundries
this element is also too frequently the unsuspected cause of the same
defects in castings.

The tin used generally contains lead, occasionally iron and copper,
but rarely other impurities.

The lead is tolerably pure, excepting that it always contains a little
silver.

Zine, which is of frequent occurrence is Japanese bronzes (karakane),
has never been added as metal, and its presence is due to the brass
articles which often form part of the “scrap” of the furnace charges.

The presence of arsenic and antimony, both of which are often found
in considerable amounts in these alloys, is not due to the use of
impure metals, but to the addition of a pseudospeise called “ shiro-mé”—
a by-product of the desilverization of copper by lead '—the composition
of which is given in the following analysis, which I have made of a char-
acteristic specimen:

The first official record we have of the use of this pseudospeise is con-
tained in an edict of the Government in 1764, prescribing its addition
to the copper-tin-lead bronze to be used in the mints for the casting of
coins, but doubtless it had been similarly employed very much earlier
than that date, and almost certainly in the casting of the colossal
Buddha in Kioto in 1614 A. D. It was added to the alloy in order to
increase its hardness without diminishing its fusibility, and to obtain
in the castings a sharper impression of the mold than was possible with
the copper-tin-lead alloy alone. During later years it has been used by
some bronze founders because its addition to ‘‘karakane” has been
found to facilitate the production of the gray patina, which is preferred
for objects which have to be decorated with inlaid-line designs in silver.

It is almost needless to say that silver, although mentioned in temple
records as having been added to the bronze used for the casting of some
of their famous images and bells, has never been so added, as there is
never more present than can be accounted for by its occurrence in the

copper, lead, or shiromé used. Mercury and gold, which are also erro-
neously recorded as constituents of some noted bronzes, do not exist
in the alloy, and can only have been used for gilding their surfaces.
Patches of gold have, however, been employed for the decoration of
some ancient bronzes.

The chief characters on which the value of the Japanese copper-tin-
lead alloys as art bronzes depend may be briefly stated as follows:

(1) Low melting point. This is of especial importance to the Japa-
nese founder owing to the fusible nature of the clays and sands of
which his crucibles and molds are made.

(2) Great fluidity when melted compared with the sluggishness of
copper-tin bronzes.

(3) Capability of receiving sharp impressions of the mold.

(4) Their contraction on solidification is not excessive.

(5) Their peculiar smooth surface.

(6) The readiness with which they acquire rich patinas of many tints
when suitably treated.

The advantages resulting from the above properties will be obvious
to all artists in bronze. They are chiefly the result of the use of lead
as one of the chief constituents of the alloys. The low melting point
of these bronzes, their fluidity when melted, and the facility with which
they acquire certain patinas are indeed entirely due to the use of this
metal. The fine velvety surface and sharpness of the castings depend
in a great measure on the structure of the mold and its comparative
high temperature when the bronze is poured into it, although partly
also on the influence of the lead. These alloys are, however, not with-
out some disadvantageous physical properties, and these are also due
to the lead which they contain. They are often low in tenacity, and
offer but little resistance to bending and torsion when compared with
simple copper-tin bronzes, even when they contain sufficient tin to
enable them to hold more lead in solution than they would otherwise
do. Their use is hence almost limited to the production of objects of
art. And even for those art castings, such as, for example, large
equestrian or other statues, where a considerable strain has to be borne
by certain parts, their use is unadvisable. But in most art castings of
moderate size—and even in many of colossal proportions, where the
position of the center of gravity of the mass does not cause excessive
tension in any part—it is not necessary that the metal of which they
are cast should possess great tenacity. For all such these alloys are
eminently adapted, and especially so, as by no others can the work of
the artist’s hand, with all its delicate and masterly touches, be so
readily and perfectly reproduced.

I do not think they could be advantageously used for statues or
monuments exposed to the weather in the impure atmosphere of our
great towns, but for castings protected from these combined adverse
influences I think the Japanese bronze, ‘“‘karakene,” is worthy of a
trial. As we have seen, the Japanese founders have no fixed or stand-

ard composition for their alloy. I may hence be permitted to suggest
the proportions in which, in my opinion, the metals should be mixed to
produce a bronze which, for castings of moderate size and thickness,
would secure many of the advantages possessed by it. They are as
follows:

The zinc to be omitted from castings with very delicate lines of ornament.

Specimens of each of these alloys are on the table for your inspec-
tion, also a specimen of ordinary gun metal, C, containing 2 per cent of
zine, for comparison with them. They do not differ much in tensile
strength, that of A being 13.25 tons, of B 12.19 tons, and of C 14.29
tons per square inch. These alloys have been kindly prepared for me,
and their tensile strengths determined by the Broughton Copper Com-
pany (Manchester), who are specially skilled in the manufacture of
copper alloys.

. The other alloys, which are not contained in the ‘ karakane” group,
do not require a lengthy consideration, as they are much less fre-
quently made use of by artists. Thus the simple copper-tin alloys
which were employed in prehistoric times are not found in use after
the introduction of “ karakane” from China until comparatively
recently, and then only occasionally for mirrors.

Neither have the copper-zine alloys, “ Shinchu,” or brass (Table II,
Nos. 24 and 25), been much in favor among artists. They were
unknown in Japan before the establishment of Buddhism, and were
probably introduced contemporaneously with that religion from China
(sixth century A. C.), Their use in art has been almost exclusively
restricted to the production of the ceremonial vessels and utensils of
temples and shrines, and especially for the ‘‘Go-gusoku,” or five orna-
ments of the Buddhist altar.

Even when a yellow metal is needed for the purposes of decorative
ornament brass is seldom used, copper coated with gold being preferred,
the rich color and quality of the gold surface being more pleasing to
the Japanese than the harsher tones of the copper-zine alloy. Hence
there is scarcely a single example in the country of any great work of
art executed in brass.

Occasionally the yellow bronze, ‘“sentoku” (Table II, No. 26), con-
sisting of copper, tin, and zinc—an alloy occupying an intermediate
position between “ karakane” and brass—is used instead of the latter
alloy. It is, however, probably not older than the fifteenth century.
An old Chinese legend records that it was accidentally discovered after

eR

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 647

the destruction of a temple by fire, when the bronze, brass, and gold
vessels of the altar were melted together into a mass. The beautiful
color of the metal attracted the attention of some art founders, who,
after numerous unsuccessful attempts, at last succeeded in producing
an alloy resembling it.. Gold is said to be an essential ingredient in its
composition, but I have not found any in the specimens I have exam-
ined. It is not in very common use. Vases and other objects cast of
it—generally with but little ornament in relief—are occasionally met
with, but the finest specimens are found among the guards and other
ornamental furniture of the sword, and all are chiefly notable as exam-
ples of chasing rather than of founding, or for the beautiful color and
texture of their surfaces.

The method of preparing or melting bronze is, as is well known to
all founders, secondary only to its correct composition, and as it has
such an important influence on the character of the castings, one or
two points relating to it, derived from my own experience, may be
briefly considered here. Cupola furnaces should never be used for any
bronze castings. If coke is employed as fuel in them the metal will be
contaminated with sulphurous anhydride (SO,), and the casting will
be vesicular. This may be avoided by using charcoal, but with either
fuel the bronze will be of uncertain composition. The Japanese method
is in this respect decidedly faulty.

For castings of small or moderate size the bronze should be melted
in plumbago crucibles. For large castings requiring the contents of
several crucibles a vessel of sufficient capacity should be provided into
which the metal from all the crucibles should be poured, and then from
it into the mold.

The bronze should not be stirred with iron rods, or it will be con-
taminated with iron, but with plumbago stirrers. This method should
be adopted whenever practicable, even for castings of considerable size,
and the fuel used should be charcoal or specially selected coke as free
as possible from sulphur.

For colossal castings reverberatory furnaces must be used, and when
worked with care they give satisfactory results. A point apt to be
neglected in these furnaces is the proper mixing of the alloy—not a
difficult matter, but requiring more supervision than is often given to
jt—and everyone who has had to make many castings with them will
have occasionally found crusts of a white alloy attached to the sides of
the hearth, indicating that some of the castings did not contain their
full amount of tin.

A second point of importance which is often overlooked is the liabil-
ity of the metal to absorb sulphurous anhydride (SO,) from the prod-
ucts of combustion of the fuel. This may be prevented by keeping a
sufficient supply of charcoal on the melting hearth while the copper is
being melted, and afterwards a thick layer on its surface, and at the
same time guarding against a large accumulation of ashes and clinker
in the fireplace. «
648 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.

Another important point is the prevention of the formation of sub-
oxide of copper (Cu,O) during the melting of the copper before the
addition of the tin and other metals, as, whenever this is formed, it dis-
solves in the copper, and when the tin and zine are added it reacts with
them, forming difficultly fusible oxides, which diminish very greatly the
fluidity of the bronze.!

It is prevented, to a certain extent, by keeping an excess of charcoal
on the melting hearth, but too often this is an insufficient precaution,
and I would strongly recommend in all cases that the copper should be
treated by the process known as ‘‘poling” before the addition of the
tin and other metals. This is performed by placing the end of a pole
of green wood below the surface of the copper; much gas and vapor
are given off, the metal is violently agitated, so that every particle is
brought into contact with the charcoal on its surface, and all traces of
suboxide are removed.

Phosphorus, aluminium, and manganese have each the effect of
removing this oxide. They should not, however, be added in excess,
but only in sufficient quantities to insure this result. The kind of cop-
per used is also of great importance.

The purest metal obtainable should alone be employed in the prepa-
ration of bronze for valuable ‘cera perduta” castings, electro-deposited
copper if possible, or at least what is known as ‘best selected” copper,
and this should have an electric conductivity of not less than 98 per
cent on Matthiessen’s scale.

5.—STAINS AND PATINAS.

The rich patinas which Japanese bronzes acquire by age or special
treatment, and which enhance so much the beauty of the artists’ work,
are worthy of a brief consideration, although perhaps they do not
strictly come within the scope of the title ofthis paper. In many bronzes
the beautiful color is due merely to a “stain,” i. e., a colored film of
infinitesimal thinness. In others the surface of the metal is altered toa
considerable depth, and in these only have we true patinas. Frequently
both a ‘‘ stain” anda patina are produced by similar treatment, but the
operations required for the latter are of a more prolonged character than
for the former, and are accompanied by special manipulations, in addi-
tion to the application of what are termed pickling solutions. For the
production of true patinas of the richest and darkest shades of brown
by Japanese methods it is essential that lead should form one of the
constituents of the bronze, and that zine should either be absent alto-
gether or be present only in small proportions. On the other hand,
“stains” of any color can be given to metal of any composition and
even to unalloyed copper.

The substances used in the operations are copper sulphate, basic

1This can be easily demonstrated by melting a little copper in a crucible, allowing
it to oxidize, and then adding zinc, when the resulting alloy will be found to be so
pasty that it can hardly be poured out of the crucible.

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 649

acetates of copper (verdigris), iron sulphate, sulphur in fine powder,
alum, vinegar prepared from unripe plums, and a decoction of the roots
or entire plant of Calamagrostis hakonensis (Nat. Ord. Graminee),
potassium nitrate, and sodium chloride. The most important of these
reagents are the first five in the above enumeration. Various mixtures
of these are dissolved or suspended in plum vinegar and water to form
what are called the pickling solutions. Sometimes they are applied in
the form of pastes. Some are also used singly to obtain special effects,
especially the decoction of Calamagrostis. The proportions in which
they are mixed to form the pickling solutions are different in every art
foundry, even for the same patina. Hence several recipes—said to be
used for special patinas—which have been communicated to foreigners,
and in which these proportions are given in very exact weights, are not
strictly representative of actual practice. So far as my observations
go, the ingredients are never carefully weighed in making a solution,
and when it is made additional quantities are so often mixed with it at
the discretion of the craftsman, that after the first day of its use it is
impossible to say what its composition really is. Old solutions are
always preferred to new, and in many cases are added to the new in
large quantities, thus still further increasing the indefiniteness of their
composition. In the bronze department of the imperial mint, which
was superintended by an old art worker of great skill, there was only
one pickling solution for the treatment of bronze. About equal parts
of copper and iron sulphates and smaller quantities of alum and sul-
phur mixed with varying quantities of plum vinegar, water, and old
solution were used in its preperation. Almost every variety of stains
and patinas, excepting red and green, were obtained by its use by
varying the mode in which it was applied and the treatment of the
bronze between the applications.

The processes for producing a patina by the use of these solutions
are, aS might be expected from what I have just stated, neither simple
nor easy, and the intermediate operations on which its production
depends, more than on the exact composition of the solution, are so
variously modified in different foundries that I can only give you an
imperfect account of their chief features within the limits of this
paper.

When the casting has been freed from any adherent portion of the
mold its surface, where necessary, is very carefully smoothed by lightly
rubbing it with a piece of soft, close-grained charcoal or with an
impalpable powder of silicious shale prepared by levigation. After its
surface has been thus prepared it is sometimes boiled in a decoction of
finely ground beans (Glycine hispida), this treatment being supposed to
facilitate the action of the pickling solution.

It is then immersed in the pickling solution, which is frequently
heated almost or quite to the boiling point, but sometimes to a much
lower temperature. In other cases it is allowed to remain in a cold
solution for many hours. After the casting has been acted on until the
650 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.’

required effect of this stage of the process has been obtained it is taken
out and washed with water, and also with a decoction of Calamagrostis.
It is then carefully heated over a brazier containing burning charcoal,
being turned round from time to time until every part has been brought
to the proper temperature. During this operation it is frequently
wetted with the above decoction or with a pickling solution, and the
amount of time and patience bestowed on this manipulation is almost
incredible. The casting is again submitted to the action of the pickle,
again heated as above described, and these operations are repeated
until the desired platina has been produced.

It is obvious that large bronzes can not be thus treated. The pick-
ling solution can only be applied to them in washes, and their action
is thus merely sufficient to produce a very thin film of altered metal,
scarcely, if at all, more than a stain, and the true patina only results
from the action of time. A green petina, in imitation of that of ancient
bronzes which have been exposed to the action of the weather, is
obtained by treating the casting with plum vinegar, to which common
salt is occasionally added, and exposing it to the air, and sometimes this
is supplemented by burial in the ground for varying lengths of time.
This patina, although often very beautiful, is, I need hardly say, of an
entirely different character from the mixture of carbonates, oxychlo-
rides, and oxides of which the true old patina consists.

It will be seen from the foregoing that much practice, careful observa-
tion, and patient labor are required for the successful performance of
these operations. The artist has no definite rules for his guidance in
carrying them out, each seems to have his own methods of procedure,
and these he varies according to his experience. His success does not
depend on the use of solutions of definite composition, or on the exact
proportions of the metals in his alloys, but rather on his ability to cor-
rectly modify the manipulation of the various stages of the process, so
that the patina he aims at may be infallibly produced. These are the
chief features of what may be termed the ‘‘ wet” method of producing
patina. The oldest bronzes, however, owe their patinas almost exclu-
sively to the action of time, and those of intermediate age generally to
“dry” methods, in which they were exposed to carefully regulated
temperatures in furnaces heated by charcoal. These “dry” methods
have now been almost entirely displaced by the ‘‘wet” methods just
described, and were not in use in the foundries in Osaka to which I
had access, so that I have not seen them in operation. Several speci-
mens of bronzes, with magnificent patinas, are exhibited from the col-
lections of my friends, Mr. Alfred Cock, Mr. Swan, and Mr. Tomkinson.

From the account I-have just given you—I fear a very imperfect
one—of the methods of casting bronze in Japan, it will be seen that
they do not differ very greatly from ours. The chief differences lie in
the use of the artist’s model itself, in the preparation of the mold,
in the heating of the mold, and the composition of the bronze. All
these we can imitate; but the spécial excellence of Japanese bronze
THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 651

castings—the faithful reproduction of the wax model, the comparative
absence of retouching, the delicacy and vigor of the relief decoration—
are not due solely to these, but are the results of a combination of con-
ditions which are only of exceptional occurrence here. Chief among
these is the nature of the Japanese people, the intense feeiing and love
of art with which they have been imbued for centuries past, and their
just and enthusiastic appreciation of faithfulness in work. These qual-
ities have made every workman an artist, hence the patient and mar-
velous skill which we see displayed in all his work, as well on common
articles for everyday use as on those for the special purpose of decora-
tion. The training which the artist receives in the operations of found-
ing is also an important factor which can not be overlooked. Besides
these there is an esprit de corps in the staff of a Japanese art foundry,
which is not always found in Europe, the outcome of which is that an
amount of painstaking care almost incredible is exercised by all, so
that the work shall be as perfect as they can make it and worthy of
the renown of their master.

One word only in conclusion. I think it will be admitted by all that
a sculptor should himself possess a practical knowledge of the technical
processes by which his work is to be reproduced in bronze. Now in
this country this knowledge can only be acquired with the greatest dif-
ficulty by our artists, as it does not form a part of any course of their
art training. I would hence repeat and indorse, with the emphasis it
deserves, the suggestion made by Mr. Simonds in a valuable paper on
“Artistic bronze casting,” read before this society nine years ago, ‘that
studios should be established in connection with our national art schools,
where the student of sculpture could be practically taught the various
processes incidental to his profession of molding and bronze casting,”
and, I would add, the coloring of metals. It would seem to be a matter
in the encouragement and development of which our society might be
able to afford valuable aid. There should be no insuperable difficulties
in carrying it out, and I am sure you will agree with me that if it were
carried out it could not fail to be of inestimable value to our artists,
and to promote in no small degree the advancement of the art of bronze
founding in our country.

The magnificent bronzes which I have the privilege of exhibiting to
you to-night are chiefly from the collections of my friends, Prof. W.
Anderson, Messrs. W. Cleverly Alexander, Alfred Cock, EK. Dillon, F.
Dillon, W. E. Hennell, Sir Trevor Lawrence, Messrs. R. Mills, Alfred
Parsons, Charles H. Read, I’. A. Satow, W. Harding Smith, R. Phene
Spiers, J. M. Swan, H. V. Tebbs, and M. Tomkinson, to all of whom I
desire here to express my sincere thanks for having so kindly lent them
for the illustration of my paper, and especially so as I feel that any
interest it may have had is largely due to them. I also owe many
thanks to M. Cernuschi for his kindness in permitting me to have pho-
tographs taken of the fine specimens in his unique collection, which I

-have shown you on the screen.

STUDY AND RESEARCH!

By RUDOLPH VIRCHOW.

Our university, since its foundation eighty-two years ago, has been
in the habit of celebrating the beginning of its scholastic year with par-
ticularly solemn feelings. Among the festivals it observes, this Octo-
ber day above all invites self-scrutiny, a review of past successes, an
examination of the methods pursued, and, on the other hand, a consid-
eration of new problems, a survey of the future. Have we proved our-
selves able to perform the tasks devolving upon us? Have we used to
good purpose our means for the training of youth to fulfill the highest
auns of the state and of humanity? Do we enjoy the consciousness
that the hopes have been realized which our activity aroused in our-
selves and in our country?

Upon the new rector rests the heavy responsibility of interpreting
these and similar reflections. But who has the eloquence to sum up in
a general statement all the widely diverging ideas of his colleagues?
How few succeed in gaining evert a superficial view of the changes
unceasingly taking place in the sciences! Not one of us, we frankly
confess, is an authority on all branches of human knowledge; not one
can do more than judge the course of studies at the university from
the point of view of his specialty, his individual experience. The temp-
tation thus assails the speaker to discuss the branch to which he has
devoted himself rather than study in general. I shall endeavor to steer
clear of this danger. Forty-six years ago I became a member of this
faculty in the capacity of privatdocent; for forty-three years I have been
ordinarius in an out-of-town university and. here, and now the confi-
dence of my colleagues has honored me with this high post. In the
interval great changes, greater than those of centuries before, have
taken place in science as well as in political life. All departments of
human endeavor have been remodeled, some undergoing radical trans-
formation, others being subjected to incisive criticism. Who that has
been interested in public life can have failed to note and seriously con-
sider these great happenings? University life is surely not an isolated
phenomenon amid the spiritual experiences of the nations. We un1-
versity teachers are forced to keep constant watch upon all departments

of education, upon the elementary and secondary schools, which are to
supply us with zealous -young knowledge-seekers, and no less upon the
instruction dispensed at the higher schools, especially the technical
institutions, many of which have latterly manifested the laudable ambi-
tion to be, or at least to be called, high schools (Hochschulen). For the
primary establishments the university is a constant warning to equip
their wards so thoroughly that they may take in our instruction with
full understanding; for the higher institutions, it is a model by which
to fashion their methods and expedients. On the other hand, the uni-
versity has the duty to furnish the state and society with generation
after generation of well-trained young men permeated with systematic
knowledge, governed by high moral views, keeping alive the sacred
torch of science, and bearing it aloft through all the perplexities and
darkness of daily life.

Time was when not only this exalted position of the universities was
generally recognized, but when they were distinguished by great priv-
ileges, many of which are now lost. We have passed the period—a
fortunate even if not a permanent condition—when universities were
exposed to violent attacks, and most irksome restrictions of their lib-
erty were demanded. But we will not forget that this university, too,
established in sad days to be in the words of its founder, Frederick
William III, “‘a nursery of better times,” fell under suspicion, and was
subjected to rigid surveillance. Various reasons combined to produce
so sad a condition of affairs. One of them, and I beg that you, my
dear students, give it your special attention, arose out of the attitude
of many students, and was due to the widespread misconception with
regard to the objects of study and the position of the students.

No less a man than Johann Gottlieb Fichte was the first to give
expression to this thought on an occasion similar to the present one.
In his memorable address ‘on the only possible interference with aca-
demic liberty,” delivered on October 19, 1811, when he assumed his duties
as the first rector of our university, he said, ‘Only he that studies is a
student;” a severe dictum, but worthy of consideration. With pro-
phetic insight he describes the consequences when students, instead of
considering study their chief task, ‘instead of concentrating all their
thinking and planning upon their chosen science,” spend their time in
cherishing obsolete traditions connected with a separate, privileged
student class, and in keeping up supposed prerogatives. Let it suftice
to refer to this address, which every student may profitably read. Fichte
was careful to point out that he was not speaking of conditions preva-
lent at our university, but that he had in mind the “state of affairs at
other universities,” and the serious tone of his admonition plainly dis-
closes his opinion of the gravity of the danger, so threatening, indeed,
that he considered it the “only possible interference with academic
liberty.”

The serious crisis which occurred a few years later, overwhelming ali

STUDY AND RESEARCH. 655

the German universities, mention of which recalls the Carlsbad Resolu-
tions, has at last vanished, and we realize with gratitude that it has
left us in undiminished enjoyment of our most precious possessions—
liberty of instruction and liberty of study (Lehrfreiheit und Lernfrei-
heit), possessions in which we have abundant reason to take pride when
we compare our own with other European nations. Teachers and
students have lost none of that independence and _ self-dependence
which grow out of the feeling of responsibility, and are incompatible
with control fromwithout. In particular, liberty of instruction, granted
aS a Special privilege by emperors and rulers up to the dissolution of
the German Empire, has become a constitutional right in our time.
Moreover, we retain the privilege of choosing our rector through our
professors (ordentliche Professoren), and the corporate character of the
university has not been called into question before the law.

To be sure many other privileges, originating when the body of
students was well nigh sovereign and medieval customs determined
the conditions of student life, have vanished wholly. Even academic
jurisdiction, with the exception of a certain degree of disciplinary
competence, has been abolished; our scepters, which appear on ocea-
sions like this, are ornaments rather than the insignia of power. The
student is wholly amenable to civil law; he is a citizen, like those in
other walks of life, and it behooves him to know that he now enjoys no
privilege but that granted him by reason of his preparatory education,
namely, liberty of study, and that to be acquired by devotion to uni-
versity studies, namely, eligibility to many, in fact the highest, positions
in the gift of the state. For the rest, we no longer have any academic
liberty that differs from ordinary civil liberty. The student has no
peculiar legal code; the academic citizen, like every other citizen of
the state, must look to the constitution as the source of law. But
the constitution has granted him more rights than he possessed before,
especially the right of occupying himself with politics within the
limits set by the constitution and by law, and exemption from the
jurisdiction of special courts. .

Therefore, my dear students, receive my well-meant counsel to
devote yourselves to study as your first and foremost task, with high
seriousness and with the consciousness of all it involves. Self-evident
as it may seem, experience teaches that this admonition can not be
repeated too often or with too much emphasis. It applies not alone to
the last terms at the university, but to the early ones as well. The
more abstruse and comprehensive the science which the matriculate
student chooses as his specialty, the earlier must methodical study
begin; for the instruction of the later terms is intelligible only when
based on that of the earlier. The temptation to enjoy academic liberty,
first of all by neglect of study, is doubtless great with a young student.
Stepping out from under the rigid discipline of the gymnasium into the
golden sunlight of academic liberty, he feels sensuous delight in stretch-
656 STUDY AND RESEARCH.

ing his limbs and acting in an irresponsible, improvident way. We all
know the feeling, and are in the habit of treating this use of academic
liberty with ‘‘academic forbearance.” But a limit must be set to for-
bearance; for, in reality, academic liberty according to our interpre-
tation and according to that of the state, is a very different affair.
“ Academic liberty” is not “liberty to do nothing,” not “liberty in the
pursuit of pleasure or the indulgence of the passions,” but ‘liberty of
study.” This is true academic liberty, to practice which the university
is opened to students.

Neither teachers nor students should forget that the aim of university
work is high: general scientific and ethical culture and full mastery of
some one branch of knowledge. At least once in his life, and that at
the end of his university course, the attainments of a cultured young
man ought to reach the tide mark of scientific research, particularly in
his specialty. If he fails to gain that point then, there is little hope
that he will ever take creditable rank with his scientific associates; he
has the prospect of never being anything but a bungler. Let none
deceive himself on this subject; only in exceptional cases does a period
of study occur later in life equal in freedom to that normally granted
the academic citizen.

For the full exercise of this liberty of study the first condition is
love of study. Indisposition to study and liberty of study are contra-
dictory terms. The would-be university student is at once, on entering,
forced to decide what and how he will study. He who lacks desire to
study will evade the issue. With such an one choice is not exercised as
to the manner of studying; it wavers between studying and not study-
ing. The university has no means of compelling study. The disci-
plinary and regulative measures at its command are barely stringent
enough to insure attendance at lectures; only the medical faculty pos-
sesses in its examinations an institution calculated to enforce a certain
degree of order in the sequence of lectures and exercises. But experi-
ence teaches that, in the absence of love of study, even this regulation
fails to produce satisfactory results. How, then, can love of study be
awakened?

At a great university like ours the personal influence of the teacher
upon individual students is naturally very limited; only peculiar cir-
cumstances make it possible for the teacher to come into close contact
with a small circle of those he addresses or, in very exceptional cases,
with single individuals. His influence, therefore, is exerted in the main
upon the mass of his audience, and it is reserved for a late examination
to reveal to him how superficially it has touched single members of his
class. It is a pleasure to be able to state that the number of students
who follow the lectures with delight and success, even distinguished
success, is by no means small. But it were wrong to conceal the fact
that too often the complaint escapes from the teacher that his efforts
have been vain. Some, indeed, go a step further, and maintain that

STUDY AND RESEARCH. 657

it is noticeable that from year to year the culture of students becomes
less and less wide.

This is especially true in departments, as, for instance, jurisprudence
and medicine, which, besides being wholly different from the studies
pursued before entrance, are distinguished by an overwhelming fuilness
of new ideas. Precisely in these branches the attitude of the student
during the first few terms decides his development, indeed his whole
future. In such studies each lecture grows logically out of the last,
and the superstructure will be a labyrinth to him who is not acquainted
with every cranny of the substructure. The result is an imperfect
piece of work built up on an insecure foundation, and the later influence
of the teacher avails naught to fill up the gaps.

Doubtless the difficulty of the subjects taught contributes greatly to
the abatement of zeal in the beginner. Yet it is precisely the beginner
upon whose enthusiasm everything depends. Is it possible that the
university teacher is to be held responsible for the diminution of ardor
so often occurring in the early terms? Mostrigid investigation will not
substantiate the reproach, and, so far as I know, it has not been made,
certainly not with any degree of frequency. I should say that, on the
contrary, all reflection upon the matter leads to the subject of prepara-
tory work.

This question at present engages the attention of many minds. Cul-
tured men, and no less the state, are occupied with the problem of the
changes necessary in the instruction dispensed by the higher schools,
in order to secure preparation for the university of the sort conducive
to the best interests of its work. My address would have to transgress
its limits by far, were I to attempt the discussion of this important
problem in ail its phases. The disputants differ on the curriculum, on
the amount of time to be assigned to each study, on the methods of
teaching, arriving finally at the overburdening of pupils, mayhap also
of teachers. The experience of the university teacher is wide enough
to admit of his formulating an opinion on the majority of these ques-
tions; for to-day’s consideration, however, a few of the less hackneyed
ones will suffice.

The university teacher must first of all make two closely connected
demands upon the preparatory schools. He must require that the
matriculates bring to the university delight in study and ability to do
independent work. As compared with these demands, the evidence of
positive attainments sinks into the background. In the latter respect,
each faculty sets up a different standard; but with regard to the former
there is probably no appreciable variation.

As for delight in learning, it is inborn in every normally gifted child.
Daily we may observe the child’s pleasure at becoming acquainted with
some new object, or at learning to use its organs in a new way. Its
eagerness grows with every step in advance. It is an innate quality,
and the use made thereof depends primarily upon the constitution of

sM 94———42
658 STUDY AND RESEARCH.

the organs. Various differences in their actions crop out early, con-
ditioned, as they are, by natural endowment and inherited peculiarities.

Is it presumable that this quality is peculiar to children? Surely
not. It is distinctive of man in hoary age as well, so long as his organs
are not in an abnormal condition, or external circumstances have not
caused a disturbance or interruption. Recall the joy of the scholar,
bowed down under the weight of years, when a new outlook upon the
domain of science is vouchsafed him. How his delight in study is
stimulated when he succeeds in grasping a new series of phenomena,
be it of nature or of the human mind, hitherto unintelligible or inac-
cessible! How, then, were it possible to explain the absence of this
common human quality in young men of culture about to join the ranks
of academic citizenship? They certainly possess it, but not infrequently
it has been stunted by injudicious treatment. Hence it is necessary
not to create, but to reanimate it.

Under careful training, delight in learning soon develops into desire
for knowledge, which refuses to stop at mere acquaintance with a fact,
and urges the student to seek its explanation. It casts about for the
connection between phenomena and occurrences, for their causes and
history, and rests satisfied only when it has discovered their genetic
and causal relations. This is the characteristic sign of a genuine desire
for knowledge, and it involves the beginning of research. Proneness
to investigation is also manifested by children. They are in the habit
of taking to pieces objects that fall under their observation, and they
imitate movements to find out what must be done to produce them.
Education, then, finds all its elements ready at hand in child nature;
it is merely necessary to bring them into play, and cultivate them along
the right lines by concentrating the mind upon facts, keeping the
interest actively engaged, confining work to the main point, and
diverting the attention from objects of subordinate importance.

We are justified now in propounding the question: Is this done in
our schools? In our very primary classes the child’s delight in study
is so materially curtailed that a considerable proportion of our people
develops not legitimate curiosity, but its perverted form, inquisitive-
ness, i. e., the inclination to rest satisfied with an external, therefore
an incomplete, understanding of a subject, and to pass quickly from one
subject to another. Thus a natural quality beneficent in its character
is distorted and forced into forms of expression which, not rarely
harmful, at best are useless.

If the legitimate desire for knowledge is to be aroused in the child
mind, that is, if it is to be trained up to a consideration of genetic and
causal relations, its attention must be fixed upon historic facts. Even
religious instruction, of all branches the one which depends upon
almost verbal transmission of doctrines, does not confine itself to
dogmatic precept, but uses sacred history as a means of illustration.
Nothing, however, is so well adapted for that sort of instruction as
STUDY AND RESEARCH. 659

natural history so-called, which deals with tangible objects that furnish
patent illustrations of genetic processes. Our public schools are mak-
ing daily progress in the application of object lessons, and the only
desideratum now is that illustrations by pictures may gradually be
superseded by explanations from the object itself.

In the higher schools linguistic studies have always absorbed the
lion’s share of time and attention. The gymnasium being the direct
descendant of the Latin school of the Middle Ages, a predilection for
Latin has come down to it as an inalienable heritage. Greek, for whose
introduction we are indebted to the humanists, took rank with it only
later. Werecognize with gratitude that this circumstance was accom-
panied by the beneficent result of supplying civilized Europe with a
common basis of culture for those nations participating in it—those
called the Western peoples in Russia. This common basis has con-
tributed more than any other factor to the promotion of mutual under-
standing and the strengthening of the sense of relationship. For a
long time the universal use of Latin by scholars facilitated intercourse
among all classes of people in different countries.

All that has changed—changed entirely—and even those who, fully
recognizing the salutary influence of the classical languages upon
European culture, desire to see it perpetuated, must confess that it is
impossible to restore the old conditions. The national idioms have been
invested with their natural rights, and much as we may deplore the
polylingual character of scientific literature, which prevents our read-
ing a number of excellent disquisitions in the original, yet we must
acknowledge that no power on earth is able to effect a change in the
near future. Our educational institutions only in exceptional cases
graduate men who can speak Latin or write a Latin paper with ease,
and the universities, despite their reluctance, have been forced to
diminish the time given to instruction in the Latin language and grad-
ually to eliminate it from their business transactions.

From the first, the prominence of Latin was a weak point in the
humanistic schools. To be sure, it was not a matter of choice with
them; in their time Latin was the universal language of the church
and of law, and they themselves were Latin schools. They merely
continued what had become a general custom through the practice of
a thousand years. But their obedience to the custom was an element
of weakness in their constitution, for the productions of the classical
writers of Rome ranked far below those of Greece. The best of them,
indeed, owed their culture to Greek predecessors, and the school of
Athens through all times maintained its preéminent place in the esteem
of men. Its teaching formed the background of all scholarly work,
and our occidental culture has derived from Greek literature its most
Stimulating ideas and its most familiar forms. Homer, Herodotus,
Aristotle, and Plato continue to the present day to be the masters of
the nations.
660 STUDY AND RESEARCH.

The conflict is still undecided. When Greek authors began to be
read in the original, interest vanished in the works of Latin writers
as literature. Nevertheless the Latin language maintained the chief
place in the curriculum of the schools. But its study became less and
less exhaustive; as the use of the language decreased from day to
day, rhetoric was dispensed with, and attention confined to grammar.
Indeed, the instruction in grammar usurped so much time that even
Latin composition became a pium desiderium.

It is plain, then, that we have arrived at a turning point with regard
to the classical languages. Discipline in grammar is not the instrument
of progress needed by our youth. It does not induce that delight in
study which is a condition of independent development; on the con-
trary, it is obvious that for many pupils, perhaps still more for many
parents, it has become a hateful pursuit. Greek has been more than
half abandoned; no teacher in the preparatory schools dreams of giving
the general run of pupils such instruction as to fit them on graduation
to read and construe Greek authors in the original. Apparently the
medical faculty has most reason to lament the displacement of Greek,
seeing that its science is the only one which, for more than two thou-
sand years, has built itself up without a break on the basis of Greek
works. But it can not be denied that Hippocrates and Galen have so
few points in common with modern medicine that, although the latter
reverently clings to Greek terminology, the study of those authors is
of inappreciable importance in the judgment of diseased states. The
essential value of Greek literature accordingly lies not in its technical,
but in its philosophic and poetic portions, whose educational influence
we are inclined to underrate at present.

In the domain of philology, however, a significant innovation has
grown up, which we may proudly claim as the achievement of German
Scholarship, namely, comparative philology. Through it the proper
place has first been assigned to the genetic element in philology. Even
now it has furnished results of inestimable value in the history of
civilization. Constant additions to this fund of discoveries lead us
to expect that comparative linguisties will remain an integral part of
higher education. Its details, naturally, will be rendered accessible
only by means of university instruction. In deciding the course of
the higher preparatory schools we are concerned only with the two
classical and the modern languages. All that the university teacher
must insist upon is that, no matter what languages may be prescribed,
they be taught in a manner to train the pupil for original research and
to preserve his delight in study. It remains to be seen whether new
methods of teaching will effect these results.

At present we are prepared to cite subjects of instruction in which
the methods of teaching are so well planned that they amply furnish
the needed discipline. They are mathematics, philosophy, and the
natural sciences. On the one hand, they are so abundant and diversified

STUDY AND RESEARCH. 661

in contents that the desire for knowledge is constantly stimulated, and,
on the other hand, by their essential nature they offer wide opportunity
for original investigation. These advantages explain why their study
schools the mind of the young so thoroughly that it easily familiarizes
itself with the work of any of the faculties.

Instruction in at least the elements of these branches has long been
part of the regular course at our higher institutions. Only the amount
of knowledge to be considered the standard has varied from time to
time. The opinions of teachers and of the state officials authorized to
make decisions changed frequently, and in the end the overwhelm-
ingly philological character of their education always militated against
a more extended engagement in those studies. Only the necessity of
meeting the exigencies of swiftly progressing technics and of the indus-
trial arts keeping pace therewith extorted concessions, and as it was
believed that they could not be carried out at the humanistic institu-
tions a division of labor was finally resolved upon, and produced the
Real-Schule and Real-Gymnasium, and, as a further result, the higher
technical schools. :

The expedient has not proved successful in establishing permanent
peace. We are in the heat of the conflict about the prerogatives of the
different kinds of higher schools, particularly the admission of the grad-
uates of the Real-Schule first to university courses and then to state
offices. Again and again the cry resounds for a homogeneous school
system, and especially for the radical reform of gymnasium methods.
Probably not all these pretensions are equally just.

As arule the universities have refused to support the demand of the
Real-Schule to admit its graduates as such. They are apt to be partial
to the Gymnasium. As intimated above, the interests of the different
faculties with regard to the character of preparatory education are not
identical. The faculties that depend upon philological aids in the fur-
therance of their peculiar educational mission will not be satisfied with
preparatory work that assigns a more or less subordinate place to the
classical languages; while those in whose departments knowledge of
the ancient languages is not the indispensable condition for the under-
standing of their specialties must consider to what extent a full course
in mathematics and the natural sciences offers adequate compensation
for deficiencies in the classical education. Experience has not yet
helped us to come to a decision on this point. This circumstance may,
however, be adduced: Among the foreigners admitted to our various
departments not a few have attended the lectures zealously and with
praiseworthy results, in spite of not having enjoyed Gymnasium training
in our sense of the term.

The practical requirements of the different faculties with regard to
the preparatory work of the matriculates differ undeniably. It remains
for the future to show whether a single sort of higher educational insti-
tution can fulfill all. One assertion can even now be definitely made.
662 STUDY AND RESEARCH.

If the classical languages are no longer able to furnish the bond that
unites all the provinees of culture, a substitute can be found only in the
lustrous triad--mathematies, philosophy, and the sciences—upon whose
development occidental culture in all its ramifications depends.

For our present purpose it is of secondary importance to determine
that this culture has its roots in the Orient—in Egypt or Babylonia. So
far as we are concerned occidental culture began on the western shore
of Asia Minor, among the Ionian Greeks, the first to base their specu-
lations about the universe on the mathematical computation of celestial
phenomena, and the first to create a natural philosophy which summed
up in a harmonious review all knowledge and conceptions of nature
and her forces. In this philosophy is contained the beginning of those
general speculations upon the world characteristically called “ world-
wisdom” (Weltweisheit) by the Germans, which have gradually led toa
complete transformation of the old ideas of heaven and earth and man
himself; an achievement that forms the imperishable glory of Greek
philosophy.

The occidental nations, it must be admitted, were very late in attain-
ing to an understanding thereof. After the fall of Constantinople,
when the Greek scholars fled to Italy and knowledge of Greek litera-
ture spread rapidly, and when in Germany the humanists arose and
one university after another was founded, only then the independent
spirit of research awakened in all the nations. Mathematicians and
scientific men of marked originality appeared, and soon philosophers
were at work accommodating the conceptions about man to the new
views and sounding the very depths of intellectual life.

A little after the beginning of this momentous period he arose whose
gigantic achievement civilized men are at present celebrating. Day
before yesterday it was four hundred years since Christopher Columbus
first gained sight of a strip of land belonging to that New World where
thousands are now exulting in his memory. For him was reserved the
enviable fortune to demonstrate at a stroke, by means of a hazardous
experiment, the sphericity of the earth, and at the same time to open
up the vastest playground ever granted to human enterprise. Let us
offer due homage to his genius and energy on this spot, too. Let us not
forget that, despite his errors, which at the present moment we are
inclined to emphasize too strenuously perhaps, he is the creator of a
new time, the time of new thoughts and new actions!

After him there was activity everywhere in the world of the intellect.
Next to great mathematicians and astronomers arose physicists of the
first rank; the reform movement developed in the church, and the
corner stone of the modern structure of medicine was laid. Even now
we are in the midst of the upheaval, but victory is everywhere on the
side of the new. Our age has already earned the title of the age of
the natural sciences. No branch of intellectual endeavor has been
able to escape the modern influence. The Roman Church itself, the
STUDY AND RESEARCH. 663

energetic antagonist of the movement, has had to yield, and a qualified
representative of the Evangelical Church, our esteemed colleague, Dill-
man, a few years ago made use of the following significant words in his
rectorate address: “A church which is unable to stand the light of
science, or is compelled to mitigate its brilliance by all sorts of colored
glasses, should be laid with the dead.” Truly the modern conception
of life is based wholly upon the natural sciences, and no one can
seriously dispute the fact.

In view thereof the question is permissible whether the young
charges of our higher schools ought not to be initiated into this new
knowledge to a greater degree than hitherto. We willingly concede
that disputed points, upon which the authorities themselves are not
agreed, shall be excluded from the instruction in the schools, and shall
be reserved for the special training at the university. On the other
hand, it is just to demand that a young man supposed to be sufficiently
self-dependent to make proper use of academic liberty of study should
be able to take in the chief results of astronomic and biologic science
without danger to himself. Can he be considered mature if his whole
world in a sense is closed to him? And how can the instruction at the
university be expected to take effect when the young man is left
without the instruments needed for his difficult work ?

He needs mathematics, not for its own sake nor to be able to under-
stand the movements of the heavenly bodies. Physics has gradually
turned into a mathematical science, and even chemistry and physiology
find themselves forced daily with more urgency to make delicate caleu-
lations. They enable the investigator to penetrate to the comprehen-
sion of the most recondite processes, and to learn not only to judge of
the strength of living forces, but to calculate them accurately, and so
regulate their practical application.

But mathematics alone is inadequate. Thinking is a necessary fac-
tor in understanding. Many have an idea that it is supererogation to
make thinking an object of study; that systematic thinking is not
indispensable to success. Unfortunately even logic has fallen almost
into oblivion among students. At many schools the opinion prevails
that it is sufficient occasionally to quote a proposition of logic. How
is it possible for one who does not know the laws of thought to study
psychology? Howcan the complex relations between spiritual acts and
the physical constitution be made clear to him? The young medical
student enjoys an advantage in this regard; but what can be expected
of the jurist, the theologian, the pedagogue? At least the school can
inculeate respect for philosophy; even that were a great attainment.
The impulse to learn to think philosophically would soon assert itself.

Finally the natural sciences. What admirable topics for study and
for instruction are offered by the descriptive sciences—botany, zoology,
and mineralogy! It is a misconception to assume that the university
teacher lays chief stress upon systematic information. By no means;
064 STUDY AND RESEARCH.

the facts of a science can be taught as well at the university. No pupil
is harmed by ability to name and distinguish a number of plants, ani-
mals, or minerals. But the real discipline to be derived from the sci-
ences ought to consist in the education of the senses, more particularly
of sight and touch. At present we complain that many in our classes
have no precise knowledge of colors; that they make false statements
about the form of objects in fall view; that they show no appreciation
of the consistency and the surface characteristics of bodies. Nothing
would be easier than to give an accurate description of color and form,
if teachers required their pupils to make a drawing, a mere sketch, in
pencil or in colors, of the objects they have observed. Such knowledge
is useful to everybody; to the medical man it is invaluable, as not infre-
quently most important diagnoses depend upon his skill in this direction.

The experimental sciences, too, especially physics and chemistry, are
essential in a complete course of study; more than anything else they
reveal the genetic and causal relations of processes, and prepare the
student for the methodical consideration of even the more difficult
problems of biology. As a matter of course only the simpler and more
comprehensible experiments can be considered in connection with a gen-
eral course preparatory for academic study. Butevery graduate of the
higher schools should at least have an inkling of this method in order
to be able to form an opinion.

The enumeration of the elements that go tomake up acceptable prep-
aration for university work has been rather lengthy, not because of the
multiplicity of subjects to be passed in review, but because in the pres-
ent state of the question as to the relation of the university to the
preparatory schools the chief consideration is the amount of prepara-
tion necessary to make university instruction profitable. T’o avoid mis-
conception it should be added that many of the branches mentioned
may seem superfluous to the student who meaus to confine himself to
his specialty. Butif the state intended to provide only for specialists, it
could dispense with universities; it could establish separate écoles, as
in France, or separate colleges, as in England, or separate ccenobiums,
as in the Roman Church. If we cling to the idea of universitas, if we
take pride in being more than an agglomeration of specialty schools,
then we must look to it that there shall be real collaboration among the
faculties; that general scientifie culture shall accompany devotion to a
specialty. If, however, we find to our great regret that we fall far
short of this ideal, which we can and should attain, then the blame
must be cast upon the inadequacy of preparatory work which I have
sought to describe and which I expect to see remedied by means of an
accurate presentation of the facts.

So long as the remedy is not discovered, nothing remains but for the
university to provide instruction in certain elementary or at least pre-
liminary subjects, which, to be sure, is a burden and a degradation,
and yet rarely suffices to fill up the gaps left by the preparatory work.

STUDY AND RESEARCH. 665

The university teacher has the less time for instruction of that kind, as
the university is not only an institution for study, but also an institu-
tion for research, the latter in a double sense. Our nation is accustomed
to look upon its university teachers as investigators, and, on the other
hand, science and the state depend upon us to train up as investiga-
tors at least a portion of the students. From this point of view weapply
the term academic to the members as well as to the institutions of the
university.

The old name academy, in Plato’s sense, a school aspiring to the high-
est aims of spiritual endeavor, since the days of the Medici has been
used to designate the associations of distinguished thinkers and original
workers banded together for untrammeled interchange of ideas. This
is the origin of the academies of sciences. In later times all imaginable
sorts of academies grew up beside them; but they do not concern us
now. Only the academy of sciences is charged with the progressive
investigation of scientific problems as its chief task. But in Germany
there are only three, at the utmost four, such academies, and their .
capacity is by no means large enough to insure progress in the wide
domain of science. Naturally a part of their duty fell to the share of
the universities, and they fulfilled it honorably, in some cases with
distinction. This is the reason why the university teacher needs more
time than must be devoted to mere instruction.

In the other direction, too, as I said before, in the education of new
generations of original workers and teachers, a solemn obligation rests
upon the universities. It is a paramount duty, upon whose efficient
performance depends the steady recruiting of the ranks of the privat-
docenten, a constituent element of the faculty, the nursery of future
professors, which is indispensable to the prosperity of the university.
Therefore we must begin early to train students as original investi-
gators. Opportunities are ample, since governments everywhere have
created institutes and seminaries in which not only guidance and
instruction are offered, but also free and independent work. We have
special reason to be grateful to our own Government for its indefatiga-
ble care in establishing and enlarging such institutions. The moneys ~
expended on them are well invested. They bear abundant fruit, and
we are justified in the confidence that in the future, too, funds will be
forthcoming to satisfy the ever-growing needs. We are accustomed to
have Prussian kings consider the founding of scientific establishments,
even in most perilous times, as their sacred duty as rulers, indeed, as a
means of strengthening the state. Our own university grew up under
such circumstances and out of such considerations, but, not having been
endowed with a sufficient sum to be independent, it must look to the
state for constant help. May it to-day recommend itself anew to the
favor and the provident care of our Government!
SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

By Lieut. Col. H. ELSDALE.

An able writer, Mr. Pearson, has recently observed in his work,
National Progress and National Character, that few or no further lead-
ing discoveries or new departures in physical or mechanical science are
to be expected; that future generations have now only to fill in the
details and to supplement what has already been done.

I can not agree with him. We must not thus set limits to the invent-
iveness of mankind. The well-known epithet zepidoadys avijo will
justify itself in the future as in the past. Nor can we set arbitrary
bounds to the inexhaustibie secrets of nature, and to the importance of
the new arrangements and fresh combinations which are open to further
research into them. An ever larger and larger number of fertile brains
are continually at work in discovery and invention, as is clearly shown
by the most cursory study of the annual publications of any of the
various State patent offices. And these fresh brains start from an ever-
widening vantage ground of accumulated research and proved expe-
rience. The result must surely be that important inventions and new
discoveries will crowd thicker upon the world in the twentieth than in
the nineteenth century. I think that we have now looming before us
in the immediate future, darkly no doubt, but still very distinctly,
leading discoveries in science which will constitute new departures
fully as large as, if not larger than, those which have resulted from,
let us say, the introduction of railways or telegraphs in the past. Their
number may possibly be legion. I propose here to confine myself to the
consideration of four leading problems, some, if not all, of which seem
practically certain of solution in the next generation, if not in our own.
And their solution will involve results of enormous and almost incal-
culable importance to the future of mankind.

it

The conquest of the air is the first of them. Aerial navigation has
been the dream of enterprising and inventive men in all the ages, and
that dream is now drawing near to its realization.

668 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE

The invention of balloons has no doubt given some impetus to the
study of the subject, and navigable balloons of increasing speed and
importance are at this moment being made on the Continent. Thus,
the latest improved machine now under construction for the French
war office is expected to obtain a speed of 40 kilometers, or nearly 25
miles, an hour. The navigable balloon, however, at its best, will, on a
broad view, provide nothing more than a convenient stepping-stone or
intermediate stage, to pave the way for the flying machine proper,
which will certainly follow and supersede it in the future. Meanwhile,
unless some bold inventor should bring forward speedily a true flying
machine, we may expect to see successive modifications in, or progres-
sive forms of, navigable balloons introducing the principle of the flying
machine proper gradually and tentatively.

Thus, whereas at present all the weight is sustained by the balloon,
in future models the greater part of the weight only will probably be
gas-sustained, and the rest of the lifting power and necessary changes
of elevation will be provided for by the lifting action of air screws.
By and by the air screw, or air propulsion in some form, will predomi-
nate. The balloon will be first reduced to an auxiliary appliance, and
then laid aside altogether. The result, of course, of its final rejection
will be an immense gain in a greatly diminished resistance and a corre-
sponding increase in speed and power.

When first it became my duty to study this subject, some thirteen
or fourteen years ago, the flying machine proper was a demonstrable
impossibility in the then condition of mechanical science. Since that
time the problem has been attacked and its great acknowledged diffi-
culties steadily minimized from three different quarters simultaneously.
The net result has been to reduce it to far more moderate and manage-
able dimensions; and if a corresponding rate of progress is to be main-
tained for another thirteen or fourteen years, this great problem is
morally certain of solution.

I do not propose here to consider the subject in any detail or to give
any figures or calculations upon it, but rather to confine myself to such
observations on its leading conditions as are necessary to explain and
support the above statement and to indicate generally our present
position on the whole question.

The problem of aerial navigation by flying machines hinges prima-
rily, of course, on the ratio of power developed by, to weight involved
in, the motor. Only thirteen years ago that ratio was simply prohibi-
tory. Any competent mechanical engineer who considered the matter
could have no difficulty in concluding that it was then practically
impossible to make a motor on any large and safe working scale which
would lift its own weight, much less the weight of a heavy passenger-
carrying machine and passengers as well. Since that date a large
progress has been achieved, and motors can now be made which, for
the same weight, will give a greatly increased power. One of the latest

SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 669

new departures in this line is the motor which Mr. Hiram Maxim has
worked out for his flying machine. I have had the privilege of inspect-
ing it, and can certify that, whatever be the merits or ultimate success
of the machine generally, it is a marvel of mechanical ingenuity, and
the motor especially develops an extraordinary and unprecedented
amount of power for weight carried.

Side by side with this great increase of power in the motors, and of
equal importance, perhaps, in its bearing on the general question, we
must next consider the great fall in the price of aluminium, together
with the progress which has been made in the study of its valuable
alloys, such as the alloy with about 5 per cent of copper.

Within my recollection the price of aluminium has fallen from a guinea
to about 2 shillings the ounce weight. A very moderate further fall in
price—far less than the above great and recent fall of 90 per cent—and
a little further corresponding progress in the study of the nature and
properties of these alloys, will cause aluminium alloys to drive steel out
of the market for many important engineering purposes, such as the
construction of bridges of wide span. And the new metals will be of
cardinal importance to aerial navigation, as they are the material upon
which we must rely for the construction of the flying machines of the
future.

The third direction in which very important progress has been
achieved recently is the theoretical and practical study of the condi-
tions which govern the resistance of the air and determine the laws of
flight or locomotion, as well as of suspension therein. The resistance of
the air is the one all-sufficient fulcrum or basis on which every flying
machine must rely. In the investigation of its laws something has
been done by the study of the flight of birds and the analysis of the
results of instantaneous photographs of them, especially by modern
French writers. For the laws which govern the flight of birds must,
mutatis mutandis—that is, in principle—apply to all aerial locomotion.
Hence, in the last edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica we see prog-
ress on the subject. Thus we find therein an instructive table, showing
clearly that, contrary to many people’s ideas upon the subject, the sus-
taining or wing area in all flying bodies in nature increases in a much
less proportion than the increased weight to be carried. For the swal-
low or the sparrow has a much less proportionate area of wing than the
fly, the gnat, or the beetle; and the vulture or wild swan a much less
area than the swallow. This is an important fundamental fact in aerial
navigation, as Showing that the flying machine of the future can be
made of very moderate dimensions. But by far the most useful prog-
ress in this direction has been made by Professor Langley in his excel-
lent ‘‘ Experiments in erodynamics,” wherein he may fairly be said to
have laid down, for the first time, a really sound and reliable scientific
basis for the study of aerial locomotion by a series of careful experi-
ments and weli-reasoned deductions from them. We may note with
670 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

pleasure that Professor Langley is reported to be now engaged upon a
model aerial machine on a working scale. Whatever its ultimate meas-
ure of success, his new experiments with it can not fail to advance the
cause of aerial navigation another stage.

I repeat that the net result of modern progress in these three direc-
tions—the study of the governing conditions of the work to be done,
the increase in the power of the motor necessary for doing it, and the
decrease in its amount, or in the weights to be lifted—has been to
bring the problem of aerial locomotion well within the range of prac-
tical men. What is now required is that the field of research and
experiment should no longer be left to unpractical enthusiasts, as for
the most part it has been of yore. It is high time that really compe-
tent and well-informed mechanical engineers should follow the example
of Mr. Maxim and Professor Langley by turning their attention to the

“subject. Once let this be done, and I am satisfied that the problem will
be in a fair way of solution, and can not fail ultimately of a satisfactory
issue. Nevertheless, after some considerable study of the question, I
have a persuasion amounting to a conviction that whatever partial or
temporary success may attend all such machines as Mr. Maxim’s,
which depend upon locomotion through the air for sustaining power in
it, the ultimate solution of the problem will be something different.
That is, I believe that a really safe, workable, and reliable flying
machine must be based upon the principle of dissociating the stable
vertical suspension in the air, if required, from horizontal locomotion
through it. Such a machine must be capable of rising vertically in
the air in a dead calm, and remaining suspended in it, as apart from,
or in addition to, any question of horizontal locomotion through the
air. Moreover, it must be so constructed that no possible breakdown
or failure in any engine or in any part of the gear will endanger the
lives of the passengers. But these conditions will no doubt involve a
considerable further reduction in the ratio of weight carried to power
developed in the motor, and for this we must be content to await the
further progress of science.

Once let this vital issue of stable suspension in the air be satisfae-
torily achieved in a really sound, safe, and reliable way, and the conse-
quences which will follow from the new departure are enormous and
incalculable. Locomotion through the air, as straight as an arrow from
a bow, and at a hitherto unheard-of rate of speed, will immediately and
easily follow, and the resulting machine is bound for light transport to
distance all competition in locomotion, whether by land or by sea. For
one of the special and leading advantages attaching to aerial, as opposed
to all ordinary locomotion at present, is that increased speed will not
involve a great and disproportionate increase of power as it does now.
It is perfectly well known to every. marine engineer, and to every well-
informed man everywhere, that an enormous increase of power is nec-
cessary to gain a very moderate increase of speed in ocean navigation.
SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 671

Thus, if a steamer with a given horsepower will run at say 14 knots an
hour, if we double that horsepower we may only succeed in driving her
some 16 knots more or less—that is, the doubling of the horsepower will
only give us one-seventh additional increase in speed. But in aerial
locomotion the conditions are radically different, and the gain is all the
other way. Thus, if a flying machine with a given horsepower will run
at say 50 miles an hour, with less than double that horsepower it will
be likely to run 100 miles, so that the increased power required for
doubling the speed is most moderate, instead of being enormous and
prohibitory as it would be in water transport.

The aerial navigation of the future will not only be much swifter and
more direct, being in a straight course over moor, mountain, or bog, wood,
ravine, or river, but it will also be much safer than our ordinary locomo-
tion by railway and steamer at present. For as the traffic on our rail-
ways and steamboats steadily increases, the risk of accident on the
crowded lines and ocean thoroughfares, due to a set of objects all
moving in one horizontal plane, increases continually, as we are already
finding out in many a disastrous collision. But once let this problem of
stable suspension in the air be satisfactorily solved, and we shall cut
off at a stroke a whole host of causes and possible contingencies which
now inevitably involve continual risk of accident. For the flying
machine of the future will travel directly and independently through
the air from point to point. It will incur no risks from drowsy or over-
worked signalmen, from inevitable imperfections in or obstructions upon
the permanent way, from chances and contingencies due to the running
of excursion trains or extra traffic, from icebergs, or floating hulks, rocks,
Shoals, treacherous currents, unreliable compasses, or other hindrances
to safe navigation. If it meet or overtake a fellow machine in the air,
it has the whole wide ocean of air above or below it in which to pass in
safety, besides an unlimited field on either hand. An endless number
of external sources of accident will be eliminated. Once let the flying
machine be stable, strong, safe, and powerful enough for its work, and
it will represent the safest kind of locomotion ever invented.

It will compete with the railways for light traffic, such as the trans-
port of mails, on terms which must apparently confer an overwhelming
advantage. Thus, if we roughly set the cost of the stations along 100
miles of our English railways, and the cost, working, maintenance, and
renewal of the aerial machines against the corresponding charges for
- engines, rolling stock, and working expenses on the line, we have the
following advantages to score to the aerial line:

Annual interest at, say, 5 per cent on the first cost of 100 miles of line at
£39,000 a mile, which has been about the average cost of construction of

672 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

This shows that in aid of the maintenance and working of 100 miles
of aerial line, or as increased dividends to the shareholders, there will
be an annual subsidy of more than £200,000, representing the saving
on the cost of a corresponding length of railway. It will be seen that
the gain is so great that it is scarcely credible that any possible increase
in the working expenses of the aerial line, as compared with the cor-
responding charges on the railway, could swallow it up.

The revolution made in locomotion by the flying machine, whereby
we shall be able to run from London to New York in perhaps from
thirty-six to forty-eight hours, and from London to Paris and back
between breakfast and luncheon, will be at least as great as that caused
recently by the introduction of railways and steam navigation.

Tecan not go into the principles of construction of these aerial machines
further than to say, as I have already said elsewhere in a professional
publication, that they will probably be of very moderate size, much
less than the huge navigable balloon for military purposes, for which
they will be most valuable, and will be speedily adopted. For ordinary
or civil purposes also they will no doubt be small at first, but it is impos-
sible to set limits to their future development. The web, or superposed
webs, of aeroplane, part steadying, part sustaining, which will be their
leading external feature, will be inclined during flight at a very small
angle with the horizontal, probably not more than 14 to 13°. Inside
this, or below it, there will be a long low ear, presenting a minimum
surface to the air, in which passengers, light baggage, or mails will be
carried. And the machines will run, as above, at a tremendous pace,
probably up to, or even exceeding, 100 miles an hour.

Finally, I repeat that if anything like the same rate of progress is
to be maintained during the next ten or fifteen years as has actually
been made during the last ten or fifteen years, the problem of aerial
navigation by flying machines, which ten years ago was demonstrably
insuperable in the then condition of mechanics, and which at present
is very difficult, if not altogether impossible, will soon be comparatively
easy, and will be morally certain of solution.

Le

A wise man of old, in naming three things which puzzled him,
associated together “the way of a fish in the sea” and “the way of a
fowl in the air.” It is here proposed to follow his example, and, having
disposed of the way of the fowl in the air in discussing the question of
aerial navigation, to consider next whether any important new depar-
tures are not possible and even probable in marine locomotion. I believe
they are quite possible and probable, whether in the immediate or in
the more remote future. Any revolution which may be effected in this
direction will not be as startling and wonder-provoking as the con-
quest of the air. Nevertheless, such a future conquest of the water,
as we may perhaps call it, may prove ultimately to be of very great
importance.

SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 673

I believe, then, that a practical revolution in marine navigation is
possible, if we only will set ourselves, with the wise man of old, to
study the way of the fish in the sea. With all possible respect to the
numerous professors and students and innumerable practical men
engaged in marine engineering and marine locomotion generally, I
would venture to challenge them to consider carefully whether they
are not all, in the main, on the wrong tack. They are one and all, so
far as appears by a study of all the publications, as the Engineer,
Engineering, the Scientific American, etc., setting themselves steadily
to gain increased speed by a continual development of the locomotive
power. Successive improvements in engines, boilers, screws, economy
of fuel, and so on, are all very desirable in their way no doubt. But
these things seem to me unduly to monopolize attention to the exclusion
of the one vital problem which appears to contain the key to the
whole question—namely, the diminishing of fluid resistance. At
present, as we increase the propulsive power continually, we are con-
tinually piling up extra resistance to meet and swallowitup. I repeat,
that any great further progress in ocean navigation is to be sought
and obtained by a careful and scientific study of the way of the fish
in the sea.

The subject of fluid resistance, as the leading and governing factor
in all water propulsion, may probably be novel to most readers, since,
if the question has ever been publicly discussed at all, it has been in
naval or other special publications. It seems necessary, therefore, to
rehearse the matter briefly from the beginning.

Years ago I was informed by Mr. Brennan, the inventor of the weil-
known torpedo, that he applied no less than 100 horsepower to drive
his torpedo at its then speed, say probably at about 24 knots an hour,
or 25 at the outside. Now this torpedo is well designed to the eye and
was adapted, to the best of the judgment of a clever inventor, for fluid
propulsion. It is, or then was, no larger than a good-sized porpoise, or,
Say, a very moderate-sized shark. But anyone who on an ocean voyage
has watched a school of porpoises playing round an Atlantic liner will
agree with me that they experience no difficulty whatever in swimming
at such a pace as this and in keeping it up apparently for an indefinite
length of time.

If now we turn to any professor of physiology and ask him what
power a porpoise, or a small shark of about the same size as the torpedo,
can reasonably be expected to develop and maintain, he will probably
tell us 1 horsepower, or, if he were disposed to be liberal, he might per-
haps say 2. Anyway, whatever be the exact expenditure of force in
the propulsion of the porpoise, for which I have no data and do not
stop to argue,it is clear that if it were to develop anything in the
remotest degree approaching to the power required to drive the torpedo
at the same speed it would quickly be reduced to impotence. It would
rapidly burn up and consume the tissues of its body in such an immense

SM 94 45

674 SCIENTIFIC PBOBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

production of energy, and in a few minutes we should see it floating on
the water an inert and lifeless mass, instead of sporting about as lvely
as ever, as we actually do see it. Now, whence comes this enormous
difference in the power required to propel the porpoise and the torpedo
at the same speed? The answer to this question contains, as 1 sub-
mit, the true and proper line of development of the marine engineermg
of the future.

No doubt we shall be told at onee that steamships can not imitate
the movements of the porpoise, that his motion is a question of fluid
displacement and ‘stream-line” action or effect, due to the sinuous
inflections of his body, and of his tail especially. This is partly true,
and it is not here contended that we can make ships with flexible back-
bones like a fish, and give them a fish-like motion. Nevertheless it
appears probable, if not certain, that the main and essential cause of
the enormous waste of power at present attaching to man’s work, the
ship or the torpedo, when compared with nature’s work, the porpoise
or the shark, is surface or skin friction.

That skin friction is the leading agent in rendering necessary the
immense power required to propel ocean steamers or battleships through
the water is clearly recognized by the chief authorities on the subject,
such as Mr. White in his standard work on naval architecture. Herein
he only follows on the principles which were first, I think, formulated
by the elder Mr. Froude, late investigator of marine problems to the
British Admiralty, in a paper read. many years ago at a meeting of
the British association at Bristol. In order to clear away a prevail.
ing misconception, or popular error, which quite vitiates any sound
argument on this whole subject, it seems necessary to refer to Mr.
Froude’s paper. Therein he demonstrated that the idea that the resist:
ance to motion of a body through water is to be measured by “ head”
resistance, or the resistance of its cross section, to passage through the
water is baseless and mistaken. There is really no such thing as head
resistance, so that if a fairly well-designed body, such as a torpedo, were
entirely immersed in a perfect fluid and started in motion at any given
speed it would, if there were no surface friction, continue to move
uniformly in a straight line ad infinitum. The result of this law, as
applied to water, which is not quite a perfect fluid, but has some small
amount of viscosity, is that very nearly but not quite all—about 98 per
cent, Speaking approximately from memory—of the total resistance to
the motion of such a torpedo under water is due to skin or fluid friction.
Any considerable reduction therefore in this friction would effect a very
large corresponding gain in the speed of the submerged body, or a
diminution in the power required to propel it at the same speed.

When we come to deal with the case of bodies only partly submerged,
such as ships, the matter is not so simple, as a very appreciable fraction
of the total resistance to motion is due to the action of waves and wind,
and involves a consideration of length, depth, ete., on the part of the
SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 675

ship, as compared with the magnitude, period, direction, and character
of the opposing waves. Nevertheless Mr. White, to whom I again refer
as the leading authority, has clearly laid down that a varying percent-
age, amounting aiways to considerably the larger half, of the total
resistance to such a vessel’s motion through the water is still due to
surface or skin friction.

Broadly, therefore, we are brought to this conclusion, that this friction
is the leading and essential cause of the great waste of power in the
propulsion of all vessels of man’s design, whether partly or wholly sub-
merged, when compared with the natural propulsion of fish or marine
animals, such as whales, under corresponding circumstances and condi-
tions. Hence the ner ction of the possible reduction of this friction is
one of vast and supreme importance to the marine engineer.

Now if we saw that nature solved this problem in only one way, and
that way clearly inapplicable to such bodies as steamships, we might
well despair of any good result to be obtained by inquiry and investi-
gation into the subject. Thus, if all fish, marine animals, and rapidly
moving aquatic birds were all alike coated with slime like the eel we
might feet conclude that, as we can hardly hope to coat her Majesy’s
izonclads with perpetual slime, we may give the question up. But as
a matter of fact we find on a very slight consideration of the subject
that nature solves this problem in many and various different ways.
The slime of the eel whereby, as we may perhaps presume, he is enabled
to slip easily through the water has no sort or kind of resemblance to
the rough, hard, shagreen, or tough outer skin of the shark, nor is this,
again, in the least like the scales of the numerous varieties of scale fish,
the fur of the otter or the seal, or the feathers of a rapidly diving bird.
Here, therefore, as it appears, is a vast field open to inquiry, investiga-
tion, and experiment.

As | think, it isa much more promising field than our present system
of piling up enormous engine power to meet an enormous and ever-
increasing-resistance. For we have already said that the resistance
to our locomotion through water at present increases in a rapidly
increasing ratio aS we increase the speed; whereas it seems clear that
nature in her beautiful arrangements for dispensing with or minimizing
skin friction contrives to avoid altogether this disproportionate piling
up of resistance to increased speed. It should, however, be noted that
this whole problem is greatly complicated by the question of the con-
tinual fouling of ships’ bottoms, due to the growth of weeds, the shells
of marine parasites, etc. Scientific investigators may propose as many
elaborate antifriction, surfaces as they please, but any old tar who has
seen his ship frequently coated thickly with barnacles and weeds, in
spite of the use of numerous patent antifouling compositions, will be
likely to shake his head doubtfully over them.

This is a serious complication. It means that we must seek for some
substance or some system of construction for the external coating of
676 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

our vessels which will lend itself as little as possible to the lodgment
of such weeds and barnacles. And it also means probably that our
ships must be overhauled in dry dock more frequently and regularly,
which again will involve the construction of numerous docks at suit-
able ports along the ocean highways. But I submit that such meas-
ures will well repay us, if thereby we can gain a more than equivalent
increase in speed.

Nevertheless I freely admit that it is very possible that no inert and
lifeless surface of man’s design can be or ever will be devised which
will compete for the present purpose with the living skin, fur, or
feathers which an all-wise Creator has specially adapted to the pur-
pose of marine navigation according to the requirements of the various
aquatic forms of life.

But we need not thereupon despair. It would be simple folly to
despair of this problem so long as we are so profoundly ignorant of its
true conditions. When we have thoroughly investigated the laws and
working of this fluid friction and ascertained its true nature and
limits, we shall then, and not till then, be justified in forming an
opinion as to whether it be or be not possible to meet and deal with
it successfully by methods which are practically applicable to ocean
navigation.

Practical methods are the essence of the matter; for nobody is fool-
ish enough to pretend that we can coat our ironclads externally with
sealskin or with porpoise hide, and undoubtedly we are at a great
disadvantage as compared with nature and her living forms. Very
possibly the ultimate solution of this question may be found in the
application of some new material altogether to the external coating of
our vessels. Compressed paper, or compressed ramie fiber, which are
now increasingly employed in America for railway wheels and steam
pipes, would seem promising materials for the purpose. They adinit of
being molded externally into any minute grooves or tiny overlapping
plates, like the scales of a fish. Little or no extra expense will thereby
be incurred, as an enormous hydraulic pressure, capable of forming any
required surface, is already employed in the regular course of manu-
facture; or they can just as easily be molded into a rough shagreen,
which in form can be made a facsimile reproduction of the skin of the
shark, and by their tough and strong retentive structure they would
effectually protect the steel or real skin of the vessel from corrosion by
the salt water. But all this is mere conjecture. Any such suggestions
which any man can propound will be nothing more than conjecture, so
long as we are content to remain in our present deplorable darkness and
ignorance of the real governing conditions of the problem. What we
most require is therefore light.

I venture to think that the lords of the Admiralty could hardly
spend £2,000 or £3,000 a year, or whatever modest sum a systematic
course of experiments, undertaken by a competent authority like Mr.

SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 677

Froude, might cost, with greater advantage to her Majesty’s navy and
to the nation at large as the leading maritime power, than by spending
it in such an investigation. It is easy to see the general line which a
course of experiments might take. Thus one might commence with a
real live porpoise, or, if smaller scale experiments and a cheaper plant
be necessary, with a salmon or a pike. Tow him through the water, in
a tank or pond, in a more or less inanimate and nonresisting condition,
and measure carefully by chronographs and power meters the exact
horsepower required to attain a given speed or the exact time and
speed due to a given horsepower. Then run a steel bar through him
to kill and keep him rigid, aud repeat the experiments with a view to
ascertain how far the rigidity of form would affect the result. Next
’ weigh and take an exact cast of him in plaster of paris, and cause any
number of models to be made, all of the same uniform pattern and
weighted up to the same weight, but vary the material and surface
structure of the models indefinitely, with a view to ascertain the con-
ditions of minimum and maximum skin friction. Repeat the experi-
ment with these various models. The result of such a preliminary
course of experiment, especially if carried out on a good-sized scale, say
with models of a large porpoise or a shark, could not fail to be most
valuable and important. It would establish incontestably, once and
for all, whether I am correct in believing that there is any such large
difference between the power required to tow a torpedo through the
water and that required for a fish or marine animal of a corresponding
size. If so, we should learn generally how, by further systematic
investigation, to determine the real and essential conditions on which
this difference hinges. Thereby we should probably see eventually the
best way of minimizing fluid friction in practice. It should be borne
in mind that, if we could only gain a knot an hour in the speed of an
ironclad or an Atlantic liner for a given horsepower, the result would
be very important, and would amply repay any possible cost and
trouble in the experiments.

It would probably be found that a smooth surface of iron or steel is
about the worst which we can give to our ships. For a smooth metal
surface has apparently the property of attracting and detaining the
particles of water in contact with it, whether by molecular attraction
or otherwise. Thereby the water in immediate contact with the vessel’s
side or bottom is drawn along with her, and its particles communicate
their motion to an outer circle of particles, and so on till a vast mass of
water is set constantly in motion alongwith theship. This is precisely
what we want to avoid, as the essence of the reduction of fluid friction
is to slip easily through the water with the least possible disturbance.
Herein lies, as I imagine, the great advantage of the surface structure
of the fish. It would probably be found by experiment that an exact.
model of a fish in any ordinary material, as wood, iron, steel, etc., when
towed through the water at a given rate, would communicate motion to
678 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE.

a straw or light floating object lying near its course to a far greater

extent than would the real fish passing through the water at the same
speed. Experiments on this point would be easy, and would be as val-
uable and suggestive when applied to different materials and surfaces
as the former suggested experiments on horsepower.

Nature seems to abhor generally a really smooth or polished surface
for water propulsion. Thus, if we put a piece of the skin of the sole
under the microscope we shall see that it is composed of overlapping
layers of scales. On the lower or outer end of each scale we see a
number of small projecting horns or points. I can only presume that
the particles of water in most immediate contact with the fish are
passed on from seale to scale like the rain running off a slated roof

without pausing to adhere to any individual scale, and that their |

disengagement without adhesion or friction arising from molecular
attraction is facilitated in some way by the projecting rows of points.
Further similar and collaterai investigations will easily suggest them-
selves. But enough, and perhaps more than enough, has been said.
I will therefore conclude this discussion by repeating that the question
of the reduction of fluid friction is one of primary importance to the
whole future of ocean navigation, and that it is high time that the
attention of competent marine engineers should be directed to the
subject.

So far I have confined myself to this question of fluid friction, as a
thorough study of its laws constitutes, it is contended, the proper and
the only sound and scientific basis for the marine engineering of the
future. But we must not stop there. It does not require the trained
perception of a naval architect to see that we must go further. I hope

that the majority of such skilled specialists, who take a broad view of |

the present position of their profession, will agree with me that the
next step after we have eliminated as far as possible, or brought down
to an irreducible minimum, the all-important element of fluid friction,

will be to set ourselves to reduce similarly to a minimum the other

important retarding element of wave action. This means probably, in
the case especially of cargo-carrying steamships, the adoption of a
vessel of the American whale-back type, or some suitable modification
of it, with a light commodious superstructure for the convenience and
comfort of passengers and crew.

Should we be fairly successful in these two distinct objects, the
reduction to a minimum of fluid friction by suitable modifications in
the external materials and structure of our ships, and the similar
reduction of retarding wave action by the employment of a long, deep,
mainly submerged vessel, the ocean steamships of the future may
perhaps run at 40 or even 50 knots an hour without any undue or
extraordinary increase in propulsive power.

It is at present quite impossible to give any estimate of the magni-
tude and importance of the issues involved in a successful solution of
SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 679

these problems. This will entirely depend upon the extent to which we
can reduce the fluid resistance. If we can eventually approximate in
any considerable degree to the easy course of the fish, the result will
amount to a complete revolution in ocean navigation.

III.

In order not to prolong this paper unduly I will only briefly mention
two more distinct subjects in which there seems to be room for probable
large new departures in the future, and at no remote date.

The problem of how to extract the stored-up power in coal without
burning it is of the first importance to the whole future of physical
and mechanical science. It is generally admitted that the very best
designed furnace is but a lame and most wasteful way of utilizing the
vast reservoir of potential work in a ton of coal. The leading chemists
and professors of science are aware of the magnitude and importance
of this problem, and no doubt many able and competent brains are
now at work upon it. The question, if I rightly apprehend it, amounts
to this: How can we best, by some simple and practical process, reduce
coal to a condition in which it will, when brought into conjunction with
the inexhaustible reservoir of oxygen in the atmosphere, give us the
necessary elements for the production of an electric battery? The suc-
cessful solution of this problem will constitute a new era in science
and lead to results of vast and incaleulable importance in the future.
It is quite possible that its early solution, by supplying us with the
necessary conditions for the production of power in an extremely light
and portable shape, will greatly hasten and facilitate a successful attack
upon the first discussed problem of aerial navigation.

Lastly, the problem of how to reduce the vegetable foods, which at
present are only adapted to animals like the cow, the sheep, or the
horse, to a condition suited to the human digestion and to the human
palate is one of great importance. The chemical constituents of these
vegetable foods, such as grass, are similar to those which we now con-
sume in various existing foods, and they are adapted to the require-
ments of the human frame. It is only a question of digestion. It can
hardly be but that with the continual progress of organic chemistry
and medical science some means will sooner or later be discovered of
solving this problem. If the process can be brought to a cheap and
workable shape the sources of our food supply will be greatly enlarged
and extended at a time, perhaps, when increasing population and a
growing pressure in the struggle for existence will render such a result
most opportune and welcome to the world.
THE FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY AND THE
TRANSITION FROM THE PHILOSOPHIC TO THE SCIEN-
TIFIC AGE.

By RUDOLPH VIRCHOW.

A pleasant task is set the orator on this day. The son of the founder
of our university made choice of his father’s birthday as the occasion
on which to renew annually in festive assembly the memory of King
Frederick William III, and to keep alive among all classes the feeling
of gratitude for his high-minded deed.

The task has gradually increased in difficulty. For many years we
were accustomed to listen to men at this celebration who had helped to
rear our university, which enjoys the honorable distinction of bearing
the name of Frederick William. As living witnesses they were qual-
ified to give testimony of the intentions which underlay the beginnings
of the great work. Their personal experiences enabled them to recount
the difficulties that had to be overcome in order to realize the funda-
mental ideas. As contemporaries of the founder finally they could
justly claim attention when they spoke of the successes obtained by
the new institution, and of the impediments which had often opposed
themselves to the inner and outer development of academic life. With
what reverent attention we younger men harkened to the words drop-
ping from eloquent lips, and how wide were the circles that expected,
to hear in them a sober and frank judgment on the methods that had
been employed and to receive advice and encouragement for the future!

The ranks of these men have been quickly exhausted; the last of
them has passed away. Even the oldest of our contemporaries who
saw King Frederick William III belong to a younger generation, which
had a realizing sense neither of the degradation nor of the glorious
reconstruction of our country. We can follow up the story of the
founding of our institution only by means of historic tradition, which,
it is universally conceded, is fragmentary and untrustworthy even in
the case of recent events. We may say with some degree of certainty
what we have become, but we grow dubious when we are called upon
to tell how we have become what weare. The specialist has confidence
in himself only when his specialty is concerned, and so it happens that
most of the recent orators of this day have preferred to depict the
course of development in the light of their specialty.

682 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

Yet not one has been able to forego the consideration of the struggle
through which the idea of the establishment of this university culmi-
nated in a creative act at a time of sore hardship. Often as the story
has been told, it must be told anew for the benefit of youth ripening
into manhood and the refinement of endeavor in all circles of academic
culture. It must be instilled into them that the founding of the Berlin
University was not merely an act of highest political wisdom, but also
an eminently moral deed.

As early as his crown prince days, Frederick William had been drawn
into the surging flood that was soon to submerge the whole of Europe.
He had been compelled to take part in the unfortunate campaign
against revolutionary France, which had shattered Prussia’s strength.
His father’s last political act of importance, the third partition of
Poland, had burdened him with a heritage whose baneful influence
made itself felt for many days. He had assumed the reins of govern-
ment filled with the most benevolent and the noblest intentions for
the weal of his subjects. To his own country he promised economy
and far-reaching reforms; to foreign countries, strict neutrality. He
devoted himself earnestly to the affairs of government, not in the
perfunctory fashion of a mere administrator of the highest power, but
with the positive energy of a true reformer. Then it was, as we know,
that the idea of founding a university at Berlin occurred to him and
grew strong. In vain! The-march of European affairs, to whose com-
plication Frederick William II had greatly contributed, with fatalistie
logic dragged Prussia intoruin. <A single battle annihilated the army,
and with it the state of Frederick the Great. What the arms of the
enemy had left undone was completed by the treachery and the folly of
the leaders. The King could save the remnant of the loyal brave only
by leading it back across the Vistula. All the provinces beyond the
Elbe were lost; the rest, impoverished, bereft of practically all their
resources, appeared to be easy booty for the conqueror. To hope for
better days was by most held to be audacity.

And there were audacious men in Prussia. The severity of the
oppression, the monstrous ill-usage to which the people—to which even
the King and his family—were exposed, aroused the desire for revenge
and the longing for deliverance from alien rule in unsuspected strength.
To a greater extent than for centuries personal interests sank into the
background to make room for the great thought of patriotism and
liberty. Out of the chaos of passions sprang up idealism—that Ger-
man idealism which was soon to become the hobgoblin of the conqueror.
How long since nothing had been heard of a German Vaterland! And
now the poet’s cry rang out, “‘Our country must be wider.” How few
had harbored the thought that such a Vaterland might become the
rock of civic liberty and peace, the home of the highest aspirations

With sincere gratitude we must acknowledge that the King was one

FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 683

of the idealists. In the days of Memel and K6nigsberg he found time
to pass the prospects for the future in review with faithful counselors.
Depressed by the tragic fate of the country, anxious lest new efforts
lead to deeper humiliation, his heart full of concern about the sad
effects upon his dear ones, he still had the strength of mind to preserve
his personal dignity, and not only to cling to the hope of a favorable
turn in his fortunes, but also, with truly statesman-like appreciation of
the circumstances, to devise ways and means whereby the rehabilitation
of the people might be made possible through its own energy.

His deep religious feeling, never left him during his long reign, filled
him with immutable trust in God. ‘ With God for King and country”
soon became the battle ery with which the people rushed to the bitter
war, for confidence was inspired by the caution and resolution with
which the tried men summoned to the King’s council made all prep-
arations for long-delayed deliverance. It had become a principle with
the Government to call into unhampered action all the living forces
of the State. As early as 1807 and 1808 reforms that may be described
as almost revolutionary were instituted. ‘The principle that every citi-
zen is in duty bound to serve in the defense of his country, wholly new
to the modern world, was enunciated. The way was opened for the free
economic development of the rural districts and the self-government of
the municipal communities. New institutions in the province of peda-
gogics were to offer the surest guarantee for the education of the people,
and as his first and highest task the King put upon his programme the
establishment of a university in Berlin.

By the cession of the western provinces, Halle, Erlangen, and a
number of Saxon, Westphalian,and Rhenish universities were lost. A
deputation of nroressors from Halle approached the King at Memel in
August, 1807, to petition for the transfer of their university to Berlin.
For political reasons the King felt obliged to refuse the request, but he
announced his intention of creating a new university at Berlin, adding
the celebrated sentiment that what the state had lost in physical forces
must be replaced by spiritual forces. Accordingly, a cabinet order of
September 4, 1807, decreed “the establishment at Berlin of an insti-
tution for all branches of learning in suitable connection with the
Academy of Sciences.”

Berlin at that time was still occupied by the French. A year passed
before the evacuation on December 3, 1808. On December 13 a new
cabinet was formed, and on February 20, 1809, Wilhelm yon Humboldt
was put at the head of the bureau of education. Now the actual work
began. A few months later we find the erudite statesman in the far
East occupied with what he considered his first and foremost duty, the
preliminaries for the organization of the Berlin University. It was to
be more, he said, than a merely local institution; by its instrumentality
“German science was to be given a refuge, the hope of which had
almost been relinquished.” He engaged the services of a number of
684 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

distinguished scholars, secured the privileges for the new institution,
and procured for it this palace in which we now are, failing to obtain
only the endowment which he had demanded. On June 14,1810, he felt
impelled to hand in his resignation, but he gave up his office with the
consciousness of having reached the highest practical success of his
life.

At Christmas of 1809 the King left East Prussia, accompanied by
his family and his councilors. A sorely tried man of 40, he returned
to the capital whence his ancestors during four centuries had managed
the building up of the state, of which lttle more than the foundations
remained. He came back to the places that had witnessed the peaceful
joys of his young married life, and where he had striven to insure his
people’s happiness by training it to the fear of God and to pure moral-
ity. How changed was all that! Yet his greatest trial was still to come.
The King’s dearest possession, his beautiful, high-minded wife, lis
solace and comfort in misfortune, who had shared all his suffering with
unparalleled courage, was to be torn from his side. The insidious
disease, whose ravages had long been perceptible, made rapid strides,
and on July 19, 1810, the Queen succumbed.

The world knows how deeply Frederick William felt the loss, how his
whole people sorrowed with him. Even at this late day, every beholder
of the magnificent monument erected by the King in honor of his
martyr wife is seized with admiration and grief. At the time, the
remembrance of the Queen’s troubles was an added incentive to the
most strenuous efforts for the deliverance of the country, and so make
amends, as it were, for the distress inflicted upon the noblest of women.

A chronologicalereview of the documents pertaining to the prepara-
tions for the new university betrays by only a slight gap the occurrence
of the sad event. In August the negotiations are resumed, the last for
which Wilhelm von Humboldt’s counsel was invited. The cabinet order
appointing the first rector and the deans of the four faculties bears date
September 28, and on October 10, 1810, the officers elected up to that
time assembled in the university building. It was a small gathering,
sixteen persons in all. The proceedings were conducted in a business-
like manner, without blare of trumpets. It is evident that the troublous
times weighed on all minds. Perhaps never before nor since has so
momentous an act, one so long and eagerly awaited, been accomplished
so quietly and informally.

Work was begun at once. On October 15 Hufeland, Graefe, and
Klaproth, and on October 21 Fichte, opened their lecture courses, and
on October 29, the day originally set, the majority of the professors
followed suit. Small though the corps of instructors was, it was ener-
getic and efficient; the brilhancy of their names and achievements com-
pensate for their restricted numbers.

It is not our object to-day to enter into further details. Our anni-
versary celebration rather suggests a general discussion of the results

FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 685

effected by the new institution. To what extent has it fulfilled the
expectations entertained by the King at its establishment? And what
has been its significance in the development of science?

Without boastfulness we may say that its first effect was to stimulate
most powerfully the sense of nationality. Its very existence indicated
that Prussia had not given herself up for lost. Its first years, to be sure,
witnessed an increase in the oppression exeicised by alien rule. Napo-
leon’s Russian campaign heightened the misery of the provinces still in
the possession of Prussia. The exactions levied by the enemy, despite
his having become an ally, exhausted their last resources. Forced to
participate in the invasion of Russia, the Prussian army revolted from
the humiliation of acting as the tool for a stranger’s purposes. The
patriots, and with them the young who had stayed at home, applied
themselves to devise means to shake off the yoke of foreign rule. A
circle of enthusiastic youths gathered about Fichte, who had never
given up the hope of regeneration, and had begun his inspiring
addresses to the German nation even before the establishment of the
university. And when finally,after the disgraceful end of the Russian
campaign, resistance began to gather force in distant East Prussia;
when a rising of the whole people came within the range of the possi-
ble, and resolution won the day in the King’s council, then the summons
to the war of liberation was nowhere obeyed more enthusiastically than
in the Berlin University circles. Here all was in readiness. Teachers
and students presented themselves for military service; the memorial
tablet in this hall records the names of the brave who in 1813 and 1815
sealed their devotion to their country with death. -So the university
showed by precept and example what forces spiritual elevation creates
for the service of the state.

Slowly the almost deserted lecture rooms filled up after peace was
established, and a still longer time it took our academic youth to real-
ize that their duty consisted in study and preparation for action, not in
action itself. Repeatedly academic liberty was in imminent danger on
account of the unbridled desire of individuals to interfere with the
course of public affairs. But gradually the conviction that quiet work
was the real object of study gained ground, and the palladium of aca-
demic life, namely, liberty of instruction for the teachers and liberty of
study for the students (Lehrfreiheit und Lernfreiheit), was happily
rescued from all assaults.

Along what lines did the actual development of the university pro-
ceed? Let us briefly review the aims of scholarly research before 1510;
details are of course out of the question.

Since the Reformation the philosophic faculties had assumed a more
and more dominating position at the North German universities. Though
occupying the last place in the hierarchic series, the philosophie fac-
ulty exercised a determining influence upon the general tendency of the
studies with regard to method as well as matter. In this department
686 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

classical philology and history were represented as well as mathematics
and a part of the natural sciences; and philosophy in the restricted
sense being added, this faculty gave clearest expression to the uni-
versality of academic instruction. The philosophic faculty was the
microcosm, as it were, of the universitas. The other faculties were in
this way forced into the position of specialty schools; even the medical
faculties, though frequently they possessed chairs of chemistry, botany,
and natural history, not wholly escaping this description. The more
sturdily philosophy in the narrow sense of the term developed, the
more it seemed the center, or in fact the culmination, of scholarly study.
Its method was adopted as the standard for all branches.

Philosophy first developed to magnificent proportions in Halle. The
Elector Frederick [II founded the university at Halle in 1694, as also
the Academy of Arts and of Sciences at Berlin, in order, as he said, to
“make a human being of man, to cleanse him of the filth of barbarism,
and give him a home on earth.” In Halle philosophy, for the first time
on German soil, obtained a preeminent position. Christian Wolf gath-
ered numerous disciples about him, and they quickly spread the new
manner all over Germany. Soon, however, he aroused the suspicions
of the orthodox. Anaddress, “De philosophia Sinensium morale,” gave
the occasion for a cabinet order by Frederick William I, on November
15, 1723, removing him from his position and punishing him with
immediate banishment. Thus ended this first promising attempt.
The recall of Wolf by Frederick II in 1740 was unavailing to make
amends.

The glory of having secured for philosophy a second and long period
of splendor fell to the share of the University of K6nigsberg, founded
by Duke Albert of Prussia in 1544, to be the high school of the unadul-
terated Lutheran creed. But as early as the time of the great Frederick
it began to lose its theologic character. Immanuel Kant, who received
the professorship of logic and metaphysics in 1770, became the accepted
teacher of central Europe; through his agency criticism replaced dogma.
Notwithstanding this, his authority was recognized by the ecclesiasti-
cal schools; even the Catholic universities in the central provinces of
Germany sent him students designed to serve as teachers at home.
The rigidity of his moral system, the absolute validity of the categori-
cal imperative taught by him, formed the connecting link between two
views of life diametrically opposed to each other at every other point.
Frederick William III, who had been interested in Kant’s works from
his crown prince days, and had entered into personal relations with
him during his East Prussian exile, esteemed at its full value his high
moral influence. Kant’s successful career contributed not a little to the
strengthening of the hopescherished in Government circles in connection
with the establishment of a new university.

These hopes centered in Fichte, one of Kant’s disciples, who in fact
stood godfather to our university, and at its very inception impressed
FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 687

upon it, as it were, his sign manual. It had been his fortune to be
teacher in Jena at that period of greatest luster, when the poet princes
inaugurated a new era in literature and a host of excellent scholars
joined them. Among the younger men pouring in from all sides were
the brothers Humboldt, who built the bridge across which Fichte
passed to the northern capital. In 1793 the professorship of philosophy
was conferred upon him at Jena. This is the first step toward that
departure in philosophy which, in its essence idealistic, led to “ Natur-
philosophie” and in quick succession transformed one branch of science
after another on lines of a priori reasoning. Fichte was soon accused of
atheism, and when a strong and agile antagonist arose in hisown camp
in the person of Schelling, he preferred to leave the little town of the
muses. Frederick William III received him in Berlin, even before the
university was organized, and so created for him the possibility of
applying his idealism on the field of practical polities in a way probably
never before vouchsafed to a philosopher. His fiery zeal, his eloquence,
his love of liberty, insured an influence, which would certainly have
become paramount for a long period after the establishment of peace,
had fate not decreed otherwise. On January 27, 1814, Fichte died of
typhoid fever, contracted at the bedside of his wife, who had brought
the infection from the military lazaretto.

At the instigation of Schleiermacher, Hegel was proposed to the min-
istry in 1816 as Fichte’s successor. Despite the opposing vote of De
Wette, who represented that this philosopher’s system contradicted
Christianity and no less the reliable principles of Aristotelian logic, and
in reality was but a form of ‘ Naturphilosophie,” the Government
offered no objections. But the negotiations were without result on this
occasion. A little while later, in 1818, the services of the ready dia-
lectician were secured for Berlin. Everybody awaited his lectures with
eagerness. The circle of his adherents grew rapidly and annually
became greater. Soon his influence over the thought and speech of his
contemporaries had become so decided that Hegelians were to be found
in every faculty. The whole body of science was remodeled by them,
and their master’s terminology was carried to the remotest depths of
every specialty. When, on November 14, 1831, he succumbed to the
cholera on its first march through our land, he left a veritable staff of
drilled disciples who undertook to continue the work in his spirit and
transmit the traditions of his system to future generations. Nothing
could have seemed more firmly joined than the system of this self-
centered school. Theology and jurisprudence, political science, and
«esthetics all wore the garb of Hegelian language and theory; only in
medicine and the natural sciences the invasion had confined its depre-
dations to individual authorities. Although the master was gone, his
halo remained visible for fully a decade, one may say, up to the death
of King Frederick William III, whose minister, Altenstein, himself an
enthusiastic Hegelian, kept the system in power by his favor. But not
688 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

one of his disciples possessed the creative impulse, nor even the glow-
ing enthusiasm, which move great circles of men. The pedantic, often
empty phrases left as the residue of a great movement, came to be the
target of ridicule, as before they had been the object of astonishment
or even admiration,

Hegeiianism was the last of the successive philosophic schools that
grew up under the eye of Frederick William III. With “ Naturphilos-
ophie” in its more rigid, or better its more logical, development he did
not come into direct contact. Its exponent, Schelling, first Fichte’s dis-
ciple, then his rival, finally his successor in Jena, had soon transferred
his activity to Bavaria; and there he had succeeded, by bold strictures
on physiology and pathology, in attracting the attention of physicians
to himself and his system. But the influence which “ Naturphilosophie”
did indeed obtain in medicine lasted only a short time. So far as
Berlin is concerned, it might have passed without leaving a trace, had
Hegel not imported many details from his old friend Schelling into his
own system.

It is peculiar that a few decades later, after ‘‘ Naturphilosophie” had
passed its zenith, ten years after the death of Hegel, immediately after
that of King Frederick William III, an unexpected turn in affairs
seemed to hold out to ** Naturphilosophie” the hope of filling the vacant
chair of philosophy. Not long after his accession to the throne Fred-
erick William IV called Schelling to Berlin (1841). The largest lecture
halls were inadequate to hold the crowds, consisting partly of students,
partly of numerous representatives of all strata of the cultured, eager
to hear from his own lips the famous thinker’s views, held almost equal
to a revelation. It soon became evident that, as might have been
imagined, the aging philosopher sought to cover up the weaknesses of
his system by all sorts of mystic additions and by a correspondingly
confusing phraseology, but that in thought he had penetrated neither
further nor deeper. |The attempt to introduce “ Naturphilosophie” was
soon abandoned, and with the author his system vanished from Ber-
lin; its soil had been prepared, but also exhausted by Hegelianism.

A rapid survey of the inner history of our university reveals unmis-
takably that during the whole time of Frederick William III its devel-
opment took place, if not entirely, certainly to all outward appearance,
under the standard of philosophy. Yet this monarch was neither a
philosopher in the strict sense of the word, nor an enthusiastic admirer
of philosophy. On this point we have information through his biog-
rapher, the court preacher, Bishop Eylert, who was in close intercourse
with him during those years. Biased by his ecclesiastical position, he
may have made his report one-sided, but there is no reason for doubting
its truthfulness.

Hylert says of the King: ‘‘ Philosophy as such he did not care for;
he was not gifted with taste in that direction. In the history of philos-
ophy, which at least inits general features was not strange to him, he

FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 689

found nothing to induce him to cultivate the study. The succession of
shifting systems which it describes, wherein what has been built up is
destroyed, what has been praised to the skies is degraded and censured,
and ideas rejected but now appear in new guises and fresh colors,
rather had the effect of instilling distrust of human wisdom into him.”
Eylert then deseribes how the King learned to love Kant: ‘“ But when,”
the biographer goes on, ‘‘ after the death of Kant, Fichte raised a new
system, and the divine homage paid to the former was transferred to
the latter, who in turn was put into the shade by Schelling, and the
members of philosophic dynasties continued to be deposed and enthroned
in rapid succession until Hegel was called to Berlin, the King became
disgusted. He lost whatever desire he may have had to work his way
through the labyrinth of ideas, and ceased wholly to take interest.”

It seems, then, that the King speedily arrived at the conclusion
reached on devious paths by the bulk of the cultured, even by the
learned. It is certain that with the death of Hegel the university was
forever delivered from the magic spell thrown over it by philosophical
systems. No philosopher since then has occupied, nor to be just has
claimed, an equally authoritative position. But as for the conditions
prevailing during the reign of Frederick William III no epithet can
more comprehensively describe them than the expression, “the philo-
sophic age.”

A term of that kind is open to misconstruction. We have since then
had eminent philosophers among our teachers, excellent men, fitted to
explain to their audiences the nature of philosophy, the laws of thought,
the method of perceiving and judging, the course and degree of intel-
lectual development, but happily not one of them has invented a
system of philosophy or sought to introduce it into the speech of our
youth by the agency of artistically constructed phrases. ‘To be sure, a
strong motive for studying philosophy has thus been removed, for many
minds are more attracted by what is dark and unintelligible than by
what is clear and perspicuous. It is possible, too, that after the study
of a definite system of philosophy ceased to be the rule, the desire
to devote study to philosophy in general was permanently impaired.
Among us teachers it is a recognized fact that the training of many of
our students in logic and dialectics falls far short of the standard that
ought to be set up for every academic citizen, indeed for every man of
education. Therefore we are not wanting in admonitions to our stu-
dents to make up their serious deficiencies in this direction by their
own efforts. It is hard to establish since when this lamentable condi-
tion has existed. The school of “ Naturphilosophie,” which was pro-
ductive of a host of faulty methods and invalid conclusions in its very
exponents, was by its nature ill fitted to discipline students to that
degree of proficiency in thinking which we at present require. In view
ot De Wette’s discovery of acontradiction between the logic of Aristotle
and that of Hegel seventy-seven years ago, consolation may be derived

SM 94——44
690 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

from the fact that this opposition rarely crops out in the scholars of
to-day. In the measure in which philosophic systems were pushed
into the background, sober observation and common sense asserted
themselves.

King Frederick William III must be classed among the sober-minded.
It is highly characteristic of him that his intimate biographer begins
the description of his mental qualities by praising his “sound, natural,
common sense” as the foundation of his personality. ‘In a rare
degree,” he writes, ‘it (common sense) was peculiar to the King, so
that it may be said that his sound, natural, undistorted good sense pre-
vailed in all affairs, and always was his helpful companion.” There-
fore he loved nature, and although he had not enjoyed a comprehensive
edueation in the natural sciences, he was wont to devote attention and
thought to the phenomena of nature. And in connection with this char-
acteristic his biographer distinctly and repeatedly gives evidence that
“his closest confidant, the one who understood and stimulated him, was
Alexander von Humboldt—the daily mess mate, the constant traveling
companion, the intimate friend of our never-to-be-forgotten royal
master.” ;

Humboldt had also had a ‘“ Naturphilosophie” period. In Jena, in
1795, he devoted much time to the problem then occupying all minds,
the half naturalistic, half spiritualistic being called vital force. The
‘ Rhodian genius,” that winsome creation of a naturalist’s fancy, which
he later abandoned with reluctance, will always remain interesting as
a characteristic picture of the mental confusion from which even the
best men of the time could not extricate themselves. Curiously, it was
at that very period that Humboldt, stimulated first by Girtaner’s
investigation of the principle of irritability, and later more particularly
by the discoveries of Galvani and Volta, was zealously engaged with
his famous experiments on the growth of plants and on the irritation
of the nerve and muscle fiber, which demonstrated his ability to manip-
ulate the rigid methods of the scientist. It is touching to read ina
letter dated Jena, 1797: ‘‘The conviction is growing that these experi-
ments may sometime or other become the basis of the art of medicine,
and that I may be founding a new science (vital chemistry).” More and
more he turned to the empirical observation of nature, and as early as
1795 he wrote to Blumenbach: “Facts endure when philosophic struc-
tures hastily erected have long crumbled. I have always kept my facts
and my theories apart. This way of observing the phenomena of nature
seems to ne most fruitful and thorough.”

Then came his great scientific tour in America. "mmediately on his
return, September 3, 1804, Humboldt announced his willingness to
serve the King. Frederick William received him with great distinction,
and generously supplied him with the means for continuing his work.
In the capacity of companion to Prince William he was sent to Paris in
1808, where he remained even after the discharge of his political mission,

FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 691

until 1826, enjoying intimate intercourse with the first scientists of the
century. Here he completed not only his equipment as a scientific
investigator, but also his general philosophic development. In 1827 he
took up his permanent abode in Prussia, and then began his close
relation to the King, to whom he became a friend and counselor. For
our university his return definitely marked the transition to the time
of the natural sciences.

It were unjust to attribute this change to Humboldt alone, Long
before his return, a solid phalanx of genuine scientists had gathered
in Berlin. The Academy of Sciences and the Collegium Medico-Chi-
rurgicum included most efficient men among its members. The latter
institution indeed, even before the establishment of the university,
was so fully equipped with scientific instructors and facilities for the
study of the sciences, that it was worthy of being ranked with a regular
medical faculty. This fact explains why the medical faculty of the
newly organized university at first had the greatest number of students.
There were besides other institutions, each with its corps of scholars,
among them the Botanical Gardens, the Observatory, and the Library.

After all, these institutions were inadequately, in fact meanly, fitted
out, and it required the benevolence of the King and the enduring
interest of the ministers to develop and perfect them so as to make’
them accord with modern views and enable them to bear comparison with
those of other States. New positions, new opportunities for work, had
to be created, and Alexander von Humboldt was ever ready to give
help in that respect. He may be considered the guardian angel of
the natural sciences in the time of Frederick William III, and even after
his death. His extensive culture, vast memory, and numerous con-
nections enabled him to understand persons and things thoroughly and
judge them without bias, while his unprejudiced, upright character
guaranteed the impartial use of his influence, no matter to what calling,
what nation, or creed his protégé might belong. Humboldt was the
confidant not only of the scientist, but of every scholar, though the
former was naturally most strongly attracted to him.

So it happened that as early as 1828 we find him presiding over the
association of German scientists and physicians, which at that time, a
few years after its formation, held its first meeting in Berlin. If this
association, which brought together the representatives of all depart-
ments of the natural sciences for personal acquaintance and the inter-
change of ideas, came to exert great and lasting influence upon the
development of scientific culture in Germany, then it owes this position
not a little to the personal interest of Humboldt. With the Berlin
meeting began the heightened activity which has made the Association
of Scientists the most popular and most numerously attended of all the
associations without a fixed seat. The attendance of the foremost
scholars, even from foreign countries, invested its proceedings with
decisive authority in the dissemination of improved methods, in pro-
692 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

moting the general spread of new discoveries, and especially in com-
pelling the esteem of Government circles. The circumstance that
Frederick William III himself appeared at a social reunion of the
scientists was an evidence of telling success.

Humboldt was at that period busily urging the erection of a new
observatory at Berlin. The old tower in Dorotheenstrasse, which had
long served for astronomical observations, was inadequate for the
subtler problems of science, now that astronomy had aims beyond the
computation of the calendar. Frederick William III, who had had the
new observatory at Kénigsberg built in days of most grievous distress,
and had been made cognizant by Bessel of the importance of the celes-
tial science, yielded to the solicitations of his experienced counselor.
He granted funds for more perfect instruments, and soon afterwards for
the building of the new observatory.

This grant inaugurated the new period of royal activity, which since
then has made addition after addition to the scientific institutes at the
capital. Some institutions of the kind had existed before. The need of
a better corps for the medical care of soldiers had led to the establish-
ment of an anatomical amphitheater in 1713; the Academy of Sciences
had fitted up a chemical laboratory in its house on Dorotheenstrasse
under Irederick the Great; the flower and vegetable gardens laid out
in Dutch fashion by the Great Elector had gradually developed into the
Botanical Gardens, so meanly furnished, to be sure, that Frederick
William III had to be at great expense to remodel them completely in
1801.

On all sides the conviction was evidently taking root that the natural
sciences can be understood only by the observation of nature herself,
and that the effective combination of science and tangible objects
requires provisions on a large scale, such as can be afforded by museums,
collections, laboratories, institutes. This conviction became particularly
strong when it was realized that experimentation is the most important
means of forcing nature to reveal the essence, causes, and development
of a phenomenon. From the closet of the philosophers no valid expla-
nation of the facts. of nature had proceeded. Since belief in magic
formulas survived only in the lowest strata of the people, the formulas
of ‘nature philosophers” found as little confidence.

Frederick William III and his ministers, to a great extent from finan-
cial reasons, confined their assistance in the transformation of scientific
institutes to individual cases and to the sporadic betterment of the
worst abuses. A definite attitude, assumed under the guidance of fixed
principles, was never reached. Also, Frederick William IV gave more
attention to the art academies than to the scientific institutions, and it
was only a chain of fortunate circumstances that brought about in 1856,
the latter part of his reign, the erection of the new Pathologic Institute,
the first of its kind in the world.

Luckily it was not long before similar institutions for other branches

FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 693

were founded, most of them on a much more magnificent scale. Under
Emperor William arose the palaces of the Physiologic and the Physical
Tustitute; the Chemical institute was completely remodeled and an
additional building erected, together with a pharmaceutical institute ;
then followed two anatomical institutes, the great Museum of Natural
History, with the Zoologic Institute, the Hygienic Institute—in short,
in the course of a few decades so large a number of buildings was
erected that at present not one of the experimental sciences is left with-
out a home of its own in Berlin, or without the instruments necessary
for successful research. Nor have the institutions for the sick been
neglected, the less so as the municipal authorities, in praiseworthy
emulation of the example set by the Government, have erected hospitals,
each with more perfect appointmeuts than the last.

“Thus,” to cite the expression used by one of the most famous expo-
nents of physical science, our recently departed friend, Siemens, at the
second Berlin meeting of the Association of Scientists, ‘we have
stepped into the age of the natural sciences.” Nowadays the scholar is
called upon to be an investigator, and the demands made upon instruc-
tion have increased to so great an extent that the academic course of
studies is arranged with a view not only of initiating the student into
the methods of investigation, but also of affording him the opportunity
of practicing them. There is no longer need to prove the usefulness of
this sort of science. Every member of the nation is aware of the profit
that accrues to the State and to society from the new institutions.
Bacon’s old dictum, scientia est potentia, has become truth.

Surely the retrospect upon the career of our university, viewed from
the height of its present stage of development, is elevating—we may
tell ourselves that eighty years have sufficed to produce a complete
revolution in science and instruction. He who has contributed even a
mite to this consummation may look back upon his work with deep satis-
faction. But it were folly to believe that we have nothing more to
investigate, that we are proof against new dangers. Not even the
old ones are entirely removed. Perhaps the so-called exact natural
sciences, physics and chemistry, will enjoy immunity for a long time to
come, inasmuch as in them we have reached a perception of the unity
of the forces of nature, instead of regarding them as separate agencies.
But that great host of sciences whose essential theme is life and its
mysteries—biology in all its ramifications—is by no means unassail-
able, and it is precisely in this quarter that mysticism has always made
its most redoubtable encroachments.

It took long for life, as such, to be recognized in the light of a study.
The beginning of its rational observation arose not more than two hun-
dred years ago, and of these two centuries more than three-quarters
were used up in refuting the doctrine of vital force as a peculiar d¢ va pis
of a more or less spiritual nature. Only since we know that life means
cell activity, and since we can see the living being in the cell and force
694 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY.

it to submit to experimentation—knowledge which the world owes
primarily to our own Johannes Miiller and his school—no one speaks
of vital force. But this knowledge does not finally solve the question
about the nature of life any more than the question about the nature
of the human mind is answered by the proof that mental activity is
connected with nerve substance. And so long as these are open ques-
tions, so long the gates are not closed to mysticism.

With regard to this fear, nothing is more instructive than the pro-
ceedings of the medical faculty, since 1812, on the establishment of a
professorship of animal magnetism. When a considerable number of
petitioners, among them sensible physicians, entreated the appointment
of a professor of this branch, the minister of state, Von Schuckmann, |
said that, convenient though it might be to absorb wisdom during
sleep, he could never consent to the employment of a master of the art,
because his common sense taught him to consider it jugglery. The
medical faculty and the department of medicine were also opposed
thereto. A few years later the chancellor, Von Hardenberg, expressed
the urgent wish to advance Wolfart and Koreff, the chief representa-
tives of animal magnetism, and curiously enough Wilhelm von Hum-
boldt seconded the proposition. So it happened that by a royal cabinet
order the two men were made professors. This was in 1816 and 1817.

In more recent times animal magnetism has been replaced by spirit-
ism, and at present hypnotism is making tremendous exertions to dis-
lodge it and rise to the rank of a recognized science. It is a conflict like
that with homeopathy. Will science succeed in warding off the danger,
and will the Government remain strong enough to keep the paths of
science free from obstructions?

Our time, so sure of itself and of victory by reason of its scientific
consciousness, is aS apt as former ages to underestimate the strength
of the mystic impulses with which the soul of the nation is infected by
single adventurers. Even now it is standing baffled before the enigma
of anti-Semitism, whose appearance in this time of the equality of rights
is inexplicable to everybody, yet which, in spite of its mysteriousness,
or perhaps on account of it, fascinates even our cultured youth. Up to
the present moment the demand for a professorship of anti-Semitism
has not made itself heard; but rumor has it that there are anti-Semitic
professors. He who knows the ‘ Naturphilosophie” in all its minute
branchings is not astonished at such phenomena. The human mind is
only too prone to leave the difficult path of well-ordered thinking and
to indulge in fanciful musing. Such aberrations can be counteracted,
to speak with Schuekmann, only by sound common sense; and he who
has lost good sense through a perverted education can rescue himself
only by rigorous empiric work. There is nothing for it but to learn
and get accustomed to explain the unknown from the vantage ground
of the known, instead of choosing as the premise for fantastic deduc-
tions the dark and the unknown, as though they were new truths. The

natural sciences owe their triumphant career to their loyal clinging to
actual knowledge, whence they pierced the darkness of unexplored
regions. The first aim always was to search out the old law in new
phenomena and so link them with the old ones. He who hopes to find
a new law in every exception is no better off than he who sees a miracle
in every exception.

And, as in the intellectual world, so it is in the moral world, The
impulse to do the good and act uprightly rests upon the inner satisfac-
tion experienced when we perform an action in accord with human
nature, reason, and the reciprocal duties of men. The satisfaction
becomes the greater if in its performance we offer resistance to the
suggestions of passion, personal interest, or worldly advantage. Isa
positive creed or a compelling obligation necessary for this? Is there
not a moral law proceeding from our inner nature which urges us to be
true and to act nobly without human statute? Was Kant’s categorical
imperative naught but a philosophic formula? To be sure, there is a
moral education which teaches and strengthens the habit of acting
justly and avoiding wrong—true morality—but in point of fact no
education can create the moral impulse where it does not exist. There-
fore our academic discipline leaves to students a certain measure of
personal liberty, which their feeling of responsibility grants them with-
out restriction, and which permits them to develop independently,
according to the bent of their minds. They are not bound down to
certain religious ceremonies; they are given no ethical code created
specially for them. What we expect and demand of them now, as in
former days, is the free development of a self-centered, honest, wholly
fine personality. May this aim be aspired to by all that come to us;
may it be reached by a goodly number! Then will the hope wherewith
King Frederick William III founded and cherished this university be
fultilled.
THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.!

By M. LoEwy,

President of the French Academy of Sciences and President of the Institute,

GENTLEMEN: It is on the eve of an anniversary that the mind
seems to me best disposed to yield to those reflections which every
great commemoration naturally evokes in us. On the day of the cele-
bration itself, we are apt to be overcome by the brilliancy of the solemn
occasion and the enthusiasm of theinoment. Since, then, custom bids me
celebrate by a direct address to its members the foundation of the Insti-
tute, which will next year attain its completed century, this seems to me
a fit occasion to consider not what has so often been admired in you—the
picturesque variety, if Imay venture to call it so, of the talents which com-
pose each one of the academies and their totality—but rather the close
union which binds into one great whole all the works of the mind, for in
this solidarity I see the true reason for the existence of your society; this
is its true principle, this is its true life. Such was also, as you well know,
the feeling of the convention when it converted our previously isolated
classes into one great whole. This creation realized the idea that the
men of that period had formed of the human mind in its rich unity.
It also realized the dream of a model republic, in which the autonomy
of admission and the perfect liberty of individual efforts, so far from
impeding rather secure that harmonious concert of action where even
tradition results in progress. On that day was born the “living ency-
clopedia,” which so justly deserves its name. Like the other written
work, it was fit that this also should see the tight on French soil, and if
such an example is unique in the world’s history, it will create no sur-
prise to see that it is set by France, the home of liberal initiative, the
land in which even the language seems to be the offSpring of good
sense. Time has shown that this bold foresight, one of the last acts of
the eighteenth century, was by no means utopian. The powerful vitality
of the institute is the strongest argument in favor of a brotherhood in
the ideal of sciences, arts, and letters. As the part it plays in the moral
and intellectual development of the nation is continually becoming

more important, this incessant activity bears evidence to the high
prestige which it enjoys throughout the civilized world.

Not only the history of the institute, but also our personal experi-
ence and careful reflection, teach us every day the advantages of our
lifein common. However different the tasks may be which the five
academies consider their special functions, the supreme aim of all your
efforts remains the same. You seek for truth in all its aspects, for the
beautiful in all its forms; you strive to inspire man with a clearer con-
sciousness of his ability to improve. In order to attain this end, we
all and everywhere employ the same means; the methods we employ
all have but one and the same principle—to observe and to analyze all
the facts in nature and to combine them upon a basis of the unchange-
able rules of reason. The arts appeal perhaps to a logic somewhat less
severe, but by no means less rigorous, than that employed for algebra.

The beautiful, the ideal representative of truth, can not perish any
more than the latter; hence it is subject to laws that are as much above
discussion as those which govern science. The plan for a masterpiece
of architecture, the composition of a beautiful symphony, may be ana-
lyzed with nearly as much precision as a geometrical problem.

The sciences, for their part, never begin and never progress without,
as Bacon says, bringing man and nature nearer to each other; the sys-
tem of the world in its scientific aspect is probably the most beautiful
of all works of art. While science and art define the just limits of our
powers, they also make us better aware of their extent and their bound-
ary lines. Both of them finally, with all their kindred—literature, his-
tory, philosophy—teach man the same lesson of hard work, in which he
is sustained by his faith in the ideal, and fill him with the consciousness
of the lofty mission intrusted to his mind.

In proportion as progress is secured and accumulates in the vast
domain of human activity, the identity of the ends pursued and the
inevitable connection between the efforts made to reach them become
daily more marked; the study of the great problems of nature and of
life help us to comprehend better the marvelous harmony that rules all
creation; in the boundless space that surrounds us, all created bodies,
from the most minute atom to the grandest of all constellations, influ-
ence one another in some way, and their reciprocal action is subject to
eternal laws; all natural forces are preserved, binding the infinitely
small and the infinitely great to each other; new worlds arise, others
pass away, and from one evolution to another the universe advances in
perfect order toward a mysterious destiny, and we are more and more
struck by the admirable relations which all parts of this infinitely
complex creation entertain to each other.

At every instant some close, unthought of, connection between
the most varied branches of science and art is brought to light.
Who could have thought fifty years ago of the remarkably fruit-
ful intervention of physics and chemistry in astronomy, a science
THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 699

which up to that time seemed to be of a purely mathematical nature?
‘Vho could have imagined that astronomers were to find in photography
and spectroscopy their most powerful means of investigation; that
by analyzing with their aid the luminous rays, the only messengers
through whom we are in direct communication with the stars, we
could arrive at positive conclusions in regard to the physical condition
of the celestial bodies, the distance which separates them from us,
their rotation, their nascent state, the present period of their stellar
life, and their wane?) What a triumph for natural philosophy to be
able to assert that the innumerable bodies in the canopy of heaven con-
tain the same material elements as our globe!

In ascertaining the truly marvelous fact that a single luminous wave
sprung from a star is enough to convey such intimate and varied
knowledge, we can not help being seized with profound admiration for
the sublime arrangement which holds and unites all things together in
a perfect and inseparable whole. And this communication, no less sur-
prising than accurate, which modern science has succeeded in estab-
lishing with the most remote of the heavenly worlds, inspires us with
confidence in the constantly progressive advance of human intellectual
power.

Unforeseen prospects are again spread out before us. We may already
dimly perceive the solution of the momentous problems relative to the
medium and to the mode of transmission of physical forces. It may also
be that we are nearer than we think to acquiring precise notions of
that primordial substance from which come all those elementary bodies
that constitute the material Universe.

- We are thus led to the extreme boundaries of the knowable, to the
threshold of the great mysteries which it seems human curiosity will
never be allowed to penetrate. As was said by one of the greatest think-
ers that have honored our compeny, Ernest Renan, “it is here that our
reason collapses; that all science stands still; that analogy is dumb.
The antinomies of Kant, an insuperable barrier, loom before us.”

This enigmatic unity of origin of all the substances that fill space
would at once explain the connection shown by study to exist among
the phenomena that seem to be most independent, and the inevitable
concatenation of all the sciences whose subject is nature.

But instances of so deep an interpenetration are not found in the
physical sciences alone. The close relations to one another of all the
operations of the mind become every day more apparent and numerous.
As we now know, the necessary preparation for successful application
to historical and archeological studies comprise a knowledge of the eli-
mate, of the structure, and successive evolutions of the soil on which
the human races have developed, and all the traces that these races
have left behind on their passage must be rigidly investigated.

The necessity of universal knowledge asserts itself on every occasion.
It was again evidenced in one of our quarterly meetings, when one of
TOO THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.

our colleagues laid before us, with admirable clearness, his manifold
investigations of a curious question in history.

This, then, is the time when, more than ever before, we must yield
to the exigency of participating in the general productions of intellec-
tual activity, to the need of universal cultivation of the mind.

But, on the other hand, the inevitable effect of this condition of things
is that at no time was so desirable a requirement so difficult to fill.
We are no longer living in a period when eminent minds might believe
it possible to embrace the whole of human knowledge. Neither do I go
so far back as the century in which Leonardo da Vinci was at once the
representative of poetry, fine arts, mathematical and natural sciences.
I merely refer to the times of Cuvier, of Arago, and of Humboldt, when
a poet could, without being charged with temerity, have pretensions to
scientific attainments and even make a lasting record, as Goethe did,
in natural history.

At the present time the repeated and prodigious conquests of science
and the general advance of ideas have imposed entirely novel condi-
tions of labor on the human mind.

The grandeur, variety, and number of the discoveries that have been
achieved in the latter half of this century suggest the statement that
it offsets all that was done in preceding ages.

Innumerable ways are now laid open before intellectual activity. On
the one hand it will henceforth be impossible to ascribe any limits to
the fields of investigation in the sciences of the past, and on the other
hand we are now supplied with methods of wonderful accuracy and
power for observing and analyzing the most impressive phenomena as
well as the most minute manifestations of nature, whose secrets we are
thus more and more enabled to penetrate.

But each discovery evokes further and manifold revelations, and indi-
vidual investigators are overwhelmed in the presence of new horizons
that spread out before them. However extensive the faculties may be,
the efforts must be confined and action concentrated on a limited field of
study, as are those of the plowman working a fertile fallow land of vast
expanse.

How many of the scientific men of our day could fairly assert that
they have been able to master in all its recesses the science that they
pursue?

We are then confronted by a condition which is apparently bound to
grow unavoidably worse and seriously to hamper the soaring of human
exertion.

Should we conclude, as some interpreters of Bufton’s saying have
done, that genius in the future will be nothing else than long patience?
We do not believe it.

Our common life helps us out of the dilemma, as far as it is possible.
It enables us to acquaint ourselves at once with all new attainments
and to turn them to advantage. It draws every mind out of the par-

lay f

THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. (Ol

ticular sphere within which it would be prone to confine itself, and in an
enlarged expanse it affords glimpses over the whole domain of thought.

It is this common life, in which each of us aims at borrowing from
his neighbor his commendable qualities, that made us fond of express-
ing ourselves with clearness and logic; this is one of the causes of our
originality, and may have been noticed not only among writers but also
among scientific men.

Nor is this all: There is a consensus of opinion that great discoveries
or lofty conceptions are stamped with a reflective logic, which keeps
imagination within bounds, protects the scientific man from wild
hypotheses, the artist and writer from false principles and errors of
taste. This character of high impersonality, of prudent wisdom, whose
disregard is one of the failings of our contemporaries, is found to exist
in your assembly in a conspicuous degree, for yours is in that respect a
privileged assembly.

Indeed all these investigations conducted by you in every direction
and by every method must be harmonious, since they are the result of
the same efforts, converge toward the same goal, and express the whole
of human thought. By this constant collaboration you are the most
vivid hght of intellectual life. By its pure and brilliant rays you see
the close solidarity of your endeavors; you constantly have before your
eyes the ideal plan under which they are united and utilized for the
better advantage of the work in which all the ages of humanity have
participated—the progress of civilization. You obtain a better grasp
of its main lines, you make more steady progress in the discovery of
truth, and, with the assistance of all the noble qualities inherent in
national characteristics, you climb with a firm step the luminous heights
toward which we are driven by our destiny on earth.

In fine, while it can not be gainsaid that so great a number of wonder-
ful results, of bold doctrines, of sublime conceptions, has stirred to its
very depth the mind of our age, and has imparted to the spirit of eriti-
cism a disquieting acuteness, this is the place where we are to look for
a brake and a regulator to apply to the wanderings of mysticism and
skepticism, of which the one gives all up to rash imagination and the
other brings all under barren animadversion.

You will preserve for the most ideal manifestations of the mind, for
art and for literature, the glorious traditions of the past.

You will push aside those morbid productions, those arbitrary specu-
lations that do not rest on the true reality of nature and of moral life,
and which, instead of touching the soul with the spark of enthusiasm,
pervade it with delusive bitterness.

It shall always be your pride that profound good sense, superior
logic, which confer on our country its first title to glory in the history
of civilization, can be said to be a sacred trust over which the Institute
of France watches with pious care.

In the course of this plenary sitting, a symbol of the effective union
702 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.

which now binds all the academies in common aspirations, our thoughts
naturally revert to those whose death has left among us recent and
lamented vacancies. It is our reverent duty, and it fills our heart with
inward satisfaction, to give them a heartfelt remembrance by recalling
in a few words the works and the accomplishments of our late col-
leagues whom death, alas, has taken from us in the course of the year.
The Academy of Sciences has suffered most. The list of our losses
is headed by a member of the section of rural economy, M. Cham-
brelent. Our lamented colleague, whose zealous activity continued to
the last hour of his life, combined the highest knowledge of engineer-
ing with all the qualities of these daring pioneers of civilization, who
undertake a struggle with the forces of nature and often discover in
those blind and apparently dreadful agents fresh elements of fertility
for the soil and of comfort for the people. A great part of his life was
devoted to works of that kind, such as the erection of protecting dams
in the Camargue, so frequently laid waste by the waves of the sea, the
removal of torrents in the Alps, the protection of forests against fire,
the digging of canals. But his chief performance, for which his mem-
ory will endure forever in the agricultural history of our country, was
the reclaiming and replanting of the Landes. Nearly the whole of
the vast territory, covering nearly 1,975,000 acres, which lies between
the Bay of Biscay and the valleys of the Garonne and the Adour, had
been for centuries unfit for cultivation and proof against civilization.
In that immense desert, covered in winter with stagnant and noxious
water, none but a iew wandering shepherds, doomed victims of fever
and destitution, were ever seen.

A few cases, widely separated, were the only exceptions. Chambre-
lent engaged in a persevering investigation of the causes which had
allowed a few favored spots to overcome the natural barrenness of the
soil. He had no sooner begun active service in the corps of ponts and
chaussées (bridges and causeways) than he found the most simple and
cheapest solution of that great problem. But the remainder of his life
Was spent in securing its application. It was no easy task, and Cham-
brelent had to fight manifold obstacles. The incredulity of the inhabit-
ants whose faith had been blighted by the failure of preceding attempts,
the spirit of reluetance in more enlightened circles, the mistrust and
indolence which were opposed to his schemes by the executive author-
ities, all this seemed likely to subdue the most powerful will, the most
indomitable perseverance. But nothing could shake the robust faith
of this remarkable man, whose modest and affable manner concealed a
manly and energetic soul.

Forsaken by all, Chambrelent resolved te teach the lesson of example
and to furnish, at his own expense, an irrefutable demonstration. He
purchased an extensive portion of land in one of the most desolate spots
of the country. In a few years the application of his device, so simple
and so easy of execution, was crowned with signal success; that barren

THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 703

soil was gradually covered with woods and harvests. Theaspect of the
Landes will be transformed from the day when the methods of our
lamented colleague shall be applied to the whole of that region, and
the name of Landes will subsist only as a vestige of the past, but the
memory of Chambrelent shall live through the ages in the hearts of the
people, for whom he shall have proved one of their greatest benefactors,

No less severe for us was the loss of Edouard Fremy, who died at
the age of 80, at the Museum, in the glorious scientific establishment
the management of which had taken up a portion of his life and whose
increased attractions were so largely due to his efforts. His uncommon
faculty of investigation had placed him among the masters of chemis-
try, with every branch of which he became conversant. His numerous
discoveries, especially in regard to industrial applications of chemistry,
have bestowed upon him a lasting claim to the gratitude of the scien-
tific world. Countless is the number of distinguished pupils who were
formed under his teaching and of the investigators who frequented his
laboratory to advantage in the forty years during which he occupied a
foremost rank in French science.

Our colleague was denied the satisfaction of bringing to an end the
publication of the ‘“ Eneyclopedie Chimique,” a monumental work,
which he undertook in common with several of our members. ‘The
overwhelming fatigues of a long life wholly devoted to work had in
recent years weakened the springs of his activity and cast a sort of
shadow over his once bright mind. But his image still stands before
our eyes as that of a man of profound observation, a sharp and clear
intellect, and a high character, which won him universal regard.

A month later we followed to his last resting place an honorary
academician especially lamented by his colleagues, General Favé, a
highly distinguished officer, who, while he was nobly attending to his
duties as a soldier, gave constant and fruitful attention to the arts of
war. He wrote many papers on history and strategy, and achieved
reputation by his numerous inventions, highly valuable for the national
defense. No one could come in contact with General Favé without
being impressed with the high cultivation of his mind, which, with his
affable disposition and his exquisite courtesy, gave him a genuine fas-
cination.

A physician has also gone from our midst. We shall cherish the
memory of Brown-Sequard as one of the most original and interesting
characters of our age, a deep thinker and bold investigator. That illus-
strious physiologist had won fame by works of the highest order long
before his name became so universally known through the last and most
curious of his efforts. His capacity for production was extraordinary.
Always bent on the pursuit of new truths, he was obliged at times to
defer the final demonstration of his general views, which thus appeared
in the light of actual divination.

He was lavish of his energies, and even of his life, when it was a ques-
TO4 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.

tion of thoroughly testing a scientific proposition, and when blood was
required in his latest experiments Brown-Sequard took his own. His
professional courage, carried to the point of hardihood, was well known.
Down to his last day his body bore the indelible marks left by experi-
ments which he had voluntarily undergone.

In the intellectual arena Brown-Sequard was one of the most fearless
champions. The endless array of scientific facts he has brought to
light and his surprisingly bold views have been the cause of passionate
debates and the origin of ardent enthusiasms. The scientific movement
thus started by him is an extensive one, and his many pupils, some of
whom have in their turn become masters, will for a long time to come
find material for deep reflection in his works.

One of the most sudden losses sustained by the Academy of Sciences
during the year is beyond doubt the death of Ernest Mallard. Fis
engineering labors engrossed all his attention for many years, and he
could not, until late, enter the path of scientific research. It took but
a few years to place him above the ordinary level. His efforts have put
anew phase on crystallography and reduced to simple and general laws
a large number of facts for which no explanation had yet been found.
Mallard would have been justified in devoting his whole time to these
speculative studies which were so prolific of felicitous results. Con-
siderations of interest and humanity frequently interfered. Down to
his last day he followed up technical experiments on fire damp and
explosive matters, at the cost of unceasing labor and danger. He
thought he could not put his high mental faculties to better use than
by working for the better safety of the lowly miners.

The death of the celebrated German physicist, Helmholtz, which
occurred in the month of September, has brought to us especial grief.
The Academy of Sciences witnesses in his demise the disappearance
of one of its most genial associates, one of the most illustrious men of
the times. He first became known for his important physiological
investigations; but the prolific work accomplished by him in the
course of half a century embraces the whole domain of physical and
mathematical sciences, and has had far-reaching consequences. Helm-
holtz was a veritable originator; his researches in geometry, his dis-
coveries in optics, acoustics and physiology have secured invaluable
conquests for science; it would be hard to say on which of those sci-
ences his genius cast the most brilliant light.

Iiven among the most favored nations men gifted with so powerful
intellectual faculties appear but rarely in the course of several gen-
erations. It is by reason of their majestic isolation that they exert a
dominating influence upon the civilization of their country. Helnholtz
maintained the most intimate intercourse with French savants through-
out his life. The universal cultivation of his mind, the elevation of his
thoughts, the nobleness of his heart won for him here the most sincere
friends. ‘To our admiration for his genius was superadded the regard
bred by the qualities of his fine nature.

THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 705

The archeology of France has lost M. Waddington, who was in his
early days elected a member of the Academy of Inscriptions in recog-
nition of the long years he had devoted as a zealous numismatist, an
inquisitive and learned explorer, to those auxiliary sciences which have
completely renovated historical methods. The epigraphy of Asia Minor
is indebted to him for investigations that have opened and paved the
way for further advancement. Waddington was drawn away from his
favorite studies by the high public offices he was called upon to fill, at
first at home and then abroaa, in the service of the country. But it
would ill become science to grieve over his temporary exile, for his keen
and liberal mind knew how to turn to advantage his versatile attain-
ments in the important positions he filled. Alike moderate and firm,
he was enabled to carry through a series of useful reforms in public
instruction, and the influence which these reforms are calculated to
exert will be lasting and beneficent. Our colleague had returned to
the study of archeology when death robbed science and the academy of
the fruitful investigations which we were still justified in expecting.

The Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres has also had the
deep sorrow of losing two of its most renowned foreign associates, Sir
Henry Layard, a descendant of an ancient family of French emigrants,
died at Venice on the 20th of July. As a traveler, politician, ambassa-
dor, he gave, in the most varied pursuits, evidence of high intellectual
capacity, and left in many parts of the globe the marks of a tenacious
and productive activity. The memorable expedition to which science
is indebted for so many magnificent monuments of Assyrian antiquity
was successfully led by him through manifold dangers. After landing
on the left bank of the Tigris he hired a company of nomad Arabs,
and was happily moved to begin excavations in the neighborhood of «
village bearing the suggestive name of Nimroud. It was soon ascer-
tained that the site of ancient Calah had been discovered. A number
of low-reliefs, sepulchers, and inscriptions were thus again brought to
light, thanks to Layard’s bold initiative. The discoveries that were
made later at Kouyundjik, added to those of our fellow-countryman,
Botta, have thrown an unsuspected light on the history of that remote
antiquity, and have secured for their authors a well-deserved and
lasting fame.

The recent announcement of the death of Commandeur J.B. de Ross,
has brought us special sorrow. In him we lose not only a celebrated
savant, but also a sincere and devoted friend of our country. The
members of the French school at Rome never called in vain upon him
for information and support. He evidenced his good will toward them
by continuous services, and his reliable learning by precious indications
for their work. We had, in a manner, the first fruits of his talent, for
it was at Paris that his first papers were printed. He first became
known for remarkable epigraphic investigations, but his chief title to
fame lies in the discovery of that portion of the Catacombs of Rome

sm 94——45
706 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.

that is most extensive and richest in memories. It was there that
he found the materials for his monumental compilation of Christian
inscriptions, in which he resurrects an epoch and a society in which we
take the liveliest interest. On these publications so fraught with useful
information, important discoveries and valuable analysis, De Rossi
set the first scientific foundation of Christian archeology. But I must
desist, regretting my inability to follow in all its manifestations his
comprehensive genius, and his eminent mind adorned by the most noble
virtues.

The Academy of Fine Arts has also had its share of mourning. It
was bereft, toward the end of January, of one of its oldest members,
M. Cavelier. Upon his leaving the Villa Medicis, the young sculptor
first gained celebrity by a statue of Penelope, a charming work whieh
at once revealed a substantial talent and that soundness of taste which
has ever since characterized the long list of his works.

Our colleague held with immovable conviction throughout his life to
the noble conception he had formed of art and of its mission. While
an eclectic in the manner of execution, he endeavored always to repre-
sent nature under its most ideal form in a classic style. Cavelier has
left among his friends, his many pupils, and all those he had favored,
the memory of a distinguished artist, of a kind master, and of a devoted
colleague. His name, inscribed on many a sculptural composition by
which our publie buildings are adorned, is assured of going down to
posterity, and of being cited as one of those that have reflected honor
and brilliancy upon French art.

Federico Madrazo, the painter, whose recent death was a national
bereavement for Spain, was doubly ours, as a foreign associate and as
an artist trained in the school of the great masters who, in the first
half of the century, won giory for our country. France was the cradle
of his new-born talent; it was in our annual salons that he won the
awards by which fame was brought to his name. His historical pictures,
and chiefly his admirable portraits that embellish the finest galleries in
Europe, are the highest vindication of the honors which, at home as well
as abroad, crowned his long and glorious career.

The French Academy was no more spared than that of the Fine Arts.
The death of M. Maxime du Camp has taken from the world of letters
and of inquiry an indefatigable worker, a refined writer, a vigorous
and honest polemist. Maxime du Camp leaves behind him extensive
and manifold works. The marks of the romantic youth of a traveler
and soldier are found in his first productions. But even during that
period of juvenile enthusiasm his exuberant nature knew how to sub-
mit to the delays of patient study. Maxime du Camp thus betokened
the eminent qualities that were to make the latter part of his life as a
writer illustrious. His great production on Paris, a city which, like
Montaigne, he loved down to its warts and blemishes, shows most
adinirably his ability as an investigator and philosopher always equal

THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. TO7

to his subject. Posterity will undoubtedly apply to our colleague the
ancient saying of Cicero “that qualities of honor and probity must be
exhibited even in the style.”

Not only the Institute, but all France, mourns for Leconte de Lisle
this year. For she honors in him one of the most sterling poetic celeb-
rities of this century. His name will live as long as his three master-
pieces, “The Poemes Antiques,” the ‘“ Poemes Carbares,” and the
‘‘Poemes Tragiques.” He was engaged for thirty years in perfecting
that great and magnificent work, which, by its very nature, seems to be
destined for immortality.

He came to us from a distant island, a French possession lost in the
tropical seas, La Réunion. It was there that he first came into the
world, on the 22d of August, 1820. His parentage was from Brittany,
and it may be that it was this dual origin that enabled him to depict
with such fidelity the wrath of the Scandinavian seas and the splendor
of Indian climes. In France he lived in obscure and modest seclusion,
accessible only to the guard of honor made up of a few friends and
elected disciples. These certainly knew that the ilustrious recluse
was anything but insensibie and supercilious. A cursory perusal of
his poems may have given rise to such an impression, but the testi-
mony of those who came in contact with him and greater familiariza-
tion with his verses place him before us in the attitude not of a frigid
marble god, but simply that of an ancient sage absorbed in his work
and following it with patient ardor.

In 1886 the votes of the Academy sought him in his retirement.
Glory did not come to his name until a very late hour. He himself
never thought of complaint on that ground ; he well knew that the
character of his works was not such as to largely draw the admiration
of the multitude. He reviews India and its religions; Greece, the birth-
place of art; the restless and dark-souled barbarians in his works, and
in all of them he takes a tragic and picturesque view of history, and
looks upon nature as the eternal soother of all sorrows.

In history he gave preference to obscure and legendary periods.
They afforded him a wider field for the description of human passions
pitched to a degree of grandeur and energy which does not comport
with the periods of peaceful civilization. A decided foe of the morbid
sentimentality which partially pervades the literature of the first half
of this century, he raised the principle of impersonality in art to the
eminence of a dogma. His peetry is ina high degree stamped with the
characteristics of scientific thought. It partakes of it by the logical
development of the subject-matter, by the stanch erudition which leads
him through the traditions of all the races, and in his poems he again
brings the soul of ancient heroes into powerfully realistic life. In some
of those revivals he combines the clear-sightedness of Thucydides with
the fiery imagination of Lucretius.

No poet, perhaps, has been more of an artist than Leconte de Lisle.
TO8 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894.

He has written some of the most beautiful lines that ever impressed
themselves upon human memory. But however perfect and polished
may be, the form he never for its sake loses sight of the point; through
the moving splendor of images can always be perceived a firm intelli-
gence, a purity of sentiment, the absolute sincerity of which is attested
by the dignity of his life. On greeting him as one of our greatest poets
we forestall the judgment of posterity without fear of being belied by it.

All these colleagues, whose memory of recent date I have just recalled,
labored, each one according to his aptitude, toward adding to the intel-
lectual patrimony of their country. We could do them no better honor
than by calling to their seats in our midst those who most worthily
continued their labors. c

It is said of Socrates that he was in the habit of curiously question-
ing even the shoemakers and fullers of a town as small as Athens, who
thought that the intelligent world ended at the Pireus and the intel-
ligible world at the pillars of Hercules; and it may be that he thought
so himself; for however wise a man may be, he nevertheless belongs to
his age and to his country, and such a natal pride surely brings to-day
a smile to our lips.

Here, on the other hand, is another city, even much smaller than
Athens; I mean the Institute. It is in France, in the most sociable
country, the second home of foreigners; it receives in its midst the
representatives of all the noble qualities of the mind; in fine, does it
not, with its extensive ramifications in the provinces and abroad, con-
dense, as it were, the whole of the civilized world? It tells man of
nearly all he knows about himself and about the universe. Well, gen-
tlemen, if an ideal Socrates could by questioning you come in possession
of all your knowledge what would there remain for him to learn? Ina
word, would not the man who could unite within himself all the things
that you know and succeed in harmoniously blending them be the per-
fect man? Let us then strive, gentlemen, to draw nearer to such per-
fection, and to achieve such intimate blending through ever-increasing
cooperation, closer intercourse. Such is the wish I have repeatedly
heard uttered about me, and which in closing I take the liberty of
expressing to you.

HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ!

By ARTHUR W. RUCKER, F. R. S.

Death has been busy lately among the ranks of German physicists.
Hertz, Kundt, and Von Helmholtz have all been laid low within a few
months, and the world is the poorer by some of the best promise of the
future and the ripest experience of the past.

The last named on this sad death roll was for long regarded as the
doyen of the physical sciences in Germany. He celebrated his seven-
tieth birthday three years ago, and on that occasion the whole world
(to quote his own words) ‘*from Tomsk to Melbourne” united to do him
honor. The close of his career thus lacks the element of tragedy,
which shocked us when we heard that Hertz, in his early maturity,
before we had ceased to wonder at his first great success, wasedead.

But the elder, like the younger man, died too soon, working to the
last. He held one of the highest scientific posts in Germany. Long
mathematical papers have quite recently been contributed by him to
the Berlin Berichte. He was present at the meeting of the British
Association at Edinburgh in 1892, at the Chicago Congress of Electri-
cians in 1893. It was hoped that he would have attended the meeting
of the British Association at Oxford in 1894.

No remarkable events distinguished the earlier years of Helmholtz
from those of the majority of clever middle-class lads. His mother,
Caroline Penn, was of English descent; his father was a professor of
literature in the gymnasium at Potsdam, who, both in and out of school,
did all that he could to help his promising boy. On looking back to
his youth, Von Helmholtz accused himself of a “bad memory for dis-
connected things,” but admitted that he had an unusual power for
grasping and remembering the details of a connected train of thought.

When he began the systematic study of geometry he astonished his
teachers with the practical knowledge of the laws of form which he
had already attained, chiefly by the aid of wooden blocks. He acquired
“a great love of nature,” was especially attracted by physics, and con-
fessed that while the class was reading Cicero or Virgil, he was often
busy with illicit calculations under the desk.

But, though he describes his interest in the special line of study to
which he subsequently adhered as ‘‘amounting even to a passion,” it

is evident that the passion was controlled by a strong vein of common
-sense. Neither at that time, nor for many years afterwards, was a liv-
ing to be made out of physics. The only influential member of the
family was a military surgeon. It was therefore decided that the young
man should adopt the profession of his relative, and devote to his
favorite science such time as he might be able to spare from more
urgent duties.

It was not long before the characteristic bent of his mind displayed
itself. He was the pupil of Johannes Miiller, from whose laboratory
came many of the most distinguished German physiologists of the last
generation. The first two papers which Helmholtz published were on
fermentation and muscular action, respectively, but the first effort
which attracted general attraction was an essay on the Conservation
of Force, published in 1847, when he was 26 years of age.

It is unnecessary to repeat the oft-told tale of how the pioneers of the
great generalization, now called the conservation of energy, were for
atime ignored. German physicists turned away from Mayer. Eng-
land would not hear, or listened in unintelligent silence to Joule. But
the year 1847 was an epoch in the history of science. Joule himself,
for the first time, claimed the full extent of the territory he had con-
quered. “On the 28th of April, 1847,” says his biographer, “Joule
gave a popular lecture in Manchester, at St. Anne’s Church reading
room,” and chose this opportunity to deliver ‘the first full and clear
exposition of the universal conservation of that principle now called
energy.”

The local press would at first have nothing to do with the address.
“One paper refused to give even notice of it.” ‘The Manchester
Guardian would, as a favor, print extracts to be selected by them-
selves.” Finally the Manchester Courier, after long debate, promised
to insert the whole as a special favor, not to Joule, but to his brother.

Of course no blame can attach to the newspaper men for failing to
recognize the importance of views that were rejected by many of the
best known scientific authorities, but the theories which in April were
hawked from one provincial editor to another, found in June, when the
British Association met at Oxford, an advocate who compelled atten-
tion. Joule has told the story himself. Alt the circumstances were
depressing. An earlier paper, read some years before, had attracted
little notice. The chairman, perhaps on this account, suggested that
the author should be brief. No discussion was invited. In a moment
the meeting would have passed to other business, and the enunciation
of his views would once more have failed “if a young man had not
risen in the section and, by his intelligent observations, created a lively
interest in the new theory. The young man was William Thomson.”
The result was that the paper created a great sensation, and from that
moment the tide of opinion turned.

What Thomson did in June, in Oxford, Helmholtz did scarcely a
HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. ei el

month later in Berlin. His paper was read to the Physical Society of
that city on the 23d of July, 1847. It was too clear, too powerful, and
too convincing to be ignored. The line of thought which he had been
following has been traced by his own hand. ’ The study of medicine led
to the problem of the nature of ‘vital force.” He convinced himself
that if—as Stahl had suggested—an animal had the power now of
restraining, and now of liberating the activity of mechanical forces, it
would be endowed with the power of perpetual motion. ‘This led to the
question whether perpetual motion was consistent with what was known
of natural agencies. The essay on the Conservation of Force was,
according to Von Helmholtz himself, intended to be a critical investiga-
tion and arrangement of the facts which bear on this point for the
benefit of physiologists. In form, however, it was addressed to the

physicists.
The paper was called Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft, eine physika-
lische Abhandlung. It opens with the statement, ‘ Vorliegende

Abhandlung musste ihrem Hauptinhalte nach hauptsichlich fiir Phy-
siker bestimmt werden.” It was communicated to the Physical Society
of Berlin. The author appears to have expected that it would there
be received as a mere summary of accepted facts, and to have hoped
that, having gained this authoritative sanction, he could thereafter
appeal with greater force to his brother physiologists. To his surprise
the physicists were not only interested, but showed a strong disposition
to treat the essay as a fantastic speculation. The editor of Poggendorff’s
Annalen declined to publish it. On the other hand, Helmholtz was
supported by his fellow-student, Du Bois Reymond, and by mathema:
tician Karl Jacobi. In the end they carried the Physical Society with
them.

The essay itself is full of interest. The phraseology differs from that
we employ, but the use of terms now regarded as archaic is not due to
any mistiness of perception. Write energy here and there for “ force,”
potential energy for “tension,” as defined in the essay, assume our
fuller knowledge of the results of experiment, and the whole might
have been written yesterday, instead of nearly fifty years ago.

The author began by an argument which practically amounts to the
statement that science is limited to the search for a mechanical expla-
nation of nature, and that, whatever the final result of the quest may
be, it must be pushed as far as possible.

Assuming that the basis of a mechanical theory must ultimately be
the action of forces between material points, and, implicitly assuming
the Newtonian laws of motion, the conclusion is reached that the law
of the conservation of energy holds good, and holds good only if the
forces are central; that is, if they are attractions or repulsions, the
magnitudes of which depend solely on the distances between the mutu-
ally reacting particles.

The cogency of this as an a priori proof of the conservation of energy
«22 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ.

of course depends upon whether the premises are admitted to be axi-
omatic; but it was followed by an appeal to experiment. The greater
part of the memoir was occupied with an elaborate discussion as to
whether the law of the conservation of energy was consistent with the
facts then known. This involved a survey of the application of the law
to mechanics, heat, electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetics. <A
number of most interesting calculations and suggestions were made,
and the conclusion arrived at was “that the law of the conservation of
energy does not contradict any known fact in natural science, but in a
great number of cases is, on the contrary, corroborated in a striking
manner.”

The author was acquainted with the earlier experiments of Joule
only, and, while employing the idea of a mechanical equivalent of heat
and using symbols to represent it, dismisses the results of observation
as having but ‘little claim to accuracy.” It need hardly be said that
this opinion was not afterwards extended to the later investigations,
which were only just then becoming known.

In a note appended, when the essay was republished in 1881, Von
Helmholtz expressly disclaimed any right to priority as an originator
of the doctrine of conservation of energy, but his essay is the more
remarkable on account of his slight acquaintance with the work of his
predecessors. He knew nothing of Mayer, and his information as to
Joule’s experiments was only gained after his own work was far
advanced.

Enough has, perhaps, been said to show that he must, as Professor
Tait asserts, ‘be classed as one of the most successful of the early pro-
moters of the science of energy on legitimate principles.”

The paper on the Conservation of Energy was only the third or
fourth which Helmholtz had published, but his remarkable abilities
were now fully recognized.

His connection with the army was severed in 1848. For some months
he was an assistant in the Anatomical Museum of Berlin, and also
teacher of anatomy at the Academy of Arts. After this he held in
succession the professorships of physiology in the universities of
Konigsberg, Bonn, and Heidelberg, and in 1871 he was appointed pro-
fessor of natural philosophy in the University of Berlin.

Honors of all sorts were showered upon him. Late in life he was
ennobled by the German Emperor, and the esteem in which he was held
in this country was proved by the award of the Copley medal, the high-
est distinction in the gift of the Royal Society.

It would be impossible to follow in chronological order the work
which Von Helmholtz gave to the world during these long years. The
most that can be attempted is to convey some idea of its importance.
He was great as a mathematician and physicist, but the direction of
his most characteristic efforts was probably determined by the early
necessity for seeking a livlihood by the practice of medicine. On the

HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. its

borderland of physics, physiology, and psychology he won a place that
is all hisown This thorny region has been invaded by others from
both sides, but it is not too much to say that Von Helmholtz, in his
triple mastery over anatomy, mathematics, and physics, had unique
qualifications for the task.

To the oculist he gave the ophthalmoscope, and thus made it possi-
ble to investigate the conditions of the inmost recesses of the living
eye. If the eye be illuminated a portion of the light returns from the
hinder surface, is brought to a focus by the lenses of the eye itself, and
forms an image of the retina in external space. To see this was no
easy matter. If the patient’s eye were focused on a luminous object
the image would coincide with the source of light, and, even if other-
wise visible, would be lost in the glare. If he looked elsewhere the
image would move, but, inasmuch as the lenses can not be adjusted to
the clear vision of any object nearer than about 10 inches, that is the
minimum distance from the eye at which it can form the image of its
own retina. To see this clearly an observer without appliances must
place himself at least 10 inches from the image, that is, at 20 inches
from the patient. At that distance the view would be so limited that
no result could be obtaimed.

Von Helmholtz, however, convinced himself that, if these difficulties
could be overcome, the image of a brightly illuminated retina could be
seen. He made the observations through a small hole in the center of
a mirror, which reflected light into the eye under examination. Then,
by means of a lens, he shifted the position of the image backward
until the relative positions of the observer and the patient were such
that, according to calculation, the retina should be visible.

Again and again he tried and failed, but he was convinced of the
validity of the theory, and at last the experiment succeeded. From
that time the occulist has been able to look into the darkness of the
pupil, and to see through the gloom the point of entry of the optic
nerve and the delicate network of blood vessels by which it is sur-
rounded.

The great monograph on the Sensations of Tone appeared in 1863.
The theories advanced were novel, but, though some points are still
open to dispute, they have as a whole been generally accepted. The
aim of the work was ambitious, being nothing less than the discovery
of the physical basis of the sensations which affect us when listening
to consonant and dissonant musical intervals, respectively. The gen-
eral nature of the solution arrived at 1s now well known. If two notes,
which differ but little from unison, are produced together, throbbing
alternations in the intensity of the sound are heard as beats. If the
interval is gradually increased the beats become quicker, till at last
they can no longer be distinguished separately. According to Von
Helmholtz, however, they produce the effect of dissonance. ‘The
nerves of hearing,” he says, ‘‘feel these rapid beats as rough and
714 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ.

unpleasant, because every intermittent excitement of any nervous
apparatus affects it more powerfully than one that lasts unaltered.
Consonance is a continuous, dissonance an intermittent sensation of
tone.” The disagreeable effect depends in part upon the number of
beats, in part upon the interval between the notes which produce them,
being greatest when the rapidity of the beats is neither very large nor
very small, and when the interval between the two notes is not great.
In applying this theory it is necessary to take into account not only
the beats between the two fundamental notes, but also those due to two
series of secondary sounds by which they may be accompanied. The
presence or absence of one of these—the so-called upper harmonic par-
tials—depends upon the way in which the note has been obtained.
They produce the differences of quality which distinguish one musical
instrument from another. They are also the basis of our appreciation
of the closeness of the relationship between the notes they accompany.
The want of perfect consonance between compound notes is attributed
to beats between those members of the two groups of sound which are
not very far apart on the scale. The growing importance of these
beats, as the intervals become less and less consonant, was traced with
wonderful ingenuity.

This theory alone would be insufficient to account for a perception
of want of consonance between two pure notes unaccompanied by
partials. To explain this recourse was had to a second series of
attendant sounds, the most important of which had been discovered
in 1745 by Sorge, a German organist, and was well known as
Tartini’s tone. Von Helmholtz proved that such notes would arise
when the vibrating body was set in somewhat violent motion, provided
that the resistances offered to equal displacements in opposite directions
were unequal. Of course the air, which transmits the sounds to the
ear, does not possess this property. On the other hand, the drum skin
of the ear, to which the aerial vibrations are communicated, is not sym-
metrical, being bent inward by the little “ hammer” bone. Von
Helmholtz, therefore, concluded that it is probable that Tartini’s tone
is due to this membrane. From his point of view it is subjective, in
the sense that it is produced within the organism, though it originates
in the auditory apparatus, and not in the brain. It is, if one may use
the phrase, the rattling of the machinery of the ear.

Having thus accounted for the production sof secondary sounds by
tones, which were themselves unaccompanied by partials, Von Helm-
holtz explained our sense of the dissonance of imperfect intervals, when
produced by such pure notes, by beats due to the combinational tones. |

But, though he maintained that these theories explained the physical
‘reason of the melodic relationship of two tones,” the author of the
“'Tonempfindungen ” was careful to point out that the principles he
enunciated had not always determined the construction of the scale,
and do not determine it everywhere now. The selection of a series of

HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 715

notes which were a posteriori found to obey certain natural laws was
voluntary. The scale itself is not natural, in the sense that it is not
a necessary consequence of the construction of the ear. On the con-
trary, it is the product of artistic invention. Music is thus not a mere
branch of mechanics, but an art. The architect and the composer alike
deal with materials which are subject to mechanical laws, but they are
alike free to fashion from these forms determined not by calculation,
but by the sense of beauty.

Von Helmholtz was at work on optics while still engaged in the study
of sound. The Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik appeared in sec-
tions in 1856, 1860, and 1866. It is, as he himself has said, a complete
survey of the whole field of that science. In the first place he treated
the eye as an optical instrument, traced the path of the rays through
it, and discussed the mechanism by which it can be accommodated to
distinct vision at different distances. To investigate the last point
it was necessary to measure the images formed by reflection from the
surfaces of the crystalline lens. For this purpose he invented a special
instrument—the opthalmometer—by which such measurements can be
made on the living patient with great accuracy.

In an interesting course of popular lectures, published in 1868, and
since translated by Dr. Atkinson, Von Helmholtz insisted that far from
being, as was often supposed, a perfect organ, the eye has many optical
defects; and that our unconsciousness of these is due not so much to
its perfection from the instrument-maker’s point of view, as to the ease
with which it adapts itself to different circumstances, and to the skill
with which long practice enables us to interpret the messages it conveys
to the brain.

The second section of the work was devoted to the sensation of sight.
The theories of color and of intensity, the duration of the sensation of
light, the phenomena of contrast and subjective appearances were all
discussed with a fullness never before attained. The last part was
devoted to such problems as our visual appreciation of three dimensions
in space and binocular vision.

The theory of color, originally due to Young, was adopted and
enlarged by Helmholtz. It assumes that all the sensations of color are
compounded out of three fundamental sensations, which are respec-
tively ared, green, and violet or blue. Nearly if not all the phenomena
of color-blindness can be explained on the hypothesis that, in the case
of persons so affected, the power of appreciating one or other of these
sensations is wanting.

It was hardly to be expected that differences of opinion would not
arise as to some of the points discussed in two works so wide in their
scope and so novel in their methods as the treatises on the sensations
of tone and on physiological optics. Koenig, the celebrated instrument
maker, has demonstrated the existence of beats which in the case of
compound sounds could be explained as due to the upper partials, but
716 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ.

as they are produced when the notes are as pure as it is possible to make
them, they do not appear to be accounted for by the original theory.
A writer (Voigt. Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1890, 40, p. 660) who has recently
examined the matter, concludes that both the combination tones of Von
Helnholtz and the beat tones of Koenig can theoretically be produced
without the unsymmetrical arrangement which the former regarded as
essential, and that the one system or the other will tend to predominate
according to circumstances. The more nearly the energies of the two
vibrations approach equality the greater is the probability that the
combination tones will be heard. The less nearly the condition of equal
energy is fulfilled, the more important will the beat notes become.

Several other points of considerable interest have been raised, but
those who on one ground or another have objected to the views of Von
Helmholtz, have not been entirely in accord among themselves. It is
probable that the theory will finally be accepted in its broad outlines,
but will require modifications of some importance in its details.

The theory of color, too, with which the name of Von Helmholtz is
associated, is not without its difficulties. A new edition of his Opties
is appearing in parts, and in this alterations have been made which
prove that the author regarded the original hypothesis as capable
of modification and improvement. A strong committee of the Royal
Society, which has recently reported on color vision, adopted the
terminology of the Young-Helmholtz theory, but pointed out that it
fails to explain some curious cases of diseased vision, in which the sen-
sation of color is confined to the blue end of the spectrum, while all
the other tints appear as white. On the other hand, the rival theory
of Hering also fails to account for some of the known facts. Thus the
problem is not finally solved, but the importance of the contribution to
its solution made in the Physiologischen Optik is not disputed even by
those who feel that there is need for further inquiry in the future.

In these investigations on the eye and the ear, on light and sound, we
see Von Helmholtz at his most characteristic work; but the shortest
sketch of his scientific achievements would be incomplete without
reference to his eminence as a mathematician.

He was, aS might have been expected, deeply interested in the
electro-magnetic theory of light, and developed it in a form which is
even more general than that adopted by Clerk Maxwell; but it seems
probable that, while Von Helmholtz has indicated possibilities, Max-
well has taken account of all that is necessary to explain the facts.

Another inquiry of the first importance, and condueted with the
greatest ability, was that on the laws of vortex motion. The move-
ments of a liquid may be so complicated that it is at first sight an
almost hopeless task to analyze the motion into its simplest elements.
Changes of shape of the most exaggerated character may occur. A
compact mass ay be drawn out into Jong threads. Particles at one
time far apart may be brought close together and again separated.

HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. TAC

Tf, however, instead of contemplating the final results we consider
what is actually going on at a given instant at a given place it is
possible to describe the facts in simple terms. A minute sphere of
the liquid may be moving as a whole in some definite direction, may
be changing its shape, and may be rotating about an axis. This last
is the distinguishing characteristic of vortex motion. Von Helmholtz
was the first to detect some of the most remarkable properties of those
portions of a fluid in which it occurs. The investigation was confined
to a frictionless, incompressible liquid, and the author proved that in
such an ideal substance the property of vortex motion could neither be
produced nor destroyed by any natural forces. If it existed in a group
of particles, they would be incapable of transmitting it to others.
They could not be deprived of it themselves. The laws of their motion
would establish between them a curious and indissoluble fellowship.
A number of beads, strung on a ring of thread or wire and rotat-
ing about it, afford, with regard to a similarly shaped system of par-
ticles possessing vortex motion, an analogy so imperfect that it is
almost dangerous to use it. But the two have, at all events, one prop-
erty in common. The wire may be moved from place to place or bent
into various forms, but wherever it goes, however it is distorted, it
carries the beads with it. The connection thus artificially secured
would be automatically maintamed in a ring of fluid particles endowed
with vortex motion. ‘Lhe ring might enlarge or contract, be deflected
or distorted, but amid all such vicissitudes the rotating particles
would move among their fellows apparently free, but in reality insep-
arably united. ’

This and other peculiarities, upon which it is unnecessary to dwell,
give to vortex motion a special interest and importance. Lord Kelvin
has made the profound and remarkable suggestion that the atoms of
matter may be vortex rings in a frictionless liquid. Whatever the
ultimate fate of this theory may be, it is justified as affording a glimpse
into new possibilities. It is, at all events, not absurd to dream that
we may some day regard matter as a special form of some more funda-
mental substance, from the comparatively simple properties of which
the laws of chemistry and physics may be deduced. Apart, however,
from the use which has been made of vortexes in this and in other
ways, as affording a basis for the explanation of physical facts, Von
Helmholtz must rank as the discoverer of a series of fundamental
propositions in hydrodynamics which had entirely escaped the notice
of his predecessors.

During the last years of his life Von Helmholtz was president of the
“ Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt” at Charlottenberg. In 1884
the late Werner Siemens offered £25,000 toward the foundation of a
State research laboratory. The Reichstag voted the necessary addi-
tions to thissum. The institution has been established on a large scale,
and the first volume of records was published in March of the present
718 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ.

year. The preface was signed by Von Helmholtz, and thus the career
of the great investigator was fittingly closed by the inauguration of a
national college devoted to learning and research.

In a brief and imperfect sketch such as this it is barely possible to
give an idea of the extent of the work of Von Helmholtz; it is certainly
impossible to do justice to its fulness and depth. I have mapped the
directions of the main streams of his thought. Only those who follow
them in detail can count the fields they have fertilized. In the course
of his investigations all sorts of side issues were studied, a vast number
of subsidiary problems solved. The alertness of his intellect, the read-
iness with which he turned from one science to another, the extraor-
dinary ease with which he handled weapons the most diverse and the
most difficult to master, these are not less wonderful than the catalogue
of his main achievements.

The technical merits of his work will, of course, be appreciated
chiefly by experts. Special knowledge is not necessary to understand
its importance. He was one of the first to grasp the principle of the
conservation of energy. He struck, independently and at a critical
moment, a powerful blow in its defense. He penetrated further than
any before him into the mystery of the mechanism which connects us
with external nature through the eye and the ear. He discovered the
fundamental properties of vortex motion in a perfect quid, which have
since not only been applied in the explanation of all sorts of physical
phenomena, of ripple marks in the sand and of cirrus clouds in the air,
but have been the bases of some of the most advanced and pregnant
speculations as to the constitution of matter and of the luminiferous
ether itself.

These scientific achievements are not, perhaps, of the type which
most easily commands general attention. They have not been utilized
in theological warfare; they have not revolutionized the daily business
of the world. It will, however, be universally admitted that such tests
do not supply a real measure of the greatness of a student of nature.
That must finally be appraised by his power of detecting beneath the
complication of things as they seem something of the order which
rules things as they are. Judged by this standard, few names will
take a higher place than that of Hermann von Helmholtz.

Wherever the investigating minds of scientists are at work promot-
ing the insight of man into the mysteries of nature, wherever friends
of natural philosophy are keenly alive to the importance of this com-
paratively new field of study, a field in which lie some of the most
essential interests of modern civilization, there will be sincere and
deep regret over the death of a young professor whose splendid
career came to an untimely end on the first day of this year. Prof.
Heinrich Hertz, of the University of Bonn, in Germany, died on Jan-
uary 1, 1894, not yet 37 years of age. For the last two years he had
not been in good health, and, though under the treatment of his capa-
ble physicians he several times rallied and seemed to be restored to his
former strength, the last winter brought a serious relapse. A chronic
and painful disease of the nose spread to the neighboring Highmore’s
cavity, and gradually led to blood poisoning. He was conscious and in
possession of his full mental power to the last; he must have been
aware that recovery was hopeless, but not a word escaped his lips that
would have shown to his dear ones whether hope or fear filled his heart.
His wife and his mother were at his bedside for many weeks, giving
him their tenderest care, and in spite of his continuous sufferings
there were many hours of genial discourse. At such times they read
to him, and he gave himself up to general topics and to matters of per-
sonal interest to them, displaying even yet his wonted brightness and
cheerfulness.

Heinrich Hertz, born in Hamburg on February 22, 1857, was the eldest
son of exceptionally good and clever parents. His father was at the be-
ginning of his career a lawyer; in due course of time he rose to the posi-
tion of judge of the supreme court of appeal, and has now for a number
of years been a senator of the free city of Hamburg. The childhood of
Professor Hertz was subject to every pure, Hearenfil) and elevating
influence that a highly capable father and a superior mother can exer-
cise. Both of them gave a great part of their time to their children;
their eldest boy especially enjoyed the advantage of their companion-
ship in many a holiday’s ramble phous the green fields and woods: and

in cozy winter nights spent in reading Homer, the German classies, and
other books.

In passing through the high-school classes of his native city his
predilection for the study of natural science early asserted itself.
Whenever a new course of study began and a new text-book was put
into the hands of the class, the boy would devote every leisure moment
to the perusal of the volume, experimenting frequently with apparatus
made by himself, and never ceasing until he could tell his father, “I
have mastered that book.” ‘This statement always proved to be per-
fectly correct. In spite of his decided gift for natural science, Hertz
chose as his vocation civil engineering. But when, after completing his
studies, he came to take the first steps toward the practical execution
of this design, he felt that his choice had been a mistake. His parents,
with a ready perception of the deeply rooted needs of his strong and
peculiar nature, whose desires they would not think of thwarting,
entered into his new idea, gave him their approval, and furnished him
with the necessary means. So he set out on anew course of studies in
mathematics and natural science. He gave himself up to this work
heart and soul, and for a number of years knew no other object in life
but unceasing and unrelenting hard work. He studied physies at
Munich and Berlin, and enjoyed the warm regard of Professor Helm-
holtz. In 1880 he became his assistant, and at his instigation, in 1883
settled down as a ‘ privatdocent,” or professor without salary, at the
University of Kiel. It was from this time on that he made the science
of electricity the one great object of his researches, the main pursuit of
his life. The first years were filled with investigations relating to
electric discharges, etc. He busied himself, above all, with the new
conceptions of the inner mechanism of electric phenomena and of the
connection between these and the phenomena of light and of radiant
heat. These conceptions, originating with Faraday and Maxwell in
England and represented in Germany by Helmholtz, were now carried
forward by Professor Hertz.

His reputation soon spread through his native country, and he was
in 1885 called to the Polytechnic School of Karlsruhe, which for vari-
ous reasons became very dear to him. One of its attractions was the
exceptionally fine and well endowed laboratory of the institution,
which furnished the most desirable facilities for unlimited experiment-
ing. At Karlsruhe Professor Hertz found a wife who was in every way
a lovely and graceful, devoted, and highly intellectual companion to him.
His life was from this time on divided between the pursuit of his main
object, the progress of science, and home happiness; both he and his
wife derived rare gratification from literature and the beauty of nature.
It was from Karlsruhe that he went to Heidelberg, there to enjoy the
proudest moment of bis life, in the year 1889, when, greeted with enthu-
Siastic applause by most prominent scientists, he stood upon the plat-
form to tender an account of his researches and their results. Who

that saw him there, the very picture of youthful vigor and life, could
have forboded that those fine and penetrating eyes, to which for the
first time since our earth turned around its poles electric waves had
been revealed, were so soon to be closed in death!

Soon Professor Hertz received flattering calls to the most prominent
universities. He preferred the smaller town of Bonn, where he settled
down in 1890, even to Berlin, the capital, because what he sought after
was the most serious and fruitful work, not glory and outward advan-
tage. In Bonn he succeeded to the eminent physicist, Professor Clau-
sius. This was in itself a high distinction conferred upon so young
aman as Professor Hertz. Considered all over Europe as one of the
most prominent, he was looked up to as one of the most promising
leaders in the science of electricity. Not only had his own country con-
ferred high honors upon this young and ardent worker, but the chief
academies of England, France, Italy, Austria, and Russia now crowned
his efforts with prizes, honorary memberships, and other tokens of uni-
versal esteem and gratitude.

Up to the middle of this century the phenomena of electricity and
magnetism had been only inadequately explained by applying to them
Newton’s law of gravitation, and asserting that in the same way as
celestial bodies exercise power of attraction at a distance and without
the intervention of a medium the two kinds of material electricity were
attracting and repelling each other while passing through space or
through nonconductors.

It was the great English physicist Faraday who first sought to carry
the knowledge of electricity to a higher stage by entering upon the
study of phenomena with a mind free from preconceived opinions. He
put forth as the foundation on which to base new theories his observa-
tions of electric and magnetic forces, their influence upon each other,
their attractions for material bodies, and their propagation by the
transmission of the excitation from one point of space to another. He
questioned the assumption of space being void, and conjectured that
the ether which transmits the luminous waves suffers modifications
perceived under the form of electrical and magnetic manifestations.
His discoveries, important as they were, gained due consideration only
when Faraday’s great countryman, Maxwell, treated the same sub-
ject in a purely scientific and theoretical way, publishing in 1865 his
Mathematical Theory of Light. The nature and properties of ether he
left undecided, and they form to this day dominant questions, destined,
it seems, ultimately to reveal the deepest secrets of natural science.
Maxwell labored to confirm the connection, surmised by Faraday,
between light, electricity, and magnetism; the idea of velocity now
entered the theory and became of supreme importance. Maxwell
arrived at the conclusion that the velocity of electrometion in a given
medium must be identical with the velocity of light in the same
medium, and that therefore ether, being contained in all ponderable

sm 94—-46
122 SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ.

bodies, would have to be looked upon as the conductor of electric
motion and power. Consequently the periodical motions of ether, which
our eye conceives as light, and which he figured as transversal waves,
were considered by Maxwell to be at the same time undulations of
electricity. These conceptions, unproved by experiment as Maxwell
left them, had merely the value of a scientific hypothesis emanating
from aman of rare genius. To have proved them facts, and thereby
to have united two vast and highly important domains of natural phi-
losophy, is the lasting credit of Professor Hertz.

The complexity of phenomena of light and electricity and the insuffi-
cient opportunities afforded by the laboratory for deductions of such
magnitude rendered the obstacles barring the road to exact observation
well-nigh insurmountable. Many of the best and ablest naturalists
were laboring to cope with these difficulties. Two English scientists of
highest standing, Prof.G. F. Fitzgerald and Dr.O. T. Lodge, were during
the eighties occupied with experiments for the investigation and meas-
urement of electric waves. But it was reserved for Hertz to discover
and apply with marvelous ingenuity the necessary ‘detector,’ a reso-
nating circuit with an air gap, the resistance of which is broken down
by well-timed impulses, so that visible sparks are produced. After an
unceasing course of experiments, in which he manifested indefatigable
energy and a wonderful faculty of reaching the very essence of the
matter, he succeeded in deciding the questions: Is the propagation of
electrical and magnetic forces instantaneous? and further, Can elec-
trical or magnetic effects be obtained directly from light? The paper
‘““On very rapid electric oscillations,” which was published in 1887, was
the first of a splendid series of researches which appeared in Wiede-
mann’s Annalen between the years 1887 and 1890, and in which Hertz
showed with ample experimental proof and illustration that electro-
magnetic actions are propagated with finite velocity through space.
These twelve epoch-making papers were afterwards republished—with
an introductory chapter of singular interest and value, and a reprint of
some observations on electric discharges made by Von Bezold in 1870—
under the title Untersuchungen iiber die Ausbreitung der elektrischen
Kraft. A translation of this book, entitled Electric Waves, by D. E.
Jones, B. Se., with illustrations and a preface by Lord Kelvin, has just
been published in England.

In 1889, when laying before the Congress of German Naturalists at
Heidelberg the results of his labors, Professor Hertz, with the modesty
characteristic of the true investigator, the utterly unassuming disciple
of science, gave ready and graceful acknowledgment to the efforts made
by his predecessors or cooperators in the work, some of whom had all
but attained the results which they aimed at and which he achieved.
It is pleasant to recollect that when he had gained the end toward
which they also had been striving, the English professors, Oliver Lodge
and Fitzgerald, were foremost in announcing his success, and in prepar-

SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. faa

ing the English-speaking world to appreciate the importance of his dis-
coveries. A natural bent of mind toward the questions at issue had
awakened the young professor’s creative powers; his complete concen-
tration upon the vital point and his intuitive perceptions led him to
definite results and complete success where so many able minds had
searched in vain. In the April number of this magazine Herbert
Spencer, speaking of the late Professor Tyndall, gives a number of
traits that apply with singular force and exactness to Professor Hertz.
Of these the first is “the scientific use of the imagination.” It may
well be said that with this constructive imagination, as Mr. Spencer
terms it, originated Professor Hertz’s rare success as a discoverer and
as an instructor.

To find out the most effective arrangement of electrical conductors
and to secure the conditions which would produce the strongest vibra-
tions at regular intervals and in quickest succession, we might say the
adjustment of his instruments was the first part of his work. Having
brought about electric undulations up to several hundred millions in
one second, Hertz proved through experiment that the waves of elec-
tricity are transversal like those of light, and that the transmission
requires a certain lapse of time. He ascertained exactly the velocity
of electricity; it is found by multiplving the length of wave, which he
measured, by the duration of the vibration, which can be calculated,
and he found this velocity to be, as Maxwell had supposed, equal to
that of light, and, moreover, equal to the velocity of electric waves in
metallic wires. The grand consequence of this last discovery was the
cognizance of a new fact, that what had hitherto been considered as a
current of electricity in a wire is really a movement along the surface
of the wire. Maxwell’s magnetic theory of light found further cor-
roboration by the experimental demonstration of electric power as
propagating from its center in waves similar to sound. The electric
undulations are subject to the same process of reflection, refraction,
absorption, ete., as the rays and waves of light, from which they are
in the end distinguished only by their considerably greater length,
measured sometimes by kilometers. The crowning experiments of this
course finally changed what had hitherto been looked upon as a coin-
cidence between two orders of distinct phenomena into a demonstration
of identity. By gathering the electric spark in the focus of a large
concave mirror, whence it came forth in the form of a rectilinear beam,
the properties of the-electric ray were shown to be identical with those
of a luminous ray, the former producing phenomena which have here-
tofore been observed only in light—those of polarization. This result
renders all theorizing on the matter superfluous; the identity of the
two powers springs from the experiment itself; ocular proof is produced
for the proposition that light is in its very essence an electrical phe-
nomenon, whether it be the light of the sun, of a candle, or of a glow-
worm, Suppress electricity in the universe, light would disappear,
724 SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ.

Suppress the luminiferous ether, electric and magnetic forces would
cease to act through space. Even a body not casting light can be a
center of electrical action if it radiates heat. Klectricity therefore pos-
sesses all nature and even man. The eye itself is, in fact, an electrical
organ.

The influence of this new system of physics upon the development of
natural science and the manifold applications in practical life of which
it is capable can not easily be overrated. Only recently a new applica-
tion of Hertz’s discovery was made by an American, who is trying to
develop photographs by the agency of the Hertzian waves, as science
has named them—that is, by electricity instead of light. Hertzian
waves, Hertzian investigations, apparatus, and methods form hence-
forth an essential part of all hand and text books of electricity. The
facts established by Hertz’s experiments have been molded into a math-
ematical formula by their author, who in this purely theoretical work
also has shown himself to be a master of high genius in the realm of
abstract science. There is at present in press and will soon be issued
by T. A. Barth, at Leipsic, a comprehensive work, entitled Principles of
Mechanies in a New Connection, found among his unpublished papers
at the death of Professor Hertz. Its appearance is eagerly watched
for by the scientific world.

However highly his own time and posterity may prize the man of
science, the great discoverer, in Professor Hertz, his value as: such to
the world at large does not surpass that of the rare purify and great-
ness of his character, of the intrinsic merit which he possessed for
those who knew him personally. A world-wide reputation so rapidly
attained might have produced in the young man some feeling of
elation and pride and in his colleagues somewhat of envy. But, as
Prof. Hubert Ludwig, representing the University of Bonn, at Professor
Hertz’s funeral in Hamburg, said in his memorial speech:

“The rich harvest of fame and glory which was granted him, and
that was so fully merited as not to be tainted by a single breath of envy
or jealousy, never caused him to give up one atom of the noble sim-
plicity and genuine modesty which were a fundamental trait of his
character. His modesty was a most lovable quality in this great man,
asserting itself not only in everyday life, but also in his scientific
labors, which it pervades with the endearing charm of an amiable per-
sonality. It was coupled with the most considerate indulgence when
judging others. His ever-ready recognition of other people’s merits
made it a sheer impossibility to grudge him his attainments or to be
his enemy.

‘None knew him but to love him,
‘None named him but to praise.’
At the same time he was governed by an inflexible veracity.”

He was indeed a most lovable man, and was never happier than in
giving pleasure to others. His kindness and benevolence found expres-
sion in many ways, most of all toward those above whom he was placed
as head of his department in the university. It was a pleasure to notice
SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. t25

his satisfaction, when he found it in accordance with his duty, to confer
a benefit or favor. And when it was incumbent upon him to refuse or
displease, he became the director who performed his duty and the
friend whe regretted what had to be done, He was always ready to
show hospitality to scientific men who came to Bonn from other parts
ef Germany or from foreign countries. Even under the restraint of a
foreign tongue (he spoke English and French with considerable fluency)
his conversation was charming. Not what he had achieved gave him
his ascendency in scientific discourse, but what he, beyond a thousand
learned men, could achieve at any time—original and sagacious thoughts,
springing up on the spur of the moment, and losing none of their force
by being expressed in the most unpretending, simple form. When
entertaining friends or conversing with his dear ones he perfectly for-
got the learned professor in himself; he was so much at his ease, so full
of fun, that none around him could help sharing his gayety. Many of
his guests, prominent men of science as well as students, will always
remember with pleasure and gratitude delightful trips made with Pro-
fessor Hertz to the Siebengebirge or evenings of genial intercourse at
his house in the Quantiusstrasse at Bonn. Absolutely devoid of any
desire to pose before the public, the professor sometimes astonished
students newly entered for his lectures by putting in a bit of humor
where they had expected abstract instruction; but they soon found them-
selves none the worse for it. Some simple word, a casual remark made
as if it were a self-understood thing, from his lips did more toward
Improving the mind of his audience than a long leeture from another.
He was not a scientist inculeating one special branch of knowledge;
he was athinker. To be considered an authority, even by the youngest
beginner, was an idea that never entered his mind. In the congenial
atmosphere of advanced classes new ideas and conceptions seemed to
rise in him and flow from his lips as though there could be no easier
thing in the world. He was at his very best when propounding a
problem to this small circle, showing how he would attack it. None,
however capable, but could profit by his teaching; genius itself seemed
to prompt it.
' With penetrating perspicacity he took hold of his problems. Asa
veritable disciple of natural science he strove to accomplish his ideal
ends, although by means of theory, which he completely mastered, yet
not merely by theory and not for her sake only; what he aimed at first
and last was the most accurate establishment of facts. Pervaded as
his strong personality was by an absorbing love of his science, the rare
harmony of his nature kept him equally from an exaggerated enthusiasm
and from prosaic dullness. An uncommonly great number of valuable
researches made at the Physical Institute at Bonn during the short
time of his leadership prove his rare capacity and untiring eagerness
to incite young talents to the best possible application of their faculties
and so pave the way for their success in research. but in a wider
726 SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ.

sense of the word we may call his disciples all those physicists who
are at this moment and will be for a long time occupied in exploring
the provinces which he was the first to open. In this sense almost
one-quarter of all living physicists call themselves Professor Hertz’s
followers.

The honors paid at his funeral to the memory of this young and
ardent worker were exceptionally great. He was buried in his native
city, Hamburg, where the most widespread sympathy for his family and
the deepest regret over his loss were shown. From Bonn, Karlsruhe,
and Berlin came friends, colleagues, and students, some of them officially
representing their colleges. Universities and prominent men from all
parts of our globe have sent messages of esteem and sympathy to the
wife, the parents, and the University of Bonn. It may be questioned
whether such utterances of sympathy and respect, much as they tend
to make mankind feel itself as one, can offer consolation to those whose
bereavement is greater than words are able to convey. However, what
Mr. Lowell said in one of his simple and admirable memorial addresses
is certainly true:

“Tt may seem paradox, but the only alleviation of such grief is a
sense of the greatness and costliness of the sacrifice that gave birth to
it, and this sense is brought home to us by the measure in which others
appreciate our loss.”

Prof. Hubert Ludwig, of Bonn, uttered the last farewell at the grave
of his friend and colleague. He expressed the sentiment of those
grieving at his bier in these final words:

“This loss is so great that we are tempted to recall the old saying of
the envy of the gods. But in this solemn hour let us resolutely banish
such temptation, and instead of rebelling against destiny, let us at the

open grave of this God-inspired investigator bow low our heads and
hearts before the inscrutable.”
