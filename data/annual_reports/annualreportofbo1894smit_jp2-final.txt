JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 24, 189

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (the Hon. M. W. Fuller), in the chair; the
Vice-President (the Hon, A. E. Stevenson), the Hon. J. S. Morrill, the
Hon. 8. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, the Hon. R. R. Hitt, Dr. James C.
Welling, Dr. James B. Angell, and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were read from Dr, William Preston
Johnston and the Hon. J. B. Henderson, on account of illness, and from
Dr. Henry Coppée, on account of pressing business engagements.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read in abstract the
minutes of the last meeting, which were approved.

The Secretary then announced the following changes in the Board
of Regents since the last meeting:

The term of Senator George Gray having expired, he was on March
20, 1893, reappointed Regent by the Vice-President.

Representative R. R. Hitt, who was on August 11, 1893, appointed
by the Speaker of the House of Representatives to fill the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Lodge, was on January 4, 1894,
reappointed. The terms of Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky,
and Wheeler, of Alabama, having expired, they also were reappointed
Regents by the Speaker on January 4, 1894.

The Secretary presented his annual report to the Board of Regents
for the year ending June 30, 1893, with a few remarks concerning the
increase in the activities of the Institution, during which he called
attention to its recent contributions to science, made in its Astro-
physical Observatory; and also to the present large number of cor-
respondents, of which there were nearly 24,000, scattered throughout
the whole globe.

On motion the report was accepted.

Dr. Welling, on behalf of his colleagues, presented the report of the

executive committee for the year ending June 30, 1893, explaining that
xI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

the committee had examined every account and found them in each
instance correct.

On motion the report was adopted.

Dr. Welling, in behalf of his colleagues, submitted a resolution rela-
tive to income and expenditures, placing the income of the Institution
in the hands of the Secretary for his administration, Dr. Welling
called the attention of the Regents to a change in the usual wording
of the resolution, by the omission of some words liable to an inter-
pretation which might tend to prejudicially limit the activities of the
Institution.

The resolution (which had been passed in nearly the form now
recommended during earlier years) had since 1888 been framed in the
following words:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, ——, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the
Secretary with the advice of the executive committee upon the basis of the opera-
tions described in the last annual report of said committee, with full discrétion on
the part of the Secretary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of
the heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

This language was a departure from the form previously in use, and
for the reasons stated (among which were that the words ‘upon the
basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said com-
mittee” might seem to restrict the Secretary in the discharge of his
scientific trusts) the committee offered the following resolution, the
propriety of which must be apparent:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895,
be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary,
with the advice of the executive committee, with sull discretion on the part of the
Secretary as to items.

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted.

A modification of the act of Congress organizing the Institution, with
special reference to the constitution of the Establishment, was discussed
at some length in connection with bills introduced in the Senate bear-
ing upon the subject by Senators Morrill and Cullom.

The Secretary stated that his attention had been called to the fact
that a gentleman, a resident of Washington, Mr. Robert Stanton Avery,
intended to make the Smithsonian Institution his residuary legatee,
and had prepared the form of a will, which was submitted.

The Secretary had satisfied himself that Mr. Avery had had this
purpose before him for years, and that the will of which he had just
spoken was not an embodiment of any lately entertained or suddenly
conceived idea, but the expression of a long-matured purpose. He
further stated that Mr. Avery was desirous of knowing whether the
Regents were likely to aecept his bequest.

After some discussion the matter was, on motion of Mr. Breckinridge,
referred to the executive committee with instructions to write to Mr.
Avery acknowledging the receipt of the proposed will, thanking him
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

for it, declaring that the Board will accept, and expressing its appreci-
ation.

The Secretary recalled the attention of the Board to the fact that at
the last meeting he had stated that he had been informally advised by
Dr. Chambers, the executor of Mr. Hodgkinys’s estate, that the latter
had placed in the hands of a New York trust company certain bonds to
be contributed after Mr. Hodgkins’s death to the unrestricted portion
of his donation to the institution; and that the Regents, with this
understanding, had authorized the Secretary to add to this certain
accrued interest and to deposit the same with the other funds of the
institution in the Treasury, making the Hodgkins donation thus placed
in the Treasury $250,000, of which the income of $100,000 was for the
special purpose of the increase and diffusion of knowledge respecting
the properties of atmospheric air as beneficial to man, and $150,000
without restriction.

The Secretary had to state that, while he had received the bonds, he
had not thought himself justified in making this deposit in the Treas-
ury without further instructions from the Regents; and for this reason,
that it appeared that the executor had been misinformed as to the con-
ditions under which they were left, for when the Secretary was called
upon by the trust company to actually receipt for the bonds it was
found that Mr. Hodgkins had given them to form a portion not of the
unrestricted, but of the restricted part of his gift.

The Secretary read a communication from the surrogate of the court
of Suffolk County, N. Y., giving a statement of the condition of the
Hodgkins property, and he read also a statement submitted by the
executor concerning the residuary estate, and he asked instructions of
the Regents as to whether, under existing circumstances, he should
deposit the amounts referred to in the Treasury, or should continue to
hold the bonds, or whether he should take other action.

After some further discussion, Dr. Angell read the following resolu-
tions:

Resolved, That the executive committee and the Secretary are hereby constituted
a permanent committee, with authority to accept for the Institution any property,
real, personal, or mixed, that may be given to it for its purposes, ‘‘the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men,” with power to sell or to convert such property,
and to invest the proceeds in such manner as may appear to them for the interests
of the Institution: Provided, That no deposit be made of such proceeds with the per-
manent fund in the United States Treasury other than by special resolution of the
Regents.

Resolved, That the income derived from the property administered by the com-
mittee constituted by the preceding resolution be appropriated for the service of
the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary under the conditions of the resolu-
tion relative to income and expenditures adopted by the Board of Regents.

Resolved, That the Secretary is authorized to deposit in the United States Treas-
ury, at 6 per cent interest, under the terms of section 5591 of Title Lxxiim of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, such sums of money as may be placed unre-
strictedly at the disposition of the Institution not exceeding $97,000.

On motion of Senator Gray the resolutions were adopted.
XIV. JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary said that he had hoped that Congress would pass an
act providing for the erection of a statue of his eminent predecessor,
Secretary Baird, as it had done in the case of Secretary Henry. Efforts
in this direction in the past had, however, failed, but though he had
foregone neither the hope nor the intention, the present time was evi-
dently not opportune to secure such legislation. There was now no
altogether satisfactory likeness of Secretary Baird. The Secretary
desired to submit to the Board of Regents the propriety of authorizing
the execution of an oil portrait of the late Secretary, which, as in the
case of the one of Secretary Henry, might be placed in the Regents’
Room in perpetual remembrance of him.

Senator Morrill then read the following resolution, which was adopted :

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to have a life-size portrait of the late
Secretary of the Institution (Spencer F. Baird) painted by some competent artist,
which, when finished, may be preserved in the room occupied by the Regents for
their meetings.

The Secretary then stated to the Board that, under its resolution to
provide a new seal for the Institution, he had consulted Mr, Augustus
St. Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, who had taken interest in the mat-
ter, giving his personal supervision to the preparation and arrangement
of the lettering. [The Secretary here exhibited an impression of a
seal executed from Mr. St. Gaudens’s design.| Mr. St. Gaudens had,
when asked to render a bill, replied that he did not desire to submit an
account. The Secretary therefore thought that some action of the
Regents would be appropriate.

Senator Gray submitted the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to convey, in fitting terms, the thanks of
the Board of Regents to Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens for his design for a new seal for
the Institution.

On motion the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary brought to the attention of the Board of Regents the
fact that the late Chinese minister had presented to it an ancient and
specially rare bronze vase, the receipt of which had been noted only by
the ordinary form of acknowledgment at the time, and he therefore
thought that the Regents might like to authorize him to give, even at
this late day, some more formal expression of their thanks.

Thereupon Mr. Gray submitted the following resolution:

Resolyed, That the Secretary is requested to convey, in fitting terms, the thanks of
the Board of Regents to his excellency Chang Yen Hoon, member of the ministry of
the Tsung Li Yamen, for the gift of a valuable ancient vase, presented by him to the
Smithsonian Institution (in June, 1889),

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1894, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary, or, in his absence, of the
Acting Secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bonds approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30,
1894, including the work placed by Congress under its supervision in
the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory.

In the body of the report I have given briefly a general account of
the affairs of the Institution and of its bureaus for the year, reserving
for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports from the
officers in charge of the different branches of work.

The full report upon the National Museum by the assistant secre-
tary, Dr. G. Brown Goode, occupies a separate volume. (Report of
the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, 1894.)

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress, approved by the President March 4, 1894, section
5579 of the Revised Statutes was amended to read as follows:

heads of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an establish-
ment by the name of the Smithsonian Institution for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men, and by that name shall be known and
have perpetual succession with the powers, limitations, and restrictions
hereinafter contained, and no other.

As now organized the Smithsonian Establishment consists of the
following ex officio members:

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 24, 1894, at 10
o'clock a.m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in- the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

There has been no change in the personnel of the Board during the
year, the Regents whose terms have expired -having been reappointed,
as follows:

Dr. Andrew D. White, reappointed by joint resolution of Congress
approved by the President, March 19, 1594.

The Honorable Joseph Wheeler, the Honorable W. ©. P. Breckin-
ridge, and the Honorable Robert R. Hitt, reappointed by the Speaker
of the House of Representatives on January 4, 1894.

ADMINISTRATION.

I desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last report
that Congress be asked to make an appropriation to cover the expenses
incurred by the Institution incident to the administration of its Gov-
ernment trusts. These expenses are not specifically provided for by
any of the present appropriations, since they belong not singly to the
National Museum, or to the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the Inter-
national Exchange Service, or the like, but to expenditures common to
all of them, and which are not arranged for by the terms of the appro-
priations for any one. I repeat that, in the words of a previous report,
it is in the interests of economy that this expenditure should be met
from some common source, owing to the limited size of the establish-
ments in question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions
than to bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of
$17,000 for international exchanges, or an appropriation of $10,000 for
an observatory, can not each so well bear the separate provision of a
disbursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employees, as in
the case of larger bureaus, but that their limited needs can be better and
more economically managed by not duplicating such offices. There is,
however, no practicable way of arranging this in compliance with the
present terms of the appropriations, which may be said to tacitly assume
that each of these bureaus or divisions is thus completely provided for.
It is in some cases impossible that it should be so without the expend-
iture of greatly more than the appropriated sum, and the terms of the
appropriations should, in the interest of economy, either recognize the
propriety of meeting each bureau’s share of these common expenses out
of each one’s appropriation or else out of a special appropriation made
in their common interest.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, as
follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000.

Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of
the purposes thereof.

The above specified permanent fund is deposited, under section 5591,
of the Revised Statutes, modified as above noted, in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1893, the unexpended
balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report
for last year, was $57,092.82. Interest on the permanent fund, amount-
ing to $54,180, was received during the year, which, together with a
sum of $7,787.06, received from the sale of publications and from mis-
cellaneous sources, and $8,000 received as a portion of the residuary
legacy from the estate of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, made the total
receipts $69,967.06.

The entire expenditures during the year, including the $8,000 men-
tioned above, which was added to the permanent fund, amounted to
$67,461.38, for the details of which reference is made to the report of
the executive committee. On June 30, 1894, the balance in the Treas-
ury of the United States to the credit of the Secretary for the expenses
of the Institution was $59,598.50, which includes the sum of $10,000
referred to in previous reports, $5,000 received from the estate of Dr. J.
H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter
a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote certain physical
researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s consent, deposited
by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the Institution.

The Regents also hold the sum of $42,000, received upon the death
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, in approved railroad bonds, and forming
a part of the fund established by him for investigations, ete., of the
properties of atmospheric air.

This balance also includes the interest accummulated on the Hodg-
kins donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations,
and interest on the Hamilton fund, besides relatively considerable sums
held to meet obligations which may be expected to mature as the result
of different scientific investigations or publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 1893-94, of the following appropriations:

All vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October
2,1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury,
were as follows:

BUILDINGS.

The crowding of objects, belonging to the nation, in the halls of the
Institution and the Museum building, and in their workrooms, which
should be devoted to other purposes, has already been spoken of by me in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

previous reports. This condition, which seems to have almost reached
a limit of evil from the impossibility of further storage of such objects,
was brought to the especial attention of the last Congress, when it
became necessary to vacate the storage rooms occupied by the National
Museum in the old Armory building on account of intended changes
authorized by Congress for the benefit of the Fish Commission.

At this time a small building in the city several squares distant was
rented, under authority from Congress, for the storage of the materials,
and for the workshops removed from the Armory building, but this made
no provision for che articles returned from the Chicago Exposition.

At the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Institution,
which has been made by Congress the depository of all such objects,
felt obliged to resume the care of an immense collection of plants, con-
stituting the National Herbarium, which had previously been placed by
the Institution in the charge of that Department, and which it had now,
in fact, no room for. The collection was stored, under the charge of
the Department of Agriculture, in a building which was not fireproof,
and this fact was stated by the Department as influencing it in its
request that the Institution should resume charge of them, but the Insti-
tution itself has no place to put them, except in sheds more insecure than
those from which they came. It is true that room has been made for
them within the fireproof portion of the building, but only by the
transfer of a large mass of other objects to the wooden sheds, which
are in a condition of extreme danger. I can give a no more definite
idea of the alarming condition here than by saying thatit is such that
no insurance company would place risks on the sheds except at very
high rates.

The congestion in question has compelled the use not only of rooms
belonging -to the Museum building proper, for the accommodation of
objects like those which came from the Chicago Exposition, but of
those of the Institution intended for other purposes, such as the
“‘Chapel,” whose lofty vaulted roof was made firepoof by Congress
three years ago with quite another destination than the actual use
which necessity has imposed for the time.

It seems almost superfluous, after what has just been said, for me to
recall.in other terms the need of more adequate accommodations for the
national collections, but I may again refer to what has been set forth
at length on this subject in my previous reports, more especially in
that for 1892.

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

In the contemplation of the first architect, the Smithsonian building
was intended to produce the effect of a Norman castle, and its tall
towers, narrow embrasures, and like features do attain, if not archie-
ological correctness, at any rate a certain admitted attractiveness of
exterior. This has been reached, however, as is well known, not only
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

at a disproportionate outlay of money from the limited Smithsonian
fund (which was here, in fact, expended largely for the benefit of the
city in furnishing it with such a picturesque building), but at a cost of
an amount of permanent discomfort to the inmates which those who
are not there employed can hardly appreciate.

In particular, the narrow windows and the small diamond panes of
glass admit so little light that in winter days some of the rooms where
clerical work is carried on, need to be artificially lighted, and in all
cases the occupants Jose the advantage of what ought to be abundant
light, considering their open surroundings in the middle of a park. I
think it well to state that while I should have made many more changes
in the interest of the comfort and health of the clerical occupants of the
building if I had had the means to do so, I have never felt at liberty
to alter the external appearance of the building when alteration
could possibly be avoided, and I have therefore never authorized the
enlargement of any of the apertures in the stone work, or made any
changes of this kind which could be understood as modifying the
structural features (except in improving the sanitary conditions of the
basement), and when any change is mentioned here it will always be
understood that it is essentially the work of the carpenter in providing
for larger inside frames and larger lights in the sashes, and in like
alterations.

Thus in the east wing of the building, in the fourth story, a room
for containing the archives of the Institution has been provided, which
is well lighted by one of the few large windows the building possesses,
and which has been fitted for more convenient reference to the records
of the Institution. The second floor has been made brighter by
repainting and by some additional floor lights in the third floor, and
the windows in the room especially set apart for the safe-keeping of
the engravings and books of art belonging to the Institution have been
thus enlarged, while some of the rooms on the second floor have been
improved by slight alterations in the window frames. On the first
floor additional quarters were provided for the library in the rooms
which were vacated by the transfer of the exchange department to the
lower floor.

I have been enabled to make the above small changes at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund, but a restrictive clause contained in the
appropriation act of August 50, 1890, for repairs to the Smithsonian
Institution, having been removed by a clause in the sundry eivil act
for the year ending June 30, 1894, I have, with a portion of the unex-
pended amount of this appropriation, been also able to transform a suite
of dark and damp rooms in the basement on the south side into well-
lighted and comfortable, though too limited offices, in which every
attention has been paid to sanitation. The exchange bureau continues
to occupy these, but they were barely sufficient at first, and, through
the constant increase of the demand of the Government service, addi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fl

tional room for these exchanges will soon be called for, while the stor-
age facilities of the Institution are now otherwise severely taxed.

RESEARCH.

As I have elsewhere remarked, it appears to be an essential portion
of the original scheme of the government of the Institution that its
Secretary should be expected to advance knowledge, whether in letters
or in science, by personal research; and resolutions of the Regents
formally request the Secretary to contirue his investigations in physi-
cal science, and to present their results for publication in the Smith-
sonian * Contributions.”

The advancement of science through original research at the hands
of those eminent men, Henry and Baird, the former Secretaries of this
Institution, is known to all, but though the Secretary may be still
expected to personally contribute to the advancement of science, or art,
or letters, by his individual efforts, it is certain that the increasing
demands of time for labors of administration had greatly limited the
possibility of this, even in the time of Henry, and that at the present
day administrative duties, and especially those connected with the care
of Government interests, constitute a barrier to such investigations,
which is all but impassable.

1 have, however, given such limited time as could be spared from
administrative duties largely to the continuation of the researches
upon the solar spectrum mentioned in my last report. This work, car-
ried on in the Astro-physical Observatory, is believed to be of more than
common importance, aud is referred to at more length in connection with
the observatory report of this year.

The investigations, referred to in previous reports, upon aerody-
namics have been continued intermittently. They are not complete,
but they appear to point to conclusions of general and unusual interest.

Mention may also be made here of a grant of $50in December, 1893,
to the director of the Lick Observatory, Prof. EK. 8. Holden, for experi-
ments in solar photography, and of a grant of a like amount in May,
1894, to Dr. A. G. Webster, of Clark University, for certain researches
in the velocity of electrodynamic disturbances in wires.

Mr. W. A. Eddy was likewise aided to the amount of $50 in certain
experiments in the study of the electrical and other conditions of the
upper atmosphere by means of kites.

Investigations aided by the Hodgkins fund, and special researches
carried on in the Astro-physical Observatory are mentioned on another
page.

The researches referred to above are connected altogether with the
physical sciences, since aid to original research in the biological sciences
has been largely, though indirectly, provided through the Institution’s
connection with the National Museum and otherwise.

The subscription has been continued for twenty copies of the Astro-
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

nomical Journal as a slight aid to its publication, the separate numbers
of the journal being sent regularly to foreign libraries and observatories
as exchanges of the Institution.

EXPLORATIONS.

The explorations of the Institution during the year have been ear-
ried on chiefly through the National Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology. Natural history and ethnological explorations and studies were
made in Kashmir, India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands, by Dr.
William L. Abbott; by Professor Cook, in Liberia; by Consul-General
Crawford, in Finland, and by other collaborators of the Institution in
Central and South America and the West Indies, resulting in very
valuable additions to the Museum collection. In New Mexico and Ari-
zona, as also in several localities in the Eastern States, archeological
explorations by the Bureau of Ethnology have added much to our
knowledge of the habits and customs of the aborigines. The San Juan
Valley and the Canyon de Chelly were found to be rich in remains of
ancient American structures, indicating a numerous population. Some
of the aboriginal songs of the Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians
were preserved with the aid of the graphophone. I have on other
pages reviewed some of these explorations more in detail.

A brief abstract of Mr. Rockhill’s explorations in Mongolia and
Tibet, in 1891 and 1892, made partly under the auspices of the Insti-
tution, was published in the Annual Report for 1892. The detailed
diary of his journey is now in the hands of the printer, and will form
an octavo volume of about 400 pages, with numerous illustrations.
This book is believed to be of particular interest at the present time.

PUBLICATIONS.

One of the most important functions of the Institution is the diffu-
sion of knowledge by means of publications, and in this branch of
work the past year has been an active one. Since my last report there
have been published by the Smithsonian and its bureaus twelve vol-
umes and eighty-two pamphlets or parts of volumes, aggregating
5,854 printed pages, covering practically every branch of natural and
physical science.

The publieations of the Institution itself include three principal
series—Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections,
and the Annual Reports. The first two are printed at the expense of
the Smithsonian fund, while the reports are Government documents.

Contributions to Knowledge.—The Contributions to Knowledge are in
quarto form, and are the most important of the series. They include
only memoirs of extended original investigations and researches,
advancing what are believed to be new truths, and constituting, there-
fore, positive additions to human knowledge. ‘Twenty-seven volumes
of these have been completed since the Institution was founded,
including 125 memoirs pertaining to all branches of knowledge.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

It is the present practice to publish occasionally memoirs from the
Contributions in separate form, to be afterwards combined in a volume
when enough have been completed. Only one such memoir of Contri-
butions has been prepared during the year, which is a communication
by the Secretary under the title of The Internal Work of the Wind.

A volume of the Contributions is now passing through the press, and,
though its full description belongs more properly to a later report, it
may be stated here that its subject is oceanic ichthyology, that it is
prepared by Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, and that
the work, which will be a joint publication of the Institution and the
National Museum, is an exhaustive dissertation on the fishes of the
ocean depths and particularly those of the North Atlantic Basin.

As another memoir of Contributions, [ had hoped to complete the
publication of the photograpbic volume on the moon, to which I have
called attention in previous reports, but the science of photography
has not yet progressed sufficiently to meet the requirements of the
work.

Other memoirs are in preparation, to which attention will be called
in my next report.

Miscellaneous Collections.—The Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions is an octavo series intended to include works of scientific value,
but of less original importance than the Contributions to Knowledge.

Thirty-five complete volumes of Collections have been issued since
the Institution was founded, and four additional volumes are now in
preparation, parts of volumes 35 to 38 having already been published.

Volume xxxv of the Collections wiil include the Smithsonian Mete-
orological, Geographical, and Physical Tables. These tables are
intended to replace in modernized form and with newer knowledge the
Guyot Meteorological and Physical Tables, first published in 1852, and
which has since been a standard work of reference for investigators.
The first part of the volume, the Meteorological Tables, was published
last year. The Geographical Tables, prepared by Professor Woodward,
have been put in type during this year, but not yet issued; these tables
make a volume of 288 pages. The Physical Tables are now being pre-
pared by Prof. Thomas Gray, and may be expected to be completed in
1895.

Volume XXXVI is a single work, a very comprehensive Select Bibli-
ography of Chemistry, covering tbe four hundred years from 1492
to 1892, prepared by Dr. H. Carrington Bolton. This volume was pub-
lished in 1893, but the first edition was soon exhausted, and it became
necessary to issue a second edition during the present year.

There is now in progress the preparation of a supplement to this
Bibliography of Chemistry, to mclude titles of works down to 1895, as
well as some additions to the first volume. It is expected that the
supplement will number about 5,000 titles.

This bibliography actually aims to include everything that is of
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

importance in the literature of chemistry, the word “Select” being
only added as an indication that the work does not profess absolute
completeness. It represents the labors of a lifetime on the part of a
most industrious student of the bibliography of chemistry, and is a
work of reference of such value that is is believed it will be a necessity
to every chemical investigator.

Volume xxxvit of the Collections is a very complete Index to the
genera and species of the Foraminifera, by Prof. C. Davies Sherborn, of
London. The technical character of this work has rendered prompt
publication impracticable. The first part of the volume, ‘¢‘A to non,”
was issued during the year, and the second part is in progress.

Volume xxxyitt of the Collections is also in progress and consists
of several short papers, including ‘* Principles and method of classifi-
cation of varieties of the human species ;” “ Bibliography of Aceto-Acetic
Ester ;” ‘Indexes to literatures of Cerium and Lanthanum,” and “ Index
to literature of Didymium.” These indexes to chemical literature are
published in continuation of the series begun some years ago under the
recommendation of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.

A special octavo volume, now in press, consists of the Diary of a
Journey through Mongolia and Tibet, by Mr. W. W. Rockhill. This
expedition was carried on in part under the auspices of the Institu-
tion, and the diary is, in the main, a description of the characteristic
geographical and ethnological features of those countries, so seldom
visited by Europeans. <A large map, on a scale of 32 miles to the inch,
shows the route traversed by Mr. Rockhill, and is in itself a valuable
contribution to our knowledge of the region.

Following the usual custom, the several papers comprised in the
general appendix of the annual report have been issued separately
in pamphlet form; about sixty of these pamphlets were issued dur-
ing this year, as enumerated in the editor’s report.

Smithsonian annual reports—The delayed annual reports of the
Institution for the years 1891 and 1892 have been received and distrib-
uted, as also the annual reports of the United States National Museum
for those years.

The Secretary’s report for 1893 was issued in January in pamphlet
form. The manuscript of the general appendix to the report of the
Institution for 1893 was sent to the printer on March 31, and the entire
volume was stereotyped and press work in progress early in June,
thus bringing the work up to date, and avoiding the tedious delays
of previous years.

Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology.—The ninth and the tenth annual
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Institution
have both been received during the year. These volumes fully main-
tain the character established for the series, and are gradually bringing
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

up the arrearageof the work. The eleventh and twelfth annual reports
are in the hands of the printer and will soon be completed. Several
papers in the Bulletin series were issued during the year.

Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum.—The publications
of the Museum are mentioned on another page under the general head
of “The National Museum.”

LIBRARY.

In my report for 1887-88 I detailed a plan for increasing the library
by exchanges. Lists of periodicals were secured from the British
Museum, several universities, and a great number of leading special-
ists, and these lists were carefully revised in the former year and corre-
spondence then entered upon with each society and journal represented
on them. This work has now been completed, after nearly seven years
of labor. Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written, resulting in the
addition of 1,853 new periodicals to the list of those received, and entire
or partial completion of 1,042 defective series. It is already ‘time to
recommence this labor, which ought to be never ending if the periodi-
cal collections of the Institution are to continue to be what they are
believed to be to-day—the completest in the world. Accordingly it is
my intention to have new lists prepared and to continue this special
feature of the work of adding to the library by exchange during the
coming year.

Through the provision of new quarters for the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges I have been enabled to assign two additional rooms
for the use of the library, the one for a collection of books required for
reference, and the other as an office for the librarian, to the very great
advantage of the service. A room has also been set apart tor the
collection of prints belonging to the Institution.

The reading room of the Institution is no longer adequate for the
large collection of scientific periodicals received and for the persons
desiring to consult them. As it isnot possible to assign any additional
room for the library at present, I am considering a plan for some modi-
fications in the present reading room which will render it more suitable
to its purpose.

The total number of publications of every kind received during the
past pear reached 39,826, an increase of nearly 9,000 over the previous
year.

THE HODGKINS FUND.

The many responses to the large number of circulars announcing
the terms of the Hodgkins competition, and the numerous requests
for further information, have shown that a widespread interest in the
subject has been awakened. In February, 1894, a second edition of the
circulars announcing the prizes became necessary, which was issued
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in English, French, and German, and widely distributed. In answer
to numerous inquiries the following supplementary circular, descriptive
of the general character and work of the Institution, and making
mention of the Hodgkins fund, was also prepared and translated into
French and German, and through the courtesy of the Department of
State a number of copies were sent to several of the American
embassies in Europe for their general use, in answering questions
concerning the Smithsonian Institution:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, ———,189 .

Str: In answer to your inquiry [ am authorized to furnish the fol-
lowing information:

The SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION was originally constituted by an Act
of the National Legislature, to administer a bequest made to the Goy-
ernment of the United States in the early years of the present century.
The purpose of the bequest was declared to be ‘‘ The increase and dif:
fusion of knowledge among men,” and its acceptance by the nation is
the only instance of such an action in its history. The Institution,
then, occupies a peculiar relation to the Government. It is composed
as follows:

MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

PRESIDING OFFICER (ex-officio): The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

Chancellor: The Chief Justice of the United States.

The Vice-President of the United States.

The Secretary of Staie.

The Secretary ot the Treasury.

The Secretary ot War.

The Secretary of the Navy.

The Postmaster-General.

The Attorney-General.

The Secretary of the Interior.

The Secretary of Agriculture.

The high functionaries above mentioned are its members ex officio,
with the exception of the chancellor, who is elected. The law also cre-
ates a secretary of the above body, whom it calls “the Secretary of the
Institution.”

ADMINISTRATION.

The law further directs that the business of the Institution shall be
managed by a Board of Regents, composed of the Vice-President and
the Chief Justice of the United States, three Senators, three members of
the House of Representatives, and six other eminent persons nominated
by a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The Secretary of the Institution is also the Secretary of the Board of
Regents and their principal executive officer. His duties in this regard
are analogous to those of a Director. All correspondence should be
addressed to him.

It will be observed that the immediate and primary object of the
Smithsonian Institution, as above constituted, is to administer a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. il

certain fund, of which the United States has accepted the custody, for
the especial purpose of ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men,” so that its purpose in its most general sense is not limited
to the people of the United States of America, but extends to all man-
kind. This has been interpreted as indicating such a direction of the
activities of the Institution as shall result—

(1) In the increase of knowledge by original investigation and
study, either in science or literature.

(2) In the diffusion of this knowledge by publication, not only
through the United States, but everywhere, and especially by promot-
ing an imterchange of thought among those prominent in learning
among all nations, through its correspondents. These embrace insti-
tutions or societies conspicuous in art, science, or literature throughout
the world.

Its publications are in three principalissues, namely: The ‘Contribu-
tions to Knowledge,” the ‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” and the “Annual
Report.” Numerous works are published annually by it, under one of
these forms, and distributed to its principal correspondents, while
there is also published, at the expense of the Government, an edition
of the Report of the Board of Regents, containing an account of the
operations of the Institution during each year, which is distributed
throughout the country by the Congress.

The Institution has been authorized by law to deposit its original
fund in the Treasury of the United States, and it has further been
authorized to accept certain special bequests made by individuals,
where these have been such as to promote its general purpose, ‘‘The
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” Thus, for example,
the Institution has accepted and administered a fund which, under the
name of the donor, is called “‘The Hodgkins fund,” and which is given
for the especial purpose of “The increase and diffusion of more exact
knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric air
in connection with the welfare of man;” this fund is also deposited in
the Treasury of the United States. Other donations have been
received and are administered for other specific purposes.

The seat of the Institution is at Washington, but its activities reach
throughout the world in various ways, and principally through the
system of correspondence already referred to. The present number
of correspondents is about 24,000, and by means of this system the
Institution not only gives, but receives, communications from men of
learning in all countries.

In this and other ways it has gathered at Washington a special
library of books bearing upon the history of arts, sciences, discoveries,
and inventions.. The library now includes 300,000 titles, the greater
proportion of which is by permission of Congress deposited in the same
building and accessible with the National Library.

Besides the above activities, which are carried on with the special
fund already referred to, of which the nation has consented to act as
the guardian, there are certain bureaus or divisions of the Government
which the legislature has placed in its especial charge, and for the cost
of which Congress has, at different times, made special appropriations.
In this way it has placed under the charge of the Institution the
United States National Museum, the Bureau of International Exchanges,
the Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory. These also are administered by the Secretary,

under the direction of the Board of Regents. The present Secretary
of the Institution is S. P. Langley, to whom all communications should
be addressed, at Washington.*

In spite of the persistent effort to reach all who might be interested,
or who might wish to contribute to the competition, it was found that
in so wide a distribution the circulars had, in various instances, failed
to reach those for whom they were intended. This fact led to the
extension of the competition from July 1 to December 31, 1594. A
circular letter announcing this change of date, and offering to return,
at the expense of the Institution, papers which had been already sub-
mitted, was issued in June, 1894, and mailed to all competitors, besides

Monsieur: J’ai eu Vhonneur de recevoir votre lettre et je suis autorisé & vous donner les renseigne-
ments qui suivent:

L’ Institut SMITHSONIEN a été, & Vorigine, créé par une loi du Parlement Fédéral dans le but de gérer
un legs fait au Gouvernement des Etats-Unis dans les premié¢res années de ce siécle. L’objet du legs,
apres la déclaration qui en était faite, était ‘le développement et la propagation du savoir parmiles
hommes,” et lorsque la Nation Paccepta, elle donna le seul exemple de ce genre qui se puisse trouver
dans son histoire. Les relations de Institut avec le Gouvernement sont done d'une nature toute
spéciale.

Tl est constitué de la fagcn suivante:

MEMBRES DE L’INSTITUT.

Chancelier: Le Président de la Cour Supréme des Etats-Unis.

Le Vice-Président des Etats-Unis.

Le Secrétaire d’ Etat.

Le Secrétaire du Trésor.

Le Secrétaire de la Guerre.

Le Secrétaire de la Marine.

Le Ministre des Postes.

Le Ministre de la Justice.

Le Secrétaire de I’ Intérieur.

Les mae fonctionnaires susnommeés sont membres d’office de Institut, & exception du Chanceller
qui est élu.

La loi pourvoit l'Institut d’un Secrétaire Perpétuel; ilale titre de ‘Secretary of the Institution.”
ADMINISTRATION.

La loi dispose en outre que les affaires de l'Institut seront gérées par un Conseil d’ Administration
dont font partie le Vice-Président des Etats-Unis, le Président de la Cour Supréme, trois Sénateurs,
trois membres de la Chambre des Députés, et six autres personnes éminentes, nommées par un ordre
du jour voté conjointement par les deux Chambres.

Le Secrétaire Perpétuel de l'Institut est également Secrétaire du Conseil d’Administration, dont il
est le principal représentant exécutif. Ses fonctions a cet égard_ sont analogues a celles de
Directeur-Général. C'est & lui que doit étre adressée toute la correspondance. .

Comme on le voit, Vobjet immédiat de Institut Smithsonien, constitué ainsi qu'il vient d’étre
dit, est de gérer un certain fonds dont les Etats-Unis ont accepté la garde et qui doit étre spécialement
appliqué ‘tau développement et a la propagation du savoir parmi les hommes,”’ de sorte que cette
destination, prise dans son sens le plus général, n'est pas réduite au public des Etats-Unis mais
s’étend au monde entier.

L’interprétation qui lui a été donnée est que l Institut doit poursuivre ses efforts dans telle direction
qui produirait comme résultat:

1. Le développement des connaissances humaines, soit dans les sciences ou dans les lettres, par des
travaux originaux de recherches et d’études.

2. La propagation de ‘ces connaissances par des publications répandues non seulement dans les
Etats-Unis, mais en tous lieux, et surtout en encourageant parmi les savants de marque dans toutes
les nations, un échange intellectuel, par ’intermédiaire de ses correspondants qui se comptent parmi
les institutions ou socictés principales dans les arts, les sciences ou les lettres, dans le monde.

Ses publications affectent trois formes principales, & savoir: ‘‘The Contributions to Knowledge”
(Les Apports an Savoir), les ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections’ (Collections Variées) et 1’ ‘Annual Report”
(le Compte Rendu Annuel). Sous unedeces trois formes, l'Institut publie chaque année de nombreux
ouvrages qu’il distribue a ses principaux correspondants. Cependant, une édition du Rapport du
Conseil d’ Administration, donnant un compte rendu des opérations de l'Institut dans le courant de
chaque année, est aussi publiée aux frais du Gouvernement et répandue dans le pays par les soins du
Congres.

L'Institut a regu de la loi l'‘autorisation de déposer le fonds originel au Trésor des Etats-Unis et il
a été en outre autorisé 4 accepter certains legs spéciaux, faits par des personnes privées, lorsque ces

country and Kurope.*

Up to June 30, 1894, 259 memoirs, printed and manuscript, have been
received in connection with the competition, representing correspond-
ents in the United States, Mexico, England, Scotland, Norway, Den-
mark, Russia (including Finland), France, Belgium, Germany, Austria-
Hungary, Servia, Italy, and British India.

legs sont de nature A laider dans sa mission générale: ‘le développement et la propagation du savoir
parmi les hommes.’’ C’est ainsi, par exemple, que l'Institut a accepté et géré un fonds qui, du nom
de son donateur, est appelé ‘‘le fonds Hodgkins” et quia été donué expressément pour favoriser “le
développement et la propagation d’une connaissance plus précise sur le sujet de la nature et des pro-
priétés de Yair atmosphérique par rapport au bien étre humain,”’ somme qui est également déposée au
Trésor. D’autres dons ont été acceptés et sont gérés pour étre affectés & d’autres objets spécifiés.

Le siége de l'Institut est & Washington, mais sa sphére action s’étend en dehors des Etats-Unis
de diverses facons, et surtout au moyen du systéme de correspondance, dont ila été parlé plus haut.
Le nombre des correspondants s’éléve actuellement a 24,000 environ et lui permet non senlement de
donner, mais encore de recevoir des communications des hommes de savoir de tous les pays.

Par ce moyen et par d'autres encore, l'Institut a réuni 4 Washington, une bibliothéque spéciale de
livres traitant de histoire des arts, des sciences, des découvertes et des inventions. Elle comprend
300,000 ouvrages, dont la plus grande partie a été, par permission du Congres, déposée a la Bibliotheque
Nationale, ou ils peuvent étre consultés avec les autres richesses de la Bibliotheque.

En dehors de cette sphére d’action dont les moyens lui. sont fournis par les fonds particuliers en
question et dont le Gouvernement a bien youlu assumer la tutelle, P Institut a été spécialement commis
ar Ja Législature 4 la charge de certains départements ou certaines divisions du Gouvernement, pour
e maintien desquels le Congrés a, de temps 4 autre, voté des crédits spéciaux. C’est ainsi qu’ont été
placés sous la direction de l'Institut, le Musée des Etats-Unis, le Département des changes Interna-
tionaux, le Département d’Ethnologie, le Pare National de Zoologie, et LObservatoire Astro-physique.
Tous ces établissements sont dirigés par le Secrétaire Perpétuel sous le contréle du Conseil

HODGKINS PRIZES.
WASHINGTON, ———, 1894.

DEAR Sir: I beg leave to inform you that the time within which papers may be
submitted in competition for the Hodgkins fund prizes of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, for essays in regard to the nature or properties of atmospheric air, has been
extended from July 1 to December 31, 1894. This action has been taken for the
reason that many of the circulars seem to have failed to reach the persons for whom
they were intended.

In order that all competitors may have the advantage of this extension of time,
the Institution will, upon request, take pleasure in returning papers already sub-
mitted; all papers being subject to the general condition requiring delivery in
Washington City before January 1, 1895,

It is preferred that the name and address of each competitor be attached to the
manuscript; it is permitted, however, that anyone who desires it may send his name
and address in such a form that they can be detached from the manuscript, which
he may identify by means of a motto.

The manuscripts of unsuccessful candidates will be returned, if desired; but the
proprietorship of papers to which one of the prizes has been awarded will rest with
the Institution, which only desires to give them a wide publicity; and no copyright
privileges are in this case to be expected by the author.

Papers which have been already published will not be accepted in competition
for the prizes, but may be eligible for the medal. This medal will be awarded in
the same way that medals are usually awarded by the principal scientific societies,
the medalists being chosen from all investigators known to the committee of award
and not necessarily from those alone who have submitted papers.

It is requested that all packages, manuscript or printed, intended for competition
be marked ‘‘Hodgkins competition” upon the outside of the wrapper, and be
addressed to Mr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washing-
ton City, U.S. A.

Very respectfully, S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work of the advisory committee has been going on systematically
during the year; papers have been read and passed upon, and many
applications for grants considered.

Prof. E. W. Morley’s work on the determinations of the density of
oxygen and hydrogen, referred to in previous reports as aided by spe-
cial apparatus provided by the Institution, is approaching completion.

The investigations undertaken by Dr.J. 8S. billings and Dr. 8S. Weir
Mitchell into the nature of the peculiar substances of organic origin
contained in the air expired by human beings, to which reference was
made in my last report, is still continued under a grant from the Hodg-
kins fund, as also are the researches by Dr. O. Lummer and Dr, E.
Pringsheim, of Berlin University, on the determination of an exact
measure of the cooling of gases while expanding, with a view to revis-
ing the value of that most important constant which is technically
termed the “ gamma” function.

The limitations of the fund have, however, rendered it necessary,
with slight exceptions, to postpone further action in this direction for
the present, although it is hoped that it will prove practicable at a later
date to aid certain important researches to which attention has been
invited.

CORRESPONDENCE.

It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the diversity of the nature
of the correspondence carried on immediately in the Secretary’s office.
Without reference to the voluminous correspondence of the National
Museum, or the special correspondence of the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Zoological Park, and the Bureau of Exchanges, constant inquiries are
received from all parts of the country for information on almost every
conceivable topic, and requests for statistics and for information on the
most varying scientific subjects. This correspondence all receives care-
ful attention, and, as a part of the aim of the Institution in the “ diffu-
sion of knowledge,” an effort is made to give a full reply to all such in-
quiries, often involving an amount of labor on the part of the curators,
as well as of those more immediately occupied with the correspondence
of the Institution, out of proportion to the merits of the case.

I desire to remark that this increase of correspondence, even if that
upon the business of subordinate Government bureaus alone is consid-
ered, calls constantly for more clerical aid and other expenses which
there is no appropriation for, and which practically form an added
burden on the limited Smithsonian fund, which it ought not to bear, and
to refer in this connection to what is said under “ Administration.”

The entries in the registry book of letters received during the year
number 3,652, but these are only the relatively important letters.

The general card index to all the correspondence in the Secretary’s
office, which was begun on January 1, 1893, is kept up constantly to date,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1 Le

and has been extended back to include all letters written or received
since January 1, 1892.

All correspondence prior to this current correspondence file has been
placed in the archives, and the letters that have been received between
1882 and 1890 have recently been bound and indexed, completing the
series of indexes to correspondence.

Reports, memoranda, and data collected on various subjects not prop-
erly belonging to the correspondence are preserved in a miscellaneous
file and properly indexed.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Naples table-—The anticipations in regard to the Naples table,
which, as I have stated in the report for 1893, has been leased for a
period of three years upon the petition of the biologists and universi-
ties of the United States, have been apparently justified.

Numerous applications for the occupancy of the table have been
received and considered. The following, being favorably reported by
the advisory committee, were approved by me for the present year:

Mr. D. G. Fairchild, United States Department of Agriculture,
received the appointment for October, November, and December, 1895.

Dr. W. M. Wheeler, University of Chicago, was appointed for Jan-
uary, February, and March, 1894.

Dr. H. C. Bumpus, Brown University, appointed for February,
March, and April, 1894.

Prof. Lewis Murbach received an assignment of three months,
beginning June 20, 1894.

Desiring to give to all investigators an equal opportunity to avail
themselves of the advantage of a seat at the Smithsonian table, it has
been decided that final action upon an application may not be taken
more than six months in advance of the date for which the table is
desired, and that should more than one application be filed for the
same period, in cases of presumably equal merit, the assignment shall
be made according to priority of application. It has also been deter-
mined that no appointment shall be made for a period of more than
six months, although an occupant may apply for extension of time or
for reappointment at some future date.

Students who are appointed to the table for the full term of six
months are desired to report to me at the close of each three months of
their occupancy; those appointed for a shorter period are expected to
make such report at the close of their assignment.

In several instances the time desired by an applicant overlaps that
of another, as is the case in February and March of 1894, but through
the ready courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, director of the station, who kindly
offered to arrange for the accommodation of more than one occupant of
the table at the same time, it has thus far been found possible to make
the appointments without disappointing a student on this account.

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

With a view to profiting by the judgment of our representative biolo-
gists in administering the affairs of the Naples table, I requested, at an
early date, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, the
president of the Society of American Naturalists, the president of the
American Morphological Society, and the president of the Association
of American Anatomists to nominate each one member of. an advisory
committee, the personnel of which is as follows, I having designated
Doctor Billings, as chairman, and Doctor Stiles, as secretary of the
committee :

Advisory committee, Naples table—Dr. J. 8S. Billings, U. 8S. A,,
director of the United States Army Medical Museum, chairman; Dr. E.
B. Wilson, professor of zoology, Columbia University; Dr. J. A. Ryder,
professor of embryology, University of Pennsylvania; Dr.C. W. Stiles,
zoologist, United States Department of Agriculture, secretary.

lam indebted to this committee for valuable aid in examining the
testimonials accompanying applications for the occupancy of the table
and for recommendations with regard to appointments, as well as for
the consideration of the various questions in connection with the assign-
ment of the table, to which {£ have asked attention. The contract
giving to the Institution the tenure of the Naples table for the term
of three years was given in full in my last year’s report.

Seal of the Institution.—A suitable steel die has been prepared for
the new sealof the Institution, designed by Augustus St. Gaudens, and
formally adopted by the Board of Regents at their meeting of January
25, 1895, and the new seal has been affixed, when required, to formal
papers since February, 1894, though the first use of the design was
upon the circulars concerning the Hodgkins prizes, issued under date
of March 31, 1893.

The Worlds Columbian Exposition.—The display made by the Smith-
sonian Institution, including the National Museum and the Bureau of
Ethnology, embraced collections prepared by the following departments
of the Museum: Ethnology, physical geology, mammals, birds, reptiles,
fishes, insects, marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, minerals,
prehistoric anthropology, historical collections, a collection of objeets
illustrating religious ceremonial, graphic arts, musical instruments,
animal products, and a special exhibit of domesticated animals. In
addition, an exhibit illustrating methods of aboriginal quarrying was
prepared by Mr. William H. Holmes, a display of Japanese potteries
was installed by Mr. Hieromich Shugio, aud an exhibit of early elec-
trical apparatus, employed by Prof. Joseph Henry in his experiments
which led to the discovery of the electric telegraph, was also prepared.
Complete sets of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and
of the National Museum were exhibited, together with those of the
American Historical Association.

_ These collections are fully described in the report for 1893 of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

Assistant Secretary, who acted as the representative of the Institution
upon that occasion. It is only necessary to add here that the exhibit
proved exceedingly attractive to the visitors, as evidenced by the
crowding of the space trom the opening to the closing day, and by the
numerous favorable notices published in the newspapers and periodi-
cals of the country.

A considerable number of the staff of the Institution served as
judges of award in connection with the several scientific juries of the
Exposition.

The Exposition closed on October 31, and the reshipment of the
exhibits to Washington was immediately commenced.

At the close of the Exposition several interesting collections were
presented to the Institution by foreign Governments and by individuals
which it has been difficult to provide room for.

In this connection I desire to call especial attention to the regret-
table fact that many exhibits that might have been secured for the
National Museum, without expense to the Government, went elsewhere,
as no provision could be made here for their exhibition in the already
overcrowded condition of the Museum building.

Delegates to universities and learned societies —The Smithsonian Insti-
tution is not infrequently invited to send representatives to special
celebrations instituted by learned societies or universities with which
it is in correspondence, both in this country and abroad. Whenever
practicable, special delegates have been designated by the Secretary to
represent the Institution on such occasions,

Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University and curator of oriental
antiquities in the National Musenm, was appointed as Smithsonian -
representative at the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists to
be held in Geneva, September 3 to 12, 1894.

Woodcuts, ete—A room on the third floor of the Smithsonian build-
ing has been set apart for the storage of several thousand original
woodcuts, copperplates, and photo-engraved blocks used in illustration
of the publications of the Institution and National Museum. These
blocks, which have now been marked and catalogued and arranged tor
ready reference, are frequently asked for by publishers, and it has been
the policy of the Institution to allow their use for reproduction and
publication at the mere cost of electrotyping.

The expense of handling and storage of the collection of stereotype
plates of the different series of publications has become so great, and
the plates are so rarely called. for, that it has been determined to dis-
continue the preparation of the plates except when their future use can
be distinctly foreseen. From past experience it is thought that the
saving of the original cost of electrotyping will more than meet the
expense of reproducing any papers for which the future may bring
special demands,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Archives.—A room on the fourth floor, about 20 by 22 feet, in the
east wing of the Smithsonian building, has been specially fitted up for
the arrangement of the valuable and somewhat voluminous archives of
the Institution, in a form where they can be most readily consulted.
Twenty-nine cases of shelves and sets of drawers are already largely
filled with volumes of letters received and press copies of letters sent,
with indexes, drawings, diagrams, photographs, and plans of the build-
ings and grounds, original records of proceedings of the Board of
Regents, a full set of the publications of the Institution, copies of
original papers by the Secretaries of the Institution, etc., and space
has been provided for the anticipated wants of several years to come.

Considerable progress has been made in the classification and index-
ing of these papers under the new arrangement.

Assignment of rooms.—A room in the basement of the east wing,
which has been specially fitted up with piers for pendulum experi-
ments, and connected by telegraph, through the Western Union Tele-
graph Company’s office, with the United States Naval Observatory, is
still reserved for the occasional use of the officers of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Toner lecture fund.—In 1872 Dr. J. M. Toner, of Washington, con-
veyed about $3,000 in real and personal property to five trustees, con-
sisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Surgeon-
General of the United States Army, the Surgeon-General of the Navy,
the president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia, insti-
tuting thereby ‘‘The Toner lecture fund.” Ninety per cent of the inter-
est of the fund is to be applied for at least two annual memoirs or essays
by different individuals relative to some branch of medical science, to
be read in the city of Washington, under the name of “The Toner lec-
tures, each of these memoirs or lectures to contain some new truth fully
established by experiment or observation.”

As these lectures are intended to inerease and diffuse knowledge,
several of them have been accepted for publication in the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections. The first of the course was by Dr. J. J.
Woodward, ‘On the structure of cancerous tumors,” and was printed
in 1873. Nine other lectures, by Dr. C. KE. Brown-Sequard, Dr. J. M.
Da Costa, Dr. W. Adams, Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, Dr. G. E. Waring, jr.,
Dr. C. K. Mills, and Dr. Harrison Allen, have since been published by
the Institution, the last having appeared in 1890.

The Hamilton fund.—In 1874 the Institution received $1,000 from the
estate of James Hamilton, esq., of Carlisle, Pa., bequeathed in the fol-
lowing clause of his will: :

I give $1,000 to the Board of Regents ot the Smithsonian Institution,
located at Washington, D. C., to be invested by said Regents in some
safe fund, and the interest to be appropriated biennially by the secre-
taries, either in money or a medal, for such contribution, paper, or lec-
ture on any scientific or useful subject, as said secretaries may approve,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

Under resolution of the Regents the bequest was deposited in the
Treasury on the same terms as the original Smithsonian bequest. In
administering the trust the income has thus far been only partially used,
but allowed to accumulate, the annual interest not being yet sufficient
to bear the expense attendant on the designing and striking of a proper
medal.

Statue of Secretary Bairvd.—-In my report for 1892 I called attention
to a bill introduced in the Senate by Mr. Morrill to provide for the
erection of a bronze statue of Professor Baird in the grounds of the
Institution. The failure of the passage of this bill was a disappoint-
ment to the friends of the Institution, and I sincerely hope that Con-
gress may consent to make an appropriation suitable for such a
memorial.

American Historical Association.—The manuscript of the annual
report of the American Historical Association for the year 1895 was
transmitted to Congress on March 3, 1894. This is the fifth annual
report and consists chiefly of papers read at the Historical Congress at
Chicago in July, 1893. The association has no official relation to the
Institution further than that its annual reports are transmitted to Con-
gress through the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as required
by its incorporation act. The reports are Congressional documents, and
the Institution has no control of their distribution. The association
prints a special edition of the reports at its own expense and distributes
them to the State historical societies and to a number of foreign insti-
tutions and libraries. Under authority granted by Congress in the act
approved January 4, 1889, a storage room has been assigned in the
National Museum for the publications of the association, and in the fire-
proof vaults of the Institution the association has temporarily deposited
a valuable collection of manuscript records pertaining to the early
history of the telegraph.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In previous reports I have felt called upon to insist upon three things
in regard to the Museum: First, that the collections are increasing so
rapidly that unless additional space is provided for their proper admin-
istration and exhibition its efficiency will be greatly impaired; secondly,
that the collections, although growing rapidly in certain directions,
are not increasing as symmetrically and consistently as is manifestly
desirable.

The third point which I desire to emphasize, and to introduce before
the others, has reference to the most undesirable and dangerous neces-
sity of storing collections, which can not, for lack of space, be placed
on exhibition, in the wooden sheds south of the Smithsonian building
and in the basement of the building itself. The storage sheds them-
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

selves are merely temporary structures, neither fireproof nor entirely
safe in other particulars, and these are not only so crowded that they
can hoid no more, but their use has thus been perverted from the pur-
poses for which they were built, i. e., for temporary workshops, and as
packing and unpacking rooms. So great, however, has been the neces-
sity of economizing all available space, and of finding some place for
the storage of specimens preserved in dilute alcohol, that the Museum
has been compelled to use the sheds for inflammable material for which
there is no room elsewhere. In the basement of the building itself
are large alcoholic collections in bottles containing, in the bulk, many
thousands of gallonsof alcohol. These last specimens are not on exhi-
bition, but for want of space are stored immediately under the large
exhibition halls of the Smithsonian building.

Ihave the assurance of experts that a fire communicated to these
rooms would sweep through the entire length of the building, and
although the building itself is fireproof as against any ordinary dan-
ger, it may well be doubted whether any of the collections therein
exhibited can be regarded as safe, if the rooms immediately below
should be exposed to so peculiarly severe a conflagration as would be
caused by the ignition of these large quantities of inflammable material.
Besides this, these wooden sheds, which (as f have already intimated)
are used not only for storerooms, but for workshops, for the preserva-
tion of specimens, and also as sheds for the carpenters, are likewise
liable to cause serious losses, should a fire be kindled in any of them,
and all of these, | repeat, are immediately under the windows of the
Smithsonian building.

In a report recently submitted by one of the inspectors of the Asso-
ciation of Fire Underwriters, in response to a request from me for a
statement as to what insurance rates would be fixed upon the sheds in
question, the Smithsonian building is referred to as an undesirable
risk, owing solely to the presence of all this inflammable material
underneath and in the adjoining sheds, on which latter insurance can
not be placed for less than $40 per $1,000. This is, I am informed,
nearly ten times the rate which would be charged on an ordinary ware-
house. The chief danger, however, is not to the sheds themselves or
their contents, but to the adjoining collections which, without refer-
ence to their scientific interest but merely to their intrinsic value, repre-
sent a very large sum of money.

I repeat that this condition of affairs is one which urgently demands
immediate relief, and with this unreserved expression of my opinion it
seems to me that I have said all that I ean.

Apart trom the dangers incurred by the storage of inflammable
material in and adjoining the Smithsonian building, the Museum is
still confronted with the problem of caring for the numerous collections
which can not be now exhibited, and which, as I have shown, are at

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Di

the present time massed together in sheds and basements. During
the past year the disadvantages to the Museum, which have grown
out of this state of affairs, have been especially apparent. Very many
valuable collections which were brought to Chicago by foreign govern-
ments for exhibition at the World’s Fair wouid have been offered to
the National Museum had not the fact been so generally known that
they could not be properly accommodated in Washington. The few
collections which were acquired by the Museum at the close of the
Exposition, though not of very great bulk, were exceedingly valu-
able, but it must be said that the care of even these has largely
increased the congestion and has been the cause of considerable
additional embarrassment. I may add that everything that it is pos-
sible to do has already been done in the way of rearranging the collec-
tions, with a view to economizing space, and of withdrawing from the
exhibition series objects which could best be spared from the halls.

I now recur to the other topics of importance connected with the
Museum.

The Museum in its present condition is by no means advanta geously
arranged, with regard either to the general interests of the Institution
or to its own importance, owing in part to the fact that some of the col-
lections, under the pressure of overcrowded conditions, now occupy halls
which were intended for quite other purposes, such as the so-called
“Chapel” in the Smithsonian building, or which are unsuitable for the
exhibition of specimens, as is indeed the whole of the lower hall in the
Smithsonian building. Still more unfortunate is it that it is impossi-
ble to install different departments in halls by themselves. In the
Museum building, in many instances, widely distinct collections are of
necessity exhibited in the same hall, and an appearance of confusion
and lack of system, which is much to be deprecated, results.

There is probably no museum in the world in which so small a pro-
portion of the objects worthy of exhibition are visible to the public,
and in which the objects exhibited are crowded together so closely.
This crowding, indeed, has of necessity been carried to such an extent
in many of the halls that there is no space to pass between the cases,
except along a few principal aisles, and the storage rooms already
contain, mounted and labeled for exhibition, enough material to fill
several halls more. It is no exaggeration to say that if there were
another building as large as the present one it could within a very
short time be filled with specimens already here, and that the two
buildings together would seem as fully occupied as do now the buildings
of most other museums.

I earnestly call attention to the proper inference from these state-
ments, which is, not that one building can be made, or is being made,
to do the work of two, but that the one building in question is almost
ceasing to fulfill its proper function, and tends more and more to the
condition of a warehouse, to the detriment of its proper museum uses,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In order to relieve in some slight degree this increasing crowding of
of the halls, I have for some years asked for an appropriation for the
erection of galleries in two or more of the halls in the Museum build-
ing. Such galleries were provided for in the original plan of the
building, and they may be supported in such a manner as not to detract
from the appearance of‘the halls or to interfere with the installation of
the collections. They would afford very material relief in the matter of
exhibition and indirectly in that of storage.

There has been but little effort to increase the bulk of the collections
although, as in previous years, no opportunity has been spared to
increase the completeness and scientific value of the series in several
departments by the addition of special desiderata. Notwithstanding
this fact, the increment from legitimate sources, especially from the
various Departments of the Government, which are required by law to
deposit their accumulations here, has been more than 171,000 specimens.
This total, although double that of the previous year, was far below
that for 1892, when 260,000 specimens were added to the collections,
and not very much greater than that for 1891. The falling off in 1893
was due to the fact that the entire activities of the Museum staff were
devoted to preparations for the World’s Fair, and that a large number
of the correspondents of the Institution, as well as other persons to
whom the annual increase is ordinarily due, were also occupied in the
same way. A certainproportion of the accessions in 1894 were acquired
at the close of the World’s Fair in Chicago. These were almost with-
out exception collections which had been prepared by foreign exhib-
itors with the Smithsonian Institution in mind as the ultimate place of
deposit, and which were sent here at the close of the exposition.

It would have been possible to have obtained an immense number
of specimens on this occasion, but it was deemed proper to refrain from
efforts in this direction, not only because of the considerations just
referred to, but also on account of the desire of the people of Chicago
to retain such objects in their own city as a beginning toward a great
civic museum which might serve as a permanent memorial of the
World’s Columbian Exposition. It has always been the policy of the
Smithsonian Institution to encourage the development of such institu-
tions throughout the United States, and to assist in developing them,
and on this account many proffers of specimens were declined, with the
recommendation that they be offered to the Chicago Museum, and so
far as it was possible to do so, the attention of exhibitors who had col-
lections to dispose of, was directed toward that institution.

A careful approximation of the number of specimens now contained
in the various departments of the Museum shows that the total is about
three and one-quarter millions, almost all of which have been acquired
by gift, in exchange for other specimens, or as an equivalent for publi-
cations.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

Notwithstanding the unsymmetrical growth of the Museum, to which
I have already alluded, there are some very encouraging features in
connection with the increase of the collections. Every day numerous
specimens are contributed by persons who have either visited the
Museum and wish to testify their sympathy with its work, or have
become interested through its publications or by correspondence.

Not a few collections of great value have been given at various times,
such as the George Catlin Indian Gallery, the Lea Collection of Min-
erals and Shells, the Bendire and Ralph Collections of Birds’ Eggs,
the Lacoe Collection of Fossil Plants, and the Collection of the Ameri-
can Institute of Mining Engineers, which latter was transferred at the
close of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.

Since the accessions are almost entirely gifts, it is manifestly impos-
sible that the Museum collections should grow symmetrically. A large
proportion of the annual accessions are not sufficiently valuable to be
‘added to either the study or exhibition series. They are all useful,
however, in connection with the preparation of duplicate sets for dis-
tribution to educational institutions. The distribution of duplicate
material has been continued, and more than twenty-seven thousand
specimens, consisting principally of marine invertebrates, rocks,
minerals, fishes, and casts of prehistoric implements, have been trans-
mitted during the year to other museums, colleges, and normal schools.

The report of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the National
Museum, contains a list by groups of the material distributed, as well
as a geographical statement of the institutions supplied. The same
report also includes a list of the distributions of material made during
the last thirty-five years.

I have found it quite impossible to comply with all the applications
for specimens from universities, colleges, and other museums; nor can
this be done until Congress shall appropriate a sum of money sufficient
to render possible the employment of competent persons who, under
the supervision of the curators, can devote their time to separating
the duplicates in the various collections, and arranging them into sets
for distribution.

I may assume that it is the intention of Congress that the National
Museum of the United States shall be; so far as a museum can be, a
worthy exponent of the natural resources and scientific achievements
of the nation; that it shall be worthy the attention of visitors to the
capital; that it shall perform its proper functions as one of the scien-
tific departments of the Government, and shall aiso promote the
scientific and educational interests of the country at large.

It seems worthy of note, then, that while in almost all the largest
cities of Europe, including London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg,
Vienna, and Florence, the national collections are exhibited in groups
of buildings, here in Washington all similar collections are brought
together under the roofs of the Smithsonian and. National Museum
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

buildings and the Army Medical Museum building. The practice
which has so largely obtained abroad in this respect is for many rea-
sons unfortunate, since much labor is duplicated and collections of
similar character are found growing up in different parts of the same
city. It has, however, its advantages, for where the national collec-
tions are exhibited in a group of museums, each would have its own
space, and there would be employed in each building a staff as large
as that which is here concerned in the administration of the whole.

The National Museum will surely in time at least equal in size and
importance the museums of similar character in any of the national
capitals in Europe. Now is the time for obtaining many kinds of
objects such as it will be impossible to obtain after the country has
become more thoroughly settled, when its natural features and its large
animals will have been destroyed, and its aboriginal inhabitants
deprived of their race characteristics. The time is rapidly approach-
ing when many desirable objects can no longer be obtained, and it is a.
matter of deep regret that valuable collections are being constantly
exported to the Old World museums, which are able to pay for them
prices absolutely beyond the reach of any American institution, and I
repeat my statement of the regrettable fact that not only the American
student must leave America to study some important branches of the
history of native American races, but that the national collections are
relatively falling still further backward in this regard, as compared with
those of many other nations.

It is not advisable, therefore, to check the current of accessions, for
each year a very large number of objects are procured without cost,
which in a few years can not be secured at any price.

The fact that the Museum is embarrassed for lack of space and for
lack of means to secure a more symmetrical development of the collec-
tions,renders it all the more necessary that an efficient staff of curators
should be constantly at work, in order to preserve the material already
here and that which is constantly coming in—this, indeed, being their
first duty. It is also desirable that they should continue, by scientific
study and by publication, to develop the facts which are essential to
the correct understanding of the material, and that the collections
should be arranged and classified in such a manner as to be immedi-
ately accessible to the students of science from all parts of the country
and from abroad, who are constantly visiting Washington for the
purpose of consulting these collections in connection with their own
scientific studies.

The scientific staff is, in my judgment, as effective a one as can possi-
bly be expected under its present condition. It is unfortunate, how-
ever, that so many of the men in charge of the departments should
be volunteers, without compensation, a system which is found advan-
tageous to a limited extent only. With only this aid from specialists,
not even connected with the Museum, it is imposible for the curators
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

and their assistants to perform the urgent work of their departments.
In a degree, this is attributable to the growing frequency of the demand
of educational institutions and the outside public upon the staff for
information and aid. For the safe-keeping of the collections, whose
increase in value has rendered the responsibility of custody much greater,
the force of watchmen should also be increased, while to insure pzoper
cleanliness of the floors and cases, a larger number of laborers and clean-
ers should beemployed than is possible with the appropriation of the pres-
ent year. It is hoped, then, that the appropriation for the preservation:
of collections may be restored to at least the amount at which it stood
when the reduction was made in 1895; though even this sum, as L
have attempted to show in my ietters year by year accompanying the
estimates, is far below what is needed for efficient work.

It is also hoped that the appropriation for furniture and fixtures,
which has been considerably decreased of late years, may be made
larger, since the crowding of the exhibition halls renders it necessary
to reconstruct many old cases and to build new ones in places hitherto
unoccupied, because they have been thought hardly suitable for exhi-
bition, but to the use of which the administration is now driven.

It should be borne in mind also that there is constant expense ior the
repair and renovation of the cases already on hand, which yearly suf-
fer considerable damage from the throngs of visitors. The necessity
for repair and renovation of the building is yearly becoming greater
as it grows older, and there being no special provision to meet such
expense, its cost is of necessity, and by direction of the Treasury author-
ities, paid from the appropriation for ‘cases, furniture, fixtures, and
appliances required for the exhibition and safe-keeping of the collec-
tions.”

The necessity of a more liberal allowance by Congress for printing the
publications of the Museum still increases. The editions are far too
small to admit of placing complete sets in the libraries of each college,
university, scientific school, normal school, and scientific society in the
United States—which I deem of the highest importance—as well as
in every State library, and every local library of importance, as indi-
cated upon the provisional list which was published as Appendix D in
the report of the assistant secretary for 1889. In addition to these
institutions it is desired to send our publications to every national
library abroad, as well as to every great library, university, or academy
of sciences which has a center of scientific activity. In return for
the publications distributed to foreign libraries there is obtained in
exchange for the Museum library a large number of scientific publica-
tions of the greatest value, many of which it is impossible to buy, and
which, if purchasable, would require annually a large expenditure of
money. On account of the present small editions, the Museum is
unfortunately unable to send sets to many scientific institutions from
which it might otherwise obtain many valuable publications for its
library.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Notwithstanding these serious drawbacks, the publications of the
Museum (Proceedings and Bulletin) are distributed to about 2,200
libraries at home and abroad, and more than twice this number receive
the annual report. Specialists are previously supplied with the papers
emanating from the Museum in the form of extras which pertain to
their special studies; and on the mailing lists of the Museum are
probably not less than 3,000 names of persons thus supplied. It is
believed, however, thatin order to comply with all applications, editions
twice as large as at present would be necessary.

The reprinting of some of the earlier volumes of the proceedings
and bulletins is also much to be desired. This would enable the
Museum to complete the sets of its publications in libraries which have
been only partially supplied. The first four volumes of the proceed-
ings and the first sixteen bulletins were reprinted by the Smithsonian
Institution in the Miscellaneous Collections, and in this form only
libraries were supplied. But it eventually became necessary to cease
this method of enlarging the editions, owing to the drain which it
made on the fund of the Smithsonian Institution.

Many libraries, therefore, which were supplied with the volumes thus
reprinted have received none subsequently, and their desiderata are
being carefully noted with a view to supplying them from new editions,
if Congress will appropriate the money necessary to defray the cost of
reprinting. It is also to be hoped that Congress will see fit to restore
the former extent of the edition of the annual report. The Museum,
having no fund for the purchase of specimens, relies upon its reports 1n
’ a large measure for securing accessions to the collections, and already,
on account of the decrease in the edition, it has become necessary to
restrict the mailing list of individuals to those who have done the
Museum some actual service. This restrictive policy will undoubtedly
result in an increased demand for these volumes on members of the
Congressional bodies, for whose personal use a large proportion of the
edition is reserved.

During the past year the Museum has received much valuable assist-
ance and many courtesies at the hands of the Executive Departments
and Bureaus of the Government, for which acknowledgments are hereby
tendered. Several officers of the United States Geological Survey, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commission have served, as
in previous years, in the capacity of honorary curators of the collections.

:

BUREAU’ OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The work of investigating the languages, habits, customs, and class1-
fication of the North American Indians was commenced in 1872 at the
request of Gen. F. A. Walker, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who
had called upon the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for advice
as to some scientific method of grouping the Indians on their reserva-
tions.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a0

The Institution was at that time in possession of a large collection of
vocabularies and manuscripts, as yet unpublished, which were placed
in the hands of Maj. J. W, Powell, who had been previously studying
the tribes of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and who had
himself collected many vocabularies, and he was requested to report
upon their availability for the purpose in question. Major Powell made
a report upon these, showing to what extent they would bear upon the
subject and what was necessary to complete the work. Soon after, the
task was put in his charge, and it has been in progress since that time.

Incarrying on this work it was essential that all the languages of the
United States should be studied. It was not known at that time how
numerous these languages were, but since then a large number of vocab-
ularies have been collected in addition to those previously obtained. It
has been found by Major Powell that these vocabularies may be
grouped into about sixty classes, each representing a distinet family of
languages.

The linguistic investigation has always had for its object to group
the Indians by their affinities or their languages, and to determine what
tribes may be thrown together on reservations. This linguistic study
has been continued to the present time, and constantly, month by
month, and year by year, Major Powell has been in communication with
the Indian Office, furnishing the facts necessary to group Indian tribes
upon reservations.

At the request of Major Powell an appropriation of $20,000 was made
for this work in 1879. The work previously done, including the collee-
tion of vocabularies, was without expense, by missionaries, teachers,
and Army officers, and various students of American ethnology have
been employed without remuneration.

When this new apy 9opriation was made, it was turther asked that the
scope of the research be enlarged so as to embrace the habits and cus-
toms of the Indians, and especially their methods of tribal organiza-
tion and government, and the system of tribal laws in vogue among
the tribes. With that understanding the appropriation was made,
and it was soon afterwards somewhat increased, and has remained the
same amount, about $40,000, except that one year $50,000 was given,
so that Major Powell might retire from the Geological Survey and
devote himself exclusively to the Bureau of Ethnology. Cireum-
stances prevented this at the time, but recently he has severed all con-
nection with the Geological Survey, and is devoting himself entirely to
the ethnological work of the Institution.

The prosecution of investigations relating to the ethnology of*the
American Indians has been carried forward during the year in accord-
ance with law under the efficient control of Maj. J. W. Powell, the
flirector, aided by Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, as executive
officers. These researches of the Bureau of American Ethnology
embrace the subjects of archeology, descriptive ethnology, sociology,
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pictography and sign language, linguistics, mythology, psychology,
and bibliography, and the results obtained during the year have —
never been exceeded in value.

Exploratory work has been carried on in the western part of the
continent by several parties. The most extended exploration was made
in connection with an archeologic survey of portions of New Mexico
and Arizona, where a party examined the valleys of the Little Colorado
and San Juan rivers, as well as Canyon de Cheily and the vicinity of
San Francisco “wash.” In the first-named valley but few relics of
the aborigines were found, and reason was disclosed for believing that
this poverty in relics was due to the high velocity of the stream and
the ruggedness of its channel and valley bottom, by which irrigation
was rendered impracticable. Certain ruins of considerable interest
were, however, located and surveyed. — In Canyon de Chelly more than
60 ruins were examined and ground plans of many of them were made,
while a large series of photographs were taken. The San Juan Valley
also was found rich in remains of structures of the general type found
in Canyon de Chelly and elsewhere in the arid southwestern region.
The relative abundance of ruins, indicating a numerous ancient popu-
lation in Canyon de Chelly and San Juan Valley, is ascribed by
the archeologist to the facility with which the respective rivers may
be controlled for irrigation purposes, and abundant remains of the
irrigation works were found.

Another party spent several months in Indian Territory and Okla-
homa collecting information concerning the habits and customs of the
Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, as well as material objects
illustrating their arts and modes of life. This party was provided
with a graphophone, by means of which a number of aboriginal songs,
both with and without instrumental accompaniment, were recorded.
Other collaborators of the Bureau visited the Indians of northern
Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota and the Kwapa Reservation in
Indian Territory, where they were able to collect valuable material
relating to the habits, customs, social organization, myths, traditions,
and languages of the aborigines.

The archeologic investigations already begun in eastern United
States were continued in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, central Ohio, and Tennessee. The researches in Delaware
Valley, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are considered by the officers
of the Bureau as of special interest in their bearing on questions con-
cerning the arts of the prehistoric peoples of eastern North America,
while the investigations in Virginia are regarded as throwing useful
light on the arts of the aborigines at a time more immediately anterior
to the white invasion. Several reports on different archzologic sub-
jects were prepared for publication during the year. The director
notes with regret that Prof. W. H. Holmes, who has for some years
been in charge of this archeologie work, has severed his connection
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Sil

with the Bureau in order to accept an important position in the Pield
Columbian Museum, at Chicago.

The study of Maya and other Mexican codices and inscriptions has
been continued during the year. Some of the ancient inscriptions
have been deciphered and appear to indicate that the calendar systems
ot the prehistoric people of the Western Hemisphere were elaborate and
of considerable accuracy.

One of the lines of work in the Bureau since its institution is the
systematic arrangement of scattered information relating to the tribal
names and characteristics of the Indians found on this continent by
early explorers and travelers. This work, which involves extended
literary research, together with correspondence and conference with
travelers, missionaries, and others, has been carried forward during the
year, and the data collected are arranged on ecards, forming a tribal
dictionary, which is now quite voluminous. The information relating
to several tribes is now considered sufficiently complete to warrant
publication, and plans have been formulated in the Bureau for printing
the work in a series of bulletins.

Several years ago the Bureau began the task of collecting the rude
rock inscriptions made by the Indians on bowlders, cliffs, canyon walls,
and the sides or roofs of caves in many parts of the country. As shown
in the earlier published reports, these inscriptions are in some cases
connected with symbolic or heraldic paintings on skins or other sub-
stances, and in some degree with the gesture speech or sign language
so commonly employed among certain Indian tribes. The researches
have been continued, chiefly by Colonel Mallery, and are now substan-
tially completed. A monograph on pictography was published during
the year in the tenth annual report of the Director, while an accom-
nanying monograph on gesture speech is nearly ready for publication.
Although the work in sign language is not unique, the information
brought together is voluminous and exact, and the work is regarded
as especially interesting and useful to students of primitive modes of
expression in this and other countries.

One of the chief lines of research in the Bureau relates to the lan-
guages of the aborigines. The collection of texts, vocabularies, and
grammatic material has been continued, and reports on the subject
have been published. It is thought that the primitive languages of
this continent, which are remarkable for number and diversity, give
unexcelled opportunities for the study of linguistic development, and
with this view a large body of more or less compiete manuscript material
has been brought together for purposes of comparative study, as well
as for immediate publication. The linguistic manuscripts are stored in
fireproof vaults, where they are kept accessible to philologists and
other students. It is believed that the manuscript and other linguistic
material in the possession of the Bureau is richer than any other body
of linguistic records of primitive men.
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The American Indians, like other primitive peoples, were largely
influenced in their modes of life and relations among each other and
with the white pioneers by their myths and beliefs. During the past
year, as during preceding years, the collection of typical myths has
heen continued, and progress has been made in the discussion and
arrangement of this material in such manner as to indicate Indian
modes of thought and the motives by which primitive men are actu-
ated. Progress has been made in preparing material relating to this
subject for publication, and several of the reports issued during the
year relate in greater or less measure to Indian mythology.

Phe publication, in the form of a series of bulletins, of a bibliography
of Indian languages has been continued. This work is made as nearly
as possible exhaustive, and the basis of classification is such that
nearly all the more important literature relating to the American
Indians is included. Two bulletins on the subject were published dur-
ing the year, covering respectively the literature pertaining to the
Indians of the Salishan and Wakashan stocks.

During the past year publication has kept pace with research in
the Bureau, and a larger number of pages of ethnologic material have
been put in type than during any previous year in the history of the
organization. Two annual reports and four bulletins were distributed,
while several other reports, monographs, and bulletins were also com.
pleted at the close of the year. Partly by reason of the distribution of
publications, the accessions of the library through gift or exchange
have been unusually rich.

A detailed statement by the director of the Bureau of the work
accomplished under his direction accompanies this report as Appen-
chic ET,

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The Smithsonian Exchange Service was inaugurated nearly half a
century ago, with the object of carrying out one of the purposes of the
founder of the Institution in the diffusion of that knowledge which the
Institution itself helped to create.

ior this purpose it established correspondence with learned men all
over the world, until there is no civilized country or people, however
remote, upon the surface of the planet, so far as is known, where the
Institution is not thus represented. These correspondents have grown
in numbers until at the present time those external to the country alone
number nearly 17,000.

An attempt is made to convey, though imperfectly, in the accompa-
nying map, an idea of the wide distribution of the Institution’s corre-
spondents. In Western Europe and in the eastern part of the United
States but a small percentage of the actual numbers can be separately
shown upon this small scale, and it must therefore be understood the
map is not to be regarded as strictly statistical.
>

So ~—_--

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ao

1 desire here, however, to call attention not so much to the extensicu
ot this system of correspondence as to the existing relations of the
Smithsonian Institution and of the National Government to this
Exchange Service.

The service was, as I have stated, inaugurated nearly a half century
since, and at that time, in the absence of pecuniary means other than
its own little fund, the Institution appealed to the generosity of the
ocean and other large transportation companies to aid it in its unselfish
work of diffusing knowledge by carrying, free, cases containing the
communications between ljearne dsocieties and others in their respec-
tive countries. Foreign governments have always recognized the
peculiar service of the Institution by allowing its exchange cases free
passage through their customs services, and in our own country past
Secretaries of the Treasury have given special instructions to like effect.

In later years a most important change in this respect, and one
whose importance is still increasing, comes from the fact that the facili-
ties of the Exchange Service of the Institution are now made use of
by all branches of the Government service, and the cases carried by
these companies contain chiefly Government publications, such, for
instance, as the Congressional Record and others.

I again call attention to the fact that, though transportation charges
are now paid over many lines, it is only through the continuance of this
peculiar privilege of free freight over other lines, granted originally in
view of quite other conditions! that it is possible for the Institution to
continue the transportation of these documents under the present
appropriations, and efficiency and promptness can not be demanded of
the unpaid service upon which the Institution relies. It has happened,
for instance, that exchange boxes have been delayed seven months at
the seaport awaiting a convenient opportunity of shipment.

Congress has never made appropriations sufficient to meet the entire
expense of the exchange as conducted under the above partly gratuitous
ocean service, even in taking into account the repayment to the Insti-
tution of money advanced to certain Government bureaus for the dis-
tribution of their exchanges and the amounts received from other
bureaus under the ruling of the Regents referred to. An examination
of the records shows that the Institution has in past years expended
of its own fund over $38,000 in the transportation of Congressional
documents alone.”

The office has been laboring under the disadvantage of reduced appro-
priations, and it has been necessary to curtail expenses in every direc-
tion. Toward the close of the year, a deficiency estimate having failed
to receive favorable action, it became necessary to restrict greatly the
shipments and to notify many correspondents that transmissions would

be delayed. A great number of packages for shipment have therefore
accumulated at the end of June, including about 7,000 copies of Con-
gressional documents, and the work has fallen in arrears in other
respects in spite of the special exertions of an insufficient clerical force
to keep it up to date. The funds available for the exchange service
have been also reduced through the inability of some of the Govern-
ment bureaus to meet their proportionate share of the expenses involved
in the transmission of their documents abroad.

Referring to the report of the curator in charge of the exchange
office, it will be seen that over 100 tons of books passed through the
exchange oftice during the fiscal year 1893-94,

The disbursements for the year were $17,584.89, of which $14,474.58
were paid from the appropriation of $14,500 by Congress; $1,729.22
were paid by Government bureaus, and $436.73 by institutions, socie-
ties, and others, leaving a deficiency of $944.36.

The amount which was estimated as necessary for the expense of
the service for the fiscal year 1894-95 was $23,000, a sum which it was
hoped would render it unnecessary to call upon the different Govern-
ment bureaus to reimburse the Institution for a part of the expense
accompanying the transmission of their publications abroad, and would
also give effect to a second treaty entered into at Brussels, and pro-
claimed in 1889, for the immediate exchange of parliamentary docu-
ments between the contracting countries, a treaty which has been
inoperative on the part of the United States on account of the lack of
appropriations for the purpose, Congress having appropriated only
$17,000 as explained elsewhere.

The Smithsonian Institution, through the International Exchange
Service, is brought into close contact with all of the most important
libraries, scientific societies, and institutions of learning in the United
States, and the valuable services it has rendered to them in procuring
foreign publications has always been cordially recognized, but to con-
tinue the service in the condition of efficiency it reached a few years
ago, and to keep pace with the ever-increasing demands upon it, for
the transportation of Government documents, a larger appropriation
is indispensably necessary.

Many and just complaints of delays in the transmission of exchanges
have recently been received, and without adequate means for the sup-
port of the service, these Government documents as well as others, which
are reaching the Institution in increasing numbers, must be allowed to
accumulate untileven room for their reception and storage will be lacking.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

It is now five years since Congress made an appropriation for the
purchase of land for a national zoological park. In this time the land
then purchased has greatly increased in value.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

When Congress was asked to appropriate funds for this park it was
for a simpler and larger purpose than that of the present establishment,
since it was meant to found it rather in national than in local interests
aud largely in view of the fact that many North American animals,
constituting a part of the national wealth and formerly occupying a
large portion of its domain, were threatened with speedy extinction.

The actual extinction of the buffalo, of which herds consisting of
literally millions of individuals roamed the prairies less than a genera-
tion ago, is a subject of knowledge and comment throughout the world.
The beaver, the wapiti, the moose, and many other species useful to
man, which within the memory of those now living had their haunts
and were found in abundance east of the Mississippi, are each year
becoming more and more rare. ‘It was urged upon Congress that
unless steps were speedily taken to preserve the remaining few, and
to bring them under observation, these races must perish, as other
extinet species have done, and that with the disappearance of the last
individual all hope of their renewal would be lost.

The reservation of the Yellowstone National Park as a great game
preserve had been a first and very important movement toward their
preservation, but the very immensity of the reservation threatened to
defeat the plan, for as regards the rarer animals, these naturally kept
to the wilder and more remote regions of the park, where they could
not be protected from the marauding hunter, nor (what is not unimport-
ant) be observed by the naturalist. To retard their extinction (since
so long as a single pair exists and bears offspring the renewal of the
race in countless individuals is at least possible), and to provide oppor-
tunity for their careful study, was the intention of those who first advo-
vocated the establishment of a preserve near Washington large enough
to keep the animals as close to natural conditions as is possible, and
yet not so large but that they could always be protected and under
observation.

The Smithsonian Institution had for some years received frequent
gifts of animals, but no suitable accommodations existed, and it seemed
desirable that some provision should be made for the numerous speci-
mens which came by donations or from Government reservations, and
which were of necessity killed for scientific study or given away to
zoological gardens in other cities.

The act of Congress making provision for a park, entailed responsi-
bilities of a different character from those first contemplated, for instead
of creating a purely national institution for a national purpose, one-half
of the cost of purchase and maintenance was placed upon the tax-
payers of the District. The indirect but quite evident tendency of
this local taxation was to divert a large share of the appropriation to
meet the demands of the local taxpayer, and the Regents of the Simith-
sonian, under whom the park was placed, were directed to “ administer
the park for the advancement of science and the instruction and
recreation of the people.”
36 REPORT GF THE SECRETARY.

When the land was bought it was thought desirable to include as
great a length of Rock Creek as possible with sufficient width of
ground to afford large, retired paddocks.

The park has an area of nearly 167 acres, with an ample supply of
water for lakes, ponds, and inclosures, while the varied and picturesque
character of the banks of the creek affords a variety of exposure and
of effect delightful to all lovers of natural landscape.

There are as yet but four permanent buildings and the animals num-
ber 510, of which 200 are of the larger size.

Comparing this with similar establishments at other capitals, it may
be noted that the Gardens of the Zoological Society, in Regent’s
Park, London, established about 68 years ago, cover about 36 acres of
mere open common, crowded with buildings, and that the magnificent
collection of animals, some 2,500 in number, is housed in a fairly com-
fortable manner.

In Paris the portion of the Jardin des Plantes assigned to animals
is a plat of ground some 17 acres in extent, laid out tastefully, with
all the resources of the landscape gardener, but necessarily crowded
with its 900 animals.

In Berlin the portion of the Thiergarten appropriated for animals
occupies about 60 acres. The buildings are ornamental and substantial.
Fifteen hundred animals are accommodated and, necessarily, much
overcrowded. The landscape features are almost wholly subordinated.

In the United States the principal collections are in Philadelphia,
where the grounds occupy about 40 acres and the collection comprises
881 animals; in Cincinnati, where 36 acres are occupied with about 800
animals ; and in New York, where the city maintains about 700 animals
in Central Park, occupying an area of approximately 10 acres. In none
of these collections are the grounds of sufficient size to give any exten-
Sive range for the animals.

The accompanying diagram shows the-size of the National Zoological
Park compared with those of London, Paris, and Berlin.

I ought not to close these remarks without calling attention to the
evidence of the use of these gardens by the public. Even in their
present inchoate condition they have received as many as 30,000 visit-
itors in a single day. The ground constitutes a park so adjacent to
the city as to be accessible on foot to all, and an expression which has
been used elsewhere may be applied with no less justness here in
describing this park as the lungs of the city.

The natural advantages possessed by the National Zoological Park
are unrivaled. I am not aware that any city has a zoological park of
such extent, so picturesquely situated, and so easily accessible. It
is possible here to provide almost any exposure which animals may
require, to give them large paddocks with abundant shade and seclu-
sion, or to furnish for waterfowl] and other aquatic animals lakes, ponds,
and long reaches of water, where they can live in almost perfect natu-

ral conditions. These desiderata for the animals may be combined with
landscape effects; with stretches of meadow and wooded hillsides,
with overhanging cliffs and running water, with dense shade and sunny
slopes; such as can not fail to prove a lasting advantage and pleasure
to the public.

It is obvious that care should be taken to develop this park along
the lines which the natural conditions so clearly indicate, and that it
would be a mistake to mar its beauty by huddling the buildings together,
and by crowding the animals into small and uncomfortable quarters.

Having always in mind that the original object of the park was the
preservation of American animals, it is intended to make that a princi-
pal matter of consideration; yet it must be remembered that even in
the interest of North American zoology, comparative studies can not
be properly carried on without a certain proportion of animals belong-
ing to the Old World. It is to be expected, therefore, that a certain
number of foreign animals will be included in the collection when they
can be advantageously obtained.

The Yellowstone National Park has always been regarded as an
important preserve, from which supplies could be drawn for the
National Zoological Park. Its distance and the cost of transportation
have prevented its use to so great an extent as could be wished;
yet there have been received from it during the year a total of 28
animals, among which were a fine herd of young elk. In order to
properly utilize the resources of the Yellowstone Park, it will probably
be necessary to construct there a corral of considerable extent, into
which wild animals can be driven, inclosed, fed, and, at the proper
time, secured for shipment. Projects for a structure of this kind have
been considered, but the lack of funds has thus far prevented their
accomplishment.

It seems necessary to again refer to the desirability of changing the
appropriation act so as to permit the occasional purchase of animals.
Several times during the past year rare native animals have been offered
for sale at extremely low prices—indeed, for less than the cost of trans-
portation from the regions where they were obtained. Among such
are the Rocky Mountain Goat and the Mountain Sheep. This goat has
never before been seen in captivity, as far as I am aware, and the
sheep is extremely rare.

In October, 1893, the proprietor of the large menagerie which in 1890
presented the park with an elephant, offered to make a temporary deposit
of a number of animals without charge. In consideration of the words
of the fundamental act, “For the instruction and recreation of the
people,” it was decided to accept the offer, such arrangements being
customary in zoological gardens. It was stipulated that any animals
born should become the property of the United States. The experiment
was satisfactory, affording to the public an opportunity of seeing and
studying at leisure, a number of interesting specimens, such as the park
could not hope to possess for many years to come.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The appropriation made for the park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1894, was in the following terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water sup-
ply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading, planting, and otherwise
improving the grounds, erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures
for the animals, and for administrative purposes, care, subsistence, and
transportation of animals, including salaries and compensation of ail
necessary employees, and general incidental expenses not otherwise
provided for, fifty thousand dollars, one-half of which sum shall be paid
from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from
the Treasury of the United States; and a report in detail of the expenses
of the National Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the begin-
ning of each regular session.

By far the greater portion of this appropriation was expended for
food for the maintenance of the animals, and for keeping in proper care
and condition the buildings and accessories. The sum remaining,
being insufficient for new work of any great extent, has been expended
in necessary improvements, and in building roads and paths to the
different buildings and shelters.

The bridge near the Quarry-Road entrance has been somewhat
improved by the addition of footways and copings. This structure is,
however, far from satisfactory, having been built from a limited appro-
priation ata time when it was absolutely necessary to cross the stream
to reach the central portion of the park.

Certain questions involving the access of the public to the park, are
still pending and are connected with the plan of the suburban roads
now under consideration by the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia. The street railways are by no means convenient, as the
Fourteenth street line is over half a mile distant from the park, and the
Rock Creek Railway, although passing by the western gate of the park,
delivers its passengers at a distance almost as great from the buildings
where the animals are kept. The plan for the extension of the streets
of the District, includes a carriage road outside the park from the
point where the Adams Mill Road leaves it to Kennesaw Avenue.
When this is once established the strip of ground between it and
the park boundary should be purchased and added to the park.
This will be of advantage in many ways, first, for seclusion by pre-
venting private property from abutting upon the park and second, as
making more secure the eliff in the vicinity of the bear pits, which has
always been a menace and a serious disadvantage because of its prox-
imity to the park line, and the impossibility of properly treating it.

Further steps will probably be soon taken toward establishing
entrances at the southern end of the park. If this be done it will prob-
ably be necessary to improve the old Adams Mill Road, and to build
a second bridge crossing from the promontory where the office now
stands to the meadow near the animal house.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oo

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Iam gratified to state that the researches conducted here have con-
tinued to fulfill the expectations held out in previous reports. I believe
that the results attained may be stated to be the most important which
have ever been reached in regard to that region of the spectrum of
which so little is known, and which includes the greater portion of all
those energies of the sun which, through its heat, affect climate and
the crops, and are thus related not only to questions of abstract interest
but to utilities of national importance. The interest aroused by these
researches among men of science has been very gratifying, and it is
hoped that it may be found that no money granted by the Government
for scientific investigation has been more profitably employed than this,
even in the restricted point of view of the merely utilitarian advantages
which may be hoped from it.

For a more particular account of these recent results I refer to the
report of the Observatory.

Mr. kh. C. Child was appointed aid in the Observatory on September
1, 1893, and Mr. F. EK. Fowle, jr., as photographer, on June 1, 1894.
Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth resigned the position of senior assistant in
the Observatory on June 1, 1894.

Respectfully subinitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: In accordance with the provision of Congress, the Report of the National
Museum is published as the second volume of the Smithsonian Report. I shall here
refer briefly to only a few of the most important features of the operations of the
Museum during the year.

Accessions.—More than 171,000 specimens have been added to the collections. This
is more than double the total for last year, a gratifying result, 1n view of the fact
that very little direct effort was made to increase the collections.

Important collections have been received, as in past years, from the Geological
Survey, the Fish Commission, the Bureau of Ethnology, and other Bureaus of the
Government. Several valuable collections have been received from private sources,
and some very interesting material was presented by representatives of foreign
Governments to the National Museum at the close of the World’s Columbian
Exposition.

The detailed report for the year will contain a statistical statement showing the
number of specimens added during the year to each department, and for each year
since the opening of the Museum building.

The scientific staf.—The scientific staff is substantially the same as last year. A
few changes and additions have occurred in the curatorships. Having, as Assistant
Secretary, resumed the active direction of the affairs of the Museum, the designation
of Mr. True was on May 9 changed from Curator-in-charge to Executive Curator,
with special duties of administration. The Executive Curator may at times be called
upon totake general charge inmy absence. On July 15, Dr. C. H. White, U.S. N., was
recalled from his custodianship of the materia medica collections by the Secretary of
the Navy. Dr. C. U. Gravatt was detailed in his place, and served until January 22,
when he was relieved by Dr. R. A. Marmion, who was succeeded on June 15 by Medical
Inspector Daniel McMurtrie, the present incumbent. Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the
United States Geological Survey, was on May 7 appointed honorary aid in the Depart-
ment of Paleozoic Fosils. Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the Department of Agriculture, was
on March 17 appointed honorary curator of the helminthological collections.

Dr. Frank Baker resigned his position as honorary curator of the Department of
Comparative Anatomy in order to devote his entire time to his duties as Superin-
tendent of the National Zoological Park, and Mr. Frederick A. Lucas, assistant
curator of that department, was on November 21 appointed curator. Dr. Baker is
now recognized as associate curator. On January 1 Mr. Wirt Tassin was appointed
assistant curator in the Department of Minerals, filling the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Mr. William 8. Yeates.

Distribution of specimens.—F ollowing the custom of previous years, the transmission
of duplicate specimens to educational establishments has been continued, and it is

41
o
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

gratifying to note that, in comparison with last year, more than double the number
of specimens has been thus distributed. Of the 27,168 specimens thus disposed of, a
large proportion represent invertebrate forms of marine life. Several sets of rocks
and ores, minerals, and casts of prehistoric objects, as well as a few special collec-
tions of insects, fishes, birds, mollusks, and other material, were included. In addi-
tion, 1,448 specimens were lent to investigators for special study.

It has for many years been the intention of the Museum to make up a number of
duplicate sets in all the departments of the Museum, to be used in supplying educa-
tional institutions. Applications for specimens are received almest every day.
That valuable service could be rendered to colleges and schools in this way does not
admit of doubt, but it is impossible to carry out such a plan until the curators can
be supplied with the services of competent assistants to relieve them of the work of
sorting out the duplicates and arranging them into sets for distribution. And this
can not be arranged until Congress sees fit to make a large increase in the Museum
appropriation.

In order to give an idea of the extent to which this branch of the Museum work
has been carried on, even with the very limited facilities now at hand, it may be
stated that since 1871 about 370,000 specimens have thus been distributed.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building during the
year was 103,910, and to the Museum building 195,748.

Publications.—The report of the Museum for 1891 was published during the year,
and also, in the form of separates, a limited edition of each paper in the appendix.
The report for 1892 is nearly ready for delivery, and the separate editions of the
papers in the appevlix have already been issued. Volumes 15 and 16 of the Pro-
ceedings have appeared in bound form, and a few papers included in volume 17 have
been published as separates. Of the Bulletin, the following numbers have been
published: No. 43, A Monograph of the Bats of North America, by Harrison Allen,
M. D.; No. 44, Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Superfamily Noctuids found in
Boreal America, by John B. Smith; No. 45, The Myriapoda of North America, by
Charles Harvey Bollman; No, 46, Monograph of the North American Proctotrypide,
by William H. Ashmead.

Special Bulletin No. 2, Oceanic Ichthyology, by the writer and Tarleton H. Bean,
isin type. This work constitutes a monograph of the deep-sea and pelagic fishes
of the world. The material for No. 5 of this series is in course of preparation by
Maj. Charles Bendire. It will be a continuation of the subject of No. 1, Life
Histories of North American Birds, and will treat of the cuckoos, woodpeckers,
goat suckers, swifts, humming birds, flycatchers, horned larks, crows, jays, mag-
pies, blackbirds, orioles, and grackles.

I have elsewhere referred to the pressing necessity of an increase in the appropria-
tion for printing.

Specimens transmitted to the Museum for identification.—During the year 478 lots of
specimens were received fordetermination. Very little of this material can be advan-
tageously incorporated with the collections, and therefore the Museum receives but
little actual gain from this work, which occupies a large proportion of the time of
several of the curators, notably inthe Department of Geology. Requests for exami-
nation and report are, however, invariably complied with. Quantitative analyses,
however, can not be undertaken.

Foreign exchanges.—A number of exchanges have been affected with museums and
individuals in different parts of the world, and the National Museum has in this
manner acquired much valuable material. Among the institutions with which
these transactions have proved most advantageous to the Museum are the Australian
Museum, Sydney; Queensland Museum; Technological Museum of New South Wales;
National Museum of Costa Rica; Museum of Natural History, Paris; Imperial Royal
Museum of Vienna,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

Explorations.—The further explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott, in Kashmir,
India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands in the Indian Ocean, have resulted in addi-
tional important collections for the Museum. Several papers describing his collec-
tions have been published in the Proceedings of the National Museum.

Prof. O. F. Cook, of Huntington, N. Y., who is now traveling in Liberia, has
transmitted a large collection of ethnological objects and natural history specimens
from that country. ;

The researches in Finland of Hon, John M. Crawford, United States consul-general
at St.Petersburg, Russia, have resulted in the transmission of a most valuable col-
lection of ethnological objects. The collection was accompanied by a descriptive
list, minutely setting forth their uses.

Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., of Washington City, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson, of the
National Museum, during an exploring trip in the West Indies obtained for the
Museum a collection of Miocene marl and land shells.

The Intercontinental Railway Commission has presented to the Museum a large
collection of natural history specimens, obtained in Central America by Dr. W. C.
Shannon, U.S. A.

Mr. Mark B. Kerr, of New York City, has, in connection with his explorations in
Keuador, forwarded an interesting collection of natural history specimens from that
country.

A collection of reptiles and fishes, obtained by Dr. Einar Lénnberg, of Upsala,
Sweden, while engaged in an exploration of the coast of Florida, has been added to
the Museum collections. :

Large and varied collections have resulted from the explorations of Dr. Edgar A.
Mearns, U.S. A., who is still engaged in the work of the International Boundary
Commission.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: Ethnologie researches have been carried forward during the year in accord-
ance with act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating to
the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.”

The primary classification of the work is topical, and the researches pertaining
to each subject are divided between field studies and office work as circumstances
require. The chief lines of activity relate to (1) archeology, (2) descriptive eth-
nology, (3) sociology, (4) pictography and sign language, (5) linguistics, (6) myth-
ology, (7) psychology, and (8) bibliography, together with (9) publication, and the
ancillary exploratory and miscellaneous work.

The classification of the work is more definite than the assignment of the person-
nel, since circumstances from time to time require the concentration of a large part
of the energies of the Bureau on one or a few subjects, and thus special assignments
are made with advantage to the work and, it is believed, without injury, and indeed
commonly with benefit, to the workers.

EXPLORATION.

The most extended exploratory work of the year was that of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff
in connection with archeologie surveys in the Pueblo country of New Mexico and
Arizona. He left Washington early in July, 1893, and, outfitting at Holbrook, Ariz.,
proceeded to the Hopi villages of Tusayan, and toward the end of August to the
valley of the Little Colorado, which he explored in some detail. Contrary te
expectations this region was found to be poor in relics of the aborigines; only a few
small and unimportant ruins are scattered over the valley, and the sites were appar-
ently occupied for short periods only. It is noteworthy, that according to Hopi
tradition, it was along a valley tributary to the Little Colorado that the large tim-
bers used in the construction of the Spanish churches and mission buildings prior to
1680 were transported on the backs of Indians from San Francisco Mountains, nearly
100 miles away, and that this tradition appears to find corroboration in Mr. Minde-
leff’s observation of a party of Tusayan Indians transporting poles from the foot-
hills of the same mountains over the same route by the use of burros. The reason
for the dearth of ruins gradually became apparent as the explorations were con-
tinued; the topography about the Little Colorado and the character of the stream
itseif are such that its waters could not be controlled for purposes of irrigation by
any means at the command of ancient pueblo builders; even modern engineering
skill has thus far failed to control the stream, although many efforts in this direction
have been made.

Only at intervals are there flood plain lands suitable for primitive cultivation
and within easy reach of irrigation devices, and in such placesruins are usualiy found.
This is notably the case near the old Sunset crossing, where, perched on the hills
overlooking the flood plain, can be seen the ruins of ten or more villages, the largest
of which would have accommodated a population of 200. The ground plan of this
village shows a number of rectangular rooms, the whole bearing a strong resem-
blance to the plan of ruins found near the Tusayan villages. Tradition recites that

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

this village (or possibly a neighboring one) was called Homalobi, and was occupied
by the Water gens, the last to reach Tusayan. The indications are that the period
of occupancy was short.

Mr. Mindeleff found the river at Mormon crossing or ‘‘ the Crossing of the Fathers”
too high for fording, and his party proceeded with difficulty along the northern
bank to the old Sunset crossing near Winslow. After fording at this point, the
yarty proceeded to Camp Verde, crossing the Mogollon Mountains by way of Sunset
and Chavez passes. At Camp Verde an old field outfit was taken up and the party
returned by way of Flagstaff, reaching Little Colorado River at the mouth of San
Francisco wash. This region was formerly a favorite hunting ground of the
Tusayan, large parties leaving the villages to hunt antelope and other game so
recently as ten years ago; but the game has nearly disappeared, and the annual
hunting parties of the Tusayan Indians are now but amemory. From San Francisco
wash the party followed the southern branch of the river to Winslow, and the
northern side thence to Holbrook.

Leaving Holbrook early in October, Mr. Mindeleff proceeded northward toward
Canyon de Chelly. Advantage was taken of the opportunity to examine the local-
ity of a supposed ruin some 35 miles north of Holbrook, concerning which rumors
have been current for several years, and the supposed ruin was found to be a nat-
ural dike rising from the summit of a low hill as a wall of black basalt over 100
feet long, generally less than 2 feet thick, and sometimes 18 feet high. Near its
western end the remains of a habitation consisting of one or two rooms was found,
the ground being strewn with potsherds. So striking is this dike that the Navajo
guide insisted, even when standing before it, that it is artificial; yet examination
leaves no doubt as to its real character. Canyon de Chelly was reached about the
middle of October, and detailed examination of its cliff ruins was begun at once and
continued nearly to the end of December. More than sixty ruins were examined, and -
ground plans of many of them were made and a large series of photographs were
taken. The results of this survey, which is summarized elsewhere, are of great
interest.

Leaving Canyon.de Chelly in December, the party proceeded by way of Pueblo
Colorado and Fort Defiance, to San Juan River, where it was planned to winter. In
crossing Tunicha Mountains a snowstorm of unprecedented severity for the season
was encountered, and the party missed the trail and for a time were lost; among other
accidents a wagon was overturned in such manner that Mr. Mindeleff was caught
beneath it and his shoulder dislocated, whereby he was disabled for some months.
Fortunately the expedition was rescued by a party of ranchmen from Fort Defi-
ance, organized for the purpose when the severity of the storm was realized. The
success of the expedition and even the preservation of the lives of its members must
be ascribed largely to the humanity which inspired the rescue party and the energy
with which they pushed into the mountains, rendered almost impassable by the
snow and wind. The expcdition reached San Juan River a few days later, and soon
after disbanded. ;

When able to resume work Mr. Mindeleff began a reconnoissance of San Juan
Valley, not completed at the end of the fiscal year. This district was found rich in
ruins, mainly of a type resembling the oldest ruins in Canyon de Chelly. San Juan
Valley is terraced, and the river itself is a swift mountain stream, and conditions
are thus favorable for irrigation by primitive as well as civilized men. The detailed
surveys here were accordingly extended and resulted in substantial contributions to
the archeology of southwestern United States.

Mr. James Mooney spent some months, beginning with July, on the Kiowa Reser-
vation in Indian Territory, and subsequently visited the Arapahoe and Cheyenne
Indians for the purpose of collecting information concerning habits and customs as
well as beliefs and languages. He was provided with a graphophone, by means of
which he was able to record a number of aboriginal songs, both with and without
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

instrumental accompaniments, and in single voice effects as well asin chorus. Alto-
gether he spent five months in field work, of which part was exploratory.

Col. Garrick Mallery spent the greater part of the month of September among the
Indians of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota for the purpose of -veri-
fying and correcting notes obtained through correspondence.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman spent July and August and a portion of September among the
Ottawa Indians near Petoskey, Mich., the Ojibwa Indians at La Pointe Reservation,
Wis., and the Menomoni Indians at Keshena in the same State, and among the several
tribes information pertaining to their customs and beliefs was obtained.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey spent the month of January, 1894, on the Kwapa Reservation
in Indian Territory, investigating the social organization of the tribe and recording
their myths and traditions.

During the earlier part of the year the Director took advantage of opportunities
growing out of work in connection with the Geolegical Survey on the Pacific Coast to
visit several Indian tribes and to continue his researches relating to their habits,
myths, and languages.

ARCH AOLOGY.

Mr. W. H. Holmes was occupied throughout the year in arch:eologic researches,
’ chiefly in eastern United States. The first half of July was spent in organizing the
work of the year, and later he proceeded to different points in Delaware Valley for
the purpose of continuing studies of ancient quarries and quarry shops. A new
quarry shop was discovered on Delaware River, 15 miles above Trenton, yielding
rejects corresponding precisely with the objects so abundantly found in the gravels
on which the city of Trenton is built, and which were formerly classed as paleoliths.
Subsequently he visited a number of interesting localities in Ohio, giving especial
attention to the gravels at Newcomerstown, in or apparently in which an artificially
shaped stone has been found, this being the only case now strongly held to indicate
the existence of man during the Glacial period in this country.

In October he visited an island in Potomac River, near Point of Rocks, flooded by
arecent freshet in such manner as to lay bare an ancient village and aboriginal
workshop. This workshop proved of considerable interest in that here unmistak-
able indication was found for the first time that blocks of stone were used as anvils
in the production of certain classes of stone implements and weapons.

During February he directed the exploitation, by Mr. William Dinwiddie, of an
aboriginal steatite quarry near Clifton, Va. This quarry was found especially
instructive by reason of its large size, the great number of partly completed utensils
found within the opening and in the neighboring dump heap, and in the excellence
of its preservation,

In April Mr. Holmes, accompanied by Mr. McGee, repaired to an interesting site
near the mouth of Pass Creek, not far from Luray, Va., for the purpose of collect-
ing additional data relating to a noteworthy series of stone art products, to which
attention was called during the preceding fiscal year by Mr. Gerard Fowke.

A considerable additional collection was made and an aboriginal cemetery was
discovered in a neighboring field, and from it a typical collection of mortuary pot-
tery was taken. The stone art products in this locality are of exceptional interest,
as the “turtleback” forms are rejects from the manufacture of celts. The rejects
hitherto studied by Mr. Holmes represent, exclusively or predominantly, narrow-
pointed instruments such as spear points or arrow heads, while those found at the
mouth of Pass Creek represent predominantly the manufacture of broad and thin
pointed objects. <A sufficiently complete series of rejects and nearly completed .
forms to illustrate all stages in manufacturing was brought together.

Mr. McGee extended the observations from this locality up Pass Creek with the
purpose of discovering the original source of the stream pebbles and cobbles used by
the primitive artisans, and was rewarded by finding, well toward the head waters
of the stream, a large mass of intrusive rock, from which the pebbles were originally
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

derived. This part of the study also proved of exceptional interest, as it indicated
the delicacy with which the Indian manutacturer adjusted himself to his environ-
ment; in situ the rock is too massive and obdurate for working by primitive meth-
ods; in the upper reaches of the stream the bowlders derived from parent ledges are
too large for reduction without the use of metal; below the confluence of Pass
Creek with the Hawksbill the pebbles are too small and too scant for profitable
working; while just above the confluence, at the site discovered by Mr. Fowke, the
pebbles are at the same time of suitable size and sufficiently abundant for easy
working by primitive methods—in short, the best and, indeed, the only feasible site
for the aboriginal factory was that selected for the purpose. The material is a
peculiarly tough and strong crystalline rock, which flakes fairly well oooe is at the
same time adapted to battering and grinding.

During the first three months of the year Mr. Gerard Fowke was occupied, under
Mr. Holmes’s general instructions but under the immediate direction of the ethnolo-
gist in charge, in making collections from the little known but highly interesting
interior shell mounds in the valley of Tennessee River. This work yielded excellent
results, particularly in the form of material collected for the enrichment of the National
Museum. The collections were duly cleaned, prepared, and tabulated, and trans-
ferred to the Museum by Mr. Henry Walther.

Mr. William Dinwiddie, under Mr. Holmes’s immediate direction, spent the greater
part of the months of July, August, and September in archeologic reconnoissance
along the shores and tributaries of Chesapeake Bay with the object of demarking
more exactly by art products the territory belonging respectively to the different
peoples. His work also yielded abundant collections for the enrichment of the
National Museum for the benefit of contemporary and future students.

During February and March, as already noted, Mr. Dinwiddie was occupied in
investigating the aboriginal steatite quarry at Clifton, Va. The quarry was
cleared and its walls and floors were found to yield numerous and characteristic
traces of primitive workmanship; a rich collection of broken and partially finished
utensils was made; a good series of photographs, showing with unprecedented aceu-
racy the details of the quarrying and manufacturing operations, was taken; a num-
ber of the tools used in the work were found, while the entire collection has been
brought together for study and preservation in the National Museum. ‘The more
general results of the investigation of this quarry have been incorporated in
reports by Mr. Holmes, while a detailed paper on the subject is in preparation by Mr.
Dinwiddie.

The results of the work by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff in New Mexico and Arizona are
of much importance. The examination of over sixty ruins in Canyon de Chelly veri-
fies the conclusion previously reached by the same investigator that the cliff dwell-
ings here were primarily farming outlooks, and that the home villages were commonly
located on wholly indefensible sites on the ec: vunyon bottom. It was found that the ruins
are divisible into several groups, apparently representing a chronologic sequence, In
the later ruins highly suggestive details are found illustrating the gradual assimila-
tion of introduced or accultural ideas. Among other results there was obtained a
series of drawings and photographs showing the development of chimney structure
from the first crude attempts to imitate a form known only from casual observation
and description to a more finished structure. though the most finished product was
far from perfect, while the first attempts were exceedingly crude. Mr. Mindeleft
was led to conclude that the foreign ideas exemplified in the chimneys and other
structures were introduced in the architecture of Canyon de Chelly at a late period
of the occupancy of the territory, probably only a few decades before its abandon-
ment. Other details, such as the constructive use of adobe, were traced through the
various stages of development in the same way; and some ruins were found in which
the old and the new ideas find expression side by side in such manner as to indicate
that the village was occupied before the introduction of the foreign ideas, and that
the occupancy continued until after the ideas were definitely crystallized.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

One interesting group or series of ancient ruins was found, which had apparentiy
been overlooked by previous visitors. They occur in the upper part of the canyon
and »re nearly obliterated. The structures were always located on sites deter-
mined wholly by agricultural necessity and methods without reference to defensive
ends. Mr. Mindeleff is of opinion that these are the oldest ruins in the canyon
belonging to the initial period of occupancy, which extended over many decades.
Close attention was given also to a number of large ruins situated in the canyon
bottom without reference to defense, also overlooked by previous explorers. These
differ from the preceding type and are in some respects the most important ruins of
the canyon. They apparently represent the home pueblos occupied contemporane-
ously with the cliff dwellings, and bore the same relation to the latter that Zuni
bears to Nutria, Pescado, and Ojo Caliente, or that Oraibi bears to Moen Kopi. The
cliff dwellings were apparently occupied as a rule only during the summer months,
the occupants resorting to the pueblos during the winter. Thus the cliff dwellings
appear to represent a phase rather than a chronologic epoch in the history of the
pueblo builders.

Although the researches are not yet completed, Mr. Mindeleff is of opinion that
while some of the ruins may be precolumbian others were undoubtedly occupied in
the seventeenth century, and that the occupancy was probably continuous as regards
the district, though probably not continuous as regards particular tribes or sub-
tribes. A general result of the study was the classification of the various types of
ruins, ina chronologic order, in such manner that the history of the canyon from
the earliest occupancy up to the recent advent of English-speaking settlers is
clearly indicated. In combining the data acquired in Canyon De Chelly with those
obtained from Rio Verde during previous years, Mr. Mindeleff finds reason for the
conclusion that the ruins of the former district represent the first settlements in the
San Juan country, and that further developments will be found in the tributary
valleys, and also that the large communal buildings on the tributaries of the San
Juan, representing the highest architectural art attained by the pueblo builders,
will prove to be the ultimate form of the primitive village of this district.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas completed the revision of proofs of text and
illustrations of his report on mound explorations, and the work was put through the
press as the body of the twelfth annual report. The document comprises much
information relating to the Indian mounds of the Mississippi Valley and eastern
United States, and if seems reasonable to hope that the monograph may come to be
regarded as a standard source of information on the subject. Subsequently Dr.
Thomas gave special attention to the hieroglyphs and codices of the Maya—the
ancient inhabitants of Yucatan. One of the results of the work is the demonstration
that the time system recorded in the Dresden codex is precisely the same as that men-
tioned by the early Spanish authors, except that the years begin with what are con-
sidered the last instead of the first of the four-year series. It is also shown that this
brings the calendar of the Dresden codex into harmony with the calendars recorded
at Palenque, Lorillard City, and Tikal. A portion of the results of Dr. Thomas’s
work on this subject is published in one of the bulletins of the Bureau, a brochure
of 64 pages, entitled ‘‘The Maya Year.” Other results are incorporated in a bulletin
on the origin and significance of the calendric terms, which is not yet completed.

During the year Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson, of Philadelphia, was occupied in arche-
ologic researches, chiefly in Guatemala and eastern Mexico, under the provision of
the De Laincel fund and under the general supervision of the Director of the Bureau.
Some of the resultsof his interesting researches have been made public through
various scientific journals.

Specially noteworthy among the results of the archeologic work in the Bureau
during the current year are the monographs by Mr. Holmes on ancient pottery of
eastern United States and stone art of eastern United States. Both embrace the
results of researches extending over many years; both are elaborately illustrated

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

from material preserved in the National Museum; both represent the mature conclu-
sions of an able and carefully trained archwologist. The classification and interpre-
tation adopted by Mr. Holmes are primarily indigenous, though his comparative
studies have extended over the archeologic literature of the world, and it is believed
that his conclusions will form a firm basis for those branches of archeology to which
his work relates. To him science is indebted for a consistent method of interpret-
ing primitive art products through study of the arts of primitive peoples cognate
to those whose relics have come down to us trom prehistoric times. It was with
ereat regret that the Director accepted his resignation.from the Bureau toward the
end of the fiscal year, in order that he might transfer his labors to the Field Colum-
bian Museum.
DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

An important line of work in the Bureau for some years past has been the collec-
tion and systematic arrangement of tribal names and characteristics, with brief
description of the habits, customs, arts, beliefs, and institutions of the aborigines.
The information thus collected has been recorded on cards under the head of Tribal
Synonymy.

During the last year Mr. F. W. Hodge devoted several months to the descriptive
ethnology of several southwestern families, the Piman, Tanoan, Keresan, and Zunian
stocks receiving chief attention. Advantage was taken of the presence in Wash-
ington of Mr. Carl Lumholtz, who has spent several seasons among the tribes of
Chihuahua, to obtain valuable information relating to the Tarahumar, Tepehuan,
and Tubar Indians for use in the synongmy of the Piman stock. Mr. Hodge’s lit-
erary research during the year has enabled him satisfactorily “to identify the
obscurely recorded Jumano of the early Spanish explorers with the Comanche of
more recent date. In connection with the condensed descriptions contained in the
systematic work, Mr. Hodge has made progress in the preparation of a bibliography
of the Pueblo Indians, designed to serve as a basis for further research concerning
this interesting portion of our aboriginal population.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey made a number of important additions to the portion of the
tribal synonymy relating to the Siouan tribes, and Mr. James Mooney devoted some
time to classifying and extending the material already obtained relating to the
Cherokee Indians. Mr. Albert S. Gatschet also made contributions to this work.

Although the collection of material for the general descriptive ethnology of the
tribal synonymy of the American Indians was commenced some years since, and
although a large body of information has been collected and arranged on cards for
office use, publication has not yet been undertaken, partly by reason of the great
volume of the material, partly because the work is of such character as not soon to be
completed, since each new investigation yields additional information; but within
the past five years the records have been found so useful, and the demand for
information contained therein so extensive, that a plan for publication has been
formulated.

In accordance with this plan the material will be arranged by linguistic stocks and
published in bulletin form in the order of completion, each bulletin comprising a
stock. In addition to the usual pagination the bulletins devoted to the subject will
be consecutively paged (at bottom) for the series, and it is proposed to complete the
series by a bulletin so arranged as to form at the same time an index to the whole
and an abbreviated dictionary of the tribal and other names used by the American
Indians. In accordance with this plan the materials pertaining to a number of the
stocks have been made ready for the press, with the exception of brief introductions
which remain to be written.

During the first half of the fiscal year Dr. W. J. Hoffman continued the investi-
gation of the Menomoni and related Indians in field and office and prepared an
elaborate memoir, entitled ‘‘The Menomoni Indians,” which has been submitted for
publication in the fourteenth annual report. This tribe, located in northeastern

SM 94——4
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

Wisconsin, has long been known in a general way, but has received little scientific
study. Dr. Hoffman’s memoir embraces a history of the tribe from their discovery
by Nicollet in 1634 to the present day, including the several treaties made with the
Federal Government; it includes also the genealogies of the two rival lines of hered-
itary chiefs, together with an exposition of the ceremonials of the several cult soci-
eties, and of the mythology, industries, arts, and manufactures of the tribe.

SOCIOLOGY.

From time to time during the year the Director found opportunity for collecting
additional information relating to the institutions of the American Indians and for
the elaboration of material collected during previous years. Mr. McGee also made
progress in the arrangement of material pertaining to this subject gathered by
various collaborators. Mr. James Mooney spent several months in the field collect-
ing information relating to the Kiowa, Caddo, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, of
which a large part is sociologic. In addition he prepared during the year a memoir
onthe Siouan Tribes of the East, which has been sent to press as one of the series of
bulletins of the Bureau. In this paper the relations and movements of the tribes
recorded by early explorers and settlers of eastern United States are analyzed and,
after comparative study for the purpose of combining the various consistent records
and eliminating the uncertainties due to vague geographic and ethnographic records,
grouped as a consistent body of information relating to the aboriginal land-holders
of cisappalachian United States. The memoir represents much patient research
among early maps and throughout the earliest literature of the United States. It
is enriched by synonymy of the various tribes of the district, and incidentally con-
siderable information relating to the organization and social institutions of these
tribes is incorporated.

PICTOGRAPHY AND SIGN LANGUAGE,

Theearlier part of the year was spent by Col. Garrick Mallery in revising the
proots of his monograph on Picture Writing of the American Indians, which has
since been published in the tenth annual report of the Bureau. Some years were
devoted by Colonel Mallery to the collection of information on this subject and the
subject of sign language and gesture specch among the aborigines, and this mono-
graph represents the product of labors in the interesting line of research to which it
appertains. By reason of the invasion of white men, many of the primitive customs
of the Indians have been modified and some have been lost; and in few directions
is the modification more complete than in that of inseribing records on rocks and
other surfaces; and it has been the purpose to render this work as complete an expo-
sition of the crude graphic art of the American Indian as it is possible to make at
this time. Itis believed that the work will be found practically exhaustive and a
standard source of information. During the remaining portion of the year Colonel
Mallery has been engaged in the preparation of acompanion monograph on the sign-
language of the American Indians. The material for this work is even more evanes-
cent than that drawn on in the preparation of the preceding work; but the author’s
studies have extended over many years and a large part of western America, and he
has been favored by rich contributions from correspondents of the office. The work
is fully illustrated, as is necessary, since it is only by graphic presentation that
definite ideas concerning the multiform gestures and motions used in primitive inter-
change of thought can be clearly expressed. The monograph is approaching com-
pletion

LINGUISTICS.

The languages of the American Indians have received a large share of the atten-
tion of the Bureau ever since its institution. It has been the policy to collect texts
and vocabularies and material for grammars as rapidly and extensively as possible
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

before the disappearance of the primitive languages. Only a small part of the
material so collected has been published; but the vaults of the Bureau are rich in
data pertaining to the languages of many tribes representing most of the linguistic
stocks of the American Indians. Perhaps on no other continent has the linguistic
diversification of primitive peoples been wider than in northern America, and the
dialectic variations are hardly Jess striking. The aboriginal languages of this con-
tinent accordingly give an admirable opportunity for the study of the facts and
causes of linguistic development; and from the beginning it was deemed important
to collect the largest possible body of material for examination and discussion in its
bearing on the general subject. Carrying out the general policy, only subordinate
attention has been given to publication, and publication has been made only in
cases in which the material seemed especially typical or exceptionally complete.
Thus, while the amount of linguistic material published is not voluminous, the
manuscripts constantly accessible for purposes of study are abundant—richer, it is
believed, than any other body of linguistic records of a primitive people.

Mr. A. S. Gatschet devoted the entire year to linguistic work. Early in the year
he was employed in translating texts and in extracting lexie and grammatic ele-
ments of the Peoria and Shawano languages, recorded by him during the preceding
two years. This work gave abundant opportunities for comparing the two tongues
with the forty or fifty other dialects of the Algonquian stock, and the interesting
results of the comparison were embodied ina comparative vocabulary of the Algon-
quian languages. By this comparison the intimate relations between the dialects is
strikingly shown and at the same time the multiplicity of forms into which the
original tongues has been diversified has been brought out. Morphologically the
Algonquian tongue is built on a purely nominal basis, yet in the various dialects ¢
wide variety of ideas are expressed with surprising perfection. In all the Algon-
quian dialects verbal roots combine with other verbal roots in a single word giving
a peculiar and forcible expression to the verbal form, The compounding of words is
further extended by numerous adjectival suffixes descriptive of quality, these suffixes
indicating whether the noun qualified by such an adjective is an animate or inani-
mate subject, and showing whether complexion, size, age, or other qualities are to
be determined. This method of adjectival suffixes extends also to the numerals, and
in some dialects there are special suffixes to qualify numeral cardinals as determin-
ing animate or inanimate objects in the plural. Mr. Gatschet’s recent studies have
brought out the fact that the Algonquian languages of the western group (Arapahoe,
Cheyenne, and Siksika) differ considerably in their phonetics from the eastern dia-
lects, these differences being especially shown in the nasalization found among the
western representatives of the stock.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey spent the earlier part of the year in office work on the Biloxi
language, completing its systematic arrangement for preservation and reference,
He also revised the proofs of Contributions to North American Ethnology, Volume IX
(Riggs’s ‘“‘ Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography”), as well as his own memoir,
entitled ‘‘A Study of Siouan Cults,” in the eleventh annual report of the Bureau.
Both of these documents have now been published. The month of January was
spent on the Kwapa Reservation in Indian Territory in investigating the social organ-
ization of the tribes and recording their myths and traditions in the form of texts.
After his return from the field these texts were translated literally, but the prepara-
tion of explanatory notes and free translations was deferred. Some time was spent
in the elaboration of a list of the characters required for recording the various sounds
in the Siouan, Athapascan, and other linguistic families; in this work he had fora
time the assistance of a skilled oriental linguist, Dr. J. J. Nouri, from whom he
obtained for comparative purposes many of the peculiar sounds of the Semitic and
other Eastern languages. Some time was spent also in the examination of supposed
linguistic affinities between the Maya and Malay languages, and during the year he
recorded in final form eight Winnebago texts, dictated by Philip Longtail. Subse-
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

quently literal translations of these texts were made, and the preparatior of explana-
tory notes and free English translations was begun and the lexic elements were
extracted.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied during the earlier part of the year in researches
concerning the social relations recorded in the Iroquois language and the literature
relating to the people. In the course of this work it was shown that the independ-
ence of the tribe in local affairs was little if at all curtailed by the confederation of
the Five Nations, certain gentes being privileged from the beginning of the histori-
cal leagues (for there were undoubtedly several) to nominate lord-chiefs and vice-
chiefs to the league councils. Subsequently Mr. Hewitt made examination of the
data for the classification of the Waijilatpuan and Shahaptian groups of languages.
Despite the paucity of the linguistic material, he found that the groups display
peculiarities apparently due rather to divergent growth than to original diversity,
this being exceptionally true of the position of the attributing or predicating word
in the word-sentences or compound stems. In the lexicon the Shahaptian dialects
show specific superficial differences from the Waillatpuan group, but nevertheless a
large and important number of stems pertaining to the former, which have the same
or cognate significance, accord substantially in sound or form with terms in the lat-
ter; there are, moreover, in many of the dialects striking proofs of the effects of dis-
cordant linguistic growth. The general result of the study was to prove that the
two groups of languages have had a common history in part; and this conclusion
has been provisionally accepted in the classification of linguistic material in the
Bureau vaults. Other important studies relating to the affinities of the aboriginal
languages of northwestern America were successfully carried forward. Mr. Hewitt
also aided in the linguistic comparison of the Maya and Malayan terms collected by
Dr. Thomas. Some time was given also to the arrangement and transliteration of
the Tubar material collected by Dr. Carl Lumholtz in Mexico, with a view to publi-
cation. This collection, although not large, is of a special interest, since it was
obtained from the last three surviving representatives of the tribe who alone survive.
During the last months of the year Mr. Hewitt made a fruitful study of the so-called
irregular or anomalous verb in the Tuskarora or Mohawk dialects.

In connection with memoirs on the Menomoni Indians, already noted, Dr. Hoff-
man compiled a considerable vocabulary representing the language of this tribe.

In addition to the Tubar material in part transliterated by Mr. Hewitt, Dr. Carl
Lumholtz turned over to the Bureau the vocabularies collected from the Tarahumar
and Tepehuan tribes occupying the mountainous portions of the state of Chihuahua,
in the Republic of Mexico. Several other valuable contributions to the linguistic
material of the Bureau were made during the year. Among these may be mentioned
amanuscript of more than a thousand pages representing the vocabulary and gram-
mar of the Nez Perce Indians of Idaho, collected by the late Miss 8. L. McBeth and
kindly transmitted to the Bureau by her sister, Miss Kate C. McBeth.

MYTHOLOGY.

The myths and cognate beliefs of the American aborigines are of exceptional inter-
est, since they exemplify m many cases the influence of environment on the minds
of the devotees, and in some cases, moreover, the myths indicate the migrations of
the peoples among whom they are found. Accordingly, the studies by Mrs. Steven-
son and Mr. Cushing of the mythology of the Pueblo tribes, particularly that of the
Zuni, are of utmost importance in American anthropology.

Having completed his work in arranging the exhibits of the Bureau of American
Ethnology at the World’s Fair, Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing returned to Washing-
ton and resumed researches in mythology about the middle of September. Almost
continuously since that time he has, in conjunction with Mr. Stewart Culin, of the
University of Pennsylvania, whose attention has long been devoted to the games of
the Orient, carried forward a study of the origin of aboriginal games, based on his
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

intimate acquaintance with the games of the Zuni and a knowledge gained by his
investigations at the World’s Fair.

A study of these primitive games reveals the fact that they were not played for
amusement, as among civilized people, but chiefly for divination, which was prac-
ticed in connection with industries and enterprises of all sorts; so that divinatory
games occupied a prominent place in the thoughts and exercised an important
influence on the daily life of these people. It was. also found that in the Orient the
games were actually played with arrows and were still recognized as arrow games
by the players themselves as late as the eleventh or twelfth centuries B. C., thus
giving historic evidence of the arrow origin of lot and dice games in the Orient, and
confirming, in Mr. Culin’s estimation, Mr. Cushing’s hypothesis as to the identical
origin of such games in America. These researches have also brought to light many
significant facts bearing on the usages, beliefs, and ethnic relations of early peoples,
and the material result of the investigation is an elaborate paper on ‘‘Arrrow games
and their variants in America and the Orient,” under the joint authorship of Messrs,
Cushing and Culin, now well advanced in preparation. Mr. Cushing was greatly
aided in this work by Mr. Lows C. Moctezuma, an educated young Mexican, from
whom he obtained much information regarding the Indian games of his country.

Mr. Cushing has not allowed his researches relating to divinatory games com-
pletely to interrupt his more general studies relating to Zuni mythology, and during
the year has given special attention to the origin and primitive use of fire. Fire
myths are nearly universal and fire worship common among primitive peoples; and
it is the possession of fire making which perhaps more than any other characteristic
distinguishes mankind from the lower animals. The conquest of fire has not yet
been clearly traced, but Mr. Cushing’s researches are contributing materially to
knowledge of the subject.

The manuscript of Mr. Cushing’s paper bearing the title ‘‘Outlines of Zuni
creation myths” was brought to completion and at the close of the year was par-
tially in type as one of the accompanying papers of the Thirteenth Annual Report.

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, although partially disabled by overwork and
exposure during her last field season among the Sia Indians of New Mexico, began
in July the revision of the proofs of her article on that tribe which covered pages
3-157 of the eleventh annual report. On the completion of the proof reading, early
in September, Mrs. Stevenson continued the preparation of a report on certain myths
and ceremonials of the Zuni tribe, among whom she has spent a number of seasons.
Notwithstanding her ill health she succeeded in completing the preparation of most
of the illustrative material of the monograph and well advanced the final revision
of the text.

PSYCHOLOGY.

The Director has found opportunity for continuing his investigations in primitive
modes of thought, carried on during previous years. The result of these studies
was imparted to the members of the Bureau in a series of informal lectures for the
purpose of establishing a firmer and more definite basis for their researches in Indian
mythology and sociology.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The work on the bibliography of native American languages was continued by
Wr. James C. Pilling. Asin previous years much time was consumed in procuring
new material for the main catalogue, from which are prepared the bibliographies of
the various linguistic stocks. This work necessitates a careful review of all the
catalogue material relating to Americana generally—those of auction sales, of book-
sellers’ catalogues, of the reviews, ete.,—and these furnish brief titles, which are
used as memoranda for further research. In this manner several hundred new
titles have been added to the main catalogue during the year. For his painstaking
and untiring patience in this tedious task Mr. Pilling is receiving high praise. The
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

press reviews of the stock bibliographies already issued indicate the regard in which
they are held, for their incomparable completeness, by students in all parts of the
world.

During the last year there was issued a Bibliografia Espatiola de Lenguas indigena
de America, by the Comte de Vinaza, bearing the imprint Madrid, 1892. Although
issued years after the appearance of Mr. Pilling’s ‘‘ proof sheets,” and although the
compiler of the Bibliografia had unusual facilities, among them access to the archives
of Spain—an advantage enjoyed by few if any foreigners,—but seventy-five titles not
already containedin Mr. Pilling’s catalogue were found inthe Comte de Vinaza’s work.

The month of August was taken up by Mr. Pilling with an examination of the
plate proofs of the bibliography of the Salishan language, then ready for press, but
little correction worthy of notice was necessary. The bulletin, which comprises
86 pages and 4 facsimiles, was delivered by the Public Printer in the middle of
November.

During November work was renewed on the Wakashan bibliography. <A trip
extending over a few days was made to Lenox and Astor libraries, New York City,
some new material being obtained and defective titles corrected. The work was
forwarded to the Public Printer in January, and by the close of March the proof
reading was finished. This bibliography, which was ready for distribution early in
May, comprises 70 pages and 2 facsimiles. During the proof reading of the Waka-
shan bibliography the preparation of the bibliography of the Shahaptian languages
was begun, and at the close of the fiscal year was in an advanced stage of progress.

PUBLICATION.

During no similar period of the Bureau’s history have so many pages of ethno-
logic material been put in type. Since the close of the last fiscal year (1892-93) most
of the proof reading of the Tenth Annual Report was completed. The volume was
received from the printer in June, 1894. The monograph accompanying this report,
“Picture Writing of the American Indians,” by Garrick Mallery, covers 807 pages
and is illustrated by 54 plates and 1,290 figures. On July 27, 1893, the Eleventh
Annual Report was sent to the Public Printer, and before the close of October all the
proofs had been read. Proof reading of the Twelfth Annual Report was in progress
at the close of the year 1892-93, and continued until April, 1894. This report, which,
in addition to the administrative report of the Director, contains a paper by Mr.
Cyrus Thomas, entitled ‘‘ Report on the mound exploration of the Bureau of Eth-
nology,” was in the bindery at the close of the year. In February, 1894, the manu-
script of the Thirteenth Annual Report was sent to the Public Printer, and in June
the first proots were received. With the close of the fiscal year all the illustrations
for this annual had been engraved, and proof reading was well advanced.

At the close of the year 1892-93 the proof reading of the ‘ Bibliography of the
Salishan Languages,” by James Constantine Pilling, was almost completed. This
bulletin was delivered by the printer in November, 1895. The Bibliography of the
Wakashan Languages, by the same author, was sent to the printer in December,
1893; the first proofs were received in January, 1894; the proof reading was finished
in April, and the edition was delivered a month later.

Early in January of the present year the manuscript of a bulletin by Mr. John
Garland Pollard, on the Pamunkey Indians of Virginia, was sent to the Public
Printer, and by February 6 the final proofs had been revised. This bulletin was
delivered in April, 1894. '

At the close of the last fiscal year proof reading of Riggs’ ‘‘ Dakota Grammar,
Texts, and Ethnography,” which forms Contributions to North American Ethnology,
Volume IX, had been in progress about a month, and by the end of July the volume
was in page form.

The first proof of a bulletin entitled ‘‘The Maya Year,” by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, was
received early in February, 1894, the manuscript having been transmitted January
19. This brochure passed through the press and was delivered in May.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

In January, 1894, there was also sent to the Public Printer the manuscript of the
first of a proposed series of bulletins, entitled ‘‘Chinook Texts,” by Dr. Franz Boas.
The first proofs were received in March, and by July 1 176 pages and a number of
galleys were in type.

Another bulletin, ‘‘An Ancient Quarry in Indian Territory,” by William H. Holmes,
was sent to the Public Printer on February 17, and by the close of June the paper
was in type.

The following publications were received from press during the fiscal year:

Ninth Annual Report, for 1887-88, containing, in addition to the Director’s report
of 46 pages, the following papers: (1) ‘‘ Ethnological results of the Point Barrow expe-
dition,” by John Murdoch. Pages3 to 441, Pls. I-II, figs. 1-428. (2) ‘The medicine

MISCELLANEOUS.

Classification of manuscripts.—In the current appropriation for American Ethnology,
provision was made for rental of quarters for the use of the Bureau, and in accord-
ance therewith the sixth floor of the Adams Building on F street was leased, In addi-
tion to increased floor space for the use of its collaborators when not engaged in
field work, the Bureau now has two large fireproof vaults, in which has been safely
deposited the large body of valuable manuscript material in its possession, This
material, comprising over 1,400 specific linguistic papers, 60 miscellaneous linguistic
papers, and 236 manuscripts on miscellaneous ethnologic subjects, has been tenta-
tively catalogued by subject, linguistic family, and author, and another catalogue
alphabetically arranged by catalogue and unit is now being prepared.

World’s Columbian Exposition.—The labor of preparing theexhibit of the Bureau of
American Ethnology at the World’s Columbian Exposition was assigned to Mr. Wil-
liam H. Holmes, who was assisted by Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing. After directing
the installation of the collections Mr. Holmes returned to Washington, leaving to Mr,
Cushing the final arrangement of a number of lay figures which had been prepared
by Messrs. Holmes, Mooney, and Cushing. Mr. Cushing remained at the Exposition
in charge of the Bureau exhibit until the middle of September, meanwhile conduct-
ing the study of primitive American games noted above.

It is gratifying to be able to state that the figures and other collections
exhibited by the Bureau at the Chicago Exposition met with high praise from
every quarter. A report on these collections is in course of preparation by Mr.
Cushing with a view to publication.

Library.—F rom the time of the establishment of the Bureau until the autumn of
1893 the books received through gift, exchange, or purchase, were temporarily
deposited in the library of the Geological Survey. When the Bureau moved into
independent quarters Mr. Hodge, in connection with his work on synonymy, was
placed in charge of the library, which then numbered about 2,600 volumes. At the
close of the year the library had increased to 4,350 volumes, chiefly through exchange

APPENDIX III.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894.

It is confined, for the sake of convenient comparison, almost entirely to the pre-
sentation of statistics, compiled upon the plan established in 1888.

The Exchange Service has been conducted during the year under exceptionally dis-
advantageous conditions, owing to the decrease in the appropriation made by
Congress to the Institution for the conduct of the exchange operations, and also
owing to the fact that some of the Government bureaus transmitting large numbers
of documents were unable at the end of the year to reimburse the Institution, as
hitherto, for the expense incurred.

The actual number of packages received during the year was somewhat less than
during the year preceding, though the weight was considerably greater. This
decrease in the number of packages was due in part to the fact that toward the
close of the fiscal year, no deficiency appropriation having been passed by Congress,
it became necessary to restrict the operations of the Exchange Service, and to notify
a number of correspondents that it would be impracticable to transmit their
exchanges abroad until a further appropriation from Congress became available. A
further cause of the decrease was the discontinuance of the transmission in the
special Congressional Library exchange of a large number of small pamphlets or
orders from the War Department, occupying but a page or two each.

Notwithstanding this fact, it will be seen that 27 more cases were shipped abroad
than during any previous year.

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU.

The work of the Bureau is succinctly given in the annexed table, prepared in a

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

The apparent decrease in the number of correspondents shown in the following
table is to be explained from the fact that the present figures represent the actual
count of the ledger cards under the system adopted in 1892. The corresponding
figures in the table of last year represent the total number of correspondents on
both the new and old system of ledger cards.

For comparison with previous years, I add a statement from 1888 to 1894, which
will make apparent the growth in the service:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by
Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose and in part by appropria-
tions made to different Government departments or bureaus, either in their contin-
gent funds or in specific terms for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the
cost of transportation.

In addition to the transmission of its own documents the Government has under-
taken, through a treaty which was concluded at Brussels in 1886, and formally
ratitied and proclaimed by the President of the United States in 1889, the exchange
of the publications of learned societies in this and other countries and the Smith
sonian Institution has been recognized as the medium in the United States through
which this exchange is to be effected, other governments having established special
exchange bureaus for the purpose.

In 1878 the Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for
the publications sent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge
being necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution.
For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of like amount
to State institutions, from which a further small revenue has been derived.

As the same reasons for the continuance of this charge have existed to the present
time, the appropriations by Congress never having been sufficient to meet the entire
expense of the service, recommendation has frequently been made that the entire
appropriation allowed by the Government should be contained in a single item to the
Smithsonian Institution.

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the Exchange Service
for the fiscal year 1893-94 was in the following terms:

“For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United
States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,
including salaries or compensation of all necessary employés, fourteen thousand
five hundred dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian Insti-

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government
bureaus and other sources was $2,165.95, making the sum practically available for
the specific purpose of exchanges $16,665.95, while the expenses amounted to
$17,610.31, leaving a deficiency of $944.36.

An estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000 was submitted in
October, 1892, this sum being intended to include in a single appropriation various
small items in different appropriation bills, and also an item of $2,000 to cover the
expense of an immediate exchange of parliamentary documents with the countries
entering into the treaty at Brussels in 1886.

I would again call attention to the fact that no appropriation has been made for
this latter purpose.

CORRESPONDENTS.

As mentioned in previous reports, it became necessary in the latter part of 1891 to
provide for an addition to the series of ‘‘ ledger” cards upon which were entered all
packages sent or received from a given society or individual. A plan was approved
by which the cards were much reduced in size, the bulk of the older cards having
already become a matter of serious consideration.

The new and smaller ledger cards were begun on January 1, 1892, and since that
date all the transactions have been entered upon them. The abbreviation of the
records and their greater convenience in handling proved to be of the utmost service
when it became necessary to reduce the clerical force in the office, and it is only by
such abbreviation of the records and by the introduction of several minor labor-
saving devices that it has been at all possible to prevent the work from falling
irretrievably behind.

The number of new ledger cards on June 30, 1893, was 16,340, and on June 30, 1894,
20,223. This difference of 3,883 represents the increase in the number of new socie-
ties or individuals during the year making use of the service, while the entire num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ber of cards, 20,223, is the number of societies and individuals, both domestic and
foreign, with which the Exchange Office has had relations since January 1, 1892.
The new list of correspondents is classified as follows:

The actual count of the list of correspondents printed in 1886, together with all
the additions made since, gives 9,212 foreign societies; of which, however, 2,221 are
not as yet represented upon the new ledger cards. The accompanying map will
convey most clearly an idea of the wide distribution of these correspondents.

The entire record file of the Exchange Office contains the names of approximately
13,500 individuals and 11,500 institutions; and, although a considerable number of
these represent defunct institutions or individuals, their registry with a statement
of this fact is often of very great value in the Exchange Service.

Attention has been directed for sometime past to the fact that the list of corre-
spondents in the Exchange Office requires revision and recopying upon cards, the
original office list prepared and printed in 1886 having become so worn and so over-
ciowded by frequent interlineations as to be almost illegible.

The special exchange list for the distribution of Smithsonian documents is also in
need of revisionand correction. It was prepared many years ago, and not a few of the
libraries to which it was deemed proper at the time to send these publications have
sunk into obscurity, while many new libraries have been established to which it
seems desirable that Smithsonian documents should be sent. A considerable number
of requests are received each year inviting an exchange of publications, or requests
for the completion of the Smithsonian series of documents, with which it is rarely
practicable to comply. It is earnestly hoped, therefore, that means will be found
for revising this list and the general exchange list of correspondents. Either of
these lists present a task of considerable magnitude, and it is manifestly impossible
with the present force of employees—which is hardly able to keep up with the cur-
rent work of the Bureau—to enter upon such an undertaking at the present time.

The last list of Smithsonian correspondents, that published in 1886, is the only
one to which applicants can now be referred. That a printed list of the addresses
of the principal learned societies and libraries of the world would be thoroughly
appreciated, the frequent inquiries made to the Exchange Office abundantly testify.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which was given in full in the
report of the Curator of Exchanges for 1887-88, the exchange of the official publi-
cations of the United States Government with other countries has been continued
by the Institution, and it now forms a very large proportion of the Bureau’s work.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to, was
15,000, and there have been received in return 8,812 packages. The United States
Government departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 28,285
packages, and have received in return 14,555 packages. The total number of
exchanges for government libraries has therefore been 23,367 packages received and
43,285 packages sent abroad, a total of 66,652 packages, or about 67 per cent of the
entire number handled, :
62

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish seale

as our own.

Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the governments

with which the Institution are in correspondence would also probably result in a
considerable increase to the library of Congress.
The exchange on account of Government bureaus is shown in detail in the follow-

ing table:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

I regret to report that, through circumstances over which the personnel of the
Exchange Office could have no control, it was found impracticable to prevent the
work of the year from falling in arrears.

The appropriation for the fiscal year was $2,500 less than for the years immediately
preceding, and during the latter half of the year, no deficiency appropriation hav-
ing been passed by Congress it became necessary to curtail the expenses in every
possible way by reducing the number of employees and otherwise in order that the
regular appropriation might not be exceeded.

A further embarrassment arose from the fact already stated that some of the Goy-
ernment bureaus, ordinarily sending a very considerable number of documents
abroad through the Smithsonian Institution, were unable to reimburse the Institu-
tion, as in previous years, for the cost of transportation advanced to meet the
expense involved.

In several instances, therefore, it became necessary to advise correspondents that
it would be impossible to receive and transmit their publications until after the
close of the fiscal year, and, as freight charges could not be met, a very large number
of documents, constituting the miscellaneous exchanges, as well as some 7,000 Con-
gressional documents to be transmitted to parliamentary libraries with which the
exchange for the Library of Congress is conducted, had to be held over until after
the new appropriation became available.

The exchange relations with Greece are in the same condition as a year ago, when,
on account of the expenses attending the distribution of packages, the transmission
of miscellaneous exchanges was discontinued by request of the librarian of the
United National and University Libraries, formerly acting as the medium for dis-
tributing publications.

The transmissions to Brazil and Chile, which were for a time suspended, were
renewed, but the exchange with Mexico is still in an extremely unsatisfactory con-
dition, and the transmission of the parliamentary documents to the Mexican Goy-
ernment has been suspended awaiting some action by the Mexican authorities, to
whose attention the matter was brought through the Mexican minister.

The difficulties attending the transmission of documents to India has been finally
met by the action of the Secretary to the Government of India, at Calcutta, in
obtaining the consent of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India to continue the
former arrangement under which publications intended by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion for private institutions and individuals, as well as for Government depart-
ments and individuals in their official capacity, were forwarded to India from
London by the director-general of stores, at the cost of the civil department.

I take much pleasure in bearing witness to the efficiency of the employees in the
Exchange Office and in expressing appreciation of their efforts to keep up with the
added volume of work in spite of the unavoidable reduction in the force, and I beg
leave to call to your notice the careful attention to the interests of the Insitution on
the part of its special agents abroad, Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipsic, and Messrs.
William Wesley & Son, in London.

The Smithsonian Institution is also under special obligation to the Secretary of
the Treasury who has designated an officer of the United States Custom-House in
New York, to receive and despatch to Washington cases containing international
exchanges, all of these cases being passed both in this country and abroad free of
custom duties.

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and others for their liberality in granting the privilege of free freight or in other-
wise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other
firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the
disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge:

APPENDIX IV,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894:

The progress of the park has been along the lines already indicated in former
reports. The appropriation granted by Congress being insufficient to permit the
construction of any important new structures, attention has mainly been given to
perfecting the accommodations already established and to improving the means of
access enjoyed by the public.

The location of the deer paddocks, on the eastern bank of the little stream that
flows through the park, was found unfavorable, they being situated there against
the boundary fence, and the deer being consequently endangered by the presence of
dogs roving in the vicinity of the park. The sight of a dog frightened them to such
an extent as to cause them to injure themselves in their efforts to escape. Several
of them were killed, breaking their necks by running violently against the fence,
others broke their legs by becoming entangled, and still others, after leaping a fence
eight feet high were recaptured with much difficulty. The force of watchmen at the
park being insufficient to fully guard against such accidents, it was thought best to
remove the paddocks to a protected situation within the park, at a sufficient dis-
tance from the boundary fence to prevent disturbance of the animals. A site
was ‘selected a short distance below the llama house, and a suitable barn or
shelter was constructed of rough beams and thatch, as shown in the accompanying
illustration. The paddocks were inclosed by light wire fencing 8 feet in height.
No further trouble has arisen with the deer since this change was made. The
approximate cost of the house and paddocks was $600.

It being desirable to place the beavers in a locality suitable for their habits,
a retired valley was selected from which the public could be excluded, and the
animals were allowed to build undisturbed. These results were even more satis-
factory than were expected, as the animals at once commenced to cut down trees of
considerable size, and to construct a dam and a lodge. It is hoped that others may
be secured, and that they may be partially domesticated so as to carry on their
interesting operations under the observations of the public.

The large pond for waterfowl and other aquatic animals, situated south of the
meadow near the bridge, has finally been completed, but is not yet fenced in so as to
retain the animals. A smaller pond on the left bank of Rock Creek, near the Quarry
road entrance, has been prepared for swans. This will prove a picturesque feature
at this point, as water can be led into and out of it by a series of small cascades,
which will afford a pleasing variety.

The site of the prairie-dog town, among trees upon the top of a gravelly knoll, is
found to be unsatisfactory. It seems probable that when a large number are
confined in a limited space for a considerable length of time, the ground becomes
impregnated with injurious matters. It has been noted that the number of these
animals has been gradually decreasing, and it is estimated that the total has fallen
off by as many as 75 during the year. As soon as funds are available for the purpose,
it is intended to remove them to a healthier situation, and to arrange so that they

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

may be shifted from time to time. The present site will be an admirable sitnation
for a public comfort room and refectory, which is greatly needed for the accommo-
dation of the public.

A considerable sum has been spent in preparing a driveway from the animal house
to the west gate, through one of the most beautiful regions of the park. Consid-
erable excavations and fills were necessary at various points, and the sum at the dis-
posal of the administration was insufficient to properly surface and finish the road.
A substantial gutter was, however, laid upon the side of the roadway. During dry
summer weather this road is satisfactory, but the frosts of winter make it so soft as
to be almost impassable.

Seventy-three animals were lent the park during the winter by the proprietor of
the Forepaugh show. This proved a great attraction to the public, obtained at very
slight expense, the only increased charge being the food consumed. It is believed
that it would be advantageous to continue the practice of taking suitable and inter-
esting animals for the expense of their maintenance, as by this means some specimens
are almost certain to be added permanently to the collection, one of the stipulations
made in such cases being that all animals born in the park shall become the property
of the Government. A kangaroo and a monkey were in this way obtained.

The collection has thriven fairly well during the year, considering the fact that

~ no purchases can be made and that it isso much dependent on gifts—a list of the
donors of which is appended. The number of animals on hand at the close of the
fiscal year was 510, being a slight increase on the number at the beginning of the
year. The number of deaths was 251, chiefly among the smaller species, a consid-
erable number occurring among animals that were in bad condition when they were
lent to the park.

Among the interesting accessions was a young black bear, born on February 5,
1894. There are but few opportunities for observing the growth of these animals,
as they are rarely born in captivity. The little creature was very small at birth,
not larger than a good-sized rat, weighing but nine ounces, and it was thirty-nine
days before it opened its eyes. It has been very viyorous and healthy from the
first, and its development was evidently normal. A fine young African lion, from
Mashonaland, was presented by Mr. H. C. Moore, and promises to become a very
large animal when full grown.

REPORT ON THE ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As indicated in my last report, the general work of the Observatory for the fiscal
year has continued to be the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum described
in the general body of the report for 1893. This work may conveniently be divided
into three parts:

A. General spectrobolographic work.

B. Special spectrobolographic work.

C. Instrumental work, including manufacture of new apparatus and the perfec-
tion of old.

A. The general spectrobolographic work of the year may besummed up as follows:
(A “bolograph” is an automatic reproduction of the curve representing the distribu-
tion of the energy in the infra-red spectrum. )

A complete record of these bolographie curves, automatically registered by the

apparatus upon glass plates, has been filed for future investigation, the work in its

present stage being confined, as has already been stated, to the exploration of this
hitherto unexplored region and the identification of its landmarks.

The result of the work has been extremely satisfactory, so far as regards the number
and importance of the lines found. The accompanying illustration (see plate) show-
ing a portion of the infra-red spectrum from the region 1.4 to 2.24, beyond what a
few years ago was considered the limit of the infra-red spectrum, will show the
detail and clearness with which the present apparatus is capable of rendering what
can, only in the absence of a better word, be called the ‘‘appearance” of this region,
since, it must be borne in mind, no human being has senses capable of directly
discriminating between these interruptions, or of directly perceiving the form of

this display of energy.

76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The portion of the infra-red spectrum shown, which is that at present furthest
advanced, has been gone over several times, and each of the more than 200 lines
which occupy this plate has been verified by many observations. The plate shows
but asmall part of the region which is now being mapped, in all of which it is

believed the results will be equally encouraging. Although no investigation has —

been made of the meaning of the many significant lines in this great and now first

exhibited region, it is reasonable to think that their study may lead to conclusions
of only less importance than those resulting from the similar Frauenhofer lines in the
visible spectrum. It is especially believed that the science of meteoroloyy may
become indebted to a study of this region for many indications of phenomena
which can not now be foretold with any degree of accuracy.

PaRT OF THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (er

Three of these bolographs, taken from a large number covering the same region,
are shown in the illustration (Fig. 1), in order that the manner of recording the
variations in the distribution of the energy in this portion of the spectrum may be
shown, as well as the agreement of distinct observations made of the same region
at different times.

In order to accomplish this agreement and accuracy in the curves, many changes
suggested by experience have had to be made in the apparatus and equipment.
The temporary and overcrowded quarters in which this apparatus is stored have
been more and more occupied as the mechanical difficulties in the work increased,
until now the space is totally inadequate to the needs of such an investigation,
while an even more serious difficulty is that the locality is in the neighborhood of
street traffic, and disturbed by continual tremors.

B. The special bolographic work which is carried on during days unfavorable for
taking observations includes the classification, detailed examination, and finally,
the reduction of the bolographs taken into linear translations of the curves, in
which the final result is similar, so far as the automatic reduction processes will
admit, to the photographs of the visible part of the spectrum.

Much attention has been given to the photographic work, which has presented
problems somewhat difficult of solution. Much of the photographic apparatus has
had to be specially designed and constructed to fit the peculiar conditions governing
its use, but the present process, it is believed, will meet any exigencies of the work.

The work in this direction has kept pace with the original bolographs and I hope
soon to be able to issue the preliminary charts covering at least a portion of the
region under investigation.

C. What may be called the principal work of the Observatory of this kind during
the year has been the improvement of the apparatus and the instrumental conditions,
the lines of development being—

(1) Toward an increase of delicacy.

(2) Toward increased stability and accuracy.

The galvanometer, whose relative importance in the train of apparatus may almost
be compared to that of the brain in the nervous system, has been perfected still
further than was noted in my last report.

The utility of these improvements, however, has been, as I have already said,
greatly impaired by the situation of the Observatory, close to traveled streets,
where it is subject to disturbances of the most annoying kind. This will be better
understood when it is considered that the galvanometer never moves very sensibly
under a change of temperature on the bolograph of less than a millionth of a degree;
that it is on the registry of these minute changes that the whole system of discov-
ery rests, and that false changes can be introduced by the magnetism or the tremor
from passing traffic, which so embarrass the observer and enhance his labor
that it may be said to be almost hopeless to introduce any great further improve-
ment in this direction till the Observatory occupies a site free from such disturb-
ances, in place ofits present temporary and most unsuitable quarters. These inter-
ruptions and disturbances, whether magnetic or seismic, have prevented, except at
rare and short intervals, the full use of the apparatus in its more delicate capacities.

Apparatus.—The clockwork, upon which depends much of the accuracy and con-
sequently the final efficiency of the observations, has been continually studied and
improved.

The siderostat has been under continued improvements suggested by experience,
but these will be better described when complete.

The Observatory, during the year, has received from the commissioners of the Rus-
sian Government to the World’s Fair a very large block of optically fine rock salt
from the mines, from which a collimating lens over 7 inches in diameter and a prism
7 inches in height has been wrought (by Brashear), which, it is believed, are the
largest of their material in the world. To this prism and lens is due much of the
increased efficiency of the whole train of apparatus.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR.

A number of direct photographs of a portion of the visible spectrum and as much
of the infra-red as could be readily photographed were made by Mr. L. E. Jewell,
with the object of comparing direct photographs with bolographs of the same
region made under similar conditions.

A number of enlargements of the spectro-bolographic charts already finished have
been made with a view to their early publication.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. R. C. Child was appointed to the position of junior assistant on September 1,
1893.

Mr. F, L. O. Wadsworth resigned the position of senior assistant June 1, 1894.

On the same date Mr. Child was appointed aid, acting in charge of Observatory.

Mr. F. E. Fowle, jr., was appointed junior assistant on June 1, 1894.

APPENDIX VI.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894.

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith a report upon the operations of the
Library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,

The work of recording accessions has been conducted as heretofore, each publica-
tion being entered as received and given a special number. While this plan causes
the exhibit of numbers in excess of volumes received, there is to set off against it
the fact that an entire series received at one time is given but a single number.

The numbers in the accession book of the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of
Congress extend from 268387 to 292425; in all, 24,038 entries, an increase in numbers
over the year 1892-93 of 1,762.

The following tables show the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts received during the year:

This table shows an increase in publications over the year 1892-95 of 8,464.

Of these publications 587 volumes, 10,256 parts of volumes, and 1,575 pamphlets,
12,418 in all, were retained for use in the United States National Museum.

One thousand three hundred and forty-six medical dissertations were deposited in
the library of the Surgeon General, United States Army. The remaining publications
were sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt.

Besides these publications entered in the accession book of the Smithsonian
deposit of the Library of Congress there have been entered in the ‘office book”
1,580 numbers (extending from No. 4089 to No. 5669), representing 1,874 volumes and
parts of volumes received, and making a grand total of accessions for the year of
39,826 publications. -

This does not include a small number of books and journals purchased for the use
of the Astrophysical Observatory and of the Zoological Park.

The following universities have sent academic publications and inaugural disser-
tations:

Basel, Giessen, Kazen, Pennsylvania.
Berlin, Gottingen, Kiel, Rostock,
Berne, Greifswald, Konigsburg, Strassburg,
Bonn, Halle, A. S. Leipsic, .- Tubingen,

80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In 1887 you organized a plan for increasing the library by exchanges. Lists of
periodicals were secured from the British Museum, several universities, and a great
number of leading specialists. These lists were carefully revised and correspond-
ence entered upon with each society and journal there represented. During the
year this work was completed. Immediately upon its completion a new list of all
scientific publications issued in France was secured, and, after revision, correspond-
ence was entered upon; 1,191 letters asking for publications not on our list, or for
numbers to complete the series already in the Jibrary, have been written. As a
result, 503 new exchanges were acquired by the Institution, while 133 defective
series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers were able to supply
missing parts. This result is very nearly double that attained last year.

Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written for the purpose of increasing the num-
ber of periodicals and transactions of learned societies in the library; 1,853 new
periodicals have been added to the list of those received, and 1, 042 defective series
have been either wholly or partially completed.

Four thousand -two hundred and thirty-six acknowledgments of publications
received were made by the post card and other printed forms, while many gifts were
acknowledged by special letter.

Three sectional libraries are now established in the Institution—the editor’s, the
astronomical, and one for works on aerodromics.

In the last report attention was called to the crowded condition of the library
offices. Since that time two additional rooms have been assigned, one for a collection
of books required tor reference, and the other as an office for the librarian. In this
reference room, besides cyclopedias and dictionaries, are placed the publications of
six of the great scientific societies of the world.

A room has also been set apart for the collections of prints belonging to the Institu-
tion. A few of these have been framed and hung upon the walls, the remainder
being retained in bound volumes and portfolios.

The card-catalogue record of periodicals received has Jeen transferred from the
large cards formerly employed to the smaller card, known as the postal size; a new
card catalogue of periodicals in the Institution has also been prepared for the read-
ing room.

The library is governed by the following regulations, which with slight additions
were drawn up by the present Secretary some years ago:

CONSTITUTION OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY,

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the library of the Smithsonian Institution
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision that the Institu-
tion shall continue to enjoy its customary use of it. The following regulations refer
only to those books which under the above proviso are retained at the Smithsonian
Institution proper, or in its Museum library.

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are placed in the immediate
charge of a librarian, whose title shall be ‘‘lib:arian of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion,” and whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the
Library of Congress in a central library under his charge. The following regulations
are intended for the better execution of the aforesaid order:

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the Assistant Secretary, the Chief Cleik,
or assistant in charge, and also by the curators and acting curators, and the editor.
Curators and acting curators are permitted, subject to the approval of the Assistant
Secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional libraries to be kept in their
respective offices; but this shall only be done by withdrawing from the general col-
lection such books as relate exclusively to the objects under their care. Dictionaries,
cyclopedias, journals, or any works other than such as relate exclusively to the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

special department, can not form a part of such a sectional library, except upon the
recommendation of the librarian, approved by the Assistant Secretary.

4, The official in charge of each sectional library shall be responsible for its safe-
keeping and shall on no account lend the books,

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited.

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinct cases, the locks of which shall be
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times,
examine them and call the attention of the curators to any deficiencies.

7. No person who is not a member of the scientific staff of the Institution or
Museum shall withdraw books or other matter without written permission from the
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the assistant in charge, the
curator in charge of the Museum, or the librarian. Persons taking books from the
central library shall be responsible for the safe-keeping of the same, and shall make
good any losses. They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those
which are lost have been restored.

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are suitable for any
curator’s sectional library, and to recall any book not in & sectional library within
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, as
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare, or costly, or encyclopedic works,
or in other special instances, the librariam shall be authorized to designate books
which shall in no case be taken from the library. These regulations shall not
apply to any books now actually in the office of the editor. All books and other
matter not in the sectional library shall be at all times subject to recall by the
librarian.

9. The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause
to the contrary) recall any book upon receiving a written request for the same.

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Secretary any defective
series, any missing books, or any new serials or books which are specially desirable.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS.

11. All books, pamphlets, maps, and other publications acquired by the Smith-
sonian Institution through exchange, or donation, or purchase shall be separately
entered by the librarian, who shall prepare reference lists, with the aid of which he
shall, immediately upon their receipt from the assistant in charge of office, divide
them into two classes; one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt,
the other to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week.

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day-
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time, for
every separate book, or pamphlet, or map, without exception; but it is understood
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue.

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the daybook the letter “C”
(Smithsonian Library deposited in Library of Congress), or ‘‘G” (Smithsonian
Library deposited with Surgeon-General), or “I” (Smithsonian Library deposited
at the Institution). Books purchased at the Institution’s cost and intended for the
Secretary’s library, or the office library, shall be entered in a separate book, and it
shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first class are prepared
for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week.

U4. The librarian shall notify the exchange department within the current week of
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the
senders or donors of every article, at stated times, at intervals of not more than a
year, and shall make a record of such entry with the date of acknowledgment oppo-
site to the entry of the work in question.

SM 94-6
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

15. It shall be the duty of the librarian at all times to hold these books, in classes
“CG” and “G,” open to the inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report
to him the place and condition of any work under his charge in answer to any specific
inquiry.

16. In addition to the books which are included in the Smithsonian deposit in the
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the
Smithsonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shall be distinct-
ively marked, and it is understood that, while they form no part of the above-
described books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are in
other respects to be treated in accordance with the above regulations. No book or
chart belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured
for the specific use of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge of
the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctly stamped as belonging to his
office. Under this clause come books purchased especially for the office of* the
Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge, forming “office libraries.”
Indispensable books of reference in exchange departments, etc., form part of the
Chief Clerk’s office library.

This is to be understood as including the books purchased at the expense of the
Museum appropriation, but not necessarily the books obtained by exchange for
Museum publications, as it would be difficult, if not impossible, always to discrimi-
nate these under our present system. This point is reserved for future consideration,
but provisionally it is understood that the librarian is to send books to the Library
of Congress, if not evidently meant for the Museum.

The books provided for the. office of the Secretary, and stamped ‘‘ Secretary’s
library,” are a distinct class, having no relation to the Library of Congress or to the
sectional libraries. They may be lent on application in special cases by the Assist-
ant Secretary or assistant in charge through the librarian. All other books (not
forming a portion of the Smithsonian deposit with the Library of Congress, but
belonging to the Institution) are stamped ‘ Office library,” which includes editor’s
library, Chief Clerk’s office library, and others, and these, as well as those of the
Secretary’s library, are in the charge of the librarian.

Respectfully submitted.

Cyrus ADLER, Librarian.

Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMUETHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1894.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution. ;

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of
an annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had
been issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by
competent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1894.

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.!

By WILLIAM HARKNESS.

Nature may be studied in two widely different ways. On the one
hand we may employ a powerful microscope which will render visible
the minutest forms and limit our field of view to an infinitesimal frac-
tion of an inch situated within a foot of our own noses; or, on the other
hand, we may occupy some commanding position, and from thence,
aided perhaps by a telescope, we may obtain a comprehensive view of
an extensive region. The first method is that of the specialist, the
second is that of the philosopher, but both are necessary for an ade-
quate understanding of nature. The one has brought us knowledge
wherewith to defend ourselves against bacteria and microbes, which
are among the most deadly enemies of mankind, and the other has made
us acquainted with the great laws of matter and force upon which rests
the whole fabric of science. All nature is one, but for convenience of
classification we have divided our knowledge into a number of sciences
which we usually regard as quite distinct from each other. Along cer-
tain lines, or, more properly, in certain regions, these sciences neces-
sarily abut on each other, and just there lies the weakness of the
specialist. He is like a wayfarer who always finds obstacles in cross-
ing the boundaries between two countries, while to the traveler who
gazes over them from a commanding eminence the case is quite differ-
ent. If the boundary is an ocean shore, there is no mistaking it; if a
broad river or a chain of mountains, it is still distinct; but if only a
line of posts traced over hill and dale, then it becomes lost in the
natural features of the landscape, and the essential unity of the whole
region is apparent. In that case the border land is wholly a human
conception of which nature takes no cognizance, and so it is with the
scientific border land to which I propose to invite your attention this
evening.

To the popular mind there are no two sciences farther apart than
astronomy and geology. The one treats of the structure and mineral

constitution of our earth, the causes of its physical features and its
history, while the other treats of the celestial bodies, their magnitudes,
motions, distances, periods of revolution, eclipses, order, and of the
sauses of their various phenomena. And yet, many, perhaps I may
even say most, of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are
merely reflections of the motions of the earth, and in studying them
we are really studying it. Furthermore, precession, nutation, and the
phenomena of the tides depend largely upon the internal structure of
the earth, and there astronomy and geology merge into each other.
Nevertheless, the methods of the two sciences are widely different,
most astronomical problems being discussed quantitatively by means
of rigid mathematical formule, while in the vast majority of cases the
geological ones are discussed only qualitatively, each author contenting
himself with a mere statement of what he thinks. With precise data
the methods of astronomy lead to very exact results, for mathematics
is a mill which grinds exceeding fine; but, after all, what comes out of
a mill depends wholly upon what is put into it, and if the data are
uncertain, as is the case in most cosmological problems, there is little
to choose between the mathematics of the astronomer and the guesses
of the geologist.

If we examine the addresses delivered by former presidents of this
association, and of the sister—perhaps it would be nearer the truth to
say the parent—association on the other side of the Atlantic, we shall
find that they have generally dealt either with the recent advances
in some broad field of science, or else with the development of some
special subject. This evening I propose to adopt the latter course, and
I shall invite your attention to the present condition of our knowledge
respecting the magnitude of the solar system; but in so doing it will be
necessary to introduce some considerations derived from laboratory
experiments upon the luminiferous ether, others derived from experi-
ments upon ponderable matter, and still others relating both to the
surface phenomena and to the internal structure of the earth, and thus
we shall deal largely with the border land where astronomy, physics,
and geology merge into each other. .

The relative distances of the various bodies which compose the solar
system can be determined to a considerable degree of approximation
with very crude instruments as soon as the true plan of the system
becomes known, and that plan was taught by Pythagoras more than
five hundred years before Christ. It must have been known to the
Egyptians and Chaldeans still earlier, if Pythagoras really acquired
his knowledge of astronomy from them, as is- affirmed by some of the
ancient writers, but on that point there is no certainty. In public
Pythagoras seemingly accepted the current belief of his time, which
made the earth the center of the universe, but to his own chosen disci-
ples he communicated the true doctrine that the sun occupies the center
of the solar system and that the earth is only one of the planets revoly-

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 95

ing around it. Like all the world’s greatest sages, he seems to have
taught only orally. A century elapsed before his doctrines were reduced
to writing by Philolaus of Crotona, and it was still later before they
were taught in public for the first time by Hicetas, or as he is sometimes
valled Nicetas, of Syracuse. Then the familiar cry of impiety was
raised, and the Pythagorean system was eventually suppressed by that
now called the Ptolemaic, which held the field until it was overthrown
by Copernicus almost two thousand years later. Pliny tells us that
Pythagoras believed the distances to the sun and moon to be, respec-
tively, 252,000 and 12,600 stadia, or, taking the stadium at 625 feet,
29,837 and 1,492 English miles; but there is no record of the method
by which these numbers were ascertained.

After the relative distances of the various planets are known, it only
remains to determine the scale of the system, for which purpose the
distance between any two planets suffices. We know little about the
early history of the subject, but it is clear that the primitive astrono-
mers must have found the quantities to be measured too small for
detection with their instruments, and even in modern times the prob-
lem has proved to be an extremely difficult one. Arisfarchus, of
Samos, who flourished about 270 B. C., seems to have been the first to
attack it in a scientific manner. Stated in modern language, his rea-
soning was that when the moon is exactly half full the earth and
sun, as seen from its center, must make a right angle with each other,
and by measuring the angle between the sun and moon, as seen from
the earth at that instant, all the angles of the triangle joining the
earth, sun, and moon*would become known, and thus the ratio of the
distance of the sun to the distance of the moon would be determined.
Although perfectly correct in theory, the difficulty of deciding visually
upon the exact instance when the moon is half full is so great that it
can not be accurately done, even with the most powerful telescopes.
Of course Aristarchus had no telescope, and he does not explain how
he effected the observation, but his conclusion was that at the instant
in question the distance between the centers of the sun and moon as
seen from the earth is less than a right angle by one-thirtieth part
of the same. We should now express this by saying that the angle is
87°, but Aristarchus knew nothing of trigonometry, and in order to
solve his triangle he had recourse to an ingenious, but long and cum-
bersome, geometrical process, which has come down to us, and affords
conclusive proof of the condition of Greek mathematics at that time.
His conclusion was that the sun is nineteen times farther from the earth
than the moon, and if we combine that result with the modern value of
the moon’s parallax, viz, 3,422.38’, we obtain for the solar parallax
180’, which is more than twenty times too great.

The only other method of determining the solar parallax known to
the ancients was that devised by Hipparchus about 150 B.C. It was
based on measuring the rate of decrease of the diameter of the earth’s
96 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

shadow cone by noting the duration of lunar eclipses, and as the result
deduced from it happened to be pearly the same as that found by Aris-
tarchus, substantially his value of the parallax remained in vogue for
nearly two thousand years, and the discovery of the telescope was
required to reveal its erroneous character. Doubtless this persistency
was due to the extreme minuteness of the true parallax, which we now
know is far too small to have been visible upon the ancient instru-
ments, and thus the supposed measures of it were really nothing but
measures of their inaccuracy.

The telescope was first pointed to the heavens by Galileo in 1609, but
it needed a micrometer to convert it into an accurate measuring instru-
ment, and that did not come into be-ng until 1639, when it was invented
by William Gascoigne. After his death, in 1644, his original instru-
ment passed to Richard Townley, who attached it to a 14-foot telescope
at his residence in Townley, Lancashire, Engiand, where it was used
by Flamsteed in observing the diurnal parallax of Mars during its
opposition in 1672. A description of Gascoigne’s micrometer was pub-
lished in the Philosophical Transactions in 1667, and a little before
that a similar instrument had been invented by Auzout, in France, but
observatories were fewer then than now, and, so far as | know, J. D.
Cassini was the only person beside Flamsteed who attempted to deter-
mine the solar parallax from that opposition of Mars. Foreseeing the
importance of the opportunity, he had Richer dispatched to Cayenne
some months previously, and when the opposition came he effected two
determinations of the parallax; one being by the diurnal method, from
his own observations in Paris, and the other by the meridian method,
from observations in France by himself, Rémer, and Picard, combined
with those of Richer at Cayenne. This was the transition from the
ancient instruments with open sights to telescopes armed with microm-
eters, and the result must have been little short of stunning to the
seventeenth century astronomers, for it caused the hoary and gigantic
parallax of about 180” to shrink incontinently to 10”, and thus ex-
panded their conception of the solar system to something like its true
dimensions. More than fifty years previously Kepler had argued from
his ideas of the celestial harmonies that the solar parallax could not
exceed 60’, and a little later Horrocks had shown on more scientific
grounds that it was probably as small as 14”; but the final death blow
to the ancient values—ranging as high as 2’ or 3/—came from these
observations of Mars by Flamsteed, Cassini, and Richer.

Of course the results obtained in 1672 produced a keen desire on the
part of astronomers for further evidence respecting the true value of
the parallax, and as Mars comes into a favorable position for such
investigations only at intervals of about sixteen years, they had recourse
to observations of Mereury and Venus. In 1677 Halley observed the
diurnal parallax of Mercury, and also a transit of that planet across
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 97

the sun’s disk, at St. Helena, and in 1681 J. D. Cassini and Picard
observed Venus when she was on the same parallel with the sun, but
although the observations of Venus gave better resuJts than those of
Mercury, neither of them was conclusive, and we now know that such
methods are inaccurate even with the powerful instruments of the pres-
ent day. Nevertheless Halley’s attempt by means of the transit of
Mercury ultimately bore fruit in the shape of his celebrated paper of
1716, wherein he showed the peculiar advantages of transits of Venus
for determining the solar parallax. The idea of utilizing such tran-
sits for this purpose seems to have been vaguely conceived by James
Gregory, or perhaps even by Horrocks, but Halley was the first to
work it out completely, and long after his death his paper was mainly
instrumental in inducing the Governments of Europe to undertake the
observations of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, from which our
first accurate knowledge of the sun’s distance was obtained.

Those who are not familiar with practical astronomy may wonder
why the solar parallax can be got from Mars and Venus, but not from
Mercury or the sun itself. The explanation depends upon two facets.
Firstly, the nearest approach of these bodies to the earth is for Mars
33,874,000 miles, for Venus 23,654,000 miles, for Mereury 47,935,000
miles, and for the sun 91,239,000 miles. Consequently, for us Mars and
Venus have very much larger parallaxes than Mercury or the sun, and
of course the larger the parallax the easier it is to measure. Secondly,
even the largest of these parallaxes must be determined within far less
than one-tenth of a second of the truth, and while that degree of accu-
racy is possible in measuring short ares, it is quite unattainable in long
ones. Hence, one of the most essential conditions for the successful
measurement of parallaxes is that we shall be able to compare the
place of the near body with that of a more distant one situated in the
same region of the sky. In the case of Mars that can always be done
by making use of a neighboring star, but when Venus is near the earth
she is also so close to the sun that stars are not available, and conse-
quently her parallax can be satisfactorily measured only when her
position can be accurately referred to that of the sun, or, in other words,
only during her transits across the sun’s disk. But even when the two
bodies to be compared are sufficiently near each other, we are still
embarrassed by the fact that it is more difficult to measure the dis-
tance between the limb of a planet and a star or the limb of the sun
than it is to measure the distance between two stars, and since the dis-
covery of so many asteroids that circumstance has led to their use
for the determination of the solar parallax. Some of these bodies
approach within 75,250,000 miles of the earth’s orbit, and as they look
precisely like stars, the increased accuracy of pointing on them fully
makes up for their greater distance as compared with Mars or Venus.
_ After the Copernican system of the world and the Newtonian theory
of gravitation were accepted it soon became evident that trigonomet-

sm 94——7
98 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

rical measurements of the solar parallax might be supplemented by
determinations based on the theory of gravitation, and the first attempts
in that direction were made by Machin in 1729 and 'T. Mayer in 1753.
The measurement of the velocity of light*between points on the earth’s
surface, first effected by Fizeau in 1849, opened up still other possibili-
ties, and thus for determining the solar parallax we have at our com-
mand no less than three entirely distinct classes of methods, which are
known respectively as the trigonometrical, the gravitational, and the
photo-tachymetrical. We have already given a summary sketch of
the trigonometrical methods as applied by the ancient astronomers
to the dichotomy and shadow cone of the moon, and by the moderns to
Venus, Mars, and the asteroids, and we shall next glance briefly at the
gravitational and photo-tachymetrical methods.

The gravitational results which enter directly or indirectly into the
solar parallax are six in number, to wit: First, the relation of the moon’s
mass to the tides; second, the relation of the moon’s mass and parallax
to the force of gravity at the earth’s surface; third, the relation of the
solar parallax to the masses of the earth and moon; fourth, the rela-
tion of the solar and lunar parallaxes to the moon’s mass and parallac-
tic inequality; fifth, the relation of the solar and lunar parallaxes to
the moon’s mass and the earth’s lunar inequality; sixth, the relation of
the constants of nutation and precession to the moon’s parallax.

tespecting the first of these relations it is to be remarked that the
tide-producing forces are the attractions of the sun and moon upon the
waters of the ocean, and from the ratio of these attractions the moon’s
mass can readily be determined. But unfortunately the ratio of the
solar tides to the lunar tides is affected both by the depth of the sea
and by the character of the channels through which the water flows,
and for that reason the observed ratio of these tides requires multipli-
cation by a correcting factor in order to convert it into the ratio of the
forces. The matter is further complicated by this correcting factor
varying from port to port, and in order to get satisfactory results long
series of observations are necessary. The labor of deriving the moon’s
mass in this way was formerly so great that for more than half a cen-
tury Laplace’s determination from the tides at Brest remained unique;
but the recent application of harmonic analysis to the data supplied
by self-registering tide gauges is likely to yield abundant results in
the near future.

Our second gravitational relation, viz, that connecting the moon’s
mass and parallax with the force of gravity at the earth’s surface,
affords an indirect method of determining the moon’s parallax with
very great accuracy if the computation is carefully made, and with a
fair approximation to the truth even when the data are exceedingly
crude. To illustrate this, let us see what could be done with a railroad
transit such as is commonly used by surveyors, a steel tape, and a fairly
good watch. Neglecting small corrections due to the flattening of the

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 99

earth, the centrifugal force at its surface, the eccentricity of its orbit
and the mass of the moon, the law of gravitation shows that if we
multiply together the length of the seconds pendulum, the square of
the radius of the earth, and the square of the length of the sidereal
month, divide the product by four, and take the cube root of the quo-
tient, the result will be the distance from the earth to the moon. To
find the length of the seconds pendulum we would rate the watch by
means of the railroad transit, and then making a pendulum out of a
spherical leaden bullet suspended by a fine thread, we would adjust the
length of the thread until the pendulum made exactly three hundred
vibrations in five minutes by the watch. Then, supposing the experi-
ment to be made here or in New York City, we would find that the
distance from the point of suspension of the thread to the center of the
bullet was about 394 inches, and dividing that by the number of inches
in a mile, viz, 63,360, we would have for the length of the seconds pen-
dulum one sixteen hundred and twentieth of a mile. The next step
would be to ascertain the radius of the earth, and the quickest way
of doing so would probably be, first, to determine the latitude of some
point in New York City by means of the railroad transit; next to run
a traverse survey along the old post-road from New York to Albany,
and finally to determine the latitude of some point in Albany. The
traverse survey should surely be correct to one part in three hundred,
and as the distance between the two cities is about 2° the difference
of latitude might be determined to about the same percentage of
accuracy. In that way we would find the length of 2° of latitude to
be about 138 miles, whence the earth’s radius would be 3,953 miles. It
would then only remain to observe the time occupied by the moon in
making a sidereal revolution around the earth, or, in other words, the
time which she occupies in moving from any given star back to the same
star again. By noting that to within one-quarter of her own diameter
we would soon find that the time of revolution is about 27.52 days, and
multiplying that by the number of seconds in a day, viz, 86,400, we
would have for the length of the sidereal month 2,360,000 seconds.
With these data the computation would stand as follows: The radius
of the earth, 3,953 miles, multiplied by the length of a sidereal month,
2,360,000 seconds, and the product squared gives 87,060,000,000,000,-
000,000. Multiplying that by one-fourth of the length of the seconds
pendulum, viz, one sixty-four hundred and eightieth of a mile, and
extracting the cube root of the product, we would get 237,700 miles
_for the distance from the earth to the moon, which is only about 850
miles less than the truth, and certainly a remarkable result consider-
ing the crudeness of the instruments by which it might be obtained.
Nevertheless, when all the conditions are rigorously taken into account
these data are to be regarded as determining the relation between the
moon’s mass and parallax, rather than the parallax itself. .
100 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

Our third gravitational relation, to wit, that existing between the
solar parallax, the solar attractive force, and the masses of the earth
and moon, is analogous to the relation existing between the moon’s
mass and parallax and the force of gravity at the earth’s surface, but
itcan not be applied in exactly the same way on account of our inability
to swing a pendulum on the sun. Weare therefore compelled to adopt
some other method of determining the sun’s attractive force, and the
most available is that which consists in observing the perturbative
action of the earth and moon upon our nearest planetary neighbors—
Venus and Mars. From this action the law of gravitation enables us
to determine the ratio of the sun’s mass to the combined masses of the
earth and moon, and then the relation in question furnishes a means of
comparing the masses so found with trigonometrical determinations of
the solar parallax. Thus it appears that notwithstanding necessary
differences in the methods of procedure, the analogy between the sec-
ond and third gravitational relations holds not only with respect to
their theoretical basis, but also in their practical application, the one
being used to determine the relation between the mass of the moon and
its distance from the earth, and the other to determine the relation
between the combined masses of the earth and moon and their distance
from the sun.

Our fourth gravitational relation deals with the connection between
the solar parallax, the lunar parallax, the moon’s mass, and the moon’s
parallactic inequality. The important quantities are here the solar
parallax and the moon’s parallactic inequality, and although the deriva-
tion of the complete expression for the connection between them is a
little complicated, there is no difficulty in getting a general notion of
the forces involved. Asthe moon moves around the earth she is alter-
nately without and within the earth’s orbit. When she is without, the
sun’s attraction on her acts with that of the earth; when she is within,
the two attractions act in opposite directions. Thus in effect the cen-
tripetal force holding the moon to the earth is alternately increased and
diminished, with the result of elongating the moon’s orbit toward the
sun and compressing it on the opposite side. As the variation of the
centripetal force is not great, the change of form of the orbit is small;
nevertheless, the summation of the minute alterations thereby produced
in the moon’s orbital velocity suffices to put her sometimes ahead and
sometimes behind her mean place to an extent which oscillates from a
maximum toa minimum, as the earth passes from perihelion to aphelion,
and averages about 125’ of are. This perturbation of the moon is
known as the parallactic inequality, because it depends on the earth’s
distance from the sun, and can therefore be expressed in terms of the
solar parallax. Conversely, the solar parallax can be deduced from the
observed value of the parallactic inequality, but unfortunately there
are great practical difficulties in making the requisite observations with
a Sufficient degree of accuracy. Notwithstanding the ever-recurring

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 101

talk about the advantages to be obtained by observing a small, well-
defined crater instead of the moon’s limb, astronomers have hitherto
found it impracticable to use anything but the limb, and the disadvan-
tage of doing so, as compared with observing a star, is still further
increased by the circumstance that in general only one limb can be seen
at a time, the other being shrouded in darkness. If both limbs could
always be observed we should then have a uniform system of data for
determining the place of the center, but under existing circumstances
we are compelled to make our observations half upon one limb and half
upon the other, and thus they involve all the systematic errors which
may arise from the conditions under which these limbs are observed, and
all the uncertainty which attaches to irradiation, personal equation,
and our defective knowledge of the moon’s semidiameter.

Our fifth gravitational relation is that which exists between the solar
parallax, the lunar parallax, the moon’s mass, and the earth’s lunar ine-
quality. Strictly speaking the moon does not revolve around the earth’s
center, but both bodies revolve around the common center of gravity
of the two. In consequence of that an irregularity arises in the earth’s
orbital velocity around the sun, the common center of gravity moving
in accordance with the laws of elliptic motion, while the earth, on
account of its revolution around that center, undergoes an alternate
acceleration and retardation which has for its period a lunar month,
and is called the lunar inequality of the earth’s motion. We perceive
this inequality as an oscillation superposed on the elliptic motion of
the sun, and its semiamplitude is the measure of the angle subtended
at the sun by the interval between the center of the earth and the
common center of gravity of the earth and moon. Just as an astron-
omer on the moon might use the radius of her orbit around the earth
as a base for measuring her distance from the sun, so we may use this
interval for the same purpose. We find its length in miles from the
equatorial semidiameter of the earth, the moon’s parallax, and the
moon’s mass, and thus we have all the data for determining the solar
parallax from the inequality in question. In view of the great diffi-
culty which has been experienced in measuring the solar parallax itself,
it may be asked, Why we should attempt to deal with the parallactic
Inequality, which is about 26 per cent smaller? The answer is, Because
the latter is derived from differences of the sun’s right ascension,
which are furnished by the principal observatories in vast numbers,
and should give very accurate results on account of their being made
by methods which insure freedom from constant errors. Nevertheless,
the sun is not so well adapted for precise observations as the stars,
and Dr. Gill has recently found that heliometer measurements upon
asteroids which approach very near to the earth yield values of the
parallactic inequality superior to those obtained from right ascenSions
of the sun.

Our sixth gravitational relation is that which exists between the
moon’s parallax and the constants of precession and nutation. THvery
102 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

particle of the earth is attracted both by the sun and by the moon, but
in consequence of the polar flattening the resultant of these attractions
passes a little to one side of the earth’s center of gravity. Thus a
couple is set up, which, by its action upon the rotating earth, causes
the axis thereof to describe a surface which may be called a fluted cone,
with its apex at the earth’s center. <A top spinning with its axis
inclined describes a similar cone, except that the flutings are absent
and the apex is at the point upon which the spinning oceurs. For con-
venience of computation we resolve this action into two components,
and we name that which produces the cone the luni-solar precession,
and that which produces the flutings the nutation. In this phenomenon
the part played by the sun is comparatively small, and by eliminating
it we obtain a relation between the luni-solar precession, the nutation,
and the moon’s parallax which can be used to verify and correct the
observed values of these quantities.

In the preceding paragraph we have seen that the relation between
the quantities there considered depends largely upon the flattening of
the earth, and thus we are led to inquire how and with what degree
of accuracy that is determined. There are five methods—viz, one geo-
detic, one gravitational, and three astronomical. The geodetic method
depends upon measurements of the length of a degree on various parts
of the earth’s surface; and with the data hitherto accumulated it has
proved quite unsatisfactory. The gravitational method consists in
determining the length of the seconds pendulum over as great a range
of latitude as possible, and deducing therefrom the ratio of the earth’s
polar and equatorial semidiameters by means of Clairaut’s theorem.
The pendulum experiments show that the earth’s crust is less dense on
mountain plateaus than at the seacoast, and thus for the first time we
are brought into contact with geological considerations. The first
astronomical method consists in observing the moon’s parallax from
various points on the earth’s surface; and as these parallaxes are noth-
ing else than the angular semidiameter of the earth at the respective
points, as seen from the moon, they afford a direct measure of the flat-
tening. The second and third astronomical methods are based upon
certain perturbations of the moon which depend upon the tigure of the
earth, and should give extremely accurate results; but unfortunately
very great difficulties oppose themselves to the exact measurement of
the perturbations. There is also an astronomico-geological method
which can not yet be regarded as conclusive on account of our lack of
knowledge respecting the law of density which prevails in the interior
of the éarth. It is based upon the fact that a certain function of the
earth’s moments of inertia can be determined from the observed values
of the coefficients of precession and nutation, and could also be deter-
mined from the figure and dimensions of the earth if we knew the exact
distribution of matter in its interior. Our present knowledge on that
subject is limited to a superficial layer not more than 10 miles thick,

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 103

but it is usual to assume that the deeper matter is distributed, accord-
ing to Lagrange’s law, and then by writing the function in question in a
form which leaves the flattening indeterminate, and equating the expres-
sion so found to the value given by the precession and nutation, we
readily obtain the flattening. As yet these methods do not give con-
sistent results, and so long as serious discrepancies remain between
them there can be no security that we have arrived at the truth.

It should be remarked that in order to compute the function of the
earth’s moments of inertia which we have just been considering, we
require not only the figure and dimensions of the earth and the law of
distribution of density in its interier, but also its mean and surface
densities. The experiments for determining the mean density have
consisted in comparing the earth’s attraction with the attraction either
of a mountain or of a known thickness of the earth’s crust or of a
known mass of metal. In the case of mountains the comparisons have
been made with plumb lines and pendulums; in the case of known
layers of the earth’s crust they have been made by swinging pendu-
lums at the surface and down in mines; and in the case of known
masses of metal they have been made with torsion balances, fine chem-
ical balances, and pendulums. The surface density results from a study
of the materials composing the earth’s crust, but notwithstanding the
apparent simplicity of that process it is doubtful if we have yet
attained as accurate a result as in the case of the mean density.

Before quitting this part of our subject it is important to point out
that the luni-solar precession can not be directly observed, but must be
derived from the general precession. The former of these qualities
depends only upon the action of the sun and moon, while the latter is
affected in addition by the action of all the planets, and to ascertain
what that is we must determine their masses. The methods of doing
so fall into two great classes, according as the planets dealt with have
or have not satellites. The most favorable case is that in which one or
more satellites are present, because the mass of the primary follows
immediately from their distances and revolution times; but even then
there is a difficulty in the way of obtaining very exact results. By
extending the observations over sufficiently long periods the revolution
times may be ascertained with any desired degree of accuracy; but all
measurements of the distance of a satellite from its primary are
affected by personal equation, which we can not be sure of completely
eliminating, and thus a considerable margin of uncertainty is brought
into the masses. In the cases of Mereury and Venus, which have no
satellites, and to a certain extent in the case of the earth also, the only
available way of ascertaining the masses is from the perturbations
produced by the action of the various planets on each other. These
perturbations are of two kinds, periodic and secular. When sufficient
data have been accumulated for the exact determination of the secular
perturbations they will give the best results, but as yet it remains
advantageous to employ the periodic perturbations also.
104 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

Passing now to the photo-tachymetrical methods, we have first to
glance briefly at the mechanical appliances by which the tremendous
velocity of light has been successfully measured. They are of the sim-
plest possible character, and are based either upon a toothed wheel or
upon a revolving mirror.

The toothed-wheel method was first used by Fizeau, in 1849. To
understand its operation, imagine a gun barrel with a toothed wheel
revolving at right angles to its muzzle in such a way that the barrel is
alternately closed and opened as the teeth and the spaces between them
pass before it. Then, with the whee] in rapid motion, at the instant
when a space is opposite the muzzle let a ball be fired. It will pass out
freely, and after traversing a certam distance let it strike an elastic
cushion and be reflected back upon itsown path. When it reaches the
wheel, if it hits a space it will return into the gun barrel, but if it hits
a tooth it will be stopped. Examining the matter a little more closely
we see that, as the ball requires a certain time to go and return, if
during that time the wheel moves through an odd multiple of the angle
between a space and a tooth the ball will be stopped, while if it moves
through an even multiple of that angle the ball will return into the
barrel. Now imagine the gun barrel, the ball, and the elastic cushion to
be replaced, respectively, by a telescope, a light wave, and a mirror.
Then if the wheel moved at such a speed that the returning light wave
struck against the tooth following the space through which it issued, to
an eye looking into the telescope all would be darkness. If the wheel
moved a little faster and the returning light wave passed through the
space succeeding that through which it issued, the eye at the telescope
would perceive a flash of light, and if the speed was continuously
increased a continual succession of eclipses and illuminations would
follow each other according as the returning light was stopped against
a tooth or passed through a space farther and farther behind that
through which it issued. Under these conditions the time occupied by
the light in traversing the space from the wheel to the mirror and back
again would evidently be the same as the time required by the wheel
to revolve through the angle between the space through which the light
issued and that through which it returned, and thus the velocity of
light would become known from the distance between the telescope and
the mirror, together with the speed of the wheel. Of course the longer
the distance traversed and the greater the velocity of the wheel the
more accurate would be the result.

The revolving-mirror method was first used by Foucault in 1862.
Conceive the toothed wheel of Fizeau’s apparatus to be replaced by a
mirror attached to a vertical axis and capable of being put into rapid
rotation. Then it will be possible so to arrange the apparatus that
light issuing from the telescope shall strike the movable mirror and be
reflected to the distant mirror, whence it will be returned to the moy-
able mirror again, and being thrown back into the telescope will appear

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 105

as a star in the center of the field of view. That adjustment being
made, if the mirror were caused to revolve at a speed of some hundred
turns per second it would move through an appreciable angle while the
light was passing from it to the distant mirror and back again, and in
accordance with the laws of reflection, the star in the field of the tele-
scope would move from the center by twice the angle through which
the mirror had turned. Thus the deviation of the star from the center
of the field would measure the angle through which the mirror turned
during the time occupied by light in passing twice over the interval
between the fixed and revolving mirrors, and from the magnitude of
that angle, together with the known speed of the mirror, the velocity
of the light could be calculated.

In applying either of these methods the resulting velocity is that of
light when traversing the earth’s atmosphere, but what we want is its
velocity in space, which we suppose to be destitute of ponderable
material, and in order to obtain that the velocity in the atmosphere
must be multiplied by the refractive index of air. The correct velocity
so obtained can then be used to find the solar parallax, either from the
time required by light to traverse the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit,
or from the ratio of the velocity of light to the orbital velocity of the
earth.

Any periodic correction which occurs in computing the place of a
heavenly body or the time of a celestial phenomenon is called by
astronomers an equation, and as the time required by light to traverse
the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit first presented itself in the guise of
a correction to the computed times of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites,
it has received the name of the light equation. The earth’s orbit being
interior to that of Jupiter, and both having the sun for their center, it
is evident that the distances between the two planets must vary from
the sum to the difference of the radii of their respective orbits, and the
time required by light to travel from one planet to the other must vary
proportionately. Consequently, if the observed times of the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites are compared with the times computed upon the
assumption that the two planets are always separated by their mean
distance, it will be found that the eclipses occur too early when the
earth is at less than its mean distance from Jupiter, and too late when
it is farther off, and from large numbers of such observations the value
of the light equation has been deduced.

The combination of the motion of light through our atmosphere with
the orbital motion of the earth gives rise to the annual aberration, all
the phases of which are computed from its maximum value, commonly
called the constant of aberration. There is also a diurnal aberration
due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, but that is quite small and
does not concern us this evening. When aberration was discovered
the corpuscular theory of light was in vogue, and it offered a charm-
ingly simple explanation of the whole phenomenon. The hypothetical
106 - ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

light corpuscles impinging upon the earth were thought to behave pre-
cisely like the drops in a shower of rain, and you all know that their
apparent direction is affected by any motion on the part of the observer.
In acalm day, when the drops are falling perpendicularly, a man stand-
ing still holds his umbrella directly over his head, but as soon as he
begins to move forward he inclines his umbrella in the same direction,
and the more rapidly he moves the greater must be its inclination in
order to meet the descending shower. Similarly, the apparent direc-
tion of oncoming light corpuscles would be affected by the orbital
motion of the earth, so that in effect it would always be the resultant
arising from combining the motion of the light with a motion equal and
opposite to that of the earth. But since the falsity of the corpuscular
theory has been proved that explanation is no longer tenable, aud as
yet we have not been able to replace it with anything equally satis-
factory based on the now universally accepted undulatory theory. In
accordance with the latter theory we must conceive the earth as plow-
ing its way through the ether, and the point which has hitherto baffled
us is whether or not in so doing it produces any disturbance of the ether
which affects the aberration. In our present ignorance on that point
we can only say that the aberration constant 1s certainly very nearly |
equal to the ratio of the earth’s orbital velocity to the velocity of light,
but we can not affirm that it is rigorously so.

The luminiferous ether was invented to account for the phenomena
of light, and for two hundred years it was not suspected of having any
other function. The emission theory postulated only the corpuscles
which constitute light itself, but the undulatory theory fills all space
with an imponderable substance possessing properties even more
remarkable than those of ordinary matter, and to some of the acutest
intellects the magnitude of this idea has proved an almost insuperable
objection against the whole theory. So late as 1862 Sir David Brews-
ter, who had gained a world-wide reputation by his optical researches,
expressed himself as staggered by the notion of filling all space with
some substance merely to enable a little twinkling star to send its
light to us; but not long after Clerk Maxwell removed that difficulty
by a discovery coextensive with the undulatory theory itself. Since
1845, when Faraday first performed his celebrated experiment of mag-
netizing a ray of light, the idea that electricity is a phenomenon of the
ether had been steadily growing, until at last Maxwell perceived that
if such were the fact the rate of propagation of an electro-magnetic
wave must be the same as the velocity of light. At that time no one
knew how to generate such waves, but Maxwell’s theory showed him
that their velocity must be equal to the number of electric units of
quantity in the electro-magnet unit, and careful experiments soon proved
that that is the velocity of light. Thus it was put almost beyond the
possibility of doubt that the ether gives rise to the phenomena of elec-
tricity and magnetism as well as to those of light, and perhaps it may

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 107

even be concerned in the production of gravitation itself. What could
be apparently more remote than these electric quantities and the solar
parallax? And yet we have here a relation between them, but we
make no use of it because as yet the same relation can be far more
accurately determined from experiments upop the velocity of light.

Now, let us recall the quantities and methods of observation which
we have found to be involved, either directly or indirectly, with the
solar parallax. They are, the solar parallax, obtained from transits of
Venus, oppositions of Mars, and oppositions of certain asteroids; the
lunar parallax, found both directly and from measurements of the force
of gravity at the earth’s surface; the constants of precession, nutation,
and aberration, obtained from observations of the stars; the parallac-
tic inequality of the moon; the lunar inequality of the earth, usually
obtained from observations of the sun, but recently found from heli-
ometer observations of certain asteroids; the mass of the earth, found
from the solar parallax and also from the periodic and secular pertur-
bations of Venus and Mars; the mass of the moon, found from the
lunar inequality of the earth and also from the ratio of the solar and
lunar components of the ocean tides; the masses of all the planets,
obtained from observations of their satellites whenever possible, and
when no satellites exist, then from observations of their mutual pertur-
bations, both periodic and secular; the velocity of light, obtained from
experiments with revolving mirrors and toothed wheels, together with
laboratory determinations of the index of refraction of atmospheric
air; the light equation, obtained from observations of the eclipses of
Jupiter’s satellites; the figure of the earth, obtained from geodetic
triangulations, measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum
in various latitudes, and observations of certain perturbations of the
moon; the mean density of the earth, obtained from measurements of
the attractions of mountains, from pendulum experiments in mines,
and from experiments on the attraction of known masses of matter
made either with torsion balances or with the most delicate chemical
balances; the surface density of the earth, obtained from geological
examinations of the surface strata; and, lastly, the law of distribution
of density in the interior of the earth, which in the present state of
geological knowledge we can do little more than guess at.

Here, then, we have a large group of astronomical, geodetic, geological
and physical quantities which must all be considered in finding the
solar parallax, and which are all so entangled with each other that no
one of them can be varied without affecting all the rest. It is there-
fore impossible to make an accurate determination of any one of them
apart from the remainder of the group, and thus we are driven to the
conclusion that they must all be determined simultaneously. Such has
not been the practice of astronomers in the past, but it is the method
to which they must inevitably resort in the future. A cursory glance
at an analogous problem occurring in geodesy may be instructive.
108 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

When a country is covered with a net of triangles it is always found
that the observed angles are subject to a certain amount of error, and
a century ago it was the habit to correct the angles in each triangle
without much regard to the effect upon adjacent triangles. Conse-
quently the adjustment of the errors was imperfect, and in computing
the interval between any two distant points the result would vary some-
what with the triangles used in the computation—that is, if one compu-
tation was made through a chain of triangles running around on the
right-hand side, another through a chain of triangles running straight
between the two points, and a third through a chain of triangles run-
ning around on the left-hand side, the results were usually all different.
At that time things were less highly specialized than now, and all geo-
detic operations were yet in the hands of first-rate astronomers, who
soon devised processes for overcoming the difficulty. They imagined
every observed angle to be subject to a small correction, and as these
corrections were all entangled with each other through the geometrical
conditions of the net, by a most ingenious application of the method of
least squares they determined them all simultaneously in such a way as
to satisfy the whole of the geometrical conditions. Thus the best posst-
ble adjustment was obtained, and no matter what triangles were used
in passing from one point to another, the result was always the same.
That method is now applied to every important triangulation, and its
omission would be regarded as proof of incompetency on the part of
those in charge of the work.

Now let us compare the conditions existing respectively in a trian-
gulation net and in the group of quantities for the determination of the
solar parallax. In the net every angle is subject to a small correction,
and the whole system of corrections must be so determined as to make
the sum of their weighted squares a minimum and at the same time
satisfy all the geometrical conditions of the net. Like the triangles,
the quantities composing the group from which the solar parallax must
be determined are all subject to error, and therefore we must regard
each of them as requiring a small correction, and all these corrections
must be so determ.ned as to make the sum of their weighted squares a
minimum, and at the same time satisfy every one of the equations
expressing the relations between the various components of the group.

Thus it appears that the method required for adjusting the solar par-
allax and its related constants is in all respects the same as that which
has so long been used for adjusting systems of triangulation, and as
the latter method was invented by astronomers, it is natural to inquire
Why have they not applied it to the fundamental problem of their own
science? The reasons are various, but they may all be classed under
two heads: First, an inveterate habit of overestimating the accuracy
of our own work as compared with that of others; and second, the
unfortunate effect of too much specialization.
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 109

The prevailing opinion certainly is that great advances have recently
been made in astronomy, and so they have in the fields of spectral
analysis and in the measurement of minute quantities of radiant heat;
but the solution of the vast majority of astronomical problems depends
upon the exact measurement of angles, and in that little or no progress
has been made. Bradley, with his zenith sector a hundred and fifty
years ago, and Bessel and Struve, with their circles and transit instru-
ments seventy years ago, made observations not sensibly inferior to
those of the present day, and indeed it would have been surprising if
they had not done so. The essentials for accurately determining star
places are a skilled observer, a clock, and a transit circle, the latter
consisting of a telescope, a divided circle, and four micrometer micro-
scopes. Surely no one will claim that we have to-day any more skillful
observers than were Bessel, Bradley, and Struve, and the only way in
which we have improved upon the telescopes made by Dollond one
hundred and thirty years ago is by increasing their aperture and rela-
tively diminishing their focal distance. The most famous dividing
engine now in existence was made by the elder Repsold seventy-five
years ago; but as the errors of divided circles and their micrometer
microscopes are always carefully determined, the accuracy of the meas-
ured angles is quite independent of any small improvement in the
accuracy of the divisions or of the micrometer screws. Only in the
matter of clocks has there been some advance, and even that is not
very great. On the whole, the star places of to-day are a little better
than those of seventy-five years ago, but even yet there is great room
for improvement. One of the commonest applications of these star
places is to the determination of latitude, but it is very doubtful if
there is any point on the face of the earth whose latitude is known
certainly within one-tenth of a second.

Looking at the question from another point of view, it is notorious
that the contact observations of the transits of Venus in 1761 and L769
were so discordant that from the same observations Encke and E. J.
Stone got respectively for the solar parallax 8.59’ and 8.91’... In 1870
no one thought it possible that there could be any difficulty with the
contact observations of the then approaching transits of 1874 and 1882,
but we have found from sad experience that our vaunted modern instru-
ments gave very little better results for the last pair of transits than
our predecessors obtained with much cruder appliances in 1761 and 1769,

The theory of probability and uniform experience alike show that the
limit of accuracy attainable with any instrument is soon reached; and
yet we all know the fascination which continually lures us on in our
efforts to get better results out of the familiar telescopes and circles
which have constituted the standard equipment of observatories for
nearly a century. Possibly these instruments may be capable of indi-
cating somewhat smaller quantities than we have hitherto succeeded
110 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

in measuring with them, but their limit can not be far off, because they
already show the disturbing effects of slight inequalities of temperature
and other uncontrollable causes. So far as these effects are accidental
they eliminate themselves from every long series of observations, but
there always remains a residuum of constant error, perhaps quite
unsuspected, which gives us no end of trouble. Encke’s value of the
solar parallax affords a fine illustration.of this. From the transits of
Venus in 1761 and 1769 he found 8.58” in 1824, which he subsequently
corrected to 8.57’, and for thirty years that value was universally
accepted. The first objection to it came from Hansen in 1854, a second
followed from Leverrier in 1858, both based upon facts connected with
the lunar theory, and eventually it became evident that Encke’s parallax
was about one-fourth of a second too small. :

Now please observe that Encke’s value was obtained trigonometric-
ally, and its inaccuracy was never suspected until it was revealed by
eravitational methods, which were themselves in error about one-tenth
of a second and required subsequent correction in other ways. Here,
then, was a lesson to astronomers, who are all more or less specialists,
but it merely enforced the perfectly well-known principle .that the con-
stant errors of any one method are accidental errors with respect to all
other methods, and therefore the readiest way of eliminating them is
by combining the results from as many different methods as possible.
However, the abler the specialist the more certain he is to be blind to
all methods but his own, and astronomers have profited so little by the
Encke-Hansen-Leverrier incident of thirty-five years ago that to-day
they are mostly divided into two great parties, one of whom holds that
the parallax can be best determined from a combination of the constant
of aberration with the velocity of light and the other believes only in
the results of heliometer measurements upon asteroids. By all means
continue the heliometer measurements and do everything possible to
clear up the mystery which now surrounds the constant of aberration,
but why ignore the work of predecessors who were quite as able as
ourselves? If it were desired to determine some one angle of a triangu-
lation net with special exactness, what would be thought of a man who
attempted to do so by repeated measurements of the angle in question
while he persistently neglected to adjust the net? And yet until
very recently astronomers have been doing precisely that kind of
thing with the solar parallax. Ido not think there is any exaggeration
in saying that the trustworthy observations now on record for the
determination of the numerous quantities which are functions of the
parallax could not, be duplicated by the most industrious astronomer
working continuously for a thousand years. How, then, can we suppose
that the result properly deducible from them can be materially affected
by anything that any of us can do in a lifetime unless we are fortunate
enough to invent methods of measurement vastly superior to any

ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. Peat

hitherto imagined? Probably the existing observations for the deter-
mination of most of these quantities are as exact as any that can ever
be made with our present instruments, and if they were freed from
constant errors they would certainly give results very near the truth.
To that end we have only to form a system of simultaneous equations
between all the observed quantities and then deduce the most probable
values of these quantities by the method of least squares. Perhaps
some of you may think that the value so obtained for the solar parallax
would depend largely upon the relative weights assigned to the various
quantities, but such is not the case. With almost any possible system
of weights the solar parallax will come out very nearly 8.809” + 0.0057’,
whence we have for the mean distance between the earth and the sun
92,797,000 miles, with a probable error of only 59,700 miles; and for
the diameter of the solar system, measured to its outermost member,
the planet Neptune, 5,578,400,000 miles.
SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS!

By WILLIAM H. PICKERING.

It is probable that the astronomer whose name is most closely linked
with the planet Mars at the present time is Giovanni Schiaparelli;
and yet, although nearly everybody has heard of Schiaparelli’s canals,
very few astronomers even, outside of France and Italy, had until
recently more than a very vague notion what were really his ideas in
regard to them. This is due probably to the fact that he has written
exclusively in Italian, a language which very few American astrono-
mers, and I believe very few English ones, understand. To this fact
chiefly, I think, is due the great incredulity with which his observa-
tions have been treated, at least until recently, in both of these coun-
tries. Astronomers could understand his maps; they knew, therefore,
what he had done, but they could not understand his descriptions of
his observations, and so were incredulous regarding their accuracy.
Moreover, such a mass‘of detail appeared upon his maps, which had
not before been seen by others, that it completely masked the more
striking features of the planet, thus rendering its appearance entirely
different from that which it presented in the telescope under ordinary
atmospheric conditions.

But within the last few years a change has occurred. Flammarion
has translated a large part of Schiaparelli’s writings into French, a
language with which most English speaking astronomers are familiar,
and moreover the canals have been seen by a number of astronomers
whose descriptions of them in Englsh and French could be under-
stood and were found to agree with those of Schiaparelli.

But errors are still frequently made by people who might be expected
to know better. Thus, many people suppose that Schiaparelli was the
original discoverer of the canals, a claim which he never made for him-
self. In point of fact, some of them appear upon maps of the planet
published more than fifty years ago. The former English incredulity
in the matter seems the more strange, smce many of the canals were
seen by Dawes in 1864 and by Burton and Dreyer in 1879. Schia-
parelli, however, has discovered far more canals than anyone else, and
he is also the discoverer of their gemination.

In this connection it may be that a brief chronological statement of
the more important facts and discoveries relating to Mars will not be
without interest. In compiling it I have been chiefly indebted to Flam-
marion’s classic work, La Planéte Mars, although other sources have
also been consulted.

272 B. C. The first known observation of Mars is recorded in Ptol-
emy’s Almagest.

1610 A. D. The phases of Mars were discovered by Galileo.

1659, The first sketch showing surface detail was made by Huy-
gens. He also suggested a rotation in twenty-four hours.

1666. Cassini determined the rotation of Mars to take place in
twenty-tour hours and forty minutes. Healso observed the polar caps,
and “he distinguished on the disk of Mars, near the terminator, a
white spot advancing into the dark portion, and representing, without
doubt, like those of the moon, a roughness or irregularity of the sur-
face.” This latter statement is curious, but the effect was undoubtedly
due to irradiation, since his telescope was entirely inadequate to enable
him to observe such a delicate phenomenon.

1777. With the exception of Huygens, Hooke, and possibly Maraldi,
no one succeeded in making recognizable sketches of the surface detail
upon Mars for over a century, until Sir William Herschel took the mat-
ter up in this year.

1783. Sir William Herschel detected the variation of the size of the
polar snoweaps with the seasons, measured the polar compression, and
determined the inclination of the axis of the planet to its orbit.

1785-1802. Schroeter made an extended study of the planet. His
drawings are upon the whole rather better than those of Herschel. He
discovered, among other things, the very dark spots to which I have
referred in my publications as the Northern and Equatorial Seas. He,
however, supposed them to be clouds.

1840. Beer and Maedler published the first map of the planet, assign-
ing latitudes and longitudes to the various markings. On this map are
indicated the first canals and the first of the small lakes, so many of
which have been discovered during the last few years. The canals are
Nectar and Agathodzemon and portions of Hades and Tartarus. The
lake is Lacus Pheenicis. Their map is the first: satisfactory represen-
tation of the entire surface of the planet. The only region which pre-
vious observers had clearly distinguished was that in the vicinity of
the Syrtis Major.

1858. Secchi made a careful study of the colors exhibited by the
planet.

1862. Lockyer made the first series of really good sketches of the
planet, showing all the characteristic forms with which we are now so
familiar. His drawings, and also those of some of the other observers,
give the first indications of the appearance of the central branch-in
the Y, so called by Secchi.

1864. Dawes detected eight or ten of the canals.

1867. Huggins detected lines due to the presence of water vapor in
the spectrum of Mars.

1867. Proctor determined the period of rotation of Mars within 0.1
second.

1877. Hall discovered the two satellites of Mars.

1877. Green made a very excellent series of drawings of the planet,
superior to anything which had preceded them.

1877. Schiaparelli made the first extensive triangulation of the sur-
face of the planet, and added very largely to the number of known
canals.

1879. Schiaparelli detected the gemination of Nilus, the first known
double canal.

1882. Schiaparelli discovered numerous double canals, and announced
that the appearance formed one of the characteristic phenomena of the
planet.

The most reliable confirmation of this phenomenon hitherto reported
has come from Perrotin, of Nice, and A. Stanley Williams, in England.
If Schiaparelli’s theory is correct, that the duplication occurs only
between the spring and autumn equinoxes of the Northern Hemisphere,
the last opportunity to witness it was in 1890, and the next will be in
January and February of 1895, unless the planet proves to be too
remote at that period.

Very few of Schiaparelli’s writings have ever been translated into
English, and none so far as I know, hitherto, without the intervention
of some other language, such as German or French. The following
translation is from Natura ed Arte for February 15, 1893. It gives
the latest expression of his views upon the periodical inundations expe-
rienced by the planet, upon the nature of the seas, the canals, and the
gemination of the latter.

LOWELL OBSERVATORY, FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ., August 26, 1894.

THE PLANET MARS.
By GIOVANNI SCHIAPARELLI.

Many of the first astronomers who studied Mars with the telescope
had noted on the outline of its disk two brilliant white spots of rounded
form and of variable size. In process of time it was observed that
while the ordinary spots upon Mars were displaced rapidly in conse-
quence of its daily rotation, changing in a few hours both their posi-
tion and their perspective, the two white spots remained sensibly
motionless at their posts. It was concluded rightly from this that
116 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

they must occupy the poles of rotation of the planet, or at least must
be found very near to them. Consequently they were given the name
of polar caps or spots. And not without reason is it conjectured that
these represent upon Mars that immense mass of snow and ice which
still to-day prevents navigators from reaching the poles of the earth.
We are led to this conelusion not only by the analogy of aspect and of
place, but also by another important observation. - -— -

As things stand, it is manifest that if the above-mentioned white
polar spots of Mars represent snow and ice they should continue to
decrease in size with the approach of summer in those places and
increase during the winter. Now this very fact is observed in the
most evident manner. In the second half of the year 182 the south-
ern polar cap was in full view; during that interval, and especially in
the months of July and August, its rapid diminution from week to week
was very evident even to those observing with common telescopes.
This snow (for we may well call it so), which in the beginning reached
as far as latitude 70° and formed a cap of over 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) in diameter, progressively diminished, so that two or three months
later little more of it remained than an area of perhaps 300 kilometers
(180 miles) at the most, and still less was seen in the last days of 1892.
In these months the southern hemisphere of Mars had its summer,
the summer solstice occurring upon October 13. Correspondingly the
mass of snow surrounding the northern pole should have increased;
but this fact was not observable, since that pole was situated in the
hemisphere of Mars which was opposite to that facing the earth. The
melting of the northern snow was seen in its turn in the years L882,
1884, and 1886.

These observations of the alternate increase and decrease of the polar
snows are easily made even with telescopes of moderate power, but
they become much more interesting and instructive when we can follow
assiduously the changes in their more minute particulars, using larger
instruments. The snowy regions are then seen to be successively
notched at their edges; black holes and huge fissures are formed in
their interiors; great isolated pieces many miles in extent stand out
from the principal mass and, dissolving, disappear a little later. In
short, the same divisions and movements of these icy fields present
themselves to us at a glance that occur during the summer of our own
arctic regions, according to the descriptions of explorers.

The southern snow, however, presents this peculiarity: The center
of its irregularly rounded figure does not coincide exactly with the pole,
but is situated at another point, which is nearly always the same, and
is distant from the pole about 300 kilometers (180 miles) in the diree-
tion of the Mare Erythreum. From this we conclude that when the
area of the snow is reduced to its smallest extent the south pole of
Mars is uncovered, and therefore, perhaps, the problem of reaching
it upon this planet is easier than upon the earth. The southern snow

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 117

is in the midst of a huge dark spot, which with its branches occupies
nearly one-third of the whole surface of Mars, and is supposed to repre-
sent its principal ocean. Hence the analogy with our arctic and
antarctic snows may be said to be complete, and especially so with the
antarctie one.

The mass of the northern snow cap of Mars is, on the other hand,
centered almost exactly upon its pole. It is located in a region of
yellow color, which we are accustomed to consider as representing the
continent of the planet. rom this arises a singular phenomenon which
has no analogy upon the earth. At the melting of the snows accumu-
lated at that pole during the long night of ten months and more the
liquid mass produced in that operation is diffused around the cireum-
ference of the snowy region, converting a large zone of surrounding
land into a temporary sea and filling all the lower regions. This pro-
duces a gigantic inundation, which has led some observers to suppose
the existence of another ocean in those parts, but which does not really
exist in that place, at least as a permanent sea. We see then (the last
opportunity was in 1884) the white spot of the snow surrounded by a
dark zone, which follows its perimeter in its progressive diminution,
upon a circumference ever more and more narrow. The outer part of
this zone branches out into dark lines, which occupy all the surround-
ing region, and seem to be distributary canals by which the liquid
mass may return to its natural position. This produces in these regions
very extensive lakes, such as that designated upon the map by the name
of Lacus Hyperboreus; the neighboring interior sea called Mare Acida-
lium becomes more black and more conspicuous. And it is to be
remembered as a very probable thing that the flowing of this melted
snow is the cause which determines principally the hydrographic state
of the planet and the variations that are periodically observed in its
aspect. Something similar would be seen upon the earth if one of our
poles came to be located suddenly in the center of Asia or of Africa.
As things stand at present, we may find a miniature image of these
conditions in the flooding that is observed in our streams at the melt-
ing of the Alpine snows.

Travelers in the arctic regions have frequent occasion to observe how
the state of the polar ice at the beginning of the summer, and even at
the beginning of July,is always very unfavorable to their progress.
The best season for exploration is in the month of August, and Sep-
tember is the month in which the trouble from the ice is the least.
Thus in September our Alps are usually more practicable than at any
other season. And the reason for it is clear—the melting of the snow
requires time; a high temperature is not sufficient; it 1s necessary that
it should continue, and its effect will be so much the greater, as 1t is
the more prolonged. Thus, if we could slow down the course of our
season so that each month should last sixty days instead of thirty, in
the summer, in such a lengthened condition, the melting of the ice
118 SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

would progress much further, and perhaps it would not be an exagger-
ation to say that the polar cap at the end of the warm season would
be entirely destroyed. But one can not doubt, in any case, that the
fixed portion of such a cap would be reduced to much smaller size, than
we see it to-day. Now, this is exactly what happens on Mars. The
long year, nearly double our own, permits the ice to accumulate during
the polar night of ten or twelve months, so as to descend in the form of
a continuous layer as far as parallel 70°, or even farther. But in the
day which follows, of twelve or ten months, the sun has time to melt
all, or nearly all, of the snow of recent formation, reducing it to such a
small area that it seems to us no more than a very white point. And
perhaps this snow is entirely destroyed; but of this there is at present
no satisfactory observation.

Other white spots of a transitory character and of a less regular
arrangement are formed in the southern hemisphere upon the islands
near the pole, and also in the opposite hemisphere whitish regions
appear at times surrounding the north pole and reaching to 50° and
55° of latitude. They are, perhaps, transitory snows, similar to those
which are observed in our latitudes. But also in the torrid zone of
Mars are seen some very small white spots more or less persistent;
among others one was seen by me in three consecutive oppositions
(1877-1882) at the point indicated upon our chart by longitude 268°
and latitude 16° north. Perhaps we may be permitted to imagine in
this place the existence of a mountain capable of supporting extensive
ice fields. ‘The existence of such a mountain has also been suggested
by some recent observers upon other grounds.

As has been stated, the polar snows of Mars prove in an incontro-
vertible manner that this planet, like the earth, is surrounded by an
atmosphere capable of transporting vapor from one place to another.
These snows are in fact precipitations of vapor, condensed by the cold,
and carried with it successively. How carried with it if not by atmos-
pheric movement? The existence of an atmosphere charged with
vapor has been confirmed also by spectroscopic observations, princi-
pally those of Vogel, according to which this atmosphere must be of a
composition differing little from our own, and, above all, very rich in
aqueous vapor. This is a fact of the highest importance, because from
it we can rightly affirm with much probability that to water and to no
other liquid is due the seas of Mars and its polar snows. When this
conclusion is assured beyond all doubt, another one may be derived
from it of not less importance—that the temperature of the Arean cli-
mate, notwithstanding the greater distance of that planet from the
sun, is of the same order as the temperature of the terrestrial one.
Because, if it were true, as has been supposed by some investigators,
that the temperature of Mars was on the average very low (from 50°
to 60° below zero), it would not be possible for water vapor to be an
important element in the atmosphere of that planet, nor could water

SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 119

be an important factor in its physical changes, but would give place
to carbonic acid, or to some other liquid whose freezing point was
much lower.

The elements of the meteorology of Mars seem, then, to have a close
analogy to those of the earth. But there are not lacking, as might be
expected, causes of dissimilarity. From circumstances of the smallest
moment nature brings forth an infinite variety in its operations. Of
the greatest influence must be different arrangement of the seas and
the continents upon Mars and upon the earth, regarding which a
glance at the map will say more than would be possible in many words.
We have already emphasized the fact of the extraordinary periodical
flood, which at every revolution of Mars inundates the northern polar
region at the melting of the snow. Let us now add that this inun-
dation is spread out to a great distance by means of a network of
canals, perhaps constituting the principal mechanism (if not the only
one) by which water (and with it organic life) may be diffused over
the arid surface of the planet. Because on Mars it rains very rarely,
or perhaps even it does not rain at all. And this is the proof.

Let us carry ourselves in imagination into celestial space, to a point
so distant from the earth that we may embrace it all at a single glance.
He would be greatly in error who had expected to see reproduced there
upon a great scale the image of our continents with their gulfsS and
islands and with the seas that surround them which are seen upon our
artificial globes. Then without doubt the known forms or part of them
would be seen to appear under a vaporous veil, but a great part (per-
haps one-half) of the surface would he rendered invisible by the
immense fields of cloud, continually varying in density, in form, and
in extent. Such a hindrance, most frequent and continuous in the
polar regions, would still impede nearly half the time the view of the
temperate zones, distributing itself in capricious and ever varying con-
figurations. The seas of the torrid zone would be seen to be arranged
in long parallel layers, corresponding to the zone of equatorial and
tropical calms. For ar observer placed upon the moon the study of
our geography would not be so simple an undertaking as one might at
first imagine.

There is nothing of this sort in Mars. In every climate and under
every zone its atmosphere is nearly perpetually clear and sufficiently
transparent to permit one to recognize at any moment whatever the
contours of the seas and continents and, more than that, even the minor
configurations. Not indeed that vapors of a certain degree of opacity
are lacking, but they offer very little impediment to the study of the
topography of the planet. Here and there we see appear from time to
time a few whitish spots, changing their position and their form, rarely
extending over a very wide area. They frequent by preference a few
regions, such as the islands of the Mare Australe, and on the conti-
nents the regions designated on the map with the names of Elysium
120 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

and Tempe. Their brilliancy generally diminishes and disappears at
the meridian hour of the place, and is reenforced in the morning and
evening with very marked variations. It is possible that they may be
layers of cloud, because the upper portions of terrestrial clouds where
they are illuminated by the sun appear white. But various observa-
tions lead us to think that we are dealing rather with a thin veil of fog
instead of a true nimbus cloud, carrying storms and rain. Indeed, it
may be merely a temporary condensation of vapor under the torm of
dew or hoar frost.

Accordingly, as far as we may be permitted to argue from the
observed facts, the climate of Mars must resemble that of a clear day
upon a high mountain. By day a very strong solar radiation, hardly
mitigated at all by mist or vapor; by night a copious radiation from the
soil toward celestial space, and because of that a very marked refriger-
ation. Hence a climate of extremes, and great changes of temperature
from day to night, and from one season to another. And as on the
earth at altitudes of 5,000 and 6,000 meters (17,000 to 20,000 feet) the
vapor of the atmosphere is condensed only into the solid form, produe-
ing those whitish masses of suspended crystals which we eall cirrus
clouds, so in the atmosphere of Mars it would be rarely possible (or
would even be impossible) to find collections of cloud capable of pro-
ducing rain of any consequence. The variation of the temperature
from one season to another would be notably increased by their long
duration, and thus we can understand the great freezing and melting
of the snow, which is renewed in turn at the poles at each complete
revolution of the planet around the sun.

As our chart demonstrates, in its general topography Mars does not
present any analogy with the earth. A third of its surface is occupied
by the great Mare Australe, which is strewn with many islands, and
the continents are cut up by gulfs and ramifications of various forms.
To the general water system belongs an entire series of small internal
seas, of which the Hadriacum and the Tyrrhenum communicate with it
by wide mouths, whilst the Cimmerium, the Sirenum, and the Solis
Lacus are connected with it only by means of narrow canals. We shall
notice in the first four a parallel arrangement, which certainly is not
accidental, as also not without reason is the corresponding position of
the peninsulas of Ausonia, Hesperia, and Atlantis. The color of the
seas of Mars is generally brown, mixed with gray, but not always of
equal intensity in all places, nor is it the same in the same place at all
times. From an absolute black it may descend to a light-gray or to an
ash color. Such a diversity of colors may have its origin in various
causes, and is not without analogy also upon the earth, where it is noted
that the seas of the warm zone are usually much darker than those
nearer the pole. The water of the Baltic, for example, has a light,
muddy color that is not observed in the Mediterranean. And thus in

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. Lt

the seas of Mars we see the color become darker when the sun approaches
their zenith, and summer begins to rule in that region.

All of the remainder of the planet, as far as the north pole, is occu-
pied by the mass of the continents, in which, save in afew areas of. rel-
atively small extent, an orange color predominates, which sometimes
reaches a dark red tint, and in others descends to yellow and white.
The variety in this coloring is in part of meteorological origin, in part
it may depend on the diverse nature of the soil, but upon its real cause
it is not as yet possible to frame any very well grounded hypothesis.
Nevertheless, the cause of this predominance of the red and yellow
tints upon the surface of ancient Pyrois is well known.' Some have
thought to attribute this coloring to the atmosphere of Mars, through
which the surface of the planet might be seen colored, as any terres-
trial object becomes red when seen through red glass. But many facts
are opposed to this idea, among others that the polar snows appear
always of the purest white, although the rays of light derived from
them traverse twice the atmosphere of Mars under great obliquity.
We must then conclude that the Arean continents appear red and
yellow because they are so in fact.

Besides these dark and light regions, which we have described as
seas and continents, and of whose nature there is at present scarcely
left any room for doubt, some others exist, truly of small extent, of an
amphibious nature, which sometimes appear yellowish like the con-
tinents, and are sometimes clothed in brown (even black in certain
cases), and assume the appearance of seas, whilst in other cases their
color is intermediate in tint, and leaves us in doubt to which class of
regions they may belong. Thus all the islands scattered through the
Mare Australe and the Mare Erythreeum belong to this category; so
too the long peninsula called Deucalionis Regio and Pyrrhe Regio,
and in the vicinity of the Mare Acidalium the regions designated by
the names of Baltia and Nerigos. The most natural idea, and the one
to which we should be led by analogy, is to suppose these regions to
represent huge swamps, in which the variation in depth of the water
produces the diversity of colors. Yellow would predominate in those
parts where the depth of the liquid layer was reduced to little or
nothing, and brown, more or less dark, in those places where the water
was sufficiently deep to absorb more light and to render the bottom
more or less invisible. That the water of the sea, or any other deep
and transparent water, seen from above, appears more dark the greater
the depth of the liquid stratum, and that the land in comparison with
it appears bright under the solar illumination, is known and confirmed
by certain physical reasons. The traveler in the Alps often has occa-
sion to convince himself of it, seeing from the summits the deep lakes

any translation of the name,—Translator.
122 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

with which the region is strewn extending under his feet as black as
ink, whilst in contrast with them even the blackest rocks illumined by
the sunlight appeared brilliant. !

Not without reason, then, have we hitherto attributed to the dark
spots of Mars the part of seas, and that of continents to the reddish
areas which occupy nearly two-thirds of all the planet, and we shall
find later other reasons which confirm this method of reasoning. The
continents form in the northern hemisphere a nearly continuous mass,
the only important exception being the great lake called the Mare
Acidalium, of which the extent may vary according to the time, and
which is connected in some way with the inundations which we have
said were produced by the melting of the snow surrounding the north
pole. To the system of the Mare Acidalium undoubtedly belong the
temporary lake called Lacus Hyperboreus and the Lacus Niliacus.
This last is ordinarily separated from the Mare Acidalium by means of
an isthmus or regular dam, of which the continuity was only seen to
be broken once for a short time in 1888. Other smaller dark spots are
found here and there in the continental area which we may designate
as lakes, but they are certainly not permanent lakes like ours, but are
variable in appearance and size according to the seasons, to the point
of wholly disappearing under certain circumstances. Ismenius Lacus,
Lune Lacus, Trivium Charontis, and Propontis are the most conspicu-
ous and durable ones. There are also smaller ones, such as Lacus
Moeris and Fons Juvente, which at their maximum size do not exceed
100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles) in diameter, and are among the
most difficult objects upon the planet.

All the vast extent of the continents is furrowed upon every side by
a network of numerous lines or fine stripes of a more or less pro-
nounced dark color, whose aspect is very variable. These traverse the
planet for long distances in regular lines that do not at all resemble
the winding courses of our streams. Some of the shorter ones do not
reach 500 kilometers (300 miles), others, on the other hand, extend for
many thousands, occupying a quarter or sometimes even a third of a
circumference of the planet. Some of these are very easy to see,
especially that one which is near the extreme left-hand limit of our
map, and is designated by the name of Nilosyrtis. Others in turn are
extremely difficult, and resemble the finest thread of spider’s web
drawn across the disk. They are subject also to great variations in
their breadth, which may reach 200 or even 300 kilometers (120 to
180 miles) for the Nilosyrtis, whilst some are scarcely 30 kilometers (18
miles) broad.

'This observation of the dark color which deep water exhibits when seen from
above is found already noted by the first author of antique memory, for in the
Iliad (verses 770-771 of Book V) it is described how “the sentinel from the high
sentry box extends his glance over the wine-colored sea, ofvora révrov.” In the
version of Monti the adjective indicating the color is lost,

These lines or stripes are the famous canals of Mars, of which so
much has been said. As far as we have been able to observe them
hitherto, they are certainly fixed configurations upon the planet. The
Nilosyrtis has been seen in that place for nearly one hundred years, and
some of the others for at least thirty years. Their length and arrange-
ment are constant, or vary only between very narrow limits. Each of
them always begins and ends between the same regions. But their
appearance and their degree of visibility vary greatly, for all of them,
from one opposition to another, and even from one week to another,
and these variations do not take place simultaneously and according to
the same laws for all, but in most cases happen apparently capriciously,
‘or at least according to laws not sufficiently simple for us to be able to
unravel. Often one or more become indistinct, or even wholly invisi-
ble, whilst others in their vicinity increase to the point of becoming
conspicuous even in telescopes of moderate power. The first of our
maps shows all those that have been seen in a long series of observa.
tions. This does not at all correspond to the appearance of Mars at any
given period, because generally only a few are visible at once.'

Every canal (for now we shall so call them) opens at its ends either
into a sea, or into a lake, or into another canal, or else into the inter-
section of several other canals. None of them have yet been seen cut
off in the middle of the continent, remaining without beginning or
without end. This fact is of the highest importance. The canals may
intersect among themselves at all possible angles, but by preference
they converge toward the small spots to which we have given the name
of lakes. For example, seven are seen to converge in Lacus Pheenicis,
eight in Trivium Charontis, six in Lune Lacus, and six in Ismenius
Lacus.

The normal appearance of a canal is that of a nearly uniform stripe,
black, or at least of a dark color, similar to that of the seas, in which
the regularity of its general course does not exclude small variations in
its breadth and small sinuosities in its two sides. Often it happens
that such a dark line opening out upon the sea is enlarged into the form
of a trumpet, forming a huge bay, similar to the estuaries of certain
terrestrial streams. The Margaritifer Sinus, the Aonius Sinus, the

1In a footnote the author refers to a drawing of Mars made by himseif, September
15, 1892, and says, - - - ‘At the top of the disk the Mare Erythreum and the
Mare Australe appear divided by a great curved peninsula, shaped like a sickle,
producing an unusual appearance in the area called Deucalionis Regio, which was
prolonged that year so as to reach the islands of Noachis and Argyre. This region
forms with them a continuous whole, but with faint traces of separation occurring
here and there in a length of nearly 6,000 kilometers (4,000 miles). Its color, much
less brilliant than that of the continents, was a mixture of their yellow with the
brownish gray of the neighboring seas.” The interesting feature of this note is
the remark that it was an unusual appearance, the region referred to being that in
which the central branch of the fork of the Y appeared. Since no such branch was
conspicuously visible this year, it would therefore seem from the above that it was
the opposition of 1892 that was peculiar, and not the present oue.—Translator.
124 SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

Aurore Sinus, and the two horns of the Sabzeus Sinus are thus formed,
at the mouths of one or more canals, opening into the Mare Erythraeum
or into the Mare Australe. The largest example of such a gulf is the
Syrtis Major, formed by the vast mouth of the Nilosyrtis, so called.
This gulf is not less than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) in breadth, and
attains nearly the same depth in a longitudinal direction. Its surface
is little less than that of the Bay of Bengal. In this case we see clearly
the dark surface of the sea continued without apparent interruption
into that of the canal. Inasmuch as the surfaces called seas are truly a
liquid expanse, we can not doubt that the canals are a simple prolonga-
tion of them, crossing the yellow areas or continents.

Of the remainder, that the lines called canals are truly great furrows
or depressions in the surface of the planet, destined for the passage of
the liquid mass and constituting for it a true hydrographic system, is
demonstrated by the phenomena which are observed during the melt-
ing of the northern snows. We have already remarked that at the
time of melting they appeared surrounded by a dark zone, forming a
species of temporary sea. At that time the canals of the surrounding
region become blacker and wider, increasing to the point of convert-
ing at a certain time all of the yellow region comprised between the
edge of the snow and the parallel of 60° north latitude into numerous
islands of small extent. Such a state of things does not cease until the
snow, reduced to its minimum area, ceases to melt. Then the breadth
of the canals diminishes, the temporary sea disappears, and the yellow
region again returns to its former area. The different phases of these
vast phenomena are renewed at each return of the seasons, and we
were able to observe them in all their particulars very easily during
the oppositions of 1882, 1884, and 1886, when the planet presented its
northern pole to terrestrial spectators. The most natural and the
most simple interpretation is that to which we have referred, of a
great inundation produced by the melting of the snows; it is entirely
logical and is sustained by evident analogy with terrestrial phenomena.
We conclude, therefore, that the canals are such in fact and not only
in name. The network formed by these was probably determined in
its origin in the geological state of the planet, and has come to be
slowly elaborated in the course of centuries. It is not necessary to
suppose them the work of intelligent beings, and, notwithstanding the
almost geometrical appearance of all of their system, we are now
inclined to believe them to be produced by the evolution of the planet,
just as on the earth we have the English Channel and the channel of
Mozambique.

It would be a problem not less curious than complicated and difficult
to study the system of this immense stream of water, upon which per-
haps depends principally the organic life upon the planet, if organic
life is found there. The variations of their appearance demonstrated
that this system is not constant. When they become displaced or

SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 125

their outlines become doubtful and ill defined, it is fair to suppose that
the water is getting low or is even entirely dried up. Then, in place
of the canals there remains either nothing or at most stripes of yellowish
color differing little from the surrounding background. Sometimes
they take on a nebulous appearance, for which at present it is not pos-
sible to assign a reason. At other times true enlargements are produced,
expanding to 100, 200 or more kilometers (60 to 120 miles) in breadth,
and this sometimes happens for canals very far from the north pole,
according to laws which are unknown. This occurred in Hydaspes
in 1864, in Simois in 1879, in Ackeron in 1884, and in Triton in 1888.
The diligent and minute study of the transformations of each canal
may lead later to a knowledge of the causes of these effets.

But the most surprising phenomenon pertaining to the canals of Mars
is their gemination, which seems to occur principally in the months
which precede and in those which follow the great northern inunda-
tion—at about the times of the equinoxes. In consequence of a rapid
process, which certainly lasts at most a few days, or even perhaps,
only a few hours, and of which it has not yet been possible to determine
the particulars with certainty, a given canal changes its appearance
and is found transformed through all its length into two lines or uni-
form stripes more or less parallel to one another, and which run straight
and equal with the exact geometrical precision of the two rails of a rail-
road. But this exact course is the only point of resembiance with the
rails, because in dimensions there is no comparison possible, as it is
easy to imagine. The two lines follow very nearly the direction of the
original canal and end in the place where it ended. One of these is
often superposed as exactly as possible upon the former line, the other
being drawn anew; but in this case the original line loses all the small
irregularities and curvature that it may have originally possessed.
But it also happens that both the lines may occupy opposite sides of
the former canal and be located upon entirely new ground. The dis-
tance between the two lines differs in different geminations and varies
from 600 kilometers (360 miles) and more down to the smallest limit at
which two lines may appear separated in large visual telescopes—less
than an interval of 50 kilometers (30 miles). The breadth ot the stripes
themselves may range from the limit of visibility, which we may sup-
pose to be 30 kilometers (18 miles), up to more than 100 kilometers (60
miles). The color of the two lines varies from black to a light red,
which can hardly be distinguished from the general yellow background
of the continental surface. The space between is for the most part
yellow, but in many eases appears whitish. The gemination is not nec-
essarily confined only to the canals, but tends to be produced also in
the lakes. Often one of these is seen transformed into two short, broad,
dark lines parallel to one another and traversed by a yellow line. In
these cases the gemination is naturally short and does not exceed the
limits of the original lake.
126 SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.

The gemination is not shown by all at the same time, but when the
season is at hand it begins to be produced here and there, in an isolated,
irregular manner, or at least without any easily recognizable order. In
many canals (such as the Nilosyrtis, for example) the gemination is
lacking entirely, or is scarcely visible. After having lasted for some
months, the markings fade out gradually and disappear until another
season equally favorable for their formation. Thus it happens that in
certain other seasons (especially near the southern solstice of the
planet) few are seen, or even none at all. In different oppositions the
gemination of the same canal may present different appearances as to
width, intensity, and arrangement of the two stripes; also in some
cases the direction of the lines may vary, although by the smallest
quantity, but still deviating by a small amount from the canal with
which they are directly associated. From this important fact it is
immediately understood that the gemination can not be a fixed forma-
tion upon the surface of Mars and of a geographical eharacter like
the canals. The second of our maps will give an approximate idea of
the appearance which these singular formations present. It contains
all the geminations observed since 1882 up to the present time. In
examining it it is necessary to bear in mind that not all of these
appearances were simultaneous, and consequently that the map does
not represent the condition of Mars at any given period; it is only a
sort of topographical register of the observations made of this phe-
nomenon at different times.!

The observation of the geminations is one of the greatest difficulty,
and can only be made by an eye well practiced in such work, added to
a telescope of accurate construction and of great power. This explains
why it is that it was not seen before 1882. In the ten years that have
transpired since that time, it has been seen and described at eight or
ten observatories. Nevertheless, some still deny that these phenomena
are real, and tax with illusion (or even imposture) those who declare
that they have observed it. ’

Their singular aspect, and their being drawn with absolute geomet-
rical precision, as if they were the work of rule or compass, has led
some to see in them the work of intelligent beings, inhabitants of the
planet. lam very careful not to combat this supposition, which includes
nothing impossible. (lo mi guarderd bene dal combattere questa sup-
posizione, la quale nulla include d’ impossibile.) But it will be noticed
that in any case the gemination can not be a work of permanent charae-
ter, it being certain that in a given instance it may change its appearance
and dimensions from one season to another. If we should assume such
a work, a certain variability would not be excluded from it; for exam-
ple, extensive agricultural labor and irrigation upon a large scale. Let
us add, further, that the intervention of intelligent beings might explain

SCHIAPARELLI’S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 127%

the geometrical appearance of the gemination, but it is not at all neces-
sary for such a purpose. The geometry of nature is manifested in many
other facts from which are excluded the idea of any artificial labor
whatever. The perfect spheroids of the heavenly bodies and the ring
of Saturn were not constructed in a turning lathe, and not with com-
passes has Iris described within the clouds her beautiful and regular
arch. And what shall we say of the infinite variety of those exquisite
and regular polyhedrons in which the world of crystals is sorich? In
the organic world, also, is not that geometry most wonderful which
presides over the distribution of the foliage upon certain plants, which
orders the nearly symmetrical, star-like figures of the flowers of the
field, as well as of the animals of the sea, and which produces in the
shell such an exquisits conical spiral that excels the most beautiful
masterpieces of Gothic architecture? In all these objects the geomet-
rical form is the simple and necessary consequence of the principles
and Jaws which govern the physical and physiological world. That
these principles and these laws are but an indication of a higher intel-
ligent Power we may admit, but this has nothing to de with the present
argument.

Having regard, then, for the principle that in the explanation of
natural phenomena it is universally agreed to begin with the simplest
suppositions, the first hypotheses of the nature and cause of the gemina-
tions have for the most part put in operation only the laws of inorganic
nature. Thus, the gemination is supposed to be due either to the effects
of light in the atmosphere of Mars, or to optical illusions produced by
vapors in various manners, or to glacial phenomena of a perpetual winter,
to which it is known all the planets will be condemned, or to double
cracks in its surface, or to single cracks of which the images are doubled
by the effect of smoke issuing in long lines and blown laterally by the
wind. The examination of these ingenious suppositions leads us to
conclude that none of them seem to correspond entirely with the
observed facts, either in whole or in part. Some of these hypotheses
would not have been proposed had their authors been able to examine
the geminations with their own eyes. Since some of these may ask me
directly, Can you suggest anything better? I must reply candidly, No.

It would be far more easy if we were willing to introduce the forces
pertaining to organic nature. Here the field of plausibte supposition
is immense, being capable of making an infinite number of combina-
tions capable of satisfying the appearances even with the smallest and
simplest ineans. Changes of vegetation over a vast area, and the pro-
duction of animals, also very small, but in enormous multitudes, may
well be rendered visible at such a distance. An observer placed in the
moon would be able to see such an appearance at the times in whic:
agricultural operations are carried out upon one vast plain—the seed-
time and the gathering of the harvest. In such a manner also would
the flowers of the plants of the great steppes of Hurope and Asia be

rendered visible at the distance of Mars—by a variety of coloring. A
similar system of operations produced in that planet may thus certainly
be rendered visible tous. But how difficult for the Lunarians and the
Areans to be able to imagine the true causes of such changes of appear-
ance without having first at least some superficial knowledge of terres-
trial nature! So also for us, who know so little of the physical state
of Mars, and nothing of its organie world, the great liberty of possible
supposition renders arbitrary all explanations of this sort and consti-
tutes the gravest obstacle to the acquisition of well-founded notions.
All that we may hope is that with time the uncertainty of the problem
will gradually diminish, demonstrating if not what the geminations
are, at least what tiey can not be. We may also confide a little in
what Galileo called “the courtesy of nature,” thanks to which a ray
of light from an unexpected source will sometimes illuminate an inves-
tigation at first believed inaccessible to our speculations, and of which
we have a beautiful example in celestial chemistry. Let us therefore
hope and study.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY, ACCORDING TO MAXWELL
AND HERTZ)!

By M. PoIncAaR#.?

It was at the moment when the experiments of Fresnel were foreimg
the scientific world to admit that light consists of the vibrations of a
highly attenuated fluid filling interplanetary spaces that the researches
of Ampere were making known the laws of the mutual action of cur-
rents and were so enunciating the fundamental principles of electro-
dynamics.

It needed but one step to the supposition that that same fluid, the
ether, which is the medium of luminous phenomena, is at the same time
the vehicle of electrical action. In imagination Ampere made this
stride; but the illustrious physicist could not foresee that the seducing
hypothesis with which he was toying, a mere dream for him, was ere
long to take a precise form and become one of the vital concerns of
exact science.

A dream it remained for many years, till one day, after electrical
measurements had become extremely exact, some physicist, turning
over the numerical data, much as a resting pedestrian might idly turn
over a stone, brought to light an odd coincidence. It was that the
factor of transformation between the system of electro statical units
and the system of electro-dynamical units was equal to the velocity
of light. Soon the observations directed to this strange coincidence
became so exact that no sane head could longer hold it a mere ecoinci-
dence. No longer could it be doubted that some occult affinity existed
between optical and electrical phenomena. Perhaps, however, we
might be wondering to this day what this affinity could be were it not
for the genius of Clerk Maxwell.

130 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

DISPLACEMENT CURRENTS.

The reader is aware that solid bodies are divided into two classes,
conductors through which electricity can move in the form of a galvanic
current, and nonconduetors, or dielectrics. The electricians of former
days regarded dielectrics as quite inert, having no part to play but that
of obstinately refusing passage to electricity. Had that been so, any
one nonconductor might be replaced by any other without making any
difference in the phenomena; but Faraday found that that was not the
ease. Two condensers of the same form and dimensions put into con-
nection with the same source of electricity do not take the same charge,
though the thickness of the isolating plate be the same, unless the mat-
ter of that plate be chemically the same. Now Clerk Maxwell had too
deeply studied the researches of Faraday not to comprehend the import
ance of dielectrics and the imperative obligation to recognize their active
part.

Besides, if light is but an electric phenomenon, when it traverses a
thickness of glass electrical events must take place in that glass. And
what can be the nature of those events? Maxwell boldly answers,
they are, and must be, currents.

All the experience of his day seemed to contradict this. Never had
currents been observed except in conductors. How was Maxwell to
reconcile his audacious hypothesis with a fact so well established as
that? Why is it that under certain circumstances those supposed cur-
rents produce manifest effects, While under ordinary conditions they can
not be observed ag all.

The answer was that dielectrics resist the passage of electricity not
so much more than conductors do, but in a different manner. Maxwell’s
idea will best be understood by a comparison.

If we bend a spring, we meet a resistance which increases the more
the spring is bended. So, if we can only dispose of a finite force, a
moment will come when the motion will cease, equilibrium being
reached. Finally, when the force ceases the spring will in flying back
restore the whole of the energy which has been expended in bending it.

Suppose, on the other hand, that we wish to displace a body plunged
into water. Here again a resistance will be experienced, but it will not
go on increasing in proportion as the body advances, supposing it to be
maintained at a constant velocity. So long as the motive force acts,
equilibrium will never, then, be attained; nor when the force is removed
will the body in the least tend to return, nor can any portion of the
energy expended be restored. It will, in fact, have been converted into
heat by the viscosity of the water.

The contrast is plain; and we ought to distinguish elastic resistance
from viscous resistance. Using these terms, we may express Maxwell’s
idea by saying that <ielectrics offer an elastic resistance, conductors a

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 131

viscous resistance, to the movements of electricity. Hence, there are two
kinds of currents; currents of displacement which traverse dielectrics
and ordinary currents of conduction which circulate in conductors.

Currents of the first kind, having to overcome an elastic resistance
which continually increases, naturally can last but a very short time,
since a state of equilibrium will quickly be reached.

Currents of conduction, on the other hand, having only a viscous
resistance to overcome, must continue so long so there is any electro-
motive force.

Let us return to the simile used by M. Cornu in his notice in the
Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes for 1893. Suppose we have in a
reservoir water under pressure. Lead a tube plumb downward into the
reservoir. The water will rise in the tube, but the rise will stop when
hydrostatic equilibrium is attained—that is, when the downward pres-
sure of the water in the tube above the point of application of the first
pressure on the reservoir, and due to the weight of the water, balances
that first pressure. If the pipe is large, there will be no friction or
loss of head, and the water so raised can be used to do work. That
represents acurrent of displacement.

If, on the other hand, the water flows out of the reservoir by a hori-
zontal pipe, the motion will go on till the reservoir is emptied; but if
the tube is small and long there will be a great loss of energy and con-
siderable production of heat by friction. That represents a current of
conduction.

Though it would be vain, not to say idle, to attempt to represent all
details, it may be said that everything happens just as if the currents
of displacement were acting to bend a multitude of little springs.
When the currents cease, electrostatic equilibrium is established, and
the springs are bent the more, the more intense is the electric field.
The accumulated work of the springs—that is, the electrostatic energy—
can be entirely restored as soon as they can unbend, and so it is that
we obtain mechanical work when we leave the conductors to obey the
electrostatic attractions. Those attractions must be due to the pressure
exercised on the conductors by the bent springs. Finally, to pursue
the image to the death, the disruptive discharge may be compared to
the breaking of the springs when they are bent too much.

On the other hand, the energy employed to produce conduction cur-
rents is lost, being wholly converted into heat, like that spent in over-
coming the viscosity of fluids. Hence it is that the conducting wires
become heated.

From Maxwell’s point of view it seems that all currents are in closed
circuits. The older electricians did not so opine. They regarded the
current circulating in a wire joining the two poles of a pile as closed;
but if in place of directly uniting the two poles we place them in com-
munication with the two armatures of a condenser, the momentary
current which lasts while the condenser is getting charged was not
132 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

considered as a current round a closed circuit. It went, they thought,
from one armature through the wire, the battery, the other wire, to the
other armature, and there it stopped. Maxwell, on the contrary, sup-
posed that in the form of a current of displacement it passes through
the nonconducting plate of the condenser, and that precisely what
brings it to cessation is the opposite electromotive force set up by the
displacement of electricity in this dielectric.

Currents become sensible in three ways—by their heating effects, by
their actions on other currents and on magnets, and by the induced
currents to which they give rise. We have seen why currents of con-
duction develop heat and why currents of displacement do not. But
Maxwell’s hypothetical currents ought at any rate to produce electro-
magnetic and inductive effects. Why do these effects not appear?
The answer is, that it is because a current of displacement can not last
long enough. That is to say, they can not last long in one direction.
Consequently in a dielectric no current can long exist without alterna-
tion. But the effects ought to and will become observable if the current
is continually reversed at sufficiently short intervals.

THE NATURE OF LIGHT.

Such, according to Maxwell, is the origin of light. A luminiferous
Wave is a series of alternating currents produced in dielectrics, in air,
or even in the interplanetary void, and reversed in direction a million
of millions of times per second. The enormous induction due to these
frequent alternations sets up other currents in the neighboring parts
of the dielectric, and so the waves are propagated.

Calewation shows that the velocity of propagation would be equal
to the ratio of the units, which we know is the velocity of light.

Those alternative currents are a sort of electrical oscillation, Are
they longitudinal, like those of sound, or are they transversal, like those
of Fresnel’s ether? In the case of sound the air undergoes alterna-
tive condensations and rarefactions. The ether of Fresnel, on the other
hand, behaves as if it were composed of incompressible layers capable
only of slipping over one another. Were these currents in open paths,
the electricity carried from one end to the other would become accu-
mulated at one extremity. It would thus be condensed and rarefied
like air, and its vibrations would be longitudinal. But Maxwell only
admits currents in closed circuits; accumulation is impossible, aud
electricity behaves like the incompressible ether of Fresnel, with its
transversal vibrations.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION.

We thus obtain all the results of the theory of waves. Yet this
was not enough to decide the physicists to adopt the ideas of Max-
well. It was a seductive hypothesis; but physicists consider hypothe-
ses which lead to no distinct observational consequences as beyond

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 133

the borders of their province. That province, so defined, no experi-
mental confirmation of Maxwell’s theory invaded for twenty-five years.

What was wanted was some issue between the two theories not too
delicate for our coarse methods of observation to decide. There was
but one line of research along which any experimentum crucis was to
be met with.

The old electro-dynamics makes electro-magnetic induction take
place instantaneously; but according to Maxwell’s doctrine it propa-
gates itself with the velocity of light.

The point was then to measure, or at least to make certain, a velocity
of propagation of inductive effects. This is what the illustrious Ger-
man physicist Hertz has done by the method of interferences.

The method is well known in its application to optical phenomena.
Two luminous rays from one identical center interfere when they reach
the same point after pursuing paths of different lengths. If the differ-
ence is one, two, or any whole number of wave lengths, the two lights
reenforce one another so that if their intensities are equal, that of their
combination is four times as great. But if the difference is an odd
number of half wave lengths, the two lights extinguish one another.

Luminiferous waves are not peculiar in showing this phenomenon; it
belongs to every periodic change which is propagated with definite
velocity. Sound interferes just as light does, and so must electro-
dynamic induction if it is strictly periodic and has a definite velocity
of propagation. But if the propagation is instantaneous there can be
no interference, since in that ease there is no finite wave length.

The phenomenon, however, could not be observed were the wave
length greater than the distance within which induction is sensible.
It is therefore requisite to make the period of alternation as short as
possible.

ELECTRICAL EXCITERS.

We can obtain such currents by means of an apparatus which con-
stitutes a veritable electrical pendulum. Let two conductors be united
by a wire. If they have not the same electric potential the electrical
equilibrium is disturbed and tends to restore itself, just as the molar
equilibrium is disturbed when a pendulum is carried away from the
position of repose.

A current is set up in the wire, tending to equalize the potential, just
as the pendulum begins to move so as to be carried back to the position
of repose. But the pendulum does not stop when it reachés that posi-
tion. Its inertia carries it farther. Nor, when the two electrical con-
ductors reach the same potential, does the current in the wire cease.
The equilibrium instantaneously existing is at. once destroyed by a
‘ause analogous to inertia, namely self-induction. We know that when
a current is interrupted it gives rise in parallel wires to an induced ecur-
rent in the same direction. The same effect is produced in the circuit
134 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

itself, if that is not broken. In other words, a current will persist after
the cessation of its causes, just aS a moving body does not stop the
instant it is no longer driven forward.

When, then, the two potentials become equal, the current will go on
and give the two conductors relative charges opposite to those they had
at first. In this case, as in that of the pendulum, the position of equi-
librium is passed, and a return motion is inevitable. Equilibrium,
again instantaneously attained, is at once again broken for the same
reason; and so the oscillations pursue one another unceasingly.

Calculation shows that the period depends on the capacity of the con-
ductors in such a way thatitis only necessary to diminish that capacity
sufficiently (which is easily done) to have an electric pendulum capable
of producing an alternating current of extremely short period.

All that was well enough known by the theoretical researches of
Lord Kelvin and by the experimentation of Federsen on the oscillatory
discharge of the Leyden jar. It was not that which constituted the
originality of Hertz.

Fic. 1.—The Hertz exciter.

But it is not enough to construct a pendulum; it is further requisite
to set it into oscillation. For that, it is necessary to carry it off from
equilibrium and to let it go suddenly, that is to say, to release it in a
time short as compared to the period of its oscillation.

For if, having pulled a pendulum to one side by a string, we were to
let go of the string more slowly than the pendulum would have
descended of itself, it would reach the vertical without momentum, and
no oscillation would be set up.

In like manner. with an electric pendulum whose natural period is,
say, a@ hundred-millionth of a second, no mechanical mode of release
would answer the purpose at all, sudden as it might seem to us with
our more than sluggish conceptions of promptitude. How, then, did
Hertz solve the problem? °

To return to our electric pendulum, a gap of a few millimeters is
made in the wire which joins the two conductors. This gap divides our
apparatus into two symmetrical parts, which are connected to the two
poles of a Ruhmkorff coil. The induced current begins to charge the
two conductors, and the difference of their potential increases with
relative slowness.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 135

At first the gap prevents a discharge from the conductors; the air in
it plays the role of insulator and maintains our pendnlum in a position
diverted from that of equilibrium.

But when the difference of potential becomes great enough, a spark
will jump across. If the self-induction is great enough and the capacity
and resistance small enough, there will be an oscillatory discharge
whose period can be brought down to a hundred-millionth of a second.
The oscillatory discharge would not, it is true, last long by itself; but
it is kept up by the Ruhmkorff coil, whose current is itself oscillatory
with a period of about a hundred-thousandth ef a second, and thus
the pendulum gets a new impulse as often as that.

The instrument just described is called a resonance exciter. It pro-
duces oscillations which are reversed from a hundred million to a thou-
sand million times per second. Thanks to this extreme frequency, they
can produce inductive effects at great distances. To make these effects
sensible another electric pendulum is used, called a resonator. In this
the coil is suppressed. It consists simply of two little metallic spheres
very near to one another, with a long wire connecting them in a round-
about way.

The induction due to the exciter will set the resonator in vibration
the more intensely the more nearly the natural periods of vibration are
the same. At certain phases of the vibration the difference of poten-
tial of the two spheres will be just great enough to cause the sparks to
leap across.

PRODUCTION OF THE INTERFERENCES.

- Thus we have an instrument which reveals the inductive waves which
radiate from the exciter. We can study them in two ways. We may
either expose the resonator to the direct induction of the exciter at a
great distance, or else make this induction act at a small distance on a
long conducting wire which the electric wave will follow and which in
its turn will act at a small distance on the resonator.

Whether the wave is propagated along a wire or across the air, inter-
ferences can be produced by retlection. In the first case it will be
reflected at the extremity of the wire, which it will again pass through
in the opposite direction. In the second case it can be reflected on a
metallic leaf which will act as a mirror. In either case the reflected
ray will interfere with the direct ray, and positions will be found in
which the spark of the resonator will be extinguished.

Experiments with a long wire are the easier and furnish much valu-
abie information, but they can not furnish an experimentum crucis,
since in the old theory, as in the new, the velocity of the electric wave
in a wire should be equal to that of light. But experiments on direct
induction at great distances are decisive. They not only show that
the velocity of propagation of induction across air is finite, but also
that it is equal to the velocity of the wave propagated along a wire,
conformably to the ideas of Maxwell.
136 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

SYNTHESIS OF LIGHT.

{ shall insist less on other experiments of Hertz, more. brilliant but
lessinstructive. Concentrating with a parabolic mirror the wave of in-
duction that emanates from the exciter, the German physicist obtained
a true pencil of rays of electric force, susceptible of regular reflection
and refraction. These rays, were the period but one-millionth of what
it is, would not differ from rays of light. We know that the sun sends
us several varieties of radiations, some luminiferous, since they act on
the retina, others dark, infra-red, or ultra-violet, which reveal themselves
in chemical and ealoritic effects. The first owe the qualities which ren-
der them sensible to us to a physiological chance. For the physicist,
the infra-red differs from red only as red differs from green; it simply
has a greater wave length. That of the Hertzian radiations is far greater
still, but they are mere differences of degree, and if the ideas of Clerk
Maxwell are true, the illustrious professor of Bonn has effected a
genuine synthesis of light.

CONCLUSION.

Nevertheless, our admiration for such unhoped-for suecesses must
not let us forget what remains to be accomplished. Let us endeavor to
take exact account of the results definitely acquired,

In the first place, the velocity of direct induction through air is finite;
for otherwise interferences could not exist. Thus the old electrody-
namics is condemned, But what is to be set up in its place? Is it to
be the doctrine of Maxwell, or rather some approximation to that, for
it would be too much to suppose that he had foreseen the truth in all
its details? Though the probabilities are accumulating, no complete
demonstration of that doctrine has ever attained.

Wecan measure the wave length of the Hertzian oscillations. That
length is the product of the period into the velocity of propagation.
We should know the velocity if we knew the period; but this last is so
minute that we can not measure it; we can only calculate it by a for-
mula due to Lord Kelvin. That calculation leads to figures agreeable
to the theory of Maxwell; but the last doubts will only be dissipated
when the velocity of propagation has been directly measured. (See
Note I.)

But this is not all. Matters are far from being as simple as this
brief account of the matter would lead one to think. There are vari-
ous complications.

In the first place, there is around the exciter a true radiation of
induction. The energy of the apparatus radiates abroad, and if no
source feeds it, it quickly dissipates itself and the oscillations are rap-
idly extinguished. Hence arises the phenomenon of multiple reso-
nance, discovered by Messrs. Sarasin and De la Rive. which at first
seemed irreconcilable with the theory.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 137

On the other hand, we know that light does not exactly follow the
laws of geometrical optics, and the discrepancy, due to diffraction,
increases proportionately to the wave length. With the great waves
of the Hertzian undulations these phenomena must assume enormous
importance and derange everything. It is doubtless fortunate, for the
moment at least, that our means of observation are as coarse as they
are, for otherwise the simplicity which struck us would give place
to a dedalian complexity in which we should lose our way. No doubt,
a good many perplexing anomalies have been due to this. For the
same reason the experiments to prove a refraction of the electrical
waves can hardly be considered as demonstrative.

It remains to speak of a difficulty still more grave, though doubtless
not insurmountable. According to Maxwell, the coefficient of eleetro-
static induction of a transparent body ought to be equal to the square
of its index of refraction. Now this is not so.!. The few bodies which
follow Maxwell’s law are exceptions. The phenomena are plainly far
more complex than was at first thought. But we have not yet been
able to make out how matters stand, and the experiments conflict with
one another.

Much, then, remains to be done. The identity of light with a vibra-
tory motion in electricity is henceforth something more than a seductive
hypothesis; it is a probable truth. But it is not yet quite proved.

Nore |I.—Since the above was written another great step has been
taken. M. Blondlot has virtually sueceeded, by ingenious experimental
contrivances, in directly measuring the velocity of a disturbance along
awire. The number found differs little from the ratio of the units;
that is, from the velocity of light, which is 500,000 kilometers per see-
ond. Since the interference experiments made at Geneva by Messrs.
Sarasin and De la Rive have shown, as I said above, that induction is
propagated in air with the same velocity as an electric disturbance
which follows a conducting wire, we must conclude that the velocity of
the induction is the same as that of light, which is a confirmation of
the ideas of Maxwell.

M. Fizeau had formerly found for the velocity of electricity a number —
far smaller, about 180,000 kilometers. But there is no contradiction.
The currents used by M. Fizeau, though intermittent, were of small
frequency and penetrated to the axis of the wire, while the currents of
M. Blondlot, oscillatory and of very short period, remained superficial
and were confined to a layer of less than a hundredth of a millimeter
in thickness. One may readily suppose the laws of propagation are not
the same in the two cases.

Note II.—I have endeavored above to render the explanation of the
electrostatic attractions and of the phenomena of induction comprehen-
sible by means of a simile. Now let us see what Maxwell’s idea is of
the cause which produces the mutual attractions of currents.

'That is, it is not so when we make the calculation with the indexes of refraction
of the waves of visible light.—Translator.
138 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY.

While the electrostatic attractions are taken to be due to a multitude
of little springs—that is to say, to the elasticity of the ether—it is sup-
posed to be the living force and inertia of the same fluid which produce
the phenomena of induction and electrodynamical effects.

The complete calculation is far too extended for these pages, and I
shall again content myself with a simile. I shall borrow it from a well-
known instrument—the centrifugal governor.

The living force of this apparatus is proportional to the square of the
angular velocity and to the square of the distance of the balls.

According to the hypothesis of Maxwell, the ether is in motion in
galvanic currents, and its living force is proportional to the square of
the intensity of the current, which thus correspond, in the parallel I
am endeavoring to establish, to the angular velocity of rotation.

If we consider two currents in the same direction, the living force,
with equal intensity, will be greater the nearer the currents are to one
another. Ifthe currents have opposite directions, the living force will
be greater the farther they are apart.

In order to increase the angular velocity of the regulator and con-
sequently its living force, it is necessary to supply it with energy and
consequently to overcome a resistance which we call its inertia,

In the same way, in order to increase the intensity of a current, we
must augment the living force of the ether, and it will be necessary to
supply it with energy and to overcome a resistance which is nothing
but the inertia of the ether and which we eall the induction.

The living force will be greater if the currents are in the same diree-
tion and near together. The energy to be furnished the counter electro-
motive force of induction will be greater. This is what we express when
we say that the mutual action of two currents is to be added to their
self-induction. The contrary is the case when their directions are
opposite.

If we separate the balls of the regulator, it will be necessary, in
order to maintain the angular velocity, to furnish energy, because with
equal angular velocity the living force is greater the more the balls are
separated.

In the same way, if two currents have the same direction. and
brought toward one another, if will be necessary, in order to maintain
the intensity to supply energy, because the living force will be aug-
mented. We shall, therefore, have to overcome an electromotive force
of induction which will tend to diminish the intensity of the currents.
It would tend on the contrary to augment it, if the currents had the
same direction and were carried apart, or if they had opposite direc-
tions and were brought together.

Finally, the centrifugal force tends to increase the distance between
the balls which would augment the living force were the angular veloc-
ity to be maintained.

LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 139

In like manner, when the currents have the same direction, they
attract each other—that is to say, they tend to approach each other,
which would increase the living force if the intensity were maintained.
If their directions are opposed they repel one another and tend to
separate, which would again tend to increase the living force were the
intensity kept constant.

Thus, the electrostatic effects would be due to the elasticity of the
ether and the electrodynamical phenomena to the living force. Now,
ought this elasticity itself to be explained, as Lord Kelvin thinks, by
rotations of small parts of the fluid? Different reasons may render
this hypothesis attractive; but it plays no essential part in the theory
of Maxwell, which is quite independent of it.

In the same wey, I have made comparisons with divers mechanisms.
But they are only similes, and pretty rough ones. A complete mechan-
ical explanation of electrical phenomena is not to be sought in the
volumes of Maxwell, but only a statement of the conditions which any
such explanation has to satisfy. Precisely what will confer long life
on the work of Maxwell is its being unentangled with any special
mechanical hypothesis.
THE HENRY!
By T. C. MENDENHALL.

On the 2ist of August, 1893, there assembled in Chicago an Interna-
tional Congress of Electricians, the transactions of which, while largely
technical and scientific in their character, were in all respects impor-
tant, and in some respects of great interest to the intelligent American
public.

The organization of the congress and preparations for holding it in
connection with the World’s Columbian Exposition were well under way
before the conception, or at least the publication, of the scheme for
a series of so-called ‘*  World’s Congresses,” the proceedings of which
were brought prominently to the attention of the reading public during
the past summer. The American Institute of Klectrical Engineers was
probably the first body to take action in reference to an Electrical Con-
gress. Cordial cooperation existed between it and the Exposition
authorities, and a large and representative advisory committee, embrac-
ing nearly all of the leading American electricians, together with many
of the first rank from foreign countries, was organized, with Dr. Elisha
Gray, of Chicago, as chairman.

It is not inteuded, in this article, to give an account of the congress
and its doings, but to refer to its organization and personnel only so
far as is necessary to throw light upon the full intent and meaning of a
single sentence in its proceedings.

The number of representatives of foreign governments present was
unexpectedly large, and the delegates were of the highest character.
To one who has some familiarity with the literature of electricity it will
suffice to mention the names of Von Helmholtz, Mascart, Preece, Row-
land, Silvanus Thompson, Ferraris, Ayrton, and Hospitalier, among
the many who took part in the deliberations of the congress. The
honorary president was Dr. H. von Helmholtz, whose splendid contri-
butions to science cover so wide a field that he would have been easily
first in congresses devoted to the consideration of several departments
of human knowledge quite distinct and apart from that of electricity.

In its internal constitution the congress differed in some particulars
from all others held in Chicago, and a part of its work had more of an

142 THE HENRY.

official and international character than that of any other. This was
the consideration and official sanction of hames and values of units of
electrical measure.

Notwithstanding the fact that more than a hundred million dollars
are Invested in machines and instruments for the production and con-
sumption of electricity and in their manufacture, little legislation has
been had looking to the protection of producer and consumer through
accurate measurement, as has long been recognized to be imperatively
necessary in other commercial transactions. It is true that the science
of electrical measurement has been thoroughly explored; excellent
methods and instruments have been devised and constructed, and the
most perfect system of units of measure ever conceived has been devel-
oped during the past quarter of a century. These units, being contin-
ually in use among scientific men, had come to be recognized as in some
degree authoritative among those engaged in commercial applications
of electricity, but in general no legal values were attached to these
units, and in reference to two or three of them scientific men were not
yet in entire accord in their nomenclature and definition. One or two
electrical congresses, notably that at Paris in 1881, had previously con-
sidered these questions, and a tentative agreement upon some of the
points at issue had been reached, but not much was accomplished that
was Satisfactory and lasting, except that an incentive was created for
further and more accurate investigation of the values of certain physical
constants in doubt. The results of these investigations and the general
progress of the science of electricity during the past decade were such
as to justify the belief that the time had now arrived when an interna-
tional agreement could be reached upon definitive values of the units
desirable and necessary in electrical measurement, as well as upon the
names they should bear. To this end it was desirable that the consid-
eration of such important questions should be restricted to a smaller,
more deliberative body than the general congress of electricians, the
membership of which reached several hundred. It was therefore agreed
to create what was technically known as the chamber of delegates,
which, as its name implies, consisted of specially commissioned dele-
gates from the several countries represented.

In this chamber the United States, Great Britain, France, and Ger-
many were allowed five delegates each. Some other nations were
allowed three, others two, and some only one.

The members bore commissions from their respective Governments,
and twenty-six were actually in attendance, representing nine different
nations. The four great nations named above had full delegations,
some others were only partly represented, and two or three nations had
appointed delegates who failed to reach Chicago in time for the meet-
ing of the congress. The chamber met in regular session every day
during the week of the International Congress, with Professor Row-
land, of Johns Hopkins University, as its presiding officer. At the end

.

. THE HENRY. 143

it had unanimously agreed upon names and definitions for eight units
of electrical measure, all that are thought to be necessary or desirable
at the present time, and no more are likely to receive consideration for
some years to come. The chamber passed a resolution recommending
the official and authoritative adoption of these units by the several
nations represented in the congress. They are all primarily derived
from the fundamental units of length, mass, and time of the metric
systein, and are thus inter-related in the simplest possible manner.

As already stated, it is not the purpose of this article to discuss the
conclusions reached by the chamber of delegates from a scientific stand-
point, but it will be desirable to name the units selected, and explain
in a general way their technical significance. In the order of their
adoption by the chamber they are as follows: The ohm, the ampere, the
volt, the coulomb, the farad, the joule, the watt, the henry.

These names are derived from those of distinguished scientific men,
all worthy of a place in the front rank of modern physicists, and many
of whom have made signal contributions to the advancement of the
science of electricity and electrical measurement.

The ohm is the unit of resistance. It has been applied by common
consent for many years to one of the three most important characteris-
ties of a circuit conveying a current of electricity. Its use perpetuates
the fame of the author of a simple and beautiful law by which these
three fundamental elements are bound together.

G.S. Ohm was born in Bavaria in 1781, and educated at the Univer-
sity of Erlangen. In 1827 he published a pamphlet, The Galvanic
Circuit Investigated Mathematically, containing what has since been
universally known as “Ohm’s law,” and which has had a most impor-
tant and far-reaching influence on the development of the theory and
applications of electricity. Guided by Fourier’s classic investigation
of the flow of heat in conductors, Ohm, from purely theoretical consid-
erations, arrived at the conclusion that in any circuit through which
an electric current was made to pass the strength of the current—that
is, the quantity of electricity passing a given section of a conductor in
one second of time—was directly proportional to the electro-motive
force (often called the ‘electrical pressure”), and inversely proportional
to its resistance. The importance of Ohim’s investigations was not
recognized at the time of their publication. Had the full meaning of his
conclusions been understood by those who shortly afterwards engaged
in the development of the electro-magnetic telegraph, they would have
been guided to results which were reached only after much loss of time
and money and many vexatious and discouraging disappointments.
In 1825 Barlow, in England, had declared the impossibility of the
telegraph, owing to the difficulty of sending electric currents through
long wires. It was noted that the strength of the current diminished
greatly when the length of the conductor was increased, and this was
properly assumed to be due to the greater resistance offered to the
144 THE HENRY. ,

passage of the current by the increased length. ‘ Barlow suggested
that this could be overcome only by enlarging the dimensions of the
conductor, and that when a current was transmitted through any con-
siderable distance the diameter of the wire must be enormous. For this
reason the electro-magnetic telegraph was an impracticable scheme.
This apparently conclusive argument undoubtedly seriously delayed
the progress of invention along that line.

But, curiously enough, about the time Ohm in Europe was publish-
ing a theoretical investigation which might have furnished the key to
the solution of the problem, in America a young man, not yet 50 years
of age, named Joseph Henry, had begun a series of experimental
researches at Albany, N. Y., which did make the way entirely clear a
few years later. Henry attacked the difficulty both as to cause and
effect. The effect was that when the conductor through which- the
current was passing was increased greatly in length, the strength of
the current was so reduced that it was insuflicient to operate the appa-
ratus necessary for the reproduction of the signal at the receiving end.
To meet this difficulty he investigated electro-magnets, and so improved
upon the original device of Sturgeon that comparatively feeble cur-
rents were capable of producing mechanical effects through long wires.
He also originated the ingenious device known as a “relay,” by means
of which a local battery is put in operation by a main current of little
strength, thus making local effects independent of the strength of the
main-line currents. By his invention of the “intensity magnet” and
use of the “intensity battery” he made the electro-magnetic telegraph
possible, and in 1831 he transmitted signals through a mile of wire,
causing a bell to ring by the action of an electro-magnet. Out of this
has grown the astounding network of wires—overhead, underground,
and across the seas—by which the earth is girdled and the existence
of which has wrought more change in the treatment of social, political,
and commercial problems than any other single fact of the present
century. While many of the conclusions which Henry had experi-
mentally reached were in harmony with and might have been deduced
from Ohm’s law, to Ohm belongs the credit of having first clearly
pointed out the real and exact meaning of “resistance” and its relation
to the other conditions of the circuit. The bestowal of his name upon
the unit by which it is measured is a fitting recognition of the lasting
value of his discovery.

The ampere is the unit of current. André Marie Ampere, born at
Lyons, France, in 1775, must be regarded as the creator of the science
of electro-dynamics. In 1820 Oersted, the Dane, published his mag-
nificent discovery of the effect of an electric current upon a freely sus-
pended magnet, thus establishing the relation between magnetism and
electricity which many of the ablest philosophers had sought in vain
for years. Ampere first heard of what was called the ‘Copenhagen
experiment” on September 11, 1820. On the 18th of the same month

THE HENRY. 145

he presented to the French Academy a paper in which he announced
the fundamental principle of the science of electro-dynamics, together
with a number of capital experiments in extension of Oersted’s princi-
ple. In the incredibly short time of a single week he had gone all over
Oersted’s work, experimentally and theoretically; he had devised a
new and ingenious hypothesis, for the examination of which he had
invented novel forms of apparatus and by means of which he had
brought the whole subject within the domain of mathematical treat-
ment. The history of the science of electricity shows nothing more
brilliant than the work of that memorable week. To him who was first
to show the action and reaction of currents upon each other, and at
the same time furnish a rational and most useful hypothesis upon which
the now rapidly growing theory of electro-magnetism might be con-
structed, has long been freely accorded the high praise which is implied
in calling the unit of current measure an ampere.

The beautifully simple law of Ohm, to which reference has already
been made, and which is as omnipresent and omnipotent in electricity
as is Newton’s law of gravitation in astronomy and mechanics, is
administered by and through a triumvirate. Twoof the triad, namely,
resistance and. current, are presented above. The third, which is
mathematically the product of these two, is the electro-motive force
in the circuit, and its unit of measure is the volt. The appropriateness
of this name will be at once recognized when the services of the dis-
tinguished Italian philosopher, Volta, the contemporary of Galvani,
are remembered. In his early youth Volta was considered dull, and
he showed little promise. of future distinction. His first awakening
to intellectual activity manifested itself in a tendency to compose
poetry, but from this he turned to experimental science; and when
Galvani, in 1786, saw in the twitchings of the legs of a frog the begin-
ning of a series of marvelous discoveries which have made the nine-
teenth century greater than any that have gone before, Volta was in
the prime of life, thoroughly equipped by taste and experience to take
up the subject at a point where his countryman seemed likely to leave
it, and so enlarge and enrich it as almost to make it entirely his own.

Differing from Galvani as to the cause of what was long called
“oalvanism,” he originated what is known as the “contact theory,”
and was the first to have clear ideas of what is now termed “ electro-
motive force.” His theory led him to the construction of the voltaic
pile or battery, which has been of incalculable value in the develop-
ment of the science of electricity and its applications. It happens
that the unit of measure, one volt, is very nearly the electro motive
force of one cell of Volta’s battery, being a little less than that of an
ordinary sulphate of copper (‘‘bluestone”) cell.

These, the ohm, the ampere, and the volt, are the three fundamental
units of electrical measurement. They are related to one another
through Ohm’s law, and, as other units are largely derived from them

10

146 THE HENRY.

it will be useful to illustrate this relation before proceeding further. For
this purpose perhaps nothing is better than the well-known and oft-
repeated comparison of the flow of a current of electricity in a conductor
to the flow of a stream of water through a pipe. When water flows
from a reservoir through a pipe the quantity which passes any point in
the pipe in onesecond (current strength) depends on the height of the res-
ervoir above the outlet—that is, on the “head” or pressure under which
it flows—and also on the resistance which the pipe offers to ifs motion.
The greater the pressure the greater the flow, and the greater the
resistance the less the flow. The strength of the current is therefore
directly proportional to the pressure, and inversely proportional to the
resistance. If in this statement ‘‘electro-motive” force be substituted
for “pressure,” it becomes Ohm’s law. When these elements are
measured in the units given above, the electro-motive force in volts,
the resistance in ohms, and the current in amperes, the law is expressed
very simply by saying that the “current is equal to the electro-motive
