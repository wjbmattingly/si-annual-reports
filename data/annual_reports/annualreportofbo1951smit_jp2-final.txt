Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
ALEXANDER WETMORE
For the Year Ended June 30, 1951

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The lengthy discussions and debates among both scientists and
legislators that preceded the creation of the National Science Founda-
tion, on May 10, 1950, are reminiscent of the ten-year deliberations
more than a century ago that culminated in the establishment of
the Smithsonian Institution. James Smithson, the English benefactor
who bequeathed half a million dollars to the United States of America
to found at Washington “an institution for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men,” had been dead 17 years before our Govern-
ment decided what form the “institution” was to take or even to
accept the gift. Finally, on August 10, 1846, President James K. Polk
signed the bill that created the Smithsonian Institution, our first
“national science foundation.” With that act, which was actively
supported by John Quincy Adams, Joel R. Poinsett, and other
science-minded leaders of the day, our Government formally recog-
nized that science is a matter of national concern, and as a nation
we committed ourselves to the Jeffersonian idea that science is a
legitimate function of government.

Today, in the wake of the atom bomb, no one dares question that
concept. Present-day exigencies have forced us to recognize that
there are certain types of scientific investigation which are essential
to our national security and that these must not be left to haphazard
and uncertain backing of private individuals and organizations, no
matter how worthy or well-meaning. They must be publicly and
continuously financed so long as science continues to be so strategically
integrated with our politics, economics, and social well-being. The
statement that “this is the age of science” has taken on deeper and
more somber implications.
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Throughout the 105 years since it was established, the Smithsonian
Institution has seen and has been a part of the development of this
national attitude toward science. It has witnessed and sometimes
aided the establishment of many great and potent scientific agencies,
such as the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research
Council, the National Bureau of Standards, the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, and others that came into being during
World War II. The Institution itself has undergone many changes
and vicissitudes: it has survived four major wars, several panics and
depressions, and controversies that seemed important at the time.
But its one continuing purpose has been, and is, to serve sclence—not
merely American science but all science—in a way that its founder
Smithson might have envisioned. It has endeavored not to compete
but to serve as a sort of catalyst to complement and cooperate in the
work of other agencies, Government and non-Government alike,
and to support worthy projects that otherwise might languish. The
unique character of its status—as a privately endowed institution
and at the same time a ward of the United States Government—has
given it a freedom of action backed by authority that has proved
fortunate and has increased its usefulness.

In the early days of its existence the Institution carried on its re-
search programs largely by subsidizing the work of scientists not on
its own staff and by publishing the results of their work. Sources of
such aid to American scientists were then extremely limited, and the
favor that this practice found can well be understood. Gradually,
however, the activities of the Institution became channelized as they
expanded, and “bureaus” grew up around the Institution, each with
its own staff specializing in the work of its particular field. These
are now ten in number, as follows: United States National Museum,
National Gallery of Art (with separate board of trustees), National
Collection of Fine Arts, Freer Gallery of Art, Bureau of American
Ethnology, International Exchange Service, National Zoological
Park, Astrophysical Observatory, National Air Museum, and Canal
Zone Biological Area. Most of these branches are now supported by
Government funds although remaining under Smithsonian direction.
At present, nearly all the research and exploration of the Institution
is done through these bureaus, notably the United States National
Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

Curtailment of the Government’s nondefense spending since the
Korean crisis has prevented the Institution from proceeding with
some of its long-term programs, such as the modernization of museum
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

exhibits, construction of urgently needed new buildings, and purchase
of modern instruments and equipment for its laboratories. The de-
mands made upon our buildings, as has been pointed out in previous
reports, are little short of incredible: the annual number of visitors
is rapidly approaching the 3,000,000 mark, and the increase of the
collections in the fields of natural history, industry, history, and
aeronautics has long since crowded all available storage space. It
should be emphasized that the Institution has no desire to expand its
activities inordinately or to add functions unjustified by normal de-
mands. At the same time the public expects certain services from the
Federal Government, through the Smithsonian, in maintaining the
priceless collections in the National Museum and in the art galleries
under the Institution’s care and in making them available for exhibit
and study. These are services that have long been entrusted to the
Smithsonian; they fall in that category of activities aimed at the
cultural and scientific advancement of all the people, and hence their
support by Federal appropriations of funds is proper and justifiable.
Smithsonian administrators, therefore, are duty bound to do every-
thing in their power to obtain adequate support for the irreplaceable
treasures in their custody, even in times of national emergency.

In the pages that follow the director of each of the bureaus under
Smithsonian direction presents his detailed report for the year (Ap-
pendices 1-10). Included also are the reports of the Librarian and
the Chief of the Editorial Division (Appendices 11 and 12).

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson,
of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithso-
nian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

There were no changes in the personnel of the Board of Regents
during the year. One vacancy still exists in the class of citizen re-
gents. The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year, June 30,
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

1951, was as follows: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor;
Vice President Alben W. Barkley; members from the Senate: Walter
F. George, Clinton P. Anderson, Leverett Saltonstall; members from
the House of Representatives; Clarence Cannon, John M. Vorys,
E. E. Cox; citizen members: Harvey N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton,
Vannevar Bush, Robert V. Fleming, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

The regular annual meeting of the Board was held in the Regents’
Room on January 12, 1951. The Secretary presented his annual re-
port covering the activities of the Institution and its bureaus, includ-
ing the financial report of the Executive Committee, for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1950, and this was accepted by the Board. The
usual resolution authorized the expenditure by the Secretary of the
income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1952.

The Secretary announced that he would reach retirement age in
June 1951 and brought to attention the question of the selection of a
successor. Accordingly, the Chancellor appointed a Special Com-
mittee to make recommendation in this connection. Dr. Wetmore
agreed to serve until a successor had been chosen.

Concerning the Gellatly art collection, the Secretary reported that
under date of February 28, 1950, the office of the Attorney General
informed the Institution that the Supreme Court had denied Mrs.
Gellatly’s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the
United States Court of Appeals. This long controversy of more than
20 years apparently has come to an end, with result favorable to the
Smithsonian.

On the evening of January 11, 1951, preceding the annual meeting,
an informal dinner meeting of the Board was held in the Main Hall
of the Smithsonian Institution, with the Chancellor, Chief Justice
Fred M. Vinson, presiding. This occasion gave opportunity for mem-
bers of the Smithsonian staff to make a fuller presentation of the
scientific work of the Institution than was practicable at the regular
meeting the next day.

. On May 3, 1951, a special meeting of the Board of Regents was held
in the Regents’ Room with the Chancellor presiding, concerned with
the operation of the Institution, including the extension of tenure of
office of the Secretary. .

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian pri-
vate funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Committee of

Of this total $100,000 was impounded by the Bureau of the Budget
through direction of the Congress.

In addition, $1,170,000 was appropriated to the National Gallery of
Art, a bureau of the Institution but administered by a separate board
of trusteees; and $636,000 was provided in the District of Columbia
appropriation act for the operation of the National Zoological Park.

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal agencies, as follows:

From the State Department, from the appropriation International
Information and Educational Activities, 1951, a total of $92,740 for
the operation of the Institute of Social Anthropology, including the
issuance of publications resulting from its work.

From the National Park Service, Department of Interior, $309,949
for archeological projects in connection with the River Basin Surveys.

EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL JAMES ARTHUR LECTURE ON THD SUN

In 1931 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York, a part of the income from which was to be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun.

The eighteenth Arthur lecture was delivered in the auditorium of
the Natural History Building on March 22, 1951, by Dr. Walter Orr
Roberts, astrophysicist and director of the High Altitude Observa-
tory, Boulder, Colo. The subject of Dr. Roberts’s address was
“Stormy Weather on the Sun.” This lecture is published in full in
the General Appendix of the present Report of the Board of Regents
(p. 163).

OPENING OF ADAMS-CLEMENT COLLECTION

Exercises were held in the Arts and Industries Building on the
afternoon of April 18, 1951, formally opening a collection of memo-
rabilia of the Adams family given to the Institution on June 1, 1950,
by Miss Mary Louisa Adams Clement, of Warrenton, Va., a descend-
ant through her mother of John Adams, second President of the
United States, and of John Quincy Adams, sixth President. The
collection contains nearly 600 heirlooms pertaining to the Adamses
and their descendants, including 15 portraits by Gilbert Stuart, Ed-
ward Dalton Marchand, Pieter van Huffel, Thomas H. Hull, Asher
B. Durand, John Trumbull, and other artists; a good representation
of period costumes and jewelry; china, glassware, and silver; books
and family letters; and numerous miscellaneous items. The gift is
SECRETARY’S REPORT 7

one of the most important historically to come to the Institution in
recent years. The portraits have been assigned to the National Col-
lection of Fine Arts; the remaining objects to the Department of
History, United States National Museum. At present those portions
of the Adams-Clement Collection chosen for public display are ex-
hibited in the west hall of the Arts and Industries Building. It is
expected that changes and substitutions in the exhibit will be made as
the documentation of the specimens proceeds. The donor died on
September 23, 1950, unfortunately before the formal opening of the
collection. At the ceremonies the speakers were Mrs. Katharine Mc-
Cook Knox, art historian; Maj. Gen. U. 8S. Grant, 3d, president of the
American Planning and Civic Association; Dr. Remington Kellogg,
director of the United States National Museum; and Dr. Alexander
Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

MEMORIAL GIFTS

In memory of their mother, Alice Pike Barney (1860-1931), Wash-
ington artist and civic leader, Natalie Clifford Barney and Laura
Dreyfus-Barney have given the Institution a fund of $15,000 and also
a collection of 224 paintings by Mrs. Barney, 54 pictures by other
artists, and many sculptures and objects of art. The art material is
to be used as the nucleus of a collection for loan in the interests of art
education in the United States and will be known as the Alice Pike
Barney Loan Collection. The fund, to be known as the Alice Pike
Barney Memorial Fund, will be used by the National Collection of
Fine Arts to maintain the loan collection and to organize and circulate
traveling art exhibitions in this country.

Also received during the year was a bequest of $15,000 from the late
George H. Stephenson, of Philadelphia, for the purpose of executing
an appropriate memorial to Brig. Gen. William Mitchell (1879-1936),
of military-aviation fame. Plans for the memorial are being insti-
tuted through the National Air Museum.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—The increment to the national collections, dis-
tributed among the Museum’s six departments, this year aggregated
more than 303,000 objects, bringing the catalog entries to a total of
52,617,298. Some of the year’s more noteworthy accessions included:
In anthropology, fine collections of Colonial furniture and utensils,
further archeological material from Neolithic sites in Honshu, Japan,
and a collection of wooden objects representing the native culture of a
village in northeastern New Guinea; in zoology, a large lot of mam-

8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

mals, birds, and marine invertebrates from Labrador and Newfound-
land; several accessions of Central American birds; a comprehensive
collection of fishes, crustaceans, mollusks, and miscellaneous inverte-
brates from the Gulf of Mexico; several large and important collec-
tions of insects, and several thousand marine invertebrates and shells
from the vicinity of Point Barrow, Alaska; in botany, gifts of plants
especially from Alaska, Honduras, Peri, México, Venezuela, and
Colombia, and more than 16,500 plants received in exchanges with
other institutions; in geology, 22 minerals heretofore unrepresented in
the Museum, 7 meteorites, fossil invertebrates and plants from several
important localities, and fossil vertebrate material from Panama and
the western United States; in engineering and industries, a collection
of historical electronic and electrical apparatus, a complete technical
exhibit of the halftone process, and an exhibit telling the story of
modern surgical sutures; and in history, a model of the battleship
Missouri and the Adams-Clement Collection of memorabilia pertain-
ing to the families of John Adams and John Quincy Adams.

Members of the staff conducted field work in Cuba, Panama, Costa
Rica, Honduras, Colombia, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.
British North Borneo, Okinawa, Alaska, and many sections of the
United States. The Museum issued 26 publications.

National Gallery of Art.—Slightly more than one and a half million
visitors were recorded at the Gallery for the year, about 684,000 less
than for 1949-50. Accessions as gifts, loans, or deposits totaled 4,044,
nearly 1,700 more than last year. On March 17, 1951, the Gallery cele-
brated its tenth anniversary at a special opening of an exhibition of
paintings and other works of art acquired since 1945 by the Samuel
H. Kress Foundation. Over 24,000 invited guests attended. Eight
special exhibits were held at the Gallery during the year. Special
traveling exhibitions of prints from the Rosenwald Collection were
circulated to eight galleries and museums in this country, and exhibi-
tions from the “Index of American Design” were shown 55 times in
20 States and the District of Columbia. The volume on “The Index
of American Design” was published and placed on sale during the
year. Progress was made on the second volume of “Masterpieces of
American Painting from the National Gallery of Art.’ More than
37,000 persons attended the Gallery’s special tours and the “Picture
of the Week” talks. The Sunday afternoon lectures in the auditorium
and the Sunday evening concerts in the garden courts were continued.
The Eighth Annual American Music Festival was held at the Gallery
in April.

. National Collection of Fine Arts —The Smithsonian Art Commis-
sion met on December 5, 1950, and accepted for the National Collection
15 paintings (part of the Adams-Clement gift to the Smithsonian
Institution), 5 miscellaneous oil paintings, 50 miniatures by American
SECRETARY’S REPORT 9

and foreign artists, and several items of Austrian, Dutch, French,
Swedish, and Bohemian glass. Eight miniatures were acquired
through the Catherine Walden Myer fund. A gift in memory of
Alice Pike Barney (1860-1931), Washington artist, brought the In-
Stitution a collection of 278 paintings, to be used as the nucleus of a
loan collection, and a fund of $15,000 to be used in maintaining the
collection and in organizing and circulating traveling art-appreciation
exhibits in this country. Sixteen special exhibits were held during
the year, one of the most noteworthy being the Centennial Anniversary
Exhibition of Paintings by Thomas Wilmer Dewing. Also of special
interest was the opening, on February 23, of the Albert Pinkham
Ryder Room of the John Gellatly Collection, exhibiting together the
17 Ryders in the collection. 7

Freer Gallery of Art.—The Freer collections were enhanced by the
accession of Chinese paintings, pottery, and bronzes; Japanese paint-
ings; and Persian metalwork. The cleaning and restoration of the
Whistler Peacock Room were completed, and the room was reopened
to the public on October 13, 1950. The staff members devoted their
time to the study of new accessions and of objects contemplated for
purchase and to general research in the field of Oriental and Islamic
art. Reports were made on 2,377 objects. ‘Two members of the staff
spent parts of the year pursuing research projects in other countries:
John A. Pope studied Chinese porcelain collections in Tehran and
Istanbul, and Dr. Richard Ettinghausen began a year’s trip to the
Near East, studying in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Vis-
itors to the Gallery totaled 62,895 persons. The Gallery issued
five publications during the year and assisted in the publication of the
final number of Avs Zslamica, under Dr. Ettinghausen’s editorship.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Ethnologists and archeologists
on the Bureau staff continued their respective researches, Director
Stirling in Panama, Dr. Collins in the Canadian Arctic, Dr. Harring
ton in Montana and México, and Dr. Fenton in New Mexico, Cali-
fornia, and Montana. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., continued as
director of the River Basin Surveys, a unit of the Bureau now in its
sixth year of operation, and completed the collection of the first volume
of River Basin Surveys papers. Since the beginning of the River
Basin Surveys field work 2,894 archeological sites have been located
and recorded, and 545 of these have been recommended for excavation
or additional testing. This year’s excavation work covered 20 reser-
voir areas in 10 States, with 26 excavating parties in the field.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, an autonomous unit of the
Bureau financed through transfer of funds from the Department of
State, carried on its research and teaching programs in Brazil, Co-
lombia, Guatemala, México, and Pert.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

The archival material of the Bureau was enriched by the addition
of the original catalog (in Powell’s handwriting) of the photographic
negatives made on Maj. John W. Powell’s famous expedition down
the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.

International Exchange Service.—As the official agency for the ex-
change with other countries of governmental, scientific, and literary
publications, the Exchange Service handled 1,011,000 packages of
such publications (total weight, 788,773 pounds) for transmission,
or about the same as during the previous year. As last year, no ship-
ments were made to China or Rumania, but consignments are moving
to all other countries. The number of sets of United States official
publications sent abroad in exchange for similar publications of other
countries is now 102 (61 full and 41 partial sets). Eighty-five copies
of the Federal Register and 92 of the Congressional Record are also
sent abroad through the Exchange Service.

National Zoological Park.—This year brought the largest attend-
ance in the history of the Zoo—an estimated total of 3,460,400 visitors,
or at the average rate of more than 9,000 a day. At the close of the
fiscal year, there were 2,813 animals in the Zoo collections, the ad-
ditions during the year (1,768) almost exactly balancing the losses
and removals (1,776). Among the more unusual accessions, some rep-
resenting species never before shown in this Zoo, were 17 Santa Marta
tinamous from Colombia; a splendid example of the black-headed
python of Australia; a rare native wild goat from Crete; specimens
of the large Meller’s chameleon from Africa; three-banded armadillos
from central South America; and six Labrador lemmings. In all,
217 creatures were born or hatched at the Zoo—62 mammals, 57 birds,
and 98 reptiles.

Astrophysical Observatory.—The Observatory continued its studies
of solar radiation at its two high-altitude field stations at Table Moun-
tain, Calif., and Montezuma, Chile. At Table Mountain a method is
being developed for determining by spectrobolometric measurements
the quantity of ozone in the upper atmosphere. The textile-exposure
studies at the Montezuma station for the Office of the Quartermaster
General were terminated in May. In cooperation with the Meteorolog-
ical Division, Chemical Corps, at Camp Detrick, Md., some work was
done on the problem of improving the melikeron, an instrument de-
veloped some years ago by the Observatory to measure outgoing ra-
diation from earth to space. Two silver-disk pyrheliometers were
constructed and furnished at cost, one to the Government of Israel
and the other to the Air Force’s Research Laboratories at Cambridge,
Mass. The division of radiation and organisms, following a 2-year
period of setting up specialized equipment and facilities, and new
electronic instruments, has begun a series of biochemical investiga-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 11

tions of photomorphogenesis in green plants which promise interest-
ing results.

National Air Museum.—A number of outstanding accessions were
received by the National Air Museum during the year. Foremost
among these were the Bell X-1, the world’s first supersonic, man-
carrying airplane, which has been installed on exhibit in the Aircraft
Building; and a duplicate example of the world’s first successful super-
sonic ram-jet engine and its rocket booster. In all, 99 specimens,
including four full-sized aircraft, were recorded from 30 sources.
Inasmuch as over two-thirds of the Air Museum’s collection of full-
sized aircraft are in storage, providing and maintaining storage fa-
cilities remain a serious problem; and toward the end of the year
this became aggravated when the Museum was ordered to vacate its
storage facility at Park Ridge, Il, to make way for aircraft manu-
facture. The National Air Museum Advisory Board met on June 28,
1951, with this problem a primary concern. During the year, by means
of a special exhibit, shown first in the Navy Department and then
in the Pentagon Building, the Museum marked the fortieth anni-
versary of Naval Airplane Carrier Operations.

Canal Zone Biological Area.—Contract was let during the year
for constructing a new laboratory building of modest design at the
Barro Colorado Island station. Thirty-three scientists made use of
the island’s facilities during the period, carrying on studies in various
fields of biology. Some of the research projects under way are worth
noting: An exhaustive study of the spiders of the region; a checklist
of Barro Colorado Island birds; investigation of the population den-
sity and social organization of the island’s howler monkeys; a study
of the light-sensitive structures of animals; corrosion and deteriora-
tion tests; and studies of fungi. The resident manager continued his
long-term termite-resistance tests and his fruit-fly studies.

PUBLICATIONS

Throughout the entire history of the Smithsonian, publications have
constituted the Institution’s principal medium for the “diffusion of
knowledge,” one of the two basic functions of the organization as
prescribed by James Smithson, the founder. The Institution issues
eight regular series of publications and six others that appear less
frequently. Embodying the results of researches of the Smithsonian
staff and collaborators, these publications are distributed free to more
than a thousand libraries, both here and abroad, as well as to a large
list of educational and scientific organizations and specialists in var-
ious fields. In all, 123,401 copies of Smithsonian publications were
distributed this year.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

During the past year, 61 publications appeared under the Smith-
sonian imprint. Outstanding among these were Part 11 of “Birds of
North and Middle America,” by Herbert Friedmann; another volume
of “A Monograph of the Existing Crinoids,” by Austin H. Clark;
volume 6 of the “Handbook of South American Indians” ; “The North-
ern and Central Nootkan Tribes,” by Philip Drucker; and two mono-
graphs of the Institute of Social Anthropology. A complete list of
the year’s publications will be found in the report of the chief of the
editorial division, appendix 12.

Smithsonian tables.—It has long been the practice of the Institution
to assist students and research workers by publishing compilations of
tables useful in all kinds of technical, industrial, and scientific work.
Since 1852, when the first edition of Prof. Arnold Guyot’s “Meteoro-
logical and Physical Tables” was published by the Institution, thou-
sands of copies of the Smithsonian tables have been distributed
throughout the world. These volumes, which have fallen in four
categories (meteorological, physical, mathematical, and geographi-
cal), have been kept revised and reprinted as new data in these fields
became available. During the present year, three volumes of these
tables were in process:

The sixth revised edition of the Smithsonian Meteorological Tables,
prepared by Robert J. List, of the U. S. Weather Bureau, was ex-
pected to be off the press before the end of the calendar year 1951.

The manuscript for the ninth revised edition of the Smithsonian
Physical Tables, compiled under the direction of Dr. W. E. Forsythe,
of Cleveland, was completed during the year and submitted for print-
ing estimates.

The Institution accepted the manuscript for a new volume in the
mathematical series: Smithsonian Logarithmic Tables, prepared by
G. W. Spenceley, Rheba M. Spenceley, and E. R. Epperson, of Miami
(Ohio) University. These tables present 23-decimal-place values of
natural and common logarithms and will be published by the Institu-
tion under a grant from the Research Corporation of New York.

LIBRARY

The library of the Institution received 52,685 publications during
the year, mostly by gifts and through exchanges with other organiza-
tions and institutions. The largest single gift of the year was in the
field of philately—a collection of about 500 books and periodicals pre-
sented by Malcolm Macgregor, of Bronxville, N. Y., which were
assigned to the philatelic sectional library in the Department of
History.

Statistics compiled by the librarian show that the staff entered
17,854 periodical parts, circulated 11,869 books and periodicals, ar-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 13

ranged 465 new exchanges, cataloged 6,992 volumes and pamphlets,
added 29,981 cards to shelflists and catalogs, transferred 19,016 pub-
lications to the Library of Congress, prepared 1,250 volumes for
binding, and repaired 1,300 volumes in the National Museum. At the
close of the year the library’s holdings totaled 932,740 volumes (ex-
clusive of incomplete volumes of serials and separates and reprints
from serials). More than half of these are housed in the Library of
Congress as the Smithsonian Deposit.
Respectfully submitted.
ALEXANDER Wermore, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
Report on the United States National Museum

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1951:

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Construction began on the conversion of the southwest court in the
Arts and Industries Building to a modern storage facility, and $80,295
was obligated from funds appropriated for this purpose. The sum
of $47,013 was allotted for the construction of storage cases and
drawers, and outside contracts were let for building the wooden
frames for these; the mechanical shops of the Institution will cover
the frames with sheets of thin steel. Steel racks to provide accessi-
bility to the stacks of large-sized drawers, totaling about 3,500, are
now being fabricated by the maintenance and operation division.

COLLECTIONS

More than 303,000 specimens were incorporated into the national
collections and distributed among the six departments during the
year, as follows: Anthropology, 15,396; zoology, 225,638; botany,
38,603 ; geology, 16,723 ; engineering and industries, 3,073; and history,
3,716. Most of the accessions were acquired as gifts from individuals
or as transfers from Government departments and agencies. The
complete report on the Museum, published as a separate document,
includes a detailed list of the year’s acquisitions, of which the more
important are summarized below. Catalog entries in all departments
now total 32,617,298. It may be noted that the annual increment of
specimens varies from a quarter to three-quarters of a million objects,
depending upon the number of large collections obtained.

Anthropology.—Household furniture, ceramics, glassware, pewter,
wrought-iron and brass utensils, woodenware, folk paintings, em-
broideries, and textiles used by residents of New England during the
period 1630 to 1840, which had been assembled by Dr. and Mrs. Arthur
M. Greenwood at Time Stone Farm, Marlborough, Mass., have now
been added to the national collections. Another outstanding addition
to the ceramic and cultural collections is the gift by Mrs. Lura

SECRETARY'S REPORT 15

Woodside Watkins of 314 earthenware utensils, which were excavated
at 20 documented New England potteries in existence between 1687
and the late 1880’s. Colonial utensils and Indian artifacts from
Kicotan, Va., one of the earliest English settlements in America,
were presented by Alvin W. and Joseph B. Brittingham.

From Maj. Howard A. MacCord, U.S. Army, 413 specimens of stone
artifacts, pottery, and other materials from various Neolithic sites
on the island of Honshu, Japan, were received.

Gen. and Mrs. David G. Barr and Patty Barr presented a black
silk cape with fur collar and lining of golden-haired monkey skins,
worn by a Manchu emperor. Lt. Col. Clifford Lee Smires gave a col-
lection of wooden objects, including a ceremonial staff, wooden bow],
bamboo arrows, shell trumpet, decorated wooden drums, and carved
and decorated wood utensils, which were obtained from the natives
of a village near Aitape, northeastern New Guinea.

Casts of fossil apelike hominoids from East Africa, one a replica of
a nearly complete skull of Proconsul africanus and the others replicas
of bones belonging to australopithecines, were presented by the
American Institute of Human Paleontology and the Wenner-Gren
Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Zoology.—Six unusually fine chamois from the Bavarian Alps were
presented by the collector, Capt. Kimberly Brabson, U. S. Army.
Maj. Robert Traub, a member of the scrub-typhus unit organized by
the United States Army Medical Service, forwarded 88 mammals from
Malaya and 57 reptiles and amphibians from Selangor. More than
200 arboreal mammals, collected by Dr. H. C. Clark and associates in
connection with research on jungle yellow fever at the Gorgas
Memorial Laboratory in Panama and México, were presented to the
division of mammals. Drs. Robert Rausch and Everett L. Schiller,
Arctic Health Research Center, United States Public Health Service,
transferred 58 Alaskan mammals. During the summer cruise of the
Blue Dolphin, conducted by Commander David G. Nutt under the
auspices of the Arctic Institute of North America, Charles O. Hand-
ley, Jr., collected for the Museum 194 mammals and 201 birds from
Labrador and Newfoundland; and to the national collections were
also added approximately 1,500 marine invertebrates.

Income from the W. L. Abbott bequest financed the ornithological
field work of M. A. Carriker, Jr., in Colombia, and the Smithsonian
private funds that of Dr. A. Wetmore and W. M. Perrygo in Panama.
The Colombian collection comprised 3,480 bird skins, 53 skeletons, 2
sets of eggs, and 1 nest; the Panamanian, 526 bird skins, 6 skeletons,
and 6 carcasses in alcohol. In addition, 393 bird skins from Denmark
and 344 from British Columbia were purchased from private funds.
Especially worthy of mention this year are the 453 skins and 29 skele-
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

tons of birds from South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, including 59
species new to the Museum, which were collected by Dr. Herbert
Friedmann. Other accessions of importance were 28 bird skins from
the South Australian Museum; 5 Pacific Island birds from Peabody
Museum, Yale University; 117 skins of Portuguese East African
birds from Museu Dr. Alvaro de Castro, Lourengo Marques; 188
Japanese bird skins from Col. L. R. Wolfe; 219 sets of eggs from
Venezuela and Trinidad collected by Robert N. Berryman; and 692
skins, 35 sets of eggs, and 28 nests from Alaska transferred to the
Museum through Dr. Laurence Irving by the Arctic Health Research
Center, United States Public Health Service.

Among the accessions worthy of note received by the division of
reptiles and amphibians were 35 specimens from Korea presented by
William E. Old, Jr.; 71 Indian reptiles, including two species of
Uropeltis, from the School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta, India;
70 reptiles and amphibians collected by Harry Hoogstraal, mostly in
Kenya, Africa; and 15 reptiles and amphibians from Saudi Arabia, a
gift of Set. Edward Murray.

The fishery investigations conducted by Stewart Springer on the
Fish and Wildlife Service vessel Oregon resulted in the transfer
to the Museum of one of the most comprehensive collections of fishes,
crustaceans, mollusks, and miscellaneous invertebrates ever made in
the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As exchanges, there were
received from the Applied Fisheries Laboratory, University of Wash-
ington, through Drs. Lauren R. Donaldson and Arthur D. Welander,
144 fishes, including a number of types of new species, from the
Marshall Islands; from Rhodes University College, through Dr. J.
L. B. and Margaret M. Smith, 91 fishes from Knysna Estuary, Cape
Province, South Africa; and from the University of Hawaii, through
Dr. William A. Gosline, 43 Hawaiian fishes, including several types.
While studying the poisonous fishes of Micronesia, Dr. Eugenie Clark
made a collection of 3,730 fishes, which she presented to the division
of fishes.

The most important accessions received by the division of insects
were transfers from the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine,
totaling 66,498 insects, of which 18,498 were derived from the Alaska
insect project. The gift to the U.S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant
Quarantine by Dr. Albert R. Shadle of his lifetime collection of nearly
5,400 insects and transferred to the Museum, along with Egger’s col-
lection of bark beetles, and over 1,900 Egyptian insects obtained by
Curtis Sabrosky, likewise enhanced the usefulness of the national col-

lections. As a gift, the Museum acquired the collection of H. G.
Barber, consisting of 32,151 bugs and beetles.
SECRETARY’S REPORT ry

In the course of an ecological survey in the vicinity of Point Barrow,
Alaska, Prof. G. FE. MacGinitie, formerly director of the Arctic Re-
search Laboratory, and Mrs. MacGinitie, assembled nearly 7,500 mis-
cellaneous invertebrates and approximately 1,600 marine shells, and
through their active interest these collections came to the Museum as
a transfer from the Office of Naval Research.

As gifts, the division of marine invertebrates received nearly 3,000
crayfishes and other fresh-water invertebrates collected in Indiana
and the TVA region by Dr. Rendell Rhoades; 367 specimens of
sponges, including 98 types, collected in Micronesia by Dr. M. W. de
Laubenfels while participating in the scientific investigations spon-
sored by the Pacific Science Board, National Research Council; and
437 miscellaneous invertebrates dredged off the west coast of Florida,
a gift of Dr. J. Brookes Knight. <A selected series of more than 5,000
copepods and other marine invertebrates were collected for the Mu-
seum in Puget Sound, Wash., by Associate Curator Paul L. Ig. As
an exchange with Dr. R. Zariquiey A., Barcelona, the Museum received
a selected set of decapod crustaceans from the Mediterranean coast
of Spain. Types and paratypes of a number of invertebrates were
received as gifts.

Most noteworthy of the 208 accessions received during the year by
the division of mollusks were 275 marine forms from Malindi, pre-
sented by the Kenya Colony Game Department, Nairobi, through R.
Teague; nearly 2,000 land mollusks from Cuba, a gift from Sr. Oscar
Acalde Ledoén, of Cienfuegos; 604 land and fresh-water mollusks from
Panama and Ecuador, transferred by Dr. James Zetek, Canal Zone
Biological Area; 105 Japanese mollusks from the Zoological Institute,
Kyoto University; and the types and paratypes of several recently
described mollusks. Types of parasitic nematodes, annelids, trema-
todes, and cestodes were received from several specialists.

Several interesting echinoderms, including a specimen of Asterias
westita, described by Thomas Say in 1825 and not seen heretofore since
then, were accessioned this year from the Institute of Fisheries
Research, University of North Carolina.

Botany—C. V. Morton, curator, division of ferns, collected 2,610
plants in Honduras and 851 in West Virginia and Michigan for the
National Herbarium. Justice William O. Douglas presented a col-
lection of 184 mounted plants from Lebanon, and 825 plants obtained
in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands by Dr. Louis H. Jordal were trans-
ferred from the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy.
Other gifts included 2,234 plants from the Museo de Historia Natural
“Javier Prado,” Lima, Peri; 662 Mexican plants from the University
of Washington; and 522 Venezuelan plants from Brother Ginés. As
exchanges, the National Herbarium received 16,645 specimens, of

1,273 Hawaiian and Pacific Islands plants from the Bernice P. Bishop
Museum; and 689 southern Brazilian plants from Fundacién Miguel
Lillo, Tucuman, Argentina.

Geology.—Twenty-two minerals hitherto unrepresented were added
to the mineralogical collection, of which three were received as gifts
and nineteen were acquired through exchange.

The 13 specimens of euclase from Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil,
purchased under the Roebling fund, comprise some of the finest known
specimens of this mineral. The Canfield bequest provided the funds
for the purchase of vanadinite crystal groups from México, two Bra-
zilian tourmaline crystals, a large and perfectly formed manganotani-
lite and simpsonite from Brazil, proustite crystals from Chile, a fine
group of quartz crystals from Japan, and an opalized cedar cone
from Nevada.

An unusual 71.20-carat aquamarine from Ceylon was purchased
under the Chamberlain fund for the gem collection, and a very fine
110.8-carat pink tourmaline from Manchuria under the Roebling fund.
A collection of Japanese cultured pearls, consisting of 2 strands and
395 individual pearls, were received as a gift from K. Mikimoto & Co.,
Ltd. Other additions to the collection included uranium and vana-
dium ores from Utah; chrome ores from Pakistan; manganese ores
from India; and tin and tungsten ores from Burma.

The meteorite collection again benefited by the continuing interest
of Dr. Stuart H. Perry, who donated seven meteorites, one of which
was an iron recently found at Mayodan, N. C., weighing 15.46 kilo-
grams. A small sample of the Maziba, Uganda, Africa, meteorite was
presented by John S. Albanese.

Many noteworthy specimens of fossil invertebrates and plants came
to the division of invertebrate paleontology and paleobotany as gifts,
including 719 slides of types of Mesozoic and Cenozoic ostracods and
Foraminifera from Dr. C. I. Alexander; 20 holotype and paratype
Tertiary Foraminifera from P. Bronnimann; 1,000 upper Miocene
invertebrates from S. E. Crumb; 200 Triassic invertebrates from the
European Alps, presented by Dr. Franco Rasetti; 600 British Paleo-
zo1¢ and Mesozoic invertebrates from Alwyn Williams; and 900 late
Tertiary plants from Credo, Colo., presented by the late Belle K.
Stewart.

More than 100 Mississippian and Pennsylvanian crinoids from Ok-
Jahoma were purchased under the Springer fund from Harrell L.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 19

Strimple. As in previous years, the income from the Walcott fund
financed paleontological field work which resulted in the acquisition of
additional invertebrate fossil materials by Dr. G. Arthur Cooper
and W. T. Allen from western Texas and by Dr. Cooper from Virginia
and ‘Tennessee.

Transfers from the United States Geological Survey include, among
others, upper Paleozoic invertebrates from the Brooks Range of
Alaska, fresh-water mollusks, and ammonites. Exchanges brought to
the Museum seeds of Tertiary plants from Germany; lower Ordovi-
cian brachiopods from Norway; Cretaceous and Tertiary Forminifera
from Sweden, France, Italy, Algeria, and Cuba; Permian fusulinid
Foraminifera from Tunisia; and Jurassic and Recent Foraminifera
from Germany.

Material sufficient for the mounting of a skeleton of the giant
ground sloth, Megatherium, which was excavated by Dr. C. L. Gazin
and Franklin Pearce in Panama, constitutes the most noteworthy ad-
dition to the vertebrate fossil collection. Beautifully preserved mid-
dle Eocene fish were found in the Green River shales of Colorado,
Utah, and Wyoming by Dr. D. H. Dunkle and Franklin Pearce. The
field work in Panama and that on fossil fishes was financed from the
income of the Walcott fund. Some 80 fossil mammals from the Wind
River Eocene of Wyoming and from the Oligocene of Montana and
North Dakota, collected by Dr. T. E. White and transferred to the
Museum by River Basin Surveys, deserve special mention.

Engineering and industries—The section of wood technology re-
ceived 345 samples of woods of Surinam by exchange from the Hout
Instituut, Netherlands. In textiles, 407 wooden blocks used as braid-
ing and embroidery patterns in the nineteenth century were presented
by Edna Plummer, and 15 coverlet drafts of the period 1831-53 by
Lelah Allison. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., prepared and
presented an exhibit showing the manufacture, properties, and ver-
satility of nylon yarn.

The National Bureau of Standards transferred a collection of 155
pieces of historical electronic and electrical apparatus, including a
radiosonde and a radiosonde transmitter. Early electrical measuring
instruments developed by Europeans and Americans were presented
by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corp. The American Screw Co.
donated 13 inventors’ models and machines illustrating the develop-
ment of wood-screw-making machinery in the transition from hand-
fed, individually operated machines to the hopper-fed, semiautomatic
machines,

The most important accession by the division of graphic arts was
a gift from the Sun Chemical Corp., through the Lithographers Na-
tional Association, of 23 lithographs of the Fuchs and Lang collection
of historical lithographs. A complete technical exhibit of the half-
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

tone process was presented by R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co. The section
of photography accessioned a collection of 71 fine pictorial photo-
eraphs made by members of the American Society of Photographic
Art and representing work in control process printing by many noted
photographers.

An exhibit entitled “The Story of Modern Surgical Sutures,” do-
nated by Davis & Geck, Inc., depicts in full color the development
of sutures from their source through the various stages of manutfac-
turing, research, and testing into actual use in the operating room.

History—The Adams-Clement collection, the gift of the late Mary
Louisa Adams Clement, of costumes, jewelry, portraits, silverware,
china, books, and papers belonging to the families of John Adams
and John Quincy Adams, constitutes the most important accession
received by the division of civil history.

The naval collections were increased by the deposit by the Depart-
ment of the Navy of scale models of the battleship Missour?, the cruiser
Brooklyn of the Spanish-American War period, an LSM and an LCI.

The medal press and tools used by Edward Stabler, diesinker and
seal engraver of Sandy Spring, Md., 1794-1888, were acquired by the
division of numismatics as a gift from Mrs. Maurice J. Stabler.

Recently issued stamps, totaling some 900 in number, were trans-
ferred to the division of philately by the Universal Postal Union and
the United States Post Office Department.

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

Following the conclusion of the conference convened by the Cuban
Ministry of Education at Habana on problems of Caribbean archeol-
ogy and ethnology, H. W. Krieger visited several historical Taino
Indian village sites, notably Vigia and Barajagua, in the province of
Oriente, eastern Cuba. On June 14, Dr. Waldo R. Wedel was detailed
to the Smithsonian River Basin Surveys to supervise the excavation
of a stratified Arikara village site near Pierre, S. Dak.

In connection with his studies on distribution and variation in the
bird life of southern Central America and northern South America,
Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
made his seventh expedition to the Republic of Panama, accompanied
by W. M. Perrygo of the U. S: National Museum. The men located
at the beginning of March on Cerro Campana, the first mountain of
size found to the west of the depression through which the Panama
Canal crosses the Isthmus. The work here served to extend the known
range of a number of mountain forms of birds from Veraguas and
Chiriqui to this southern outpost of the great mountain chain that
comes down through Central America. Additional collections were
made from E] Valle in the Province of Coclé, where forest still remains
SECRETARY’S REPORT 21

on mountain shoulders around the valley. The field studies terminated
at the beginning of April, when administrative matters recalled Dr.
Wetmore to Washington.

Under the income of the W. L. Abbott fund, M. A. Carriker, Jr.,
continued ornithological collections in northern Colombia from De-
cember to the end of the fiscal year. The work this season extended
into the difficult and poorly known area of the western slopes of the
Choeé in the northwestern part of the country. From Buenaventura
Mr. Carriker went to the lower Rio San Juan where he made important
collections at Punto Muchimbo. On January 19 he moved to Nuquf, on
the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Rio Nuqui, and later continued
inland to a base at the highest point to be reached by canoe travel
in the foothills of the Baud6 Mountains. His collections covered the
area from the river to the crest of the range. Maps of the region are
incorrect, as the altitudes are lower than recorded and the summit is
a narrow steep-sided ridge without extensive level ground. In March
Mr. Carriker traveled farther north to Jurubidé where again he lo-
cated inland at the end of canoe navigation whence he had access to
the Baudé range. The work here terminated early in April, and the
party returned to Medellin. The latter part of the season was devoted
to the region in the vicinity of Sonson near the Rio Magdalena. The
collections made this year represent more than 400 species of birds, a
number of forms being new to the National Museum series.

Grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Philo-
sophical Society, and special research funds of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution enabled Dr. Herbert Friedmann to devote 5 months to a study
of the habits and life histories of the honey-guides and parasitic
weaverbirds in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. At the request
of the U. S. Army Medical Department Graduate School, Dr. David
H. Johnson was detailed to accompany a medical research unit en-
gaged in an intensive study of the mammalian and other hosts involved
in the transmission of scrub typhus, and part, at least, of this field
study will be carried on in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu, British
North Borneo. Under a cooperative arrangement with the Office of
Naval Research, Dr. Henry W. Setzer departed from Washington for
the Arctic Research Laboratory at Point Barrow, Alaska, on June 3
to make an ecological survey during the summer months of the mam-
mals inhabiting the Arctic slope of Alaska. O.L. Cartwright made an
intensive study of the insect fauna in the vicinity of the Inter-Amer-
ican Institute at Turrialba, Costa Rica.

During March and April, C. V. Morton was the guest of the Escuela
Agricola Panamericana, of the United Fruit Co., located at
El] Zamorano in a mountain valley some 25 miles from Tegucigalpa,
Honduras. Collecting trips for ferns were made to the cloud forest
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

on the summit of Mount Uyuca and to other areas in the departments
of Morazin and El Paraiso. While collecting in the cloud-forest area
of the San Juancito Mountains, Mr. Morton was the guest of the
New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Co. Another longer trip
was made to Lake Yojoa, in the departments of Santa Barbara and
Cortés, and to the mountains near Siquatepeque, Comayagua. On
May 31 Dr. E. H. Walker departed from Washington for Okinawa
in response to a request made to the Pacific Science Board, National
Research Council, by the Department of the Army for the assignment
of a botanist to make a 4-months’ study of the flora of the Ryukyu
Islands.

The program of investigations undertaken by the department of
geology and financed for the most part from income of the Walcott
bequest, involved field work in Alaska, California, Utah, Wyoming,
Colorado, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, and Panama. Dr. George S.
Switzer completed field studies relating to the genesis of iron ores in
the Iron Springs district of southwestern Utah. During the early
part of the summer of 1950, Dr. G. Arthur Cooper and W. T. Allen
continued field work on the Wolfcamp formation, the lowest portion
of the Permian beds in the Glass Mountains of west Texas. Later
in the summer Dr. Cooper visited Blacksburg, Va., where, accom-
panied by Dr. B. N. Cooper, of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he
spent several days collecting Ordovican fossils from the Catawba
Valley section. Subsequently a thick sequence of Ordovician rocks
was examined by Dr. Cooper and Dr. R. B. Neuman, of Gatlinsburg,
Tenn., during a brief visit to the west side of the Great Smoky Moun-
tains. Under a contract between the Office of Naval Research and
the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., assembled a
large collection of living Arctic foraminiferal faunas near Point Bar-
row, Alaska, during the summer of 1950. With the assistance of Max
B. Payne, of Bakersfield, Calif., Dr. Loeblich, late in April and in
May 1951, obtained foraminiferal samples from the Moreno and
Panoche formations in Fresno County, Calif., and with Dr. Edward
Bailey, of the U. S. Geological Survey, in the Franciscan series in
Santa Clara County, Calif.

In the summer of 1950, Dr. D. H. Dunkle and F. L. Pearce made
careful stratigraphic collections of fossil plants, invertebrates, fishes,
and mammals in the Green River shales of Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming. Early in 1951, Dr. C. L. Gazin and his assistant, F. L.
Pearce, returned to the interior of western Panamé to continue with
the investigation of the Pleistocene fauna of that area. Most of the
skeletal remains excavated belonged to the giant ground sloth,
Megatherium, but, in addition, fragmentary remains were found of a
peccary, a giant armadillo, and a bird. The field work in Panamé
SECRETARY'S REPORT 23

this year was restricted to large springs near the town of Pesé. As in
the previous year, the expedition was carried on in cooperation with
the Panamanian Government, and in particular with the Museo
Nacional de Panama.

At the invitation of Dr. George Crile, Jr., Mendel L. Peterson,
associate curator of military and naval history, during the first two
weeks of June 1951 participated in the investigation of ships wrecked
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries off the Florida Keys.
Two boats equipped with air compressors for use with diving equip-
ment and a large water pump attached to a jet hose for clearing sand
from objects found on the sea bottom were utilized in this underwater
exploration. Many interesting relics from one British ship, including
iron cannon barrels, 6- and 12-pound shot, fragments of Chinese porce-
lain and pottery, pieces of rum bottles, clay pipes, and remnants of a
silver-trimmed jar, were brought to the surface.

VISITORS

An increase of 246,340 visitors to the Museum buildings was re-
corded over the previous year, the totals being 2,617,226 for 1951 and
2,370,886 for 1950. July 1950 was the month of the largest attendance
with 352,147 visitors; May 1951 was the next largest with 334,844.
Attendance records for the three buildings show the following num-
bers of visitors: Smithsonian Building, 556,110; Arts and Industries
Building, 1,303,990; Natural History Building, 757,126. The average
daily number of visitors was 7,190. During the past 10 years more
than 19,445,000 visitors have viewed the exhibits in these three
buildings.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

On October 30, 1950, Dr. Clifford Evans, Jr., whose particular field
of interest is Latin America, was appointed associate curator in the
division of archeology.

After 42 years of association with the institution, Austin H. Clark
retired from active service as curator of the division of echinoderms
on December 31, 1950. During his incumbency the collection of echino-
derms grew to be the largest, and, except for east Atlantic and Med-
iterranean areas, by far the most representative in the world. Charles
O. Handley, Jr., was appointed assistant curator in the division of
mammals on November 28, 1950.

After being associated with the National Herbarium for 82 years,
Ellsworth P. Killip, head curator since the organization of the de-
partment of botany, retired at his own request on September 30, 1950,
and to this vacancy Jason R. Swallen, who had served as curator,

981445—52——3
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

division of grasses, was promoted on December 10, 1950. Other
changes in that department were the resignation of Dr. George A.
Llano, associate curator, division of cryptogams, on February 8, 1951,
and the appointment of Dr. Ernest R. Sohns as associate curator,
division of grasses, on June 1, 1951.

Arthur L. Bowsher, ado oie curator, division of invertebrate
paleontology and paleobotany, returned to the Museum rolls on
August 1, 1950, from temporary transfer to the U. 8. Geological Sur-
vey for special stratigraphic and paleontologic studies in the
Mississippian rocks of northern Alaska in connection with exploration
for oil in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4.

On June 21, 1951, the department of engineering wind industries lost
by retirement Fred 0. Reed, associate curator in charge of the sections
of manufactures and dericattaral industries, after 28 years of service.

Charles Carey, acting head curator, department of history, re-
tired at his own request on November 30, 1950, after 30 years of
government service. Mrs. Catherine L. Manning, assistant curator,
division of philately, retired January 31, 1951, after 27 years in that
division, having reached the statutory age limit. Franklin R. Bruns,
Jr., philatelic staff columnist for the New York World Telegram
and Sun, was appointed on February 9, 1951, to succeed Mrs. Manning.

the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, 1945-1951.

The cataloging and filing of photographs in the George Martin
Richter Archives continued to make progress, with the gradual en-
largement of the collection. Also, about 100 additional catalog notes
were prepared for the new catalog of paintings in the National
Gallery.

Further activities of the department are indicated under the head-
ing “Publications.”

RESTORATION AND REPAIR OF WORKS OF ART

Necessary restoration and repair of works of art in the Gallery’s
collections were made by Francis Sullivan, resident restorer to the
Gallery. All work was completed in the restorer’s studio in the
Gallery.

PUBLICATIONS

During the year Huntington Cairns contributed an article on the
late American philosopher, Morris R. Cohen, to the Rivista Inter-
nazionale di Filosofia del Diritto; reviews of “Styles in Painting,”
by Paul Zucker, “Impressionists and Symbolists,” by Lionello Ven-
turi, and “Painting in France, 1895-1949,” by San Lazzaro, to the
Yale Review; and the foreword to “Morals and Law: the Growth of
Aristotle’s Legal Theory,” by Max Hamburger. He also delivered
a series of eight lectures at the Johns Hopkins University on “The
Theory of Criticism.”

The book “Paintings from America,” by John Walker, published
by Penguin Books, Ltd., appeared during this year, and Mr. Walker’s
book review of “Landscape into Art,” by Sir Kenneth Clark, was
published in the December 1950 number of Burlington Magazine.
Also, Mrs. John Shapley contributed an article, “A Predella Panel

SECRETARY'S REPORT 37

Progress was made on the second volume of “Masterpieces of Paint-
ing from the National Gallery of Art” by Huntington Cairns and John
Walker; and work on Erwin O. Christensen’s second Decorative Arts
Handbook, “Objects of Medieval Art,” and his third Decorative Arts
Handbook, “Jewels and Rock Crystals,” approached completion.

During the past fiscal year the Publications Fund added 8 new
11-x-14’’ color reproductions to the large group already available,
and 5 more plates of the new Kress paintings were completed and
ready for use; 17 additional new plates in this size were on order.
Portfolio No. 2 on “The Life of Christ,” containing fifteen 11—x-14’’
color reproductions and accompanying text, was issued. An exchange
of 11-x-14”’ prints with the Metropolitan Museum in New York was
also instituted.

The long-awaited book entitled “The Index of American Design,”
with a foreword by Erwin O. Christensen, was published during the
fiscal year and received wide acclaim. A new type of publication, a
guidebook to the Italian paintings, is now on order.

About 3,000 copies of the catalog for the Sesquicentennial Exhibi-
tion, put on sale a year ago, were sold; and during the exhibition of
Canadian paintings over 300 catalogs as well as portfolios and maga-
zines were distributed.

A new set of Index of American Design playing cards was made
available; and three recordings by the National Gallery Symphony
Orchestra were put on sale for the first time.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

The attendance for the General, Congressional, and Special Tours,
and for the “Picture of the Week,” was more than 37,000 for the fiscal
year. The Sunday afternoon lectures in the auditorium, by members
of the staff and visiting lecturers, continue to be a popular activity
of the Education Office. Three Sunday afternoon programs were
given over to the showing of educational art films.

The work of the Department has been extended by circulating the
black-and-white film strip of 300 paintings from the Gallery’s collec-
tion; by lending slides and the film “The National Gallery of Art.”

The monthly Calendar of Events announcing all the Gallery activi-
ties, including notices of exhibitions, new publications, lectures, gal-
lery talks, tours, and concerts, was mailed to approximately 4,700
persons each month.

LIBRARY

The most important contributions to the Library this year were
the books, pamphlets, periodicals, and subscriptions purchased out of
the fund presented to the National Gallery of Art by Paul Mellon.
These included the collection of 2,775 art sales catalogs dating from
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

1727 through 1948 purchased from Martinus Nijhoff at The Hague, a
collection containing several rare manuscript catalogs. Gifts in-
cluded 145 books, pamphlets, and periodicals, while 700 books, etc.,
were received on exchange from other institutions. During the year
375 persons other than the Gallery staff have used the Library for
research either in person or by phone.

INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN

During the fiscal year, 603 examples from the Index were repro-
duced in various magazines while 284 were borrowed for use in forth-
coming publications. Of the 630 persons visiting the Gallery for the
purpose of studying Index material, 567 were new users. In all, 948
photographs of Index material were sent out for use by designers,
possible publication, for research, study, etc., and for publicity; and
413 slides of Index renderings were used in connection with lectures.

Mr. Christensen, as a member of the faculty of the Seminar in
American Culture, New York State Historical Association, Coopers-
town, N. Y., participated in lecture courses, panel discussions, and
classes.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING

During the past year, the Gallery building and grounds and me-
chanical equipment were maintained at the high standard established
in the past. Considerable redecorating work was done, including the
painting of several galleries and offices. Flowering plants, totaling
3,294 in number, and valued at approximately $6,975, were grown in
the moats and used for decoration of the Garden Courts.

The condenser water, chilled-water, and dehumidifier pumps, and
the fountain and sump pumps were overhauled; all air-conditioning
equipment was inspected, serviced, and repairs made; two refrigera-
tion machines were completely overhauled; new lawn sprinklers
were installed in the space between the sidewalk and Constitution
Avenue, east of the service entrance; 12 sections of skylight, repre-
senting an area of more than 5,000 square feet, were completely
overhauled ; an azalea storage frame was constructed in the southwest
moat with surplus building tile; a contract was entered into in June
1951 for the raising to the original level of the granite and marble
platforms at the Mall entrance which had settled and created a poten-
tial hazard to the public.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GALLERIES AND OFFICES

Work under the contract accepted June 24, 1949, for completing 12
galleries in the east end of the building was completed on July 15,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 39

1950; and work under the contract awarded March 10, 1950, for the
completion of five offices with a slide storage room in the west wing
on the ground floor for the Educational Office, was completed in
December 1950.

A contract was entered into on July 31, 1950, for the completion of
five galleries in the west end of the building. It was anticipated that
the work on these galleries would be completed early in 1951; however,
completion has been greatly delayed because of the difficulty en-
countered in obtaining the quality of oak flooring called for in the
specifications. Private funds were made available for these purposes.

CONSTRUCTION—STORAGE FACILITIES

A contract was entered into on March 1, 1951, to build a storage
room adjacent to the Gallery building in the southeast moat. Work
is progressing satisfactorily, and it is expected that this project will
be completed by late summer.

A contract was entered into on March 2, 1951, to build a storage
building and reconstruct a cottage on the site of Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, Lynchburg, Va. This work is also progressing
satisfactorily and, unless unforeseen delays occur, will be completed
in the late autumn of 1951. Both of these projects are being carried
out with private funds advanced for these purposes.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Forty-five Sunday evening concerts were given in the Garden
Courts during the fiscal year. The Eighth Annual American Music
Festival was held in April, featuring 22 works by American com-
posers. Most of the concerts were broadcast in their entirety by radio
station WCFM, Washington. The National Gallery Orchestra also
made four long-playing records for WCFM Recording Corporation,
recording works by Mozart, Handel, and Ives.

The Photographic Laboratory of the Gallery produced 12,593
prints, 818 black-and-white slides, and 1,723 color slides during
the fiscal year, in addition to 2,110 negatives, as well as X-rays, infra-
red and ultraviolet photographs.

A total of 2,298 press releases and 21,000 invitations for exhibitions

Report on the National Collection of Fine Arts

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the National Collection of Fine Arts for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1951:

THE SMITHSONIAN ART COMMISSION

The twenty-eighth annual meeting of the Smithsonian Art Com-
mission was held in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian Building
on Tuesday, December 5, 1950. The members present were: Paul
Manship, chairman; Alexander Wetmore, secretary (member, ex of-
ficio) ; John Nicholas Brown, George H. Edgell, David E. Finley,
Gilmore D. Clarke, Archibald G. Wenley, Lloyd Goodrich, John
Taylor Arms, Robert Woods Bliss, and George Hewitt Myers. John
EK. Graf, Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, Thomas M.
Beggs, Director, National Collection of Fine Arts, and Paul V.
Gardner, curator of ceramics, National Collection of Fine Arts, were
also present.

The resignations of William T. Aldrich and Gifford Beal as mem-
bers of the Commission were submitted and accepted with regret.
The Commission recommended to the Board of Regents Lawrence
Grant White to succeed Mr. Aldrich, and Andrew Wyeth to succeed
Mr. Beal. The Commission recommended the reelection of John
Taylor Arms and Gilmore D. Clarke for the usual 4-year period.
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Paul
Manship, chairman; Robert Woods Bliss, vice chairman, and Dr.
Alexander Wetmore, secretary. The following were elected mem-
bers of the executive committee for the ensuing year: David E. Finley,
chairman, Robert Woods Bliss, Gilmore D. Clarke, and George
Hewitt Myers. Paul Manship, as chairman of the Commission, and
Dr. Alexander Wetmore, as secretary of the Commission, are ex-
officio members of the executive committee.

Mr. Beggs reported that the reorganization of the permanent col-
lection progressed steadily during the year as further work of in-
dividual artists and various types of artistic work were assembled.
Seventeen paintings by Albert Pinkham Ryder, N. A. (1847-1917),
have been installed in a gallery to be known as the Ryder Room of
the Gellatly Collection. Meissen, Worcester, and Sévres porcelains

41
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

have been grouped by Mr. Gardner for systematic display in the Pell
Collection. Two additional storage rooms with movable screens and
air conditioning are being provided for the better maintenance of
the collections.

Mr. Gardner explained briefly the progress made in a project in-
volving spectrochemical analysis of ancient glass, the purpose being
to associate known types with the time and location of their manu-
facture and to trace ancient trade routes and material sources. An
initial group of specimens lent by two museums has been turned over
to the National Bureau of Standards for qualitative analysis, the
results of which are to be interpreted in collaboration with Ray Smith,
of the Archeological Institute of America.

The Secretary outlined briefly further legal action relative to the
Gellatly Collection under which the United States Supreme Court
had ruled that there were no grounds for reopening the case. He also
mentioned briefly tentative suggestions relative to the art collections
in connection with present threats of war.

RECENT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION OF THE FREER GALLERY OF ART
SECRETARY'S REPORT 53

At the end of the year work was begun on the construction of a
technical research laboratory in the west end of the building.

The firm of Keally and Patterson, architects, of New York, com-
pleted a survey of the building with a view to modernization of the
lighting throughout, air conditioning, and effecting structural changes
for enlarging the library and adding much-needed office space. Plans
were also drawn for a proposed addition to the building. All this
work was preliminary in nature.

ATTENDANCE

The Gallery was open to the public from 9 to 4: 30 every day except
Christmas Day. The total number of visitors to come in the main
entrance was 62,895. ‘The weekday total was 49,893, and the Sunday
total 18,002. The highest monthly attendance was in July, 8,407, and
the lowest was in December, 2,281.

There were 1,471 visitors to the office during the year.

HERZFELD ARCHIVE

Mrs. Charlotte Bradford, sister of the late Ernst Herzfeld, pre-
sented to the Herzfeld Archive additional squeezes, plans, maps, draw-
ings, ete., executed by Professor Herzfeld.

STAFF ACTIVITIES

The work of the staff members has been devoted to the study of new
accessions, of objects contemplated for purchase, and to general re-
search within the collections of Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Arabic,
and Indian materials. Reports, oral or written, were made upon 2,377
objects as follows: Belonging to private individuals, 1,552; belonging
to dealers, 705; at other museums, 120. In all, 289 photographs of ob-
jects were examined, and 242 Oriental language inscriptions were
translated for visitors. By request, 10 groups met in the exhibition
galleries for docent service by staff members; the total attendance
was 208. ‘Two members of the staff spent parts of the year engaged in
research projects outside the United States as follows:

During the summer months of 1950, Mr. Pope traveled to the Near
Kast to study the uniquely important Chinese porcelain collections in
Tehran and Istanbul. In Iran, additional material was examined in
Mashhad and Isfahan; and passing through Europe to and from the
Near East provided an opportunity to see important Chinese ceramics
in museums and private collections in Bristol, Cirencester, Oxford,
London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Leeuwarden, as well as scattered ex-
amples in Rotterdam, Rome, Faenza, Venice, and Ziirich.
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

In October Dr. Ettinghausen began a year’s study trip to the Near
East. After a month in Europe, he proceeded to Cairo where he
studied for two months. A brief stop was made in Baghdad en route
to Iran where he spent four months studying and visiting the impor-
tant sites and monuments. At the end of the year he was continuing
his work in Afghanistan.

APPENDIX 5
Report on the Bureau of American Ethnology

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
ean Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951, conducted
in accordance with the Act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which provides for continuing “independently or in
cooperation anthropological researches among the American Indians
and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection of the
United States and the excavation and preservation of archeologic

remains.”
SYSTEMATIO RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau, left Washington early
in January to continue the program of archeological work in Panama
inaugurated in 1948 in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society. En route, he made stops of several days each in México,
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica to study and photograph
archeological collections in those countries. In Panama the primary
objective was an archeological reconnaissance on the relatively un-
explored Atlantic coast of Panama lying between the Canal Zone and
the Chiriqui lagoon. It was here in 1502 that Columbus attempted
to establish the first European colony on the American mainland.
Three river systems in this region were explored— the Rio Salud,
Rio Indio, and Rio Coclé del Norte. The latter is the largest river
on the Panama north coast. Columbus found this region inhabited
by Indians who wore gold ornaments and who did not live in villages
but in single houses separated from one another by considerable dis-
tances. Dr. Stirling’s archeological work confirmed this observation.
The archeological remains consisted primarily of pottery and stone
objects removed from the refuse deposits where the houses had stood.
Near the coast the pottery was simple in style, unpainted, and with a
limited variety of forms. Near the headwaters of the rivers the
pottery became more elaborate as a result of influences from the high
culture centers that existed in pre-Columbian times on the Pacific
side of the divide. On concluding this survey, in the latter part of
March, the expedition established headquarters at La Pintada in the
Pacific drainage opposite the headwaters of the Coclé del Norte, where
additional excavations were undertaken with the intention of estab-

56
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

lishing the relation between the prehistoric cultures of the two re-
gions. Dr. Robert Rands accompanied Dr. Stirling in the field as
archeological assistant.

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau
and Director of the River Basin Surveys, devoted most of his time
during the year to the management and direction of the River Basin
Surveys. In October he went to Lincoln, Nebr., to inspect the Missouri
Basin headquarters. Accompanied by Paul L. Cooper, field director,
he then proceeded to the Fort Randall Reservoir area near Chamber-
lain, S. Dak., and visited a number of archeological sites that were
being tested by one of the field parties. From Chamberlain he went
to Pierre, S. Dak., and inspected the investigations being carried on
in the area of the Oahe Dam. Dr. Roberts also went to several other
sites that will be flooded by the Oahe Reservoir and discussed with
Mr. Cooper plans for excavation projects at those locations when field
work got under way in the spring months. After returning to the
headquarters at Lincoln, Dr. Roberts went to Colorado where early
in November he spent two days at the Lindenmeier site seeking char-
coal that could be used for carbon-14 dating. He also spent two days
testing a rock shelter near Livermore, which had been reported to
contain materials belonging to the Folsom complex. Dr. Roberts
found considerable evidence of occupancy of the shelter by recent In-
dians but saw nothing to indicate the older horizon. In April he
went to Clarksville, Va., where excavations were under way in sites
that will be flooded by the Buggs Island Reservoir. In May he went
to Evanston, Ill., to attend the annual meeting of the Society for
American Archaeology, of which he was President, and then pro-
ceeded to Lincoln, Nebr., where he assisted in the preparation of plans
for the summer field season in the Missouri Basin. From Lincoln
he went to Oklahoma and spent several days visiting sites in the
Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir and observing the excavations that were
being made by a River Basin Surveys’ party near Tahlequah.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Henry B. Collins, anthropolo-
gist, left for a second season of field work on Cornwallis Island in the
Canadian Arctic. As in the two preceding years the work was con-
ducted under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Museum of Canada. Dr. Collins and his assistant, Walter
K. Taylor, anthropology student at the University of Toronto, were
flown by the Royal Canadian Air Force from Montreal to the Reso-
lute Bay weather station on Cornwallis Island, stopping en route at
Churchill on Hudson Bay. The excavations yielded a large collection
of the Thule culture material, most of it from in and around an
unusually large stone and whalebone house at the site designated as
M 1, a mile from the weather station. Just to the rear of this house
was a small and inconspicuous house ruin, indicated only by a shal-
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

low depression in the ground, which turned out to be the oldest Thule
structure thus far found in the central or eastern Arctic. The artifacts
from this house were identical with those from the earliest Thule sites
in Alaska. The house had evidently been occupied very briefly, for
perhaps only one or two years, by some of the first Thule migrants
from Alaska, who in all likelihood had then continued on their way
to northwest Greenland. A similar shallow depression nearby yielded
Dorset objects, the first indication that this early but little-known
Eskimo culture had reached Cornwallis Island. Three culture stages
are thus represented at Resolute—Dorset, early Thule, and developed
Thule. The first two were probably represented by only a few families
who lived there for very short periods. The last stage was of much
longer duration, probably a century or more, during which time the
population was probably to be numbered in the hundreds. In June
1951 Mr. Taylor returned to Resolute to complete some of the excava-
tions that had to be left unfinished the preceding August.

Dr. Collins was reelected to the board of governors of the Arctic
Institute for a 3-year term, and also for a 1-year term as treasurer of
the organization. He continued to serve as chairman of the directing
committee that planned and supervised the bibliography and roster
projects on which the Arctic Institute has been engaged for the past
four years under contract with the Office of Naval Research. The
Roster of Arctic Specialists, containing biographical data on Amer-
ican and Canadian citizens having expert knowledge of the Arctic
regions, was completed and turned over to the agencies that had spon-
sored and financed the work—U. S. Departments of the Army, Navy,
Air Force, and Defense Research Board of Canada. The first five vol-
umes of the Arctic Bibliography were also completed and delivered to
the Government Printing Office through the Department of the Army,
which had contributed additional funds for its publication. Prepared
under the direction of Miss Marie Tremaine with a staff including
expert bibliographers, translators, and scientists working at the Li-
brary of Congress and other libraries in the United States and Canada,
the Arctic Bibliography is one of the most comprehensive regional
bibliographies ever assembled and should be a useful research tool
for scientists and others interested in the North.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, Dr. John P. Harrington was
on the Crow Indian Reservation in southern Montana conducting lin-
guistic studies. Dr. Harrington found in connection with his studies
that the word Missouri, formerly thought to mean “large canoe” or
“wooden canoe,” means simply “canoe” and, as applied since aboriginal
times to the Missouri River, means by implication the navigated river.
Dr. Harrington also obtained detailed information concerning the
Mandan coracle or bull boat from Crowsheart, an Indian 94 years
of age. An article was completed on this subject. On December 19,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 59

Dr. Harrington returned to Washington, D. C., and spent the time
until March 9 writing reports on his field work. On this date he left
for México in order to resume his studies on the Maya language. At
the end of the fiscal year he was in Mexico City continuing this work.

Commencing July 1, Dr. William N. Fenton, having completed an
assignment for the Indian Service at Taos Pueblo, conducted a survey
of manuscripts relating to the ethnohistory of eastern Indians in the
Henry E. Huntington Library at San Marino, Calif. The latter re-
search, carried out with the aid of grants from the research funds
of the American Philosophical Society, was published in the Proceed-
ings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 95, No. 8.

Factions are a peculiar feature of American Indian political organi-
zation that has yet to be worked out for the country as a whole. Some
ideas about political structure and methods of field work, which Dr.
Fenton developed over a long period of field and library study among
the Six Nations, were this past year transferred to the study of Indian
self-government, which is riddled with factional disputes, in three
divergent tribal cultures—T aos, Klamath, and Blackfeet. Each field
situation was unique and required adjusting techniques, but the main
principles hold. Field work was completed at Klamath Indian Agency
in August, and the situation at Blackfeet Agency in Montana was
explored during September. On returning to Washington late in
September, at the request of the Indian Bureau Dr. Fenton drafted
a comprehensive plan for the study of the Blackfeet problem by a
team of social-science specialists who would be drawn from several
disciplines including anthropology.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS
(Report prepared by Frank H. H. Roserrs, Jr.)

Instituted in the fall of 1945 as a unit of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, the River Basin Surveys were organized to carry into
effect a memorandum of understanding between the National Park
Service and the Smithsonian Institution. The memorandum per-
tains to the salvage of archeological and paleontological remains that
would otherwise be lost as a result of numerous projects for flood
control and irrigation, hydroelectric installations, and navigation
improvements in the river basins of the United States. The field
work was started in July 1946 and has continued since that date.
During the entire period of operations the investigations have been
conducted as an interagency program with full cooperation on the
part of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Park Service, and
the Bureau of Reclamation of the Interior Department, and the Corps
of Engineers of the Department of the Army. In addition, numerous
non-Federal institutions scattered throughout the various States have
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

aided in the work. The program in the last fiscal year was financed
by a transfer of $174,375 to the Smithsonian Institution by the Na-
tional Park Service. Those funds were derived in part from the
National Park Service and in part from the Bureau of Reclamation.
The money from the Bureau of Reclamation was for use in the Mis-
souri Basin, while that from the National Park Service was for use in
all other areas throughout the United States. Because the appro-
priations for the previous year became available so late in the field
season, a substantial carry-over ($185,574) increased the 1951 funds
so that a much larger series of investigations was possible than would
otherwise have been the case.

Activities during the year consisted of reconnaissance or surveys for
the purpose of locating archeological sites or paleontological deposits
that will be flooded or otherwise destroyed by construction work and
in the excavation of sites located by previous surveys. In all, 45
reservoir basins located in 13 States and scattered over 8 river basins
were visited by survey parties. In addition one lock project and four
canal areas were examined. Excavations were completed or were
under way at the end of the fiscal year in 20 reservoir areas in 10
States. During the course of the year there were 26 excavating
parties in the field. Eight of the excavation projects were in areas
where digging was done in previous years, but the remainder were
new undertakings. When the fiscal year closed, the total of the res-
ervoir areas where surveys had been made or excavations carried on
since the beginning of actual field work in July 1946 was 225 located
in 25 States. During the course of the work 2,894 archeological sites
have been located and recorded, and of that number 545 have been
recommended for excavation or additional testing. Preliminary
appraisal reports were completed for all the reservoirs surveyed, and
14 reports were mimeographed for limited distribution to the co-
operating agencies. This makes a total of 134 such reports issued
since the start of the program. In some cases a series of reservoirs is
included in a single report covering a subbasin, and for that reason
the total number of reports is less than that of the reservoirs. The
excavations made during the fiscal year brought the total for areas
where such work has been done to 33. The results of some of that
work have been published as technical reports in various scientific
journals, and one Bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology con-
taining eight such papers is now in press. That Bulletin inaugurates
a new series, to be called “River Basin Surveys Papers” and designed
as an outlet for the reports resulting from the interagency archeologi-
cal salvage program. Paleontological surveys have been made in
115 reservoir areas, 70 being those where archeological work has also
been done. The remaining 45 in due course will be investigated by
SECRETARY'S REPORT 61

archeological parties. The over-all total of reservoirs visited, includ-
ing those where archeological work still needs to be done, is 270.

The reservoirs investigated for archeological remains as of June 30,
1951, have the following distribution by States: California, 20; Colo-
rado, 24; Georgia, 4; Idaho, 11; Illinois, 2; Iowa, 3; Kansas, 7; Ken-
tucky, 1; Louisiana, 1; Minnesota, 1; Montana, 14; Nebraska, 27; New
Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 18; Ohio, 2; Oklahoma, 7; Oregon, 26; Penn-
sylvania, 2; South Dakota, 9; Tennessee, 1; Texas, 15; Virginia, 2;
Washington, 11; West Virginia, 2; Wyoming, 19. Excavations since
the start of the program have been made in: California, 5; Colorado,
1; Georgia, 1; Kansas, 1; Montana, 1; Nebraska, 1; New Mexico, 1;
North Dakota, 4; Oklahoma, 2; Oregon, 3; South Dakota, 5; Texas, 7;
Virginia, 1; Washington, 8; Wyoming, 38.

The River Basin Surveys received extensive cooperation during the
year from the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the
Corps of Engineers, and numerous State and local institutions.
Guides and transportation were furnished staff men in the field at a
number of projects, while at others office and laboratory space was
provided. In several cases labor and mechanical equipment were con-
tributed by the construction agency. Had it not been for the assist-
ance provided in that way, it would not have been possible for the
River Basin Surveys’ men to accomplish as much as they did. As in
past years, the National Park Service served as the liaison between
the various agencies and provided the Smithsonian Institution with
the necessary information concerning the locations of the proposed
dams and reservoirs and also their priorities. In addition, the Na-
tional Park Service carried the responsibility for budgeting the costs
of the program and for procuring the funds.

General supervision and direction of the work in California, Geor-
cia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia were from the
main office in Washington. The program in the Columbia Basin was
directed from a field headquarters and laboratory at Eugene, Oreg.;
that in the Missouri Basin was under the supervision of a field office
and laboratory at Lincoln, Nebr.; and that in Texas was under the
field office at Austin. All the materials collected by the survey and
excavation parties in those three areas were processed at the field lab-
oratories. In addition, the collections made in Georgia were processed
at a laboratory at Athens.

Washington office—The main headquarters of the River Basin Sur-
veys continued under the direction of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.
Joseph R. Caldwell, Carl F. Miller, and Ralph §. Solecki, archeolo-
gists, were based on that office, although Caldwell spent the entire
year in Georgia, and Solecki took leave of absence to join an expedition
going to the Near East. Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, di-
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

vided his time between the Washington office, the Missouri Basin, and
the Texas area.

Mr. Caldwell spent the early months of the fiscal year working on
his report on the results of the excavations completed during the pre-
vious year at the Allatoona Reservoir. In November he proceeded to
the Buford Reservoir area on the Chattahoochee River northeast of
Atlanta where he carried on a survey until April 6. In the latter part
of April Mr. Caldwell made an investigation at the site of Fort Char-
lotte in McCormick County, S. C., to determine what work might be
necessary to obtain full information about it before it is flooded by the
waters of the Clark Hill Reservoir. From Fort Charlotte Mr. Cald-
well returned to his field base at Athens where he prepared a manu-
script “The Booger Bottom Mound: A Forsyth Period Site in Hall
County, Georgia.”

At the beginning of the year, Carl F. Miller was carrying on ex-
cavations at a site on the east bank of the Roanoke River near Clarks-
ville, Va. He continued operations there until August 4, when he
returned to Washington. During the months spent in the office, Mr.
Miller worked on his section of the report on the excavations at the
Allatoona Reservoir in Georgia. On February 28 he returned to
Clarksville and resumed investigations in the Buggs Island Reservoir
area. Those operations continued until June 20, when he proceeded
to Bassett, Va., and made a survey at the Philpott Reservoir on the
Smith River. He returned to Washington on June 30. During such
times as the Director was absent from the Washington office, Mr.
Miller served as Acting Director of the River Basin Surveys.

Ralph S. Solecki devoted the early months of the year to the com-
pletion of reports on work done previously. In October he made a
brief investigation of the area at Morgantown, W. Va., where a new
navigation lock was under construction. From there he proceeded to
the Conemaugh Reservoir on the Conemaugh River in western Penn-
sylvania, where he made a reconnaissance of the area that will be
flooded. From the Conemaugh project he proceeded to the East
Branch Reservoir basin on the Clarion River, also in Pennsylvania.
After completing the survey of that area, he returned to Washington
and completed his report on the field investigations.

Dr. Theodore E. White spent the winter and early spring months
in Washington studying the materials he had collected during the
summer field season and in the preparation of a manuscript “Prelim-
inary Analysis of the Fossil Vertebrates of the Canyon Ferry Reser-
voir Area.” In April he went to Texas where he collected fossils from
the Lavon Reservoir on the East Fork of the Trinity River in Tarrant
County and from the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir on the Elm Fork of
the same river in Denton County. In June Dr. White proceeded from
SECRETARY’S REPORT 63

Texas to Lincoln, Nebr., and resumed his activities in the Missouri
Basin.

California.—At the beginning of the fiscal year a party under the
direction of Franklin Fenenga was excavating a site in the Terminus
Reservoir area on the Kaweah River, in Tulare County. That work
was continued until August 1, and upon its completion detailed in-
formation had been obtained about a small village consisting of 14
houses and 38 distinct milling places. The site was important be-
cause it provided an opportunity to study the remains left by a group
of people who occupied the region in historic times and concerning
whom there is an extraordinarily complete ethnographic record. The
lower end of the Kaweah Canyon was formerly occupied by a small
band of the Yokut Indians known as the Wukchumne or Wickchamni.
Correlations of the data from both the ethnological and archeological
sources of information will make it possible to prepare an archeolog-
ical report containing an almost unique amount of information on
the function and significance of the artifacts and the various features
of the site. Many items of the material culture previously known only
through tradition are now represented by actual objects recovered
during the archeological researches.

Upon the completion of the digging at the Terminus Reservoir,
Mr. Fenenga moved his party to the Folsom Reservoir located on the
American River, in Eldorado County, where excavations were carried
on from August 3 to September 16. About 75 percent of the site was
investigated. The returns were small in that only a single burial
and 214 artifacts were found. The burial was that of a child about
12 years old and had no accompanying offerings. The artifacts con-
sist for the most part of stone and, as most of them are unspecialized
forms making functional identifications or comparisons with objects
from other sites difficult, they are not particularly significant. A
small series of arrow points, about half of which were made from
a native opal, will be useful in the matter of correlation with other
sites, but at present there is so little material available for study from
that particular region that conclusions are not warranted. Until
more data are obtained, it will not be possible to give a reasonably
complete picture of the material culture of the people who occupied
the site.

Two field parties excavated at the Cachuma Reservoir on the Santa
Ynez River, in Santa Barbara County. One of them, under Albert D.
Mohr, worked from August 1 to September 12, while the other, under
Martin Baumhoff, worked from April 8 until May 18. The first party
excavated in a site that contained evidence of three cultures previously
described by David Banks Rogers. They are the Oak Grove, Hunting,
and “Chumash.” The evidence obtained there substantiated the re-
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

ported sequence for the Santa Barbara area. It also indicated that
two phases each of the last two periods might be defined as the result
of further work. The same party also did some testing in another
site which apparently represents a single late period that extended
into early historic times.

The party under Mr. Baumhoff concentrated its efforts at the second
site where Mr. Mohr worked and obtained considerable additional
information from it. Preliminary study of the artifacts indicates
that the occupation is attributable to the Canaliio. There is evidence
of trading activities in the form of tubular beads from the San Joaquin
Valley and potsherds similar to the pottery made by the Yokuts of
that region and the western Paiutes. No house remains were found,
but there were scattered piles of stones that appear to have been inten-
tiona) rather than accidental, and in one case there was a pear-shaped
pit 12 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 3 inches wide, and 1 foot 3 inches in
depth, which had been lined with slabs of shale and was filled with
rocks of all sizes. The function of the pit has not been determined.
It was at first thought that the feature may have been a sweat house,
but the nature of the shale lining was such that it probably would
not have withstood the heating necessary for sweat-house purposes.
Additional work is needed at the Cachuma Reservoir in order to gain
a better understanding of the aboriginal history of the area.

Columbia Basin.—W ork in the Columbia Basin was continued under
the supervision of the field headquarters at Eugene, Oreg., where
laboratory and office space were provided by the University of Oregon.
Joel L. Shiner served as acting field director throughout the year.
Activities in that area consisted of a survey of six reservoir projects
and excavations in four areas where preliminary reconnaissance work
had already been completed. The John Day Reservoir basin on the
John Day River, in Oregon,’ was examined by Robert Farrell and
Stuart Peck during the first two weeks in July. The party found 88
sites and recommended testing or more extended excavations for 8 of
them. From the John Day Reservoir, Peck and Farrell proceeded
to the Hells Canyon Reservoir on the Snake River, in Oregon-Idaho,
where they found 22 sites, of which 4 were recommended for investiga-
tion. The latter survey was completed the middle of August. During
July George L. Coale and Octavio Romano surveyed the area to be
flooded by the Albeni Falls Reservoir on the Pend Oreille River, in
northern Idaho. They found 13 sites and recommended the testing of
5. Construction work on the dam has progressed to such an extent
that the indicated work may not be possible at that location. From
the Albeni Falls area, Coale and Romano proceeded to the Katka
and Libby Reservoir projects on the Kootenai River, in Idaho and
Montana, where they made a preliminary reconnaissance. The Katka
Dam is located in Idaho, but the reservoir will extend upstream into
SECRETARY'S REPORT 65

Montana. The survey of the Katka area located and recorded 14
sites, of which one was recommended for excavation. Three others,
however, were found to be worthy of testing. The Libby area contains
11 archeological sites, and because so little is known of the archeology
of the Kootenai Indians, 6 of the 11 were recommended for further
study. Extensive excavation would not be required at any of them,
however. John M. Campbell spent July and August making a survey
of the Priest Rapids Reservoir basin. The Priest Rapids Dam is to
be built in the Columbia River just below the rapids and will create
a pool area 56 miles long. The district to be flooded is an important
one from the standpoint of the aboriginal occupation of the area,
and 74 sites were found there. Of that number, 29 are considered
to be of high archeological significance. The sites consist of those
with well-preserved house pits, the remains of open camps, cave shel-
ters, burial grounds, and various groups of pictographs. The region
is one that was occupied by several different Indian groups, and know]l-
edge from it should have an important bearing on a large section of
the Plateau Culture area.

At the start of the fiscal year a party under the direction of Douglas
Osborne, consulting archeologist, was continuing excavations at a site
on the Washington side of the Columbia River near Mottinger in the
McNary Reservoir basin. The site was that of a postcontact village
and probably was the location of that visited by Robert Stuart in 1812.
During the course of the digging three house pits and one mat lodge
were uncovered, and three additional house pits were tested. The
house pits were circular, and if the identification of the village is
correct it would indicate that the circular earth lodge was in use in
that area at a later date than most anthropologists have believed. The
artifacts obtained were not numerous, which is a condition found at
most of the places worked in the McNary basin. In addition to abo-
riginal stone and bone implements and shell ornaments, a variety of
European goods was obtained. Several of the house pits gave evi-
dence of several separate occupations, which may indicate that the
village was not lived in continuously but was revisited from time to
time, perhaps by the same group of people. The remains of the long
narrow mat house, which was a popular form of multifamily dwelling
during the historical period in that area, agree closely with the de-
scriptions of such houses given by the Umatilla Indians to ethnological
investigators in previous years. One complete burial was recovered
at that location. Late in July Mr. Osborne transferred his party to
a site near Cold Springs on the Oregon side of the river where he dug
four house pits in the remains of a small village. During periods of
high water the site appears to be located on an island, as a portion
of the river flows through an old channel and separates it from high
ground to the south. The village was situated on the side nearest
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

the main channel and consisted of two distinct groups of houses. The
largest group was centered about 500 feet downstream from the
smaller one. An almost identical condition had previously been noted
at another site where work was done during the summer of 1949, but
thus far no explanation for such a division has been found. The pits
at. this particular location were also circular in form and indicated
a single occupation. The lack of well-developed midden or refuse
areas implies that the village must have been short-lived or that par-
ticular care was taken to throw refuse into or near the river. Trade
goods were scarce at this site, which would seem to indicate that it
should be dated as slightly earlier than the time of the first contact
with the Whites or just prior to 1800. The Lewis and Clark map shows
the “island” but does not indicate the presence of a village or at least
the existence of houses. It would appear that the village had been
abandoned and had fallen into ruin before 1805. The most important
contribution from the excavations at these sites is the verification of
data secured at other locations in the McNary, particularly with re-
spect to the size and shape of the former houses and their artifact asso-
ciations; also, it was indicated that, while fishing was the primary
source of subsistence, hunting actually played a larger part in the econ-
omy than previously supposed. Mr. Osborne also completed the exca-
vation of a house pit at a site 1 mile downstream where work was done
the previous summer, and in addition located and removed 17 burials
from Sheep Island in the middle of the river about equidistant from
the other three sites. Some work had been done previously at that lo-
cation by Thomas R. Garth, who was then with the National Park
Service. Osborne, who was under a temporary appointment as con-
sulting archeologist, completed his investigations the end of August
and returned to his regular duties at the Washington State Museum.

Richard D. Daugherty and his party continued the excavations
started near the end of the previous fiscal year at the O’Sullivan Reser-
voir near Ephrata, Wash., and completed the investigations on Sep-
tember 2. They spent the summer season at a small village site close to
a larger one where Daugherty did some work in the summer of 1948.
During the current year two large circular house pits were dug, and
the remains of a rectangular mat dwelling were uncovered. A series
of cairns that had formerly contained burials was also studied. The
graves had been systematically rifled by local collectors, however, and
little could be learned other than that the piles of stone had covered
the remains of cremations. Information pertaining to the house
types agreed with that from the previous digging, and from that data
it will be possible to draw a number of conclusions about the dwellings
of the area. Not a single item was found suggesting White contact,
but the similarity of the artifacts to those from other sites in the
region where there was association with contact material suggests that
SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

the occupancy was not long prior to the time the first white men reached
the area. In general the artifacts consist of projectile points, various
types of scrapers, knives, drills, hammerstones, sinkers, pendants,
grinding stones and pestles, stone pipes, bone awls and points, bone
flaking tools, gaming pieces, and beads. While carrying on his excava-
tions, Daugherty also tested a site in the Lind Coulee where materials
attributable to the Paleo-Indian occur. The site is outside the reser-
voir basin but is along the course of lateral and distribution-system
canals, and as Lind Coulee is to be used as a wasteway for them the
archeological remains will ultimately be destroyed.

A party under the direction of Samuel J. Tobin was excavating in
a large rock shelter in the Equalizing Reservoir basin southwest of the
town of Grand Coulee, Wash., at the start of the fiscal year. The
work was carried on through July. Evidence obtained there was that
the shelter was not a regular dwelling place but rather a spot where
small parties probably camped from time to time. Three distinct
levels of occupation were found, but apparently no great length of
time intervened between each level, and the materials suggest that
the same cultural group was involved throughout. The chief signifi-
cance of the shelter is that a considerable amount of dry material such
as is rarely found in open sites was obtained. Included in it are
cordage, fragments of bow staves, arrow or spear shafts, textile frag-
ments, matting, and pieces of basketry. Nonperishable artifacts are
projectile points, bone implements and beads, and shell beads. The
rear wall of the shelter was decorated with pictographs, some made
with white paint and others in red. Analysis of the dry materials
should throw considerable light on that phase of the material culture
of the people in the area. Present indications are that the shelter
may well have been occupied by either the Nespelem or their eastern
neighbors the Sanpoil. Although contact objects were lacking below
the surface, it is difficult to assign either a historic or a pre-Columbian
age to the site.

The beginning of the fiscal year found a party under George A.
Cheney digging in village remains along the Columbia River in the
basin to be flooded by the Chief Joseph Reservoir. The work con-
tinued through July and August and into early September. In
August Tobin’s party was shifted to that project to assist in the in-
vestigations. The work in September was a cooperative effort, the
Washington State Museum providing the necessary labor. At the
end of the season 42 house pits located in 7 sites had been dug and
accompanying trash mounds examined. Good information was ob-
tained concerning the house type, and indications are that there was
no particular village pattern. The structures do not seem to have
been grouped, but at all the sites were strung along a terrace above
the river in sheltered areas well back from the water. The artifacts
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

recovered consisted in the main of stone projectile points, blades,
scrapers, hammers, pestles, pipes, choppers, and bow] fragments. The
evidence in general appears to show that a single cultural level was
represented at all the sites investigated. The area is one, however,
where the river has done considerable scouring and shifting, and it
is possible that older materials may have been destroyed. Though
many of the data from the Chief Joseph Reservoir supplement those
reported by earlier workers for the Upper Columbia-Grand Coulee
Reservoir, there are some marked differences in certain artifact cate-
gories. Considerable light will be thrown on the archeology of that
portion of the Columbia Basin when studies on the materials from
the Chief Joseph Reservoir are completed.

On April 2 Joel L. Shiner started excavations at a site in the McNary
Reservoir where a cultural layer had been discovered underneath a
thick stratum of wind-deposited volcanic ash. The site, which was
reported to the River Basin Surveys in January by Thomas R. Garth,
represented a single occupation by a group of Indians having a simple
culture and, except for the projectile points, very crude tools. Some
100 artifacts, including hammerstones and choppers in addition to the
points, were found there. Large numbers of animal bones, many of
them burned, and mussel shells were present in the midden. There
were no indications, however, of any type of habitation. The culture
probably represents a fairly early horizon in the Columbia Basin, but
its proper place in the sequence for the area cannot be determined
definitely until the volcanic ash is correlated with one of the known
eruptions in the region or the burned bones have been dated by the
carbon-14 method. Typologically the artifacts appear to be of re-
spectable age.

At the end of April Mr. Shiner moved his party to the site of a
former fishing village at the mouth of the Walla Walla River and
carried on excavations there until the middle of May. Most of the
digging was done in a midden deposit adjacent to the house remains,
and a good series of artifacts was obtained. That is one of the few
locations where enough material was found to make possible a satis-
factory statistical study of the types of artifacts. The village appar-
ently was occupied just prior to and during the first coming of the
white man. A large number of burials had been present at one time,
but the locality had been so thoroughly dug by local collectors that
only scattered bones were found by Shiner’s party.

During the year seven preliminary reports were completed and
mimeographed at the Eugene office. Specimens from the various
surveys were processed and cataloged and the photographs taken by
the various parties were cataloged and filed. Because of the situation
with respect to funds for the following fiscal year, it was necessary to
close the Eugene office on June 30, 1951.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 69

Georgia.—Field work in Georgia was carried on from a base of
operations furnished by the University of Georgia at Athens. The
main investigations during the year were of a survey nature. From
November 14 to April 6 a reconnaissance was made of the area that
will be inundated by the proposed Buford Reservoir on the Chatta-
hoochee River. From April 23 to 28 a brief reconnaissance was made
in the Clark Hill Reservoir, on the Savannah River, for the purpose
of locating the remains of Fort Charlotte.

The Buford Reservoir basin occupies a large intermediate section
of north-Georgia terrain lying between the Allatoona Reservoir area
on the Etowah River and the north-Oconee drainage. The region is
one that is virtually unknown archeologically, and it should contain
significant data as far as a proper understanding of cultural develop-
ments in that part of Georgia is concerned. The preliminary survey
located 46 sites in the area to be flooded. Included in the group are
29 that appear to represent a rather early prepottery period. There
is some evidence that this group of sites may be somewhat older than
the Stallings Island Prepottery Culture. A larger proportion of
sites belong to the Woodstock period than was found to be the case
during the investigations at the Allatoona Reservoir. The larger
number of early sites indicates either that there was a sizable popula-
tion in the district or that it was occupied over a long span of time.
Extensive investigation of a number of the sites should give an answer
in that respect. Two large previously unrecorded mounds were also
noted, and some test digging was done in them. One gave evidence
of having been erected over a small natural knoll, and the outlines of
a small square house with a bench, bed, or throne at one end were
found on its summit. The mound appears to represent a rather late
and previously unknown complex which probably is pre-Lamar in
age. The other mound apparently is one of the oldest artificial struc-
tures thus far found in Georgia. It differs from previously recognized
types of eastern mounds in that it was not accretional and probably
was not intended for burial purposes. Neither does it seem to have
been a temple platform or domiciliary mound. Evidence obtained
during the course of testing it and adjacent areas suggests that it
probably belongs in the Forsyth Period, which falls into the general
category known as the Burial Mound I Period. In many ways the
mound suggests similarities to the well-known Swift Creek Mound.
One postulation as to its function is that it may have been erected for
ceremonial purposes even though there are no traces of a structure on
its summit. A simple earthen platform without a structure would be
the logical beginning in the development of the eastern temple-mound
complex.

In addition to the pre-Columbian sites, the survey found a number
attributable to the historic Cherokee. The latter are located for the
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

most part along the course of the old Federal Road, which passed
through the Cherokee country to the Tennessee settlements. A brief
study was made of the Vann House which was built between 1805
and 1813 to serve as an inn for people traveling along the Federal
Road and stands on a high knoll overlooking the Chattahoochee River
about 114 miles from the present town of Oscarville. It is one of
the few Indian country taverns still standing. In its present form
the structure shows several periods of enlargement, but the old original
portion is readily discernible, and careful study of it should produce
interesting data on the nature of the taverns of the period when built.

The search for the remains of Fort Charlotte, in the Clark Hill
Reservoir area, showed that it was located on the South Carolina
side of the Savannah River, but inasmuch as it will be inundated by
the Clark Hill Reservoir, the dam for which is being built in Georgia,
investigation of the site is considered to be a part of the Georgia
project. Fort Charlotte, built in 1765 as one of the Colonial defenses
against the Cherokee Indians, was seized on July 12, 1775, by South
Carolina troops—one of the first overt acts of defiance by the rebellious
Colonies against the British Government. It continued to be occupied
by Colonial troops until the close of the Revolutionary War. Because
of the lack of accurate information about the actual physical character
of the fort and the fact that certain phases of its history correlate
with Indian activities in that area, it is hoped that all remaining
evidence pertaining to it can be retrieved from the site before it is
inundated.

Kentucky—During the period April 16 to May 18 Douglas W.
Schwartz, field assistant, made a reconnaissance and carried on limited
test excavations in the basin to be flooded by the proposed Celina
Reservoir on the Cumberland River, in southern Kentucky. He lo-
cated 24 archeological sites, representing a number of cultural periods;
further work in the area probably would make it possible to establish
a sequence for them. Excavations in six major sites have been recom-
mended, but inasmuch as all of them are above the pool line there is
no immediate urgency for their investigation. Their location is such,
however, that after the reservoir is filled they may be subject to some.
wave action and will be easily available to unauthorized diggers.
Consequently, plans should be made for additional work in that
district.

The survey in the Celina area was done in cooperation with the
University of Kentucky, which furnished Mr. Schwartz with the
necessary transportation and provided him with office and laboratory
space for working over his material. Dr. William S. Webb, head
of the university’s department of anthropology, assisted Mr. Schwartz
in an advisory capacity.
SECRETARY'S REPORT Tt

Missouri Basin.—Activities in the Missouri Basin continued to be
supervised and directed from the field headquarters at the University
of Nebraska in Lincoln. Paul L. Cooper served as acting field di-
rector from July 1 until October 3, when he was made field director
for the Missouri Basin program. The operations in the Missouri
Basin shifted in character during the course of the year. Where
previously most of the activities had been concerned with preliminary
surveys, a larger number of excavating parties were sent into the field
and greater emphasis was placed on the actual salvage of materials
from sites that eventually will be inundated.

From July 3 to November 21 a two-man archeological survey party
headed by Robert L. Shalkop made preliminary reconnaissance of the
Apex, Brenner, Clark Canyon, Gibson, Kelley, Landon, Nilan, and
Wilson Reservoirs in Montana; the Middle Fork and South Fork proj-
ects in Wyoming; and the Narrows in Colorado. The party also re-
visited the Keyhole Reservoir area in Wyoming and the Moorhead
and Yellowtail projects whose basins occur in both Montana and Wyo-
ming. ‘The Shalkop party located and recorded 127 new sites. From
August 12 to November 3 a two-man party led by George Metcalf in-
vestigated the area of the Fort Berthold Reservation in the Fort Gar-
rison area in North Dakota, locating and recording 55 new sites. Dur-
ing October a two-man reconnaissance party under Richard Page
Wheeler visited 10 potential reservoirs in the Niobrara subbasin in
Nebraska. The party found a total of 41 archeological sites. Robert
B. Cumming, Jr., and an assistant carried out a reconnaissance of the
Ashton Reservoir area in the Lower Platte basin in Nebraska from
November 7 to 15 and at the same time examined the sites of the Sar-
gent, Woods Park, and Ashton Feeder canals. Since only one archeo-
logical site was found by Cumming’s party, the area does not ap-
pear to have had much aboriginal occupation. This party also inves-
tigated an ossuary that had been uncovered at the Cushing dam site.
During the period June 5 to 9, Franklin Fenenga and an assistant sur-
veyed the Lovewell Reservoir area on White Rock Creek in northern
Kansas and recorded six archeological sites. On June 19 Fenenga
and an assistant proceeded to Wyoming and by the end of the fiscal
year had made surveys at the Bull Creek, Smith, Buffalo Bill, Tri-
angle Park, Willow Park, and Red Gulch Reservoirs. Five sites were
found in the Bull Creek Reservoir and one large workshop area, which
may be relatively old, was discovered in the Red Gulch Reservoir.
None of the other projects visited contained archeological
manifestations.

At the beginning of the fiscal year a party under the direction of
Richard Page Wheeler was excavating at the Long site in the Angos-
tura Reservoir basin on the Cheyenne River in South Dakota. That

981445—52——6
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

work, which had been started in the previous year, continued until
July 19, when the Wheeler party moved to the Boysen Reservoir area
in Wyoming. The Long site is of particular interest because it repre-
sents one of the early hunting-culture occupations in the Plains area.
The material from it is limited in quantity, but the blades, scrapers,
and projectile points probably can be correlated with some of the types
from other hunting cultures and will aid materially in filling in the
gaps in present knowledge about the prehistory of the western Plains.
Charcoal obtained from unprepared hearths has been dated by Dr.
W. F. Libby by the carbon-14 method and shows that the occupation
at the Long site was in the interval from 7,073 +300 to 7,715 +740 years
before the present.

The Wheeler party began work in the Boysen Reservoir area on the
Big Horn River near Shoshoni, Wyo., on July 20 and continued oper-
ations until September 20. During that period a number of sites were
tested, and fairly extensive excavations were carried out at three loca-
tions. Most of the sites were in the open and proved to be the remains
of camps rather than of villages. One small rock shelter was found to
contain considerable refuse material as well as various types of arti-
facts and broken animal bones. One crevice burial, discovered on a
butte top overlooking the reservoir area, presumably belonged to the
historic period as a number of porcelain beads and a short coil of iron
were sifted from the sand that lay directly below the crevice. ‘Two of
the sites examined probably are late prehistoric, while the others are
older, perhaps considerably older. In addition to the excavating
work, the Wheeler party photographed and sketched many petro-
glyphs and made extensive surface collections from numerous occupa-
tional sites, several of which were newly discovered while the digging
was going on.

On June 21 Wheeler and his field assistant, J. M. Shippee, returned
to Wyoming and started excavations at the only known pottery site
in the Keyhole Reservoir area on the Belle Fourche River near Moor-
croft. By the end of the fiscal year they had dug three shallow test
areas across the site and recovered a series of artifacts consisting of
stone and bone implements and a variety of potsherds. The apparent
absence of dwellings of any kind, the shallowness of the middenlike
deposits, and the character of the material found there suggest that
the site, which covers approximately 30 acres, was a late prehistoric
or protohistoric hunting camp. The work there had not yet progressed
sufficiently to make possible the correlation of the remains with one of
the historic tribes known to have inhabited that part of Wyoming.

The largest excavation operations in the Missouri Basin during
the year were those in the Oahe Reservoir area on the main stem of
the Missouri River near Pierre, S. Dak. A party under the super-
vision of Donald J. Lehmer was digging in the remains of a large
SECRETARY'S REPORT 73

fortified village near the Oahe dam site on July 1 and continued at
that location until October, when it was shifted to another fortified
village a short distance farther downstream. At the first location,
called the Dodd site, the remains of 21 earth lodges, 27 cache pits,
and 16 miscellaneous features were uncovered. In addition, 8 test
trenches and 27 test pits were dug. The Dodd site is of particular in-
terest because of the fact that three types of houses were found there,
and there was definite stratigraphic evidence for a sequence of the
various forms. The latest structures at the location had been circular
earth lodges, while the earlier ones were rectangular. There appar-
ently were two types of rectangular earth lodge, the oldest being
smaller and with a somewhat different pole arrangement than the later
ones. Although it has not been established beyond question, it appears
that the circular houses were those built by the Arikara, while the
rectangular ones are attributable to the Mandan. Several thousand
specimens, consisting of potsherds, stone, bone, shell, and metal arti-
facts, were found during the digging, and the analysis of that mate-
rial should be a definite contribution to the archeology of the area.
At the second location, known as the Phillips Ranch site, 5 earth lodges
and 46 cache pits had been cleared and one test trench dug across the
fortification ditch when weather conditions brought the activities to
a close on November 26. The structures at the Phillips Ranch site
were circular and appear to correlate with those of the final period
at the Dodd site. Mr. Lehmer returned to the Phillips Ranch site on
June 20 and resumed his excavation program. It was still under way
at the close of the fiscal year. During the short period involved one
house was completely cleared and another started. The presence of
a palisade inside the fortification ditch surrounding the site was es-
tablished, and the overburden from the northeast quadrant of the
area was stripped away, revealing a number of features lying outside
the houses.

Additional work in the Oahe area got under way in June when a
party under the direction of Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, who was detailed to
the River Basin Surveys from the U. S. National Museum, began ex-
cavations at the Cheyenne River village site, about 45 miles north of
the Dodd site. The Cheyenne River village is one of the largest and
best preserved of the fortified sites along the Missouri River, although
a portion of it has been carried away by the encroaching stream. It
apparently was occupied for a considerable period and probably con-
tains several components. By the end of the fiscal year one earth lodge
had been uncovered, the work on a second was nearly completed, and
digging had started on a third. One cache pit had been cleaned and
another located. Two test trenches excavated across the moat had
shown that the original bottom was about 6 feet below the present
surface. The artifact yield from the investigations was proving
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

highly satisfactory, and the artifacts should give a well-rounded pic-
ture of the material culture of the former occupants of the village,
as well as indicating their relationship to other peoples in that portion
of the Plains.

Early in July a party led by Thomas R. Garth started investigating
historic sites in the area to be affected by the Fort Randall Reservoir
in South Dakota. They spent a short time examining the site of old
Fort Randall, across the river from Pickstown, but devoted most of
the field season to work in the vicinity of Chamberlain. Extensive
but unsuccessful efforts were made to locate the site of Fort Recovery,
an early fur-trading post. The remains of other trading posts and
military establishments were found, however, and partially investi-
gated. Included in that group are Fort Hale, Fort Brule, Fort Look-
out trading post, Fort Lookout military post, and the Whetstone
Agency. At Fort Hale there was evidence of a large building that
probably had been a trading post, two smaller buildings, and indica-
tions of a stockade. There was also evidence that there had been an
earlier Indian occupancy of the site. At Fort Lower Brule the re-
mains of a cabin 45 feet long were uncovered, and an 18-by-12-
foot cellar was excavated. An abandoned well was also investigated,
and about 30 “snow snakes,” some of which were decorated with
geometric and some with realistic designs, were recovered. “Snow
snakes” were frequently made from bison ribs and in some cases were
equipped with feathers stuck to two wooden pegs inserted in one end
of the bone. Objects of this type were generally used in playing a
rather simple game, which consisted of sliding them along the frozen
crust or in a rut in the snow. The players chose sides, and when a
“snake” outdistanced all on the other side it counted as a point. The —
remains of the fur-trading post, presumably adjacent to the military
post, were found, and an Indian earth lodge was located while the
area was being tested for the historic remains. The Garth party
also located 29 new Indian sites in the Chamberlain area.

Further work was started in the Fort Randall Reservoir area on
June 3 when a party under the supervision of Robert B. Cumming,
Jr., began excavations at Indian sites near the mouth of Platte Creek.
Work was started at the Oldham site, an earth-lodge village, and at
the close of the fiscal year the remains of one house had been un-
covered and a second was in the process of excavation. Efforts to
trace the fortification ditch that had surrounded the village had not
been wholly successful because surface indications of a large part of
that feature had been completely obliterated by cultivation. How-
ever, it was hoped that subsequent digging would make it possible to
follow its entire course.

At the beginning of the year a party under the direction of G.
Ellis Burcaw was excavating at the Rock Village located in the Gar-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 75

rison Reservoir basin, near Hazen, N. Dak., a few miles above the dam
site. Rock Village was reputedly occupied in the late eighteenth
century by the Hidatsa. During the field season, which terminated
November 3, five house floors had been uncovered and a number of
other features investigated. A party under the direction of Donald
D. Hartle resumed work at that location early in June. Additional
house floors were being uncovered and a number of cache pits had been
cleaned of their accumulated debris. The artifact yield was proving
satisfactory and the specimens should add to the picture of the Plains
culture as a whole. Rock Village is particularly interesting because
it presumably was the most northerly of the fortified earth-lodge vil-
lages belonging to the period preceding the replacement of aboriginal
material culture by trade goods obtained from the white man.

A second party, under the direction of G. H. Smith, was sent to
the Garrison Reservoir in June to study the site of Fort Stevenson, one
of the important military posts in that area during the period 1867
to 1883. The post was located a few miles above the dam site on
the left side of the Missouri River. By the end of the year the founda-
tions of the post hospital had been traced and excavations had been
started on the site of the south barracks. There is considerable docu-
mentary information about Fort Stevenson, but knowledge of the
post will be considerably broadened by the study of its actual location
and remains,

At the beginning of the fiscal year excavations were being conducted
at the Tiber Reservoir on the Marias River in Montana by a party
under the supervision of W. D. Enger. Two of the sites investigated
were occupation levels attributable to a simple hunting culture. They
were characterized for the most part by hearths; charcoal; bones from
bison, deer, and smaller mammals; and scattered chips of stone with an
occasional artifact. The cultural levels began approximately 2 to 4
feet beneath the present surface, and in one of them a rock-ringed
hearth about 2 feet in diameter was found 714 feet below the surface.
The yield from both sites was small, but there is sufficient evidence
to indicate that the area was not heavily populated and that the peo-
ple were dependent for the most part on the hunt for their subsistence.
Other sites examined, but not extensively dug, included tipi-ring
clusters, bison kills, and surface camp sites. Sites such as that con-
taining the deeply buried hearth may contribute important informa-
tion on the rate of deposition in the area in question. When materials
from the low level are correlated with those from other districts, it
may be possible to determine the lapse of time since the fire pits were
built and used.

Paleontological and geological investigations were continued in
the Missouri Basin during the year. In the summer of 1950 a party
under Dr. Theodore E. White explored Tertiary deposits in reservoir
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

areas in Montana and North Dakota and Cretaceous deposits in South
Dakota. Work in the Lewis and Clark and Broadwater Counties in °
Montana where the Tertiary stratigraphy has been imperfectly known
since its discovery in 1904 by the late Dr. Earl Douglass definitely
established the presence of Lower and Middle Oligocene and Lower
and Middle Miocene in that area. In North Dakota the investigations
demonstrated that the Cannonball Marine member of the Fort Union
formation has a much greater areal distribution than was formerly
supposed. Other activities consisted of rapid surveys of proposed
reservoir projects in Nebraska and Colorado. Investigations in Mon-
tana were resumed in June of 1951.

Laboratory activities at the field headquarters in Lincoln during
the year included the processing and cataloging of specimens; the
processing of records, including the indexing and filing of photo-
graphs; and the preparation and mimeographing of preliminary re-
ports for distribution to the cooperating agencies. The specimens
processed, numbering 84,255, came from 371 sites distributed over 18
reservoirs and other projects. In all, 11,764 reflex copies of records
were made. Color transparencies totaling 651 were cataloged. Black-
and-white photographic negatives numbering 1,707 were made, and
7,507 contact prints were processed. In addition, 197 8-by-10’’ en-
largements were made. The drawings, tracings, and maps prepared
for use in the various reports numbered 469.

Several exhibits were prepared interpreting the salvage program
and the prehistory of the Missouri Basin area. One of them was dis-
played at the Eighth Conference for Plains Archeology, while another
was placed in the windows of the Surveys’ quarters in downtown
Lincoln. <A series of lantern slides illustrating the salvage program,
particularly with respect to Nebraska, for use in an automatic pro-
jector, was prepared in cooperation with the University of Nebraska
State Museum and was installed in the latter institution.

G. Ellis Burcaw, archeologist, was in charge of a field party exca-
vating at the Rock Village in the Garrison Reservoir, N. Dak., at
the start of the fiscal year. He continued his activities there until late
in October and returned to the field headquarters at Lincoln on Novem-
ber 8 where he worked on his field report covering the summer’s
activities.

Paul L. Cooper, field director, devoted most of his time to manage-
ment problems and general supervision of the field office and labora-
tory. He made numerous trips to inspect and consult with field parties
and served in an advisory capacity to the Region Two office of the
National Park Service at Omaha, Nebr., in the matter of preparing

agreements for cooperative projects carried on by State and local
institutions in the Missouri Basin.
SECRETARY'S REPORT Th

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, served as laboratory super-
visor at the Lincoln headquarters from July 1 to November 6. During
such times as the director was absent from the office, Mr. Cumming
assumed administrative responsibility for the Lincoln office. After
November 6 Mr. Cumming took over the duties of a field archeologist,
conducting surveys in the Ashton Reservoir area and carrying on ex-
cavations in the Fort Randall Reservoir basin. During the winter
months he wrote a preliminary report on the results of his survey
work and assisted with the preparation of a preliminary report on
the Oahe Reservoir. He also prepared a report on the physical anthro-
pology of skeletal material excavated at the Massacre Creek site,
Nebr., by the Nebraska State Historical Society, a cooperating insti-
tution. At the close of the year he was supervising the excavations
at the Oldham site near Platte, S. Dak.

Walter D. Enger, Jr., archeologist, was engaged in a series of exca-
vations at the Tiber Reservoir on the Marias River in Montana at
the beginning of the fiscal year. The party under his supervision con-
tinued its activities until September 16, when it returned to the Lincoln
‘headquarters.

Franklin Fenenga, archeologist, reported to the headquarters at
Lincoln, Nebr., on October 26 and served as laboratory supervisor
from November 6 to June 1, when he was assigned to duty in the field.
Early in June he made a survey of the Lovewell Reservoir area in
Kansas and in the latter part of the month made a preliminary recon-
naissance of six potential reservoir areas in Wyoming. During the
winter months in Lincoln he wrote preliminary archeological recon-
naissance appraisals of the Sun River basin and the Jefferson River
basin which were issued in mimeograph form. He also prepared sur-
vey reports for the following reservoir projects: Keyhole, Yellowtail,
Narrows, Moorhead, Fort Randall, and Lovewell. In addition, Mr.
Fenenga wrote “A Historical Analysis of Anthropological Interests
in the Psychological Sciences,” for publication in the Proceedings of
the Nebraska Academy of Sciences. In November Fenenga was elected
editor of the Plains Conference News Letter.

Thomas R. Garth, archeologist, joined the River Basin Surveys on
July 2 by transfer from the National Park Service. On July 17 a
party under his supervision began a series of investigations of historic
sites in the Fort Randall area. That work continued until late in
October, when he turned his attention to a survey of the area in the
vicinity of Chamberlain, S. Dak., for the purpose of locating Indian
sites. He completed his reconnaissance and returned to the Lincoln
office on November 7. On November 27 he was detailed to the Na-
tional Park Service to complete reports on work he had previously
done at the Whitman Mission and Fort Walla Walla in Washington.
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

He returned to duty with the River Basin Surveys on February 27,
when he prepared a report on the results of his activities in the Fort
Randall area.

Donald D. Hartle worked at the Oahe Reservoir as assistant to
Donald J. Lehmer from the beginning of the fiscal year until Decem-
ber 1. During February and March he was employed on a Texas
project. On April 17 he was appointed archeologist and from then
until June 1 assisted in the laboratory at Lincoln. He then proceeded
to the Rock Village site in the Garrison Reservoir, N. Dak., where he
started a series of excavations which were still under way on June 30.

Donald J. Lehmer, archeologist, was in active supervision of the
excavations at the Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota from July 1 until
December 1. From the latter date until March he worked at the
Lincoln office preparing the report on the results of his investigations
at the Dodd site. In March he was transferred from the Missouri
Basin headquarters to a project in Oklahoma, where he remained until
the first of June, when he returned to the Lincoln headquarters. On
June 20 he proceeded to the Oahe Reservoir and resumed excavations
at the site where he was working when the field season ended the pre-
vious November. That work was continuing at the end of the fiscal
year. While at Lincoln Mr. Lehmer completed a paper giving pre-
liminary descriptions of the pottery types found at the Dodd site.

George Metcalf, field and laboratory assistant, was at the Angostura
Reservoir in South Dakota assisting Richard Page Wheeler at the
beginning of the fiscal year. On July 10 he returned to the Lincoln
office, where he worked on material obtained during the course of
excavations at the Medicine Creek Reservoir. On August 12 he pro-
ceeded to the Garrison Reservoir and joined the party under G. Ellis
Bureaw. From August 22 until October 18 he carried on a reconnais-
sance of the area around the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and
located and recorded 55 sites, including historic buildings, the remains
of earth-lodge villages, camp areas, deeply buried hearths, tipi-ring
sites, burial sites, and one reputed battleground. After completing
the survey he remained at the Rock Village excavation assisting Mr.
Burcaw until the end of the field season, when he returned to Lincoln.
During the winter months he assisted in the processing and analysis
of materials from the various excavations and helped to prepare sec-
tions of some of the reports on the previous season’s work. On June 1
he left Lincoln for the Garrison Reservoir to assist in the work at the
Rock Village. At the end of the fiscal year he was continuing his
activities at that location.

James M. Shippee, field and laboratory assistant, was at the field
headquarters in Lincoln until July 17, when he left to join the excavat-
ing party at the Angostura Reservoir in South Dakota. He assisted
in the activities there and accompanied the party when it moved to
SECRETARY’S REPORT 79

the Boysen Reservoir in Wyoming, returning with it to Lincoln in
September. During the period September 28 to October 30 he as-
sisted in the survey in the Niobrara River subbasin in Nebraska and
from November 7 to 15 aided in the examination of the Ashton Res-
ervoir area and the region adjacent to the Sargent, Woods Park, and
Ashton Feeder canals. He also assisted in the salvage of the burials
uncovered by activities at the Cushing dam site. During the winter
months he devoted his time to the restoration of pottery vessels from
the Boysen and Oahe Reservoirs and assisted in other laboratory
duties. On June 21 he accompanied the excavating party that was
sent to the Keyhole Reservoir in Wyoming and was occupied there
at the end of the fiscal year.

George H. Smith joined the River Basin Surveys staff as archeolo-
gist on May 2. Until June 4 he devoted his time to a study of the
problems centering about historic sites in the Fort Randall, Oahe, and
Garrison Reservoirs, and in familiarizing himself with the work
already accomplished in those areas. He also made a quick trip to
the Oahe and Garrison Reservoirs in company with M. J. Mattes and
R. H. Mattison, historians of the National Park Service. On June 11
a party under his supervision began excavations at the site of Fort
Stevenson, and at the close of the fiscal year he was still engaged
in that activity.

At the beginning of the year Richard Page Wheeler, archeologist,
was in charge of a party excavating at the Angostura Reservoir in
South Dakota. In July he and his party moved to the Boysen Reser-
voir in Wyoming, where they carried on excavations until September
20. Wheeler then returned to the headquarters at Lincoln and from
September 28 through October 30 directed the survey of 10 "shart
reservoir sites in the Niobrara River subbasin in northern Nebraska.
Returning to the field headquarters, he spent the winter months
completing his report on the Niobrara survey and working on detailed
technical reports on his investigations in the Angostura and Boysen
areas. On June 21 he left for the Keyhole Reservoir near Moorcroft,
Wyo., where he began a series of excavations which were actively
under way at the end of the fiscal year. In April Mr. Wheeler was
elected chairman of the anthropology section of the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences to serve for 1952.

On July 1 Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, was investigating
deposits in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. From there he proceeded
to the Garrison Reservoir and subsequently to the Fort Randall
Reservoir. At all three locations he collected fossils and continued
his studies of the geology of the various areas. From September 22
to 29 he made a rapid survey of 10 proposed reservoir projects in the
Niobrara River subbasin in Nebraska. The completion of that task
in so short a time was made possible through the cooperation of Morris
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Skinner of the Frick Laboratories who is thoroughly familiar with
the area. From October 8 to 14 Dr. White examined Pliocene de-
posits in the Bonny Reservoir in northeastern Colorado. From No-
vember until June he was engaged in work elsewhere. Returning to
the Missouri Basin on June 17, he proceeded to the Canyon Ferry
Reservoir in Montana to continue his search for fossils. Nearly 100
specimens were collected, including forms previously unknown from
the area. Those from the Oligocene deposits consisted of marsupials,
insectivores, rodents, and small artiodactyls. The larger animals,
such as the rhinoceroses, are represented only by fragments. The
material obtained from the Miocene deposits consists of large oreo-
donts, beavers, rabbits, and small rodents. While at the Lincoln
office Dr. White prepared a paper, “Observations on the Butchering
Technique of Some Aboriginal Peoples,” which was presented before
the Eighth Annual Conference for Plains Archeology held at Lincoln
late in November.

Oklahoma.—During the fiscal year both surveys and excavations
were carried on in Oklahoma. From July 1 to August 10 Leonard
G. Johnson and James G. Smith, field assistants, made a reconnais-
sance of the Gaines Creek Reservoir on Gaines Creek, a tributary of
the South Canadian, in eastern Oklahoma. They located 52 archeo-
logical sites, most of which indicate temporary occupation despite the
fact that at two locations there were mounds, and at other places vil-
lages seemed to have existed. Most of the sites in the Gaines Creek
area were found on high ground above the high-water mark, but a
number of those that will be flooded appear to be of some significance,
and excavations have been recommended for six of them. In addi-
tion to the aboriginal remains, the former location of one historic
settlement, North Fork Town, was established. The Gaines Creek
Reservoir constitutes part of an alternate plan that has been prepared
for that area. One plan calls for a single large reservoir to be known
as the Eufaula. The other calls for three smaller projects which in
the main will inundate approximately as large an area as the one
reservoir. In view of that situation the surveys have been carried on
from the standpoint of the three smaller reservoirs but extending the
investigations sufficiently beyond their limits to take in the one large
project. The other two smaller reservoirs, the Canadian and the
Onapa, were surveyed during previous years. At that time the Ca-
nadian was found to involve 41 archeological sites and the Onapa 25.
With the results of the Gaines Creek survey, it now is evident that a
total of 118 sites will be included in the Eufaula basin if the one large
project is carried through. If only one or two of the smaller reser-

ig are completed, the archeological salvage needs will, of course,
e less.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 81

After completing their studies at the Gaines Creek project, John-
son and Smith proceeded to the Optima Reservoir area on the North
Canadian (Beaver) River in Texas County. The dam for the project
is to be erected just above the confluence of the North Canadian and
Coldwater Creek and will flood areas along both streams. ‘Three sites
were found along the North Canadian and one along Coldwater Creek.
In all cases they were found to be above the high-water line, and there
is no urgency with respect to excavating them. Site 3 lies at the
upper end of the basin that will be flooded along the North Canadian,
and investigation at some future date has been recommended.

The excavations made in Oklahoma were in the area to be flooded
by the Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir on the Ilinois River near Tahlequah.
Some testing was done at two locations, but most of the work was at a
third, known as the Cookson site, where a party under the direction
of Donald J. Lehmer dug 6 houses, 4 graves, 2 hearths, and 31 cache
pits. ‘Two components were isolated. The early one was character-
ized by rectangular houses with four center posts and trench en-
trances, while the later was characterized by rectangular houses with
two center posts and indications of a bench along the north wall.
There was no evidence of an entryway for these houses. The projec-
tile points accompanying the early horizon fall within the range that
is considered typical of Archaic and early Woodland in the Southeast.
They also are common in the material from the prepottery Grove
Focus in northeastern Oklahoma. Associated potsherds indicate a
ware similar to the utility forms from the Spiro components. The
latter ware in itself cannot be limited to an early horizon, but the
small amount found in the excavations of the early component sug-
gests that pottery was just beginning to appear in the complex. Stone
artifacts in the late horizon differ somewhat from those of the earlier.
Slate hoes and double-bitted axes are absent and projectile points are
predominately small. The pottery associated with the late horizon is
a shell-tempered ware which usually is decorated. The total complex
has certain similarities to Orr’s Fort Coffee Focus, but it probably will
warrant being set up as a separate focus. The houses of the early
horizon are similar to those considered typical of the early Spiro
component, while those of the late horizon are quite similar to those
for the late Spiro component.

The work at the Tenkiller Ferry was completed at the end of May,
and Mr. Lehmer returned to the Missouri Basin headquarters at Lin-
coln. Throughout the period of the activities in Oklahoma, both for
the surveys and the excavations, Dr. Robert E. Bell, of the University
of Oklahoma, aided the field parties in the capacity of a consultant,
and the University of Oklahoma cooperated in the loan of equipment
and in making office space available to the men when they were in
Norman.
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Pennsylvania.—Investigations in Pennsylvania consisted of two sur-
vey projects. During October a reconnaissance was made of the Cone-
maugh River Reservoir in Indiana and Westmoreland Counties and
of the East Branch Reservoir on the Clarion River in Elk and McKean
Counties. The dam for the Conemaugh Reservoir, situated near Tun-
nelton, is scheduled for completion by December 1951. The reservoir
will flood approximately 21 miles of the Conemaugh River and 11
miles of one of its larger branches, the Black Lick Creek. Within
the pool area eight archeological sites were located. Of this group
only one was deemed worthy of further exploration and excavation.
It covers about 10 acres and is located on one of the larger terrace
bottoms above the river near an old fording place. An Indian trail,
the Venango, is supposed to have crossed the river at that point.
The East Branch Reservoir apparently is located in a district where
there was little aboriginal occupation because no archeological sites
were found there. This probably may be attributed to the fact that
the reservoir will fill a narrow V-shaped valley which was not suitable
for Indian inhabitation. The surveys in Pennsylvania were made by
Ralph §. Solecki.

Texas—The River Basin Surveys in Texas continued to operate
from the base and headquarters furnished by the department of an-
thropology of the University of Texas at Austin. Robert L. Stephen-
son was in charge from July 1 until April 15, when he was granted
an extended leave of absence. Edward B. Jelks then assumed direc-
tion of the project. During the fiscal year surveys were begun and
completed in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir on Cypress Creek in north-
east Texas and in the Granite Shoals Reservoir on the Colorado River
in central Texas. Excavations were continued and brought to comple-
tion in two field sessions in the Lavon Reservoir on the East Fork of
the Trinity River, while the first field session at Garza-Little Elm
Reservoir on the Elm Fork of the Trinity resulted in the excavation
of two sites and the brief testing of three others. Excavations were
also started and brought to completion in three sites in the Falcon
Reservoir on the Rio Grande. The excavation of two sites and testing
of three others were completed in the Belton Reservoir on the Leon
River in central Texas.

The excavations started the previous year in the Lavon Reservoir
were completed on August 2, with recommendation for additional
excavation to be undertaken during the spring of 1951. The work
there included excavation of over 40 percent of the large circular
pit in the Hogge Bridge site as well as several test squares and several
deep-strata squares outside the pit. The purpose for which the pit
was built is still unknown, but it was determined that the site is a pure
component of the newly delineated Wylie Focus. This is a culture
complex probably overlapping the latter part of Gibson aspect and
SECRETARY'S REPORT 83

the early part of Fulton aspect times in the Caddoan area and is coeval
with the Henrietta Focus of the southern Plains area. It is not a part
of either of those complexes but apparently an independent culture
in contact with both and dating probably between 1300 and 1500.

Excavations were started in three archeological sites in the Falcon
Reservoir on February 9. Donald D. Hartle was appointed temporary
field archeologist for this project, and, under the supervision of Mr.
Stephenson, he dug two historic sites and one deeply buried site.
No positive evidence of Indian occupation was found in the two his-
toric sites, which consisted of two and four stone-house ruins, re-
spectively. Both probably may be referred to the Early to Middle
Spanish Colonial period in the area. In the prehistoric site, a bull-
dozer was used for half a day and an area 20 feet by 40 feet was un-
covered to an average depth of 12 feet below the surface, exposing an
extensive occupation area which was excavated by hand in arbitrary
6-inch levels to an additional depth of 18 inches. Large quantities of
workshop refuse and 200 artifacts were recovered from the level. The
stratigraphic profile provided by the 12-foot trench wall revealed two
additional occupation levels at depths from the surface of approxi-
mately 4 and 7 feet, respectively.

In the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir, E. O. Miller and E. H. Moorman
conducted a survey from January 29 to February 16 and from April
9 to 21. During that survey 34 archeological sites were located and
recorded. Five of them contain smal] artificial earth mounds; the
remainder are open occupational areas. Six of the sites have been
recommended for further excavation.

The Belton Reservoir, surveyed the preceding year and recom-
mended for no further excavation, was later found to contain two
previously unknown archeological sites meriting some investigation.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Moorman, who had located the sites, spent the
periods December 11 to 13 and February 28 to March 2 in brief
excavations of the Urbantke site and the Grimes-Houy site. In addi-
tion, they made extensive tests in three other nearby sites. It was
found that the Urbantke site contained considerably more pottery
than most of the sites in the area. The artifact analysis showed con-
siderable similarity to the three rock shelters excavated the previous
year in the Whitney Reservoir area. The excavations at the Grimes-
Houy site uncovered 10 burials, and analysis of the artifacts and site
features indicates a relatively late date. It possibly was a Comanche
burial site.

The second season of excavations at the Lavon Reservoir was begun
on March 12 and continued until May 4. The work included further
digging in the Hogge Bridge site and extensive excavations in the
Branch and Campbell Hole sites. In order to determine quickly the
stratigraphic profile involved in the large circular pits in those sites,
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

a bulldozer was used for a total of 2214 hours. This provided exten-
sive stratigraphic trenches through the pit and the midden areas in
the Branch and Hogge Bridge sites and one long exploratory trench
in the Campbell Hole site. The use of a bulldozer for this work proved
very satisfactory, and little material damage was done to the artifacts
or the features encountered.

The first field session at the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir was begun
on May 7 and continued until June 18. Extensive excavations were
completed in the Lake Dallas and Ledbetter sites and brief tests were
made at the Pease and Craft sites. One of the few large Archaic sites
in this area, the Lake Dallas site, yielded artifacts that should be
valuable in the integration of the Archaic complexes of northeast
Texas. At the Ledbetter site—one of the most extensive local examples
of the later agriculture-pottery period—an interesting group of arti-
facts was found that suggests contacts with both the Caddoan peoples
to the east and the peoples who lived to the west and southwest.

At the Granite Shoals Reservoir, surveyed during February and
March by Robert H. Humphreys, 12 archeological sites were located
and recorded. They are all open occupational areas along the narrow
valley of the Colorado River. None are extensive or deeply stratified,
and since some information is on record from sites both upstream and
downstream from this project no further investigations are recom-
mended. Such evidence as was found during the reconnaissance and
testing indicated that the Granite Shoals region probably was occu-
pied by people of the Round Rock and Uvalde Foci over a period of
many centuries.

Dr. Theodore E. White spent the first 2 weeks in April in the
Austin laboratory identifying the faunal remains from the archeologi-
cal excavations of the Whitney, Lavon, Belton and Falcon Reservoirs.
During the remainder of April and the first week of May, he collected
fossils from the Upper Cretaceous deposits of the Lavon Reservoir.
He devoted most of May to investigations at the Garza-Little Elm
Reservoir, where he located and collected several vertebrate specimens
of Pleistocene age. They included a bison skull, a turtle, and a horse
jaw.

When he was not in the field, Robert L. Stephenson, archeologist,
devoted his time to analysis and study of the archeological materials
from the Lavon and Whitney Reservoirs and in organizing and pro-
gramming the work for the various field parties sent out from the
Austin headquarters. He completed an article on “Culture Chronol-
ogy in Texas,” which was published in American Antiquity, and fin-
ished a paper, “The Hogge Bridge Site and the Wylie Focus,” for
publication in the same periodical.

Edward B. Jelks, archeologist, assisted Mr. Stephenson in the field
and laboratory throughout the year until April 15, when he took
SECRETARY'S REPORT 85

over supervision of the Texas project. He spent most of the remainder
of the year in the field at the Lavon and Garza-Little Elm excavations.
He prepared a “Field Manual for Beginners in Central Texas Arche-
ology,” which was mimeographed and distributed to amateur archeolo-
gists who had requested guidance. As a result of historical research
undertaken to supplement archeological investigation at the Stans-
bury site in the Whitney Reservoir, he prepared a paper, “Indians of
the Central Brazos Area,” which was presented at the annual meeting
of the Texas Historical Association on April 27.

EK. O. Miller and E. H. Moorman served as field and laboratory assist-
ants throughout the year. They participated in the investigations in
the Lavon and Garza-Little Elm Reservoirs, began and completed the
excavations in the Belton Reservoir, and carried on the survey of
Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir. The remainder of their time was spent in
the laboratory in Austin cataloging and tabulating the materials from
the various field projects and preparing a report on their survey of
the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir.

Asa result of the financial status of the River Basin Surveys’ work
in the Texas area, the Austin office was closed on June 30.

Virginia—Field work in Virginia during the year included the
survey of one reservoir area and the excavation of a number of sites
inanother. On July 1,Carl F. Miller was digging at a site immediately
east of Clarksville, Va., on the east bank of the Roanoke River in
the Buggs Island Reservoir. Stripping operations there had destroyed
a large part of the site before information was received about the
work under way. Consequently, it was possible to salvage material
from only two small portions of the site. From those areas 77 burials
with their accompanying artifacts were recovered, and various midden
pits, as well as the remains of a rectangular structure, were uncovered.
That project was completed early in August. On February 28, excava-
tions in the Buggs Island area were resumed, and from then until
June 20, digging was carried on at nine different sites. At one there
was stratification showing that it was first occupied during the pre-
ceramic times and had continued in use until about the middle of the
ceramic period, when it was abandoned. Two of the sites investi-
gated were on Occaneechi Island near Clarksville. One of them con-
tained heavy cultural deposits consisting of both Indian and European
materials. Unfortunately, there had been so much disturbance by the
later occupation that it was difficult to obtain satisfactory evidence
from it, although a good series of artifacts was found. The second
site on the island was one of the largest thus far examined in the basin.
Iorty-four burials were found there representing all types from fully
flexed to partial cremation. The burned floor area of a large rec-
tangular structure measuring 35 by 15 feet was uncovered. The house
had five distinct floor levels interspersed with layers of clean sand.
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Whether that indicated five separate occupations of the structure or
remodeling activities during the course of a long-continued tenancy
is not known, but further study of the data obtained from the digging
may throw light on the subject. The structure had been built over
a number of burials, and after it was abandoned other graves were
dug through the floor, showing that the site continued to be inhabited
after the dwelling had burned. A number of the burials were accom-
panied by turtle carapaces, which undobutedly were placed there as
funerary offerings. They do not seem to have been used as food
receptacles, for in every instance they were inverted. Possibly they
may have had totemic significance and were placed with the dead to
indicate that the individual was a member of the turtle clan. A good
pottery series obtained from the site should fill certain gaps in the se-
quence for the area. ‘The work on Occaneechi Island indicates that it
was not the place where the village mentioned by Lederer, who visited
it in 1670, was located and that previous identification of it as such was
inerror. The current investigations indicate that the Occaneechi vil-
lage probably was on another island lying some distance downstream
from the one that now bears that name.

It had been hoped that at two of the sites, where fluted points and
other artifacts suggestive of the eastern variant of the Folsom com-
plex had been picked up from the surface, some remnants of the de-
posits belonging to that period would still be intact. The excava-
tions showed, however, that the sites had suffered extensive erosion
and that the artifacts previously found there were simply float ma-
terial that remained when the deposits were carried away. Addi-
tional work still remains to be done at the Buggs Island Reservoir.
The survey was made at the Philpott Reservoir during the last week
in June. The archeological manifestations found there are so
closely related to those in the Buggs Island area that no additional
work will be required. Materials gathered from the surface are so
similar to those from Buggs Island sites that they could not be recog-
nized if placed in the same collections.

West Virginia.—The only work done in West Virginia during the
year was the brief survey made at the site of the new navigation
lock at Morgantown. Examination of the area involved by the con-
struction disclosed that practically no new lands will be inundated
by the project. The water there is to be kept within the limits of
the river channel, which has rather steep and confining banks. Rail-
roads parallel the channel on both sides, and any archeological remains
that may have been there at one time were long since destroyed. No
further investigations are necessary at that project.

Cooperating institutions —Various State and local institutions co-
operated with the River Basin Surveys during the year. Space for
field offices and laboratories for units of the Surveys were provided
SECRETARY’S REPORT 87

by the Universities of Nebraska, Oregon, Georgia, and Texas. The
Universities of Oklahoma and Kentucky furnished temporary bases
of operations for the parties working in their States. The University
of Oklahoma took over the responsibility for the excavation of sites
in the Fort Gibson Reservoir, and the University of Georgia con-
tinued making surveys along the Flint River in the southern part of
that State. The University of Missouri and the Missouri Archeologi-
cal Society continued to make surveys in a number of proposed reser-
voir areas and carried on excavations in others. The University of
Arkansas also made surveys and did some digging in reservoir areas
in that State. In June, parties with which the River Basin Surveys
were cooperating began excavations in the McNary Reservoir and at
Lind Coulee in Washington. The McNary party came from the Uni-
versity of Washington at Seattle; that at Lind Coulee from the Wash-
ington State College at Pullman.

The program developed by the National Park Service late in the
previous year whereby various scientific agencies carried on salvage
work in proposed reservoir areas continued throughout fiscal year
1951. On the basis of agreements between the agencies concerned
and the National Park Service, certain funds were made available
to the agencies to help finance specified investigations. The River
Basin Surveys served in a consultative and advisory capacity only in
the carrying out of that program. Agreements were made, how-
ever, with the University of Nebraska, the Nebraska State Museum,
the Nebraska State Historical Society, the University of Kansas, the
University of South Dakota, the North Dakota Historical Society,
the University of Wyoming, and the University of Montana for work
in the Missouri Basin. Similar agreements were made with the
University of Mississippi for a survey of the Grenada Reservoir in
that State, with the University of Oklahoma for excavations at the
Eufaula Reservoir, with the University of Texas for excavations at
the Falcon Reservoir, with the Museum of New Mexico at the Chamita
Reservoir, with the University of California for excavations at the
Farmington Reservoir, and with the University of Washington for
work in the McNary area. The final results of the work accomplished
under those agreements will be published by the institutions con-
cerned, but they will correlate with and augment the information
obtained by the River Basin Surveys.

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY
(Report prepared by G. M. Foster)

General statement.—The objectives of the Institute of Social
Anthropology are anthropological research on the community life of
rural peoples of Latin America and the training of Latin American

981445527
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

nationals in the methods and principles of modern social anthropol-
ogy. The purpose is to inform both the social scientist and layman
in the United States concerning little-known peoples of other parts
of the world and to build up in various Latin American countries a
corps of professionally trained scientists and friends.

During the past year the Institute was financed by transfers of
funds from the Department of State, totaling $92,740, from the appro-
priation “International Information and Educational Activities,
1951.” As in the previous year, long-term planning has been done on
a very tentative basis because of budget uncertainties for the future.
Nevertheless, a full program was maintained in all countries, and
work on a short-term basis was initiated in Guatemala. The year in
review has seen increasing interest on the part of the Institute in a
more direct application of anthropological knowledge and techniques
to the practical problems of social and economic change that face
Latin American countries. Accordingly, for the first time an at-
tempt was made to enlist Institute personnel in a common research
problem in all four countries in which programs have been maintained
for several years for the purpose of pointing up some of the types of
contributions anthropologists can make to “action” programs of eco-
nomic and social betterment in so-called underdeveloped areas. It
was decided that an analysis of American-sponsored technical-aid
programs, with a history of several years of successful operations,
might reveal common operational problems, the solution of which
might be facilitated by anthropological counseling. After reviewing
a number of programs, it was decided that health centers developed by
the Institute of Inter-American Affairs in cooperation with the Min-
istries of Health of México, Colombia, Peri, and Brazil would be the
most satisfactory subjects. Two centers in each country, one urban and
one rural, were selected, and during March and April the operations
of these centers were studied, particularly in relationship to the basic
cultures of the peoples served. A dual goal was envisaged: (1) that
of determining, if possible, what may be the common factors that
favor and factors that inhibit the introduction and acceptance of ideas
and habits new to the ethnic groups in question; (2) that of pointing
up difiiculties in going projects, and making remedial suggestions.
A 100-page mimeographed report was prepared, which outlined the
theoretical basis for the work, described the work of health centers,
discussed salient aspects of indigenous culture that were affected by
this work, and made suggestions as to how utilization of anthropologi-
cal knowledge would increase the effectiveness of such work. One
hundred copies were sent to the Institute of Inter-American Affairs,
and plans made to distribute additional copies to various national and

international organizations carrying out a wide variety of technical-
aid programs,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 89

Major activities in each of the field offices, and in Washington, were
as follows:

Brazil—Drs. Donald Pierson, sociologist, and Kalervo Oberg, social
anthropologist, continued their research and teaching activities in
cooperation with the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Politica in Sao
Paulo. Dr. Pierson’s administrative duties as dean of the graduate
division occupied much of histime. In addition, he gave three courses
in sociology and guided independent and graduate research. In Feb-
ruary 1951, he directed an intensive course on rural life in Brazil,
sponsored by several ministries of the state of Sao Paulo, to about 70
persons who are government employees and administrators in various
offices. Dr. Pierson continued to develop plans for extensive social-
science research as a part of the Brazilian Government’s plan for eco-
nomic and social development of the Sao Francisco River Valley.
This planning came to a head with an offer from the National Com-
mission of the Sao Francisco Valley to transfer $27,000 to a fund to
be directed by Dr. Pierson for intensive socioethnological study and
analysis of the problems of industrialization and settlement in this
enormous area.

Dr. Oberg returned to SAo Paulo in July 1950, via Lima, after a
period of consultation in the United States. While in Lima he visited
and consulted with Ozzie Simmons, Institute representative in that
country. During the fall, and a part of the spring, he gave courses
in anthropology as usual at the Escola. During March and April
he carried out health-center investigations at Colatina, in the Rio
Doce Valley, and Cameta, at the mouth of the Tocantins River in the
Amazon basin. A lengthy report covering this work was submitted
to the local offices of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs. In
April Dr. Oberg represented the Smithsonian Institution and the
United States Government in Rio de Janeiro at the Second Annual
National Indian Week. At the end of the year plans were being
completed to lend Dr. Oberg for a 6-week period to the Institute of
Inter-American Affairs for additional anthropological work in
Chonin, in Minas Gerais.

Colombia.—Because of the budgetary uncertainties it was necessary
to discontinue the Colombian program in 1949. A new memorandum
of understanding was agreed upon in November 1950 by the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of Colombia and the United States Department of
State whereby it was agreed that future Smithsonian Institution ac-
tivities in Colombia would be in collaboration with the Instituto
Etnoldégico Nacional in Bogota, directed by Licenciado Luis Duque
Gomez, rather than with the Popayaén branch of the Instituto, as in
former years. Charles J. Erasmus joined the staff of the Institute of
Social Anthropology in the fall of 1950 to take charge of this program.
Mr. Erasmus has given a general course in ethnography at the Insti-
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

tuto Etnoldégico as a part of the regular curriculum of this organiza-
tion. A number of Colombian towns and villages were surveyed for
possible field work, and final decision was made on the village of Kota,
about 20 kilometers to the north of Bogoté. This is a typical mestizo
village of the Savanna of Bogota, representative of much of rural
Colombian life, and conveniently close to Bogota so that short vacation
periods as well as long field periods are possible. During March and
April Mr. Erasmus devoted his time to the health-center research
described in the introduction, working in the Ricuarte barrio of
Bogota, and in the Magdalena River port of La Dorada.

Guatemala.—Late in 1950, upon the request of Dr. Antonio Gou-
baud-Carrera, Guatemalan Ambassador to the United States, the tem-
porary detail of an Institute ethnologist to Guatemala became pos-
sible. Accordingly, Richard N. Adams joined the staff, arriving in
that country in December. In the seven months at his disposal Dr.
Adams gave a general course in the Instituto de Antropologia e His-
toria. A series of special lectures was also given to personnel of the
Instituto Indigenista. Dr. Adams also supervised field research in
several villages, including La Magdalena, near Guatemala City, in
which the Central American Institute of Nutrition is carrying out
long-range investigations. This work was designed to shed light on
the cultural factor in a program aimed at bettering the nutritional
and general health practices of the peoples concerned, and in gather-
ing data applicable to similar projects in other Central American
countries. Because of budgetary limitations it was, unfortunately,
necessary to drop Dr. Adams from the Institute staff at the end of the
fiscal year. Fortunately, it was possible to make arrangements for
him to continue his Guatemalan work by means of a Department of
State specialist grant.

México—During the fall of 1950 Dr. Isabel T. Kelly, Institute rep-
resentative, continued preparation of the second volume on the Tajin
Totonac Indians, the first volume of which was sent to the printer in
June 1950. In March 1951 she participated in health-center analyses,
studying the Beatriz Velasquez Aleman Center in Mexico City, and
that in the suburb of Xochimilco. Late in the winter she made a recon-
naissance trip through the Sierra de Puebla and selected the highland
Totonac village of San Marcos Eloxochitlan for field work. In April
a 3-month period of field work was initiated, in which five students
from the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia participated. This study
of a highland Totonac community will, among other things, in con-
junction with the lowland Tajin Totonac afford data on the relation-
ship of environment to culture.

Dr. William Wonderly joined the Institute in March 1951 to teach
linguistics at the Escuela Nacional. This was the first time that lin-
guistics had been taught in México under Institute of Social Anthro-
SECRETARY'S REPORT O]

pology auspices since Dr. Stanley Newman left three years ago. Two
courses were given, one on general linguistics and the other on mor-
phology and syntax.

Perti.—Ozzie G. Simmons continued his teaching activities at the
Instituto de Estudios Etnolégicos in Lima. Field studies, in which
several Peruvian students participated, were initiated in the non-
Indian village of Lunahuana, in the upper Cafete Valley, south of
Lima. This work, when completed in 1951, will still further broaden
our knowledge of contemporary Peruvian rural culture, which already
includes the villages of Moche (Gillin), Sicaya (Tschopik, Muelle,
and Escobar), and Vira (Holmberg and Muelle). During April Mr.
Simmons carried out his part of the health-center investigations,
studying the Lima center in Rimac barrio, and the center in Chim-
bote, on the north coast of Pert.

Washington.—Dr. Gordon R. Willey served as Acting Director of
the Institute until September, at which time he went to Harvard Uni-
versity as Bowditch Professor of Mexican and Central American
Archeology and Ethnology.

Dr. George M. Foster returned in September from a year’s field
trip to Spain to resume duties as Director of the Institute. While in
Spain, Dr. Foster worked with Dr. Julio Caro Baroja, director of the
Museo del Pueblo Espajiol in Madrid, making a general survey, based
on printed sources and field studies, of Spanish ethnography. Dr.
Foster’s part of the work was oriented toward the historical and theo-
retical problems involved in the carrying of Spanish culture to the
New World, and its assimilation with native American culture. This
work was planned to give added depth and background to the
continuing studies of Institute and cooperating Latin American
personnel.

Dr. Foster made a month’s trip in March to Guatemala, Colombia,
and Pert, for the purpose of consulting with Institute field personnel,
and appraising the new Guatemalan project as well as the newly
opened Bogota office. Consultations were also held with heads of the
participating national institutions in all three countries. Dr. Foster
spent much of the month of June in assembling the health center’s
report.

LIBRARY

One hundred twenty-three volumes were added to the library of

ARCHIVES

Manuscript material has been made available to research workers
both in the office and through the furnishing of microfilm copies. The
94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

major project accomplished during the year was the classification of
the great collection of Iroquois material assembled by J. N. B. Hewitt.

The addition of five new metal storage cabinets greatly improved
the conditions for protecting the manuscripts. Since more cabinets
could not be obtained, another method of storage for the material in the
archives annex was developed. Using heavy cardboard filing boxes,
graded to size, does away with the wrappings formerly used and makes
the material much easier to consult.

A method of preserving the rare Indian drawings in the collections
by the process of lamination was adopted on advice from the preserva-
tion division of the National Archives.

Through the librarian of the Geological Survey, the collections have
been enriched by the addition of the original catalog of the photo-
graphic negatives made on the famous Grand Canyon expedition of
J. W. Powell. This list in Major Powell’s handwriting, removes all
doubt as to the identification of the pictures made by J. K. Hillers
and E. O. Beaman. The original negatives have long constituted an
important sector of the Bureau’s Indian photographic archives.

Indians, past and present, of both continents. Requests from teach-
ers of primary and secondary grades and from Scout organizations
continue to increase and indicate a rapidly growing interest in the
American Indians throughout the country. Various specimens sent to
the Bureau were identified and data on them furnished for their
owners.

APPENDIX 6

Report on the International Exchange Service

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1951:

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency
for the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and
literary publications. The International Exchange Service, initiated
by the Smithsonian Institution in the early years of its existence for
the interchange of scientific publications between learned societies
and individuals in the United States and those of foreign countries,
serves as a means of developing and executing in part the broad
and comprehensive objective, “the diffusion of knowledge.” It was
later designated by the United States Government as the agency for
the transmission of official documents to selected depositories through-
out the world, and it continues to execute the exchanges pursuant
to conventions, treaties, and other international agreements.

Although the weight of the packages received for transmission
during the year decreased by 438,314 pounds to the total of 788,773
pounds, the number of packages increased by 1,375 to the total of
1,011,000—the greatest number of packages received during any year
of the existence of the International Exchange Service.

The average weight of the individual package decreased to 12.46
ounces, approximately the same as the 13-ounce average of 1950. The
majority of the publications now being transmitted are current pub-
lications rather than large lots of accumulated publications. The
publications received from both the foreign and domestic sources for
shipment are classified as shown in the following table:

SECRETARY’S REPORT 97

The packages of publications are forwarded to the exchange bureaus
of foreign countries by freight or, where shipment by such means
is impractical, to the addressees by direct mail. The number of boxes
shipped to the foreign exchange bureaus was 2,884, only 5 less than
for the previous year. Of these boxes 765 were for depositories of
full sets of United States Government documents, these publications
being furnished in exchange for the official publications of foreign
governments which are received for deposit in the Library of Con-
gress. The number of packages forwarded by mail and by means
other than freight was 190,690.

The reduction in transportation costs, accomplished by exporting
through Baltimore rather than New York and first effected in 1947,
is being gradually neutralized by steadily increasing transportation
rates. The increasing freight and postal rates are primarily respon-
sible for the 145,727 pounds of publications that remained unshipped
at the end of the fiscal year.

No shipments are being made to either China or Rumania. Pub-
lications intended for addresses in Formosa and formerly sent through
the Chinese Exchange Bureau at Nanking are now forwarded by
direct mail.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
by the Exchange Service for transmission abroad in return for the
official publications sent by foreign governments for deposit in the
Library of Congress is now 102 (61 full and 41 partial sets), listed
below. Changes that occurred during the year are shown in the
footnotes.

Report on the National Zoological Park

Sir: Transmitted herewith is a report on the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951.

During the year 1,768 individual animals were added to the collec-
tion by gifts, deposits, purchases, exchanges, births, and hatchings.
Among the accessions were many rare specimens never before shown
in this Zoo. The addition of new kinds of animals enhances the value
of the collection, which is maintained not only for exhibition, but for
research and education, thus fostering the Smithsonian’s established
purpose of “the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”

Valuable opportunities for research are afforded students of biology,
particularly vertebrate zoology, as well as artists, photographers, and
writers. Only methods of study that do not endanger the welfare
of animals or the safety of the public are permitted.

Services of the staff included answering in person or by phone, mail,
and telegraph questions regarding animals and their care and trans-
portation; furnishing to other zoos and other agencies, public and
private, information regarding structures for housing animals; co-
operating with other agencies of Federal, State, and municipal gov-
ernments in research work; and preparing articles for publication.

The stone restaurant building, which was constructed in the Park
in 1940, is leased at $23,052 a year. This money is deposited in the
general fund of the United States Treasury. The concessionaire
serves meals and light refreshments and sells souvenirs.

VISITORS

The estimated numbet of visitors was 3,460,400, an increase of
22,7381 over the previous year. This was the largest attendance in
the history of the Zoo and was probably due to a combination of cir-
cumstances, such as the continued high employment in the Wash-
ington area, increase in travel accompanying the general economic
prosperity, and the frequency with which the Zoo was able to announce
the addition of interesting specimens to the collection.

Before the war, early days of the week had relatively low attend-
ance, with an increasing number of visitors the latter portion of the
week and very large crowds on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
Now the variation in attendance on the different days is much less.
There is also a considerable increase in attendance in the mornings.

Groups came to the Zoo from schools in Canada, Cuba, Haiti, and
29 States, some as far away as Maine, Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas,
and North Dakota. There was an increase of 167 groups and 138,445
individuals in groups over last year.

About 2 p. m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
by the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or
country from which they came. This is, of course, not a census of the
cars coming to the Zoo but is valuable in showing the percentage of
attendance, by States, of people in private automobiles. Many of the
District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia cars come to the Zoo to
bring guests from other States. The tabulation for the fiscal year
1951 is as follows:

The cars that made up the remaining 11.5 percent came from every
one of the remaining States, as well as from Alaska, Austria, Bahamas,
Belgium, Canada, Canal Zone, Cuba, England, Germany, Guam,
Guatemala, Hawaii, Holland, Japan, Mexico, Newfoundland, Nica-
ragua, Okinawa, Philippines, Puerto Rico, some of the South American
Republics, and Switzerland.

THE EXHIBITS

Specimens for exhibition are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase,
exchange, births, and hatchings and are removed by death, exchange,
or return of those on deposit. Although depositors are at liberty to
remove their specimens, many leave them permanently.

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turn-over, and
so the exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory list of
specimens in the collection on June 30 of each year does not show all
the kinds of animals that were exhibited during the year; sometimes
creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown are no
longer in the collection at the time the list is prepared.

The United States National Museum is given first choice of all
specimens that die in the Zoo. If they are not desired for the Museum
they are then made available to other scientific institutions or scien-
tific workers. Thus, the value of the specimen continues long after
it is dead.

ACCESSIONS

During the year there were 267 accessions comprising 862 individual
animals received as gifts or deposits. These included an unusual
number of interesting specimens.

OUTSTANDING ACQUISITIONS

There were received 88 different kinds of animals that either had
never before been exhibited in this Zoo or are such rare specimens that
they are outstanding additions.

One of these is the Agrimi goat, “Kri Kri” (Capra aegagrus cret-
ensis),a choice male specimen of a very rare native wild goat of Crete.
This was a gift to the United States Government from the Greek Gov-
ernment, through the Economic Cooperation Administration and the
State Department.

A single specimen of toucan (Ramphastos), which is as yet un-
identified, was received from Colombia. This bird had never been
exhibited formerly in the National Zoological Park, and it is appar-
ently rare in the wild, as well as in collections.

Seventeen specimens of the Santa Marta tinamou (Crypturellus
noctivagus idoneus) were also received from Colombia. These were
new to the Zoo collection, and they are large enough and so conspic-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 107

uously marked as to be choice exhibits. They have hitherto been
considered rare.

Specimens of the large Meller’s chameleon (Chamaeleon melleri)
were received from J. D. Handman, of Nyasaland, Africa. These
are rare in collections, and their size, conspicuous coloration, and a
peculiarly shaped projection on the end of the nose make them showy
exhibition animals. Mr. Handman also sent such rarities as giant
wingless crickets (Znyaliopsis petersz) , quaint blesmols (Cryptomys),
and numerous reptiles.

A splendid specimen of the black-headed python (Aspidites melano-
cephalus) of Australia was received. This is a large snake that had
never before been in the Zoo collection.

The three-banded armadillos (Tolypeutes tricinctus) received from
central South America are interesting little creatures not much larger
than a good-sized grapefruit. They are the first this Zoo has ever
exhibited.

A pair of the large burrowing gopherlike tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sp.),
also from central South America, makes an interesting exhibit and the
first of its kind the Zoo has had.

Six Labrador lemmings (Dicrostonyx hudsonius), likewise the first
that have been exhibited here, were received from the Arctic Institute
of North America through Dr. Graham Rowley, T. H. Manning, and
Dr. A. L. Washburn.

The big black-bellied hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) of eastern Europe
are striking contrasts to the much smaller and better-known golden
hamsters that have become so popular as pets. Efforts are being made
to breed these. None have previously been exhibited in the Zoo.

Three large mouselike creatures (Mfastomys coucha) , new to the col-
lection, are particularly interesting because they are used in Africa
as laboratory animals and are now being tried out in the United States
for research work. They were turned over to the Zoo by the Army
Medical Center.

Three specimens of the rarely found little burrowing frog (Cera-
tophrys calcarata) of Colombia were received. These, also, are new
to the collection.

Other animals that, though not the first of their kind in the Zoo,
are sufficiently rare or interesting to be noteworthy include a pencil-
tailed tree mouse (Chiropodomys gliroides) from the Malay Penin-
sula; hairy armadillos (Chaetophractus villosus); least marmoset
(Callithriz pygmaea) ; two of the rare and peculiar maned or crested
rat (Lophiomys imhausi) of Africa; white-tailed Colobus monkey
(Colobus polykomos) ; potto (Perodicticus potto) ; brush-tailed porcu-
pines (Atherurus africanus) ; young mandrills (Mandrillus sphing) ;
shoebill stork (Balaeniceps rex) ; black-necked swan (Cygnus melan-
coriphus) ; a king vulture (Sarcorhamphus papa) ; quetzals (Pharo-
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

machus mocino) ; fer-de-lance snakes (Bothrops lanceolatus) ; king
cobra (Vaja hannah); Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica) ; Australian
copperhead snake (Denisonia superba) ; the little burrowing snake
(Typhlops) from Africa; and coconut crabs (Birgus latro), which
were a gift to us from the Governor of Guam.

The Army Medical Center, through its various workers, has con-
tinued to turn over to the Zoo interesting animals no longer needed
in their work. Through Maj. Robert Traub, of the Research and
Graduate School, there was received a very fine collection of rodents
from Kuala Lumpur, Malay Peninsula. There were six different
species of the genus Rattus, which included a very small richly colored
rat, and a large somber-colored one, as well as other intermediate
forms. These rats are of particular interest as they are being studied in
connection with human diseases. Also received through Major Traub
were three species of the inconspicuously marked squirrels of the
Callosciurus group, the long-pointed-nose Malayan ground squirrel
(Lariscus), another of the queer little pencil-tailed tree mice (Chzro-
podomys), and three excellent specimens of the slow loris (Wycticebus
coucang).

E. M. Blocker, of the Fresno (Calif.) Zoo, presented two California
jack rabbits, which were particularly desirable additions as they have
rarely been available to the National Zoo.

Dr. Gabriel Ospina Restrepo, Director of the Instituto Nacional de
Antropologia Social de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia, kindly presented
the Zoo with two pygmy marmosets. These are the smallest of the
marmosets and, being rare in collections, are especially desirable
additions.

It has been possible to acquire many of these rarities for the Zoo
through the use of air transportation to bring animals quickly from
their native haunts, and by maintaining contacts with persons in
remote regions who are interested in collecting specimens. By a con-
tinuance of these methods it is hoped to bring to the American public
more interesting creatures that have not heretofore been available
for study alive.

laid by the original pair of tiger bitterns (Zigrisoma lineatum).

MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS

In July 1950 a portion of the arched acoustical block ceiling in the
large-mammal house fell. The building was immediately closed to
the public, and the Public Buildings Administration was requested
to make a study of the condition to determine the extent of the neces-
sary repairs and how best to do them. On their advice a deficiency
appropriation of $63,000 was obtained, and the work of repairing the
entire ceiling was undertaken under a contract handled by the Public
Buildings Administration. Most of the work was completed by June
30, 1951.

Progress was made during the year in repairing and improving
buildings, cages, roads, and walks. New bear cages were built in the
line above the reptile house; 2,000 linear feet of 7-foot fence around
four deer and mountain-sheep paddocks were replaced; the steel frame
of the silver-gull cage was repaired and painted, and the cage was
re-covered with new wire fabric; the wolf and fox cages were exten-
sively repaired; a new shelter house was constructed for the wild hog;
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

a 6-foot concrete sidewalk, 600 feet in length, was constructed along
the base of lion-house hill between the mechanical shops and the cross
roads; 7,800 square feet of bituminous surfacing was laid between
walks and roads to prevent erosion; 900 linear feet of cement copings
for roads and walks were constructed; electric hot-water heaters were
installed in the small-mammal house, reptile house, monkey house,
lion house, mechanical shops and Director’s office to provide hot water
at locations where it had not previously been available; the wooden
park benches were extensively repaired and painted; 60 table tops
and legs, 12 bench legs with arms, and 24 table tops were cast of
concrete; and a new waterproof electric cable with lamps was installed
in the underground steam conduit from the central heating plant to the
large-mammal house.
NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Replacement of antiquated structures that have long since ceased
to be suitable for the purposes for which they are used is still the
principle need of the Zoo. The more urgently needed buildings are:
(1) A new administration building to replace the 146-year-old historic
landmark which is now in use as an office building for the Zoo but
which is neither suitably located nor well adapted for the purpose;
(2) a new building to house antelopes and other medium-sized hoofed
animals that require a heated building; and (8) a fireproof service
building for receiving shipments of animals, quarantining animals,
caring for animals in ill health or those that cannot be placed on
exhibition.

APPENDIX 8

Report on the Astrophysical Observatory

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1951:

The two divisions of the Astrophysical Observatory, the division
of astrophysical research engaged in the study of solar radiation
and the division of radiation and organisms concerned with radiation
effects on organisms, report improvement in instrumentation and in
results obtained,

Dr. R. B. Withrow, chief of the division of radiation and organisms,
with a staff of six research men, has augmented the program outlined
in last year’s report to include a new biochemical investigation of
photomorphogenesis in green plants, under contract with the Atomic
Energy Commission.

Dr. Withrow’s division occupies offices in the tower of the Smith-
sonian building, with laboratories in the west end of the basement.
The laboratories, recently completely reconditioned, form an excel-
lent setting for the specialized work of the division.

The division of astrophysical research and part of the shop fa-
cilities occupy a group of small structures just south of the Smith-
sonian Building. These buildings were this year sheathed in asbestos
shingles, not only to improve their appearance but also to make them
warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

On February 24 and 25, 1951, the Director attended a conference
at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston, on “The Sun
in the Service of Man.” The stimulating program and discussions
emphasized one fact—that man must learn to make better use of the
energy received daily from the sun if he is to avoid hunger and dis-
comfort in the not too distant future. Sixty years ago this fact was
uppermost in the mind of Samuel P. Langley when he founded the
Astrophysical Observatory.

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

Two high-altitude field stations for solar observations—at Monte-
zuma, Chile, and Table Mountain, Calif.—have continued in operation
throughout the year. Reestablishment of a third station was still
uncertain at the close of the fiscal year, inasmuch as the requested

117
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

funds had not been provided. Clark Mountain, near the Nevada
border in southern California, a region whose annual precipitation
averages about 3 inches, has been chosen as the best available location
in North America for this proposed station.

W. H. Hoover, chief of the division, conducted special studies at
the Table Mountain station during October and November 1950. He
returned to the station at the close of the fiscal year to continue these
studies.

Dr. W. E. Forsythe, of Cleveland, Ohio, who during the past 214
years has prepared the ninth revised edition of the Smithsonian Physi-
cal Tables, submitted his completed manuscript on June 1, 1951.

Work in Washington.—As in previous years, the monthly solar-
constant records from the two field stations have been checked, com-
puted when necessary, and final corrections applied.

Four reports have been submitted to the Office of the Quartermaster
General summarizing the radiation observations made at Montezuma,
Chile, during the year. These observations, a part of the textile-
exposure work under contract with the Quartermaster Department
and referred to in previous reports, were completed May 10. The
Quartermaster Department has indicated a desire to start a new series
of studies at Montezuma and also at the proposed Clark Mountain
station.

Some years ago the Observatory developed an instrument, called
the melikeron, to measure outgoing radiation from the earth to space.
Several of these instruments have been used with fair success by the
United States Weather Bureau and others, and it has been the hope
to improve the melikeron and make it a more sensitive recording
instrument. Inasmuch as the Meteorological Division, Chemical
Corps, Camp Detrick, Md., is interested in the same general problem,
it was arranged to work cooperatively. At the close of the year a new
instrument was being assembled and undergoing preliminary tests
and calibration at Camp Detrick.

During the year two silver-disk pyrheliometers were built, cali-
brated, and sold at cost as follows:

8. I. No. 83 to the Government of Israel, Jerusalem.

8. I. No. 85 to the Air Force, Cambridge Research Laboratories, Cam-

bridge, Mass.

A third pyrheliometer was lent to the Radiological Defense Labora-
tory, San Francisco, Calif., and three new orders were received. It is
a satisfaction to note the continued demand for Smithsonian pyrheli-
ometers. Since Dr. Abbot designed the silver-disk instrument 40 years
ago, over 100 have been built. Eighty-four have been sold to interested
institutions: 34 are in various parts of Europe, 19 in North America,
10 in South America, 14 in Asia and Australia, and 7 in Africa. In
SECRETARY’S REPORT 119:

consequence the Smithsonian standard scale of radiation has been
made available throughout the whole world.

Dr. Abbot, research associate since his retirement from administra-
tive work, continues his special studies, and Dr. Henryk Arctowski
continues his researches concerning solar and terrestrial atmospheres.

Work in the field—tlast year’s report mentioned the new concrete
observing tunnel on Table Mountain, Calif., about 100 feet west of
the old tunnel, in which the spectrobolometric equipment formerly
used at Tyrone, N. Mex., had been set up. This gave duplicate equip-
ment in the two tunnels, and at the beginning of the year a series of
simultaneous observations was in progress, observing through iden-
tical skies. The series continued for 40 observing days, including 8
long-method days. Detailed comparisons of the observations showed
satisfactory agreement. One unexpected difference persisted through
the observations, namely, the ratio of the galvanometer deflections
for successive wavelengths changed progressively through the spec-

. .o¢2,, old tunnel deflection Kn: =
trum. The ratio = are Gi SteREGts started at about 1.150 in the violet

end and decreased to 0.960 in the red end. These differences in de-
flections are compensated for by the transmission factors, which are
regularly determined for each individual spectrobolometer and the
deflections altered accordingly.

Following this series of observations, the stellite mirrors in the new
tunnel were replaced by aluminized mirrors. As expected, this mate-
rially increased the deflections in the new tunnel—a gain of twofold
in the red end and approximately fivefold in the violet end. A second
series of simultaneous observations, one tunnel with stellite mirrors
and the other with aluminized, is now in progress.

Mr. Hoover took with him to Table Mountain a specially built
double spectroscope with rock-salt prisms, designed to measure the
ozone absorption in the infrared, between 9 and 10 microns wavelength.
This was mounted and tested in the new tunnel.

A new and important project has developed at Table Mountain, re-
sulting from a paper published in 1931 by Dr. Oliver R. Wulf, of the
United States Weather Bureau and the California Institute of
Technology, on the determination of ozone by spectrobolometric meas-
urements (Smithsonian Misc. Coll., vol. 85, No. 9). Dr. Wulf has
long felt that a method could be developed for daily measurement of
the quantity of ozone in the upper atmosphere from the Smithsonian
solar-constant records. He bases his method on the relatively weak
Chappuis absorption bands in the yellow-orange region of the visible
spectrum. Dr. Wulf fortunately was able to spend some days on
Table Mountain, working on the details of his method. On February
1, 1951, the Table Mountain staff started the required daily measure-
ments. Preliminary results look promising, and the method will be

981445—52—9

120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

strengthened as more data accumulate. It is hoped that a daily de-
termination from our bolographs of the quantity of ozone in the upper
atmosphere may become a regular part of our records at the Table
Mountain station.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Report prepared by R. B. WirHRow)

During the past 2 years the division of radiation and organisms has
been setting up specialized equipment and facilities for an investiga-
tion of the plant photochemical reactions involving photomorpho-
genesis, which is a light reaction controlling the growth and develop-
ment of higher plants, and photoperiodism which is another light
reaction controlling the flowering of many higher plants. Wave-
lengths in the red end of the spectrum from about 600 to 700 my are
the most effective in producing these responses.

The first experimentation has involved photomorphogenesis as it
pertains to the effect of red light on leaf expansion and pigment forma-
tion in seedlings of bean and corn. In the dark, a young bean seedling
develops with a sharp bend just below the bud, called a plumular hook,
and the leaves fail to develop beyond a very immature stage. With
very low intensities of red light, leaf expansion occurs quite rapidly,
nodes develop from the bud, and the plant form approaches normal.
Heretofore, with such developmental reactions there has always been
associated other photochemical reactions as chlorophyll synthesis
and photosynthesis.

Since the elucidation of the biochemistry of photomorphogenesis
is greatly complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of other light-
controlled reactions, an attempt has been made to induce photomor-
phogenesis independently of other light processes. Special dyed gel-
atin light filters have been prepared which have a sharp cut-off at
about 730 mp, so that they transmit only wavelengths longer than the
cut-off, but strongly absorb the shorter wavelengths. In bean it has
been found possible to cause almost complete development of leaves
and the first few internodes without any measurable synthesis of
chlorophyll; thus photomorphogenesis has been excited with only the
most minute traces of chlorophyll synthesis, no photosynthesis, and no
phototropic reaction. From this it is evident that the photomorpho-
genic reaction has an action spectrum that goes a little farther into
the infrared than that of the other photochemical reactions.

By using the 436 my line from a mercury arc isolated with a blue
filter, it has been possible to produce bean plants in which the leaf
development occurred to a very small degree, but yet considerable
chlorophyll synthesis took place. The blue-treated plants had
roughly 10,000 times as much chlorophyll as the 730-myp-treated
SECRETARY’S REPORT 21

plants. It is thus concluded that protochlorophyll and chlorophyll
as photoactivating pigments are probably not associated with photo-
morphogenesis and that some other pigment must be present which is
causing this reaction.

Pigment analysis showed that the corn and bean plants treated with
radiation in the range from 730 to about 1,000 mp developed from 50
to 100 percent more protochlorophyll, carotenoids, and, in the case of
bean, anthocyanin pigments per unit of fresh tissue than those kept
in the dark. On a per-plant basis, the increase varied from 200 to
300 percent depending upon temperature and intensity.

Higher plants can grow “normally,” the normal being considered
the growth form of a sunlight-grown plant, when a balanced spectrum
involving the proper proportions of blue and red radiation are pres-
ent. At moderate intensities of blue light, where there is sufficient
photosynthesis, growth is rather poor with most higher plants, and the
plants appear short and stunted. In red light of the same energy,
growth is rapid but the plants are tall and weak-stemmed. Since
the alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa is a standard test object that has been
studied in relation to photosynthesis and can be grown rapidly and
reproductively under precisely controlled conditions, it was consid-
ered desirable to test whether growth of Chlorella is dependent upon
the red-light reaction necessary for the growth of higher plants.
Chlorella cultures were grown under blue radiation from a mercury
lamp isolated at 435.8 mp, and the red cultures were grown in an
incandescent band from 635 to 670 mp. Results thus far indicate that
Ohlorella is not dependent upon the same photomorphogenic red-light
reactions as the higher plants, since growth in the blue-treated cul-
tures is similar to that in the red-treated cultures when equal quantum
energies are used. However, there is evidence that the blue cultures
contain more chlorophyll. Thus growth with Chlorella appears to be
dependent entirely upon the rate of supply of the products of photo-
synthesis. The other photochemical reactions do not appear to be
limiting as in higher plants.

Gas-exchange studies made in a Warburg manometric apparatus
have indicated that in Chlorella there is no detectable increase in
respiration rate with radiation of wavelengths beyond 730 mp and
there is, likewise, no photosynthesis. Thus these radiations that pro-
duce such marked growth reactions in higher plants produce no
measurable reactions in Chlorella.

A second phase of the research has dealt with the effect of growth
regulators on salt uptake and water exchange by plants. The par-
ticular reference plant used was black valentine bean and the growth
regulator was ammonium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate acid. The up-
take of salts was measured continuously by a recording electronic
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

conductance bridge especially designed for the purpose. Absorption
of various nitrates, chlorides, and sulfates of potassium, calcium, and
magnesium was studied. The results indicate that there is a marked
reduction in salt uptake when the plants are treated with NH,-2,4-D
and that this reduction is concomitant with a reduction in growth and
does not precede it. With all salts except potassium and calcium
nitrates, the reduced uptake does not appear until 24 to 48 hours after
application of the regulator. In the case of potassium and calcium
nitrate the effect begins within the first 24 hours.

It was also found that water absorption was markedly reduced when
either the bud or primary leaf of bean was treated with NH,-2,4-D,
the greater reduction occurring when the leaf was treated. The re-
duction was not related to an effect on a root mechanism since it oc-
curred on excised shoots to the same magnitude as in whole plants. A
rapid weighing technic showed that the loss of water from the plant
treated with NH,-2,4-D was considerably less than for plants not so
treated, indicating that transpiration is greatly reduced by treatment
with 2,4—-D.

During the year a contract was assigned to the division by the
Atomic Energy Commission to study the effect of radiation on the
growth and development of plants. A contract renewal was awarded
by the Biological Department, Chemical Corps, Camp Detrick, Md.,
to continue physiological studies of the effect of growth regulators on
plants.

Respectfully submitted.

Report on the National Air Museum

Sim: [have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951:

HIGHLIGHTS

Because of the tense international situation this year the National
Air Museum encountered difficult obstacles in the conduct of its op-
erations. As the program progressed, rumor of the reuse of war
plants became fact, and before the close of the year the Air Museum
was ordered to vacate its storage facility at Park Ridge, Ill., to make
way for aircraft manufacture. Despite such deterrent factors, how-
ever, all normal functions of the bureau were carried on, including
the maintenance of the exhibited collections in Washington, the opera-
tion of the storage facility near Chicago, the survey for aeronautical
museum material, and the conducting of the bureau’s informational
services.

Although new material added to the aeronautical collections was
less in quantity than usual, the quality equaled that received in former
years. Joremost on the list of 99 objects received was the Bell X-1
supersonic airplane, considered by many to be the greatest forward
step in aeronautics since the Wright Brothers’ invention of the Actty
Hawk. The acquisition of this important addition to the aeronautical
collections and notes of other worthwhile items received are further
described under the heading “Accessions and Events.”

ADVISORY BOARD

This year one meeting of the Advisory Board of the National Air
Museum was held, on June 28, 1951, called primarily to consider the
problem of the required removal of the Air Museum’s collections stored
in the former Douglas bomber manufacturing plant, Park Ridge, Ill.
The Board formally reaffirmed its belief in the great historical and
technical value of the collections and directed that all possible care be
taken to effect the preservation of the aircraft and other components
of the collections. In this connection, the wholehearted cooperation
of the Departments of the Navy and Air Force was assured.

123
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Changes in the composition of the Advisory Board were announced
as follows: Lt. Gen. K. B. Wolfe, United States Air Force, on retiring
from active duty was succeeded by Maj. Gen. Donald L. Putt, United
States Air Force. Rear Adm. A. M. Pride, Bureau of Aeronautics,
Department of the Navy, upon assignment away from Washington was
succeeded by Rear Adm. Thomas S. Combs.

STEPHENSON BEQUEST

Public Law 722, by which the National Air Museum was established
August 12, 1946, authorized the Smithsonian Institution to accept as
a gift from George H. Stephenson, of Philadelphia, Pa., an appro-
priate statue of Brig. Gen. William Mitchell. Mr. Stephenson died
on July 17, 1949, leaving a bequest of $15,000 to the Smithsonian for
the proposed memorial. This has been accepted following a feasible
interpretation of the bequest under agreement between the Smith-
sonian and the executors of the Stephenson Estate, with approval of
the Orphan’s Court of Philadelphia County. Toward the close of this
fiscal year, the bequest was received, and plans for the memorial were
initiated.

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

The curator, Paul E. Garber, reports on the year’s work as follows:
In an effort to alleviate the crowded condition of the aeronautical
displays, provide space for the bureau’s laboratory and shop, and
permit the exhibition of some of the new and timely accessions, many
exhibits were moved and rearranged this year. In addition, several
important items in the collections were removed from exhibition and
carefully stored.

Since its organization, the workshop facilities of the bureau had
been contained in small rooms in two buildings. Operations were
hampered, and it was decided to convert a portion of the exhibition
area in the Aircraft Building into a single laboratory. Some of the
exhibition space lost by this transaction was regained by the construc-
tion of display cases recessed into the exterior walls of the new shop,
and the condition of the bureau’s reference files and library was im-
proved by extending these units into one of the old shops. Another
major readjustment was the concentration of all aircraft engines in
“engine row” along the north side of the Aircraft Building. The en-
gines have been chronologically arranged and provided with improved
exhibition stands, better labeling, and a protective railing. This con-
centration provided floor space for the display of a portion of a full-
sized fuselage of a current United States Air Force fighter, the Re-
public F-84 thunderjet, a type now in service in Korea.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 125

The installation of the Bell supersonic X-1 was a major project.
Unlike aircraft generally, the X—1 was built as an integral structure
without the usual attachments and fittings that permit assembly or
disassembly. As its size did not permit its movement into the mu-
seum’s exhibition hall through existing entrances, a 30-foot length of
wall was removed from the side of the Aircraft Building to allow the
X-1 to be placed inside the building. In this undertaking the bureau
had the cooperation of United States Air Force personnel and equip-
ment and of the Bell Aircraft Corp.

Two of the full-sized aircraft—the Spad XIII, World War I
fighter, and the F-5-L, World War I Naval patrol bomber—received
extensive repairs. The exhibition of the Wright Brothers’ Wind
Tunnel was improved by adding a copy of the bench grinder, fan, and
belt, which provided the wind current, and the small truck used to
launch the original Kitty Hawk.

ACCESSIONS AND EVENTS

The outstanding accession of the year was the Bell supersonic air-
plane X-1 noted above. This was formally presented to the Air Mu-
seum by Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg on behalf of the United States Air
Force and accepted by Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary of the
Smithsonian, on August 26, 1951, at Logan Airport, Boston, Mass.,
during the National Air Fair. Participating in the ceremony were
Lawrence D. Bell, president of Bell Aircraft Corp. which constructed
the airplane, Lovell Lawrence, Jr., president of Reaction Motors, Inc.,
makers of the rocket engine which powered the X—1, and Capt. Charles
E. Yeager, United States Air Force, who first piloted the X—1 through
the sonic barrier on October 14, 1947.

A second accession of note was a duplicate of the first ram-jet engine
to achieve thrust over drag and attain supersonic speed. This type of
jet engine was developed for the United States Navy by the Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Silver Spring, Md.
The first successful demonstration occurred on June 13, 1945, when a
speed of about 1,500 miles an hour was attained. The original engine
was lost in the ocean off Island Beach, N. J., where the experiment
took place, but a duplicate composed of original parts, sectioned to
show construction and operation details, was prepared for the Na-
tional Air Museum. Its presentation was made at a ceremony held
in the Aircraft Building on November 29, 1951, in which Rear Adm.
A. G. Nobel, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, United States Navy,
Dr. R. E. Gibson, Director of the Laboratory, and his associate, Dr.
Wilbur H. Goss, participated. Carl W. Mitman, Assistant to the Sec-
retary for the National Air Museum, accepted the gift.
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

An outstanding aeronautical event celebrated during the year was
the fortieth anniversary of Naval Airplane Carrier Operations.
Such operations were instituted on January 18, 1911, by Eugene Ely,
an associate of Glenn H. Curtiss, pioneer aircraft manufacturer, when
he landed upon and took off from a special deck platform constructed
on the U.S. S. Pennsylvania anchored in San Francisco Harbor. That
successful experiment demonstrated the utility of the aircraft carrier,
which proved to be such a vital factor in World War II. To mark the
anniversary the Museum obtained a scale model of the old U.S. S.
Pennsylvania and constructed on its stern deck a scale reproduction of
the special landing platform and arresting gear used by Ely. Upon
this a model of his airplane was placed illustrating the moment of suc-
cessful landing. The Museum meanwhile had acquired by transfer
from the Department of the Navy an early Curtiss airplane engine
identified as the one that powered Eugene Ely’s airplane on this his-
toric occasion. The engine was procured through Don Coe, Buffalo,
N. Y. These two accessions, together with a series of photographs
illustrating carrier development from 1911 to the present, were com-
bined attractively into a special exhibit which, for the anniversary,
was placed first in the foyer of the Navy Department and later ex-
hibited in the Pentagon. The exhibit is now permanently incorpo-
rated in the Museum’s collections.

Three full-sized aircraft of historical or technical significance were
added to the collections, in addition to the Bell X-1. They are the
trans-Isthmian tractor airplane, designed, constructed, and flown
across Panama in 1913 by the renowned pilot Robert C. Fowler; the
Northrop F-61 of World War II origin believed to be the first type
of American fighter designed specifically for night operations; and
the McDonnell helicopter Whirlaway, the first twin-engined helicopter
and prototype of the heavy lift designs now under development.
These three aircraft are in storage until a museum building is
provided.

Among the aircraft engines added, the original Pratt & Whitney
Wasp engine No. 1, which in 1925 laid the foundation for that com-
pany’s development of radial engines, is outstanding. In addition,
two sectionalized and operating Wright radial engines of World
War II era, received from the Navy, help both student and layman
to understand the workings of this complicated type of internal-
combustion engine. Guided missiles, also received from the Navy,
not only furnish important examples of both German and American
types, but also provide, in their engines, forms of jet propulsion that
supplement the types shown in the Museum’s engine display. A
series of miniature engines as used on model airplanes is of particular
interest to younger flyers. A unique addition to the propeller collec-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 127

tion was received from Stanford University, namely, the experimental
test model of a controllable pitch propeller embodying features de-
veloped in 1918 by Dr. W. F. Durand and his associate, Dr. E. P.
Lesley. Dr. Durand has made many important contributions to
aeronautics.

Other accessions worthy of note are an original oil portrait of
Wilbur Wright done from life by J. A. Herve Mathe, received from
Gen. Frank P. Lahm, U. S. A. (ret.), and his sister, Mrs. Frank
Parker; and the Harmon Trophy established by Clifford B. Harmon
in memory of the Lafayette Escadrille of World War I and awarded
for outstanding accomplishments in aeronautics. The Air Museum
is recognized as a logical repository for renowned trophies.

A full list of the year’s accessions is presented at the close of this
report.

STORAGE

With more than two-thirds of the collection of full-sized aircraft
in storage because of the lack of an adequate building, storage-facility
operations loom large in the bureau’s management. The principal
storage facility during 1951, as in the previous 2 years, was the former
Douglas DC-4 plant at Park Ridge, Ill. The program of operations
there concerns the guarding, preservation, and cataloging of aircraft,
engines, and components, and their preparation for eventual shipment
to Washington. Other programs include evaluation of specimens,
screening and salvaging of material, research on design details of
aeronautical items, and special informational services. All opera-
tions were advanced during the year with the result that of the 82
full-sized aircraft on a retained status, 33 had been boxed for ship-
ment, 11 had been disassembled for boxing, 27 were ready for dis-
assembly, and 11 were assembled and made flyable. Of the 106
engines only 5 remained unboxed. About 5,000 components are now
boxed, but many of the containers require repair.

Technical research by the staff resulted in the selection and segrega-
tion of a number of details of aircraft construction which are being
prepared for display. These include samples of Japanese wing-rib
stitching, a German rocker box hold-down fitting, a German saw-
toothed entering edge from an He-177 wing for severing cables of
barrage balloons, a German cable clamp, German pulley, and other
items believed in each instance to incorporate features that are of
interest to designers and engineers.

Informational service included furnishing data on aircraft details
to pilots and mechanics servicing airplanes of types similar to those
in the collection, guided tours of the collection for groups of United
States Air Force personnel studying design features of foreign air-
craft, loans of significant specimens for official educational and re-
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

cruiting displays, and preparation of special exhibitions for Armed
Forces Day.

To record historical and design details of specimens, the staff de-
vised and installed a special card-index system, and by the close of
the year cards had been prepared for all aircraft, engines, parachutes,
and flight clothing. This information will expedite the preparation
of permanent records at the Washington office. The operation of
the storage facility this year was under the immediate supervision of
the associate curator, Walter Male. His staff consisted of two clerks,
three mechanics, two carpenters, and four guards. Space occupied
by the stored collections, office, and shop at Park Ridge remained at
147,600 square feet throughout the year.

Naval aircraft being retained for the Museum are stored at the Naval
Base, Norfolk, Va. Additions during the year included several en-
gines and the McDonnell Whirlaway helicopter. Donors who are as-
sisting the Museum by storage of significant aircraft include Howard
Hughes with his transcontinental record holder of 1937, and Stanley
Hiller with one of his early coaxial helicopters. During the year,
storage at Washington was relieved by shipping to Park Ridge two
aircraft, six engines, and a quantity of components, models, and other
items which had been removed from exhibition to relieve congestion.

COOPERATIVE PROJECTS AND INFORMATIONAL SERVICES

Assistance to other Government departments included: for the State
Department, furnishing historical data on rigid airships; and for the
Department of Justice, tracing development of various types of con-
nectors and handles used in parachute harnesses, and checking cockpit
installations as adapted to blind-flying operations. This research was
in connection with patent priority investigations. The Museum pro-
vided and assisted in posing models of aircraft and items of insignia
and flight clothing for a motion picture being prepared for the Air
Force. The use of identifying marks and insignia on aircraft was
traced for the heraldic office of the Air Force, and one of its historical-
research analysts was assisted in preparation of data on the Wright
Brothers. At the request of Kirtland Air Force Base, a Japanese
fighter airplane, Oscar, was made available from the excess examples
stored at Park Ridge. .

The Department of the Navy consulted the Museum to determine
details of one of its early Curtiss aircraft—the Triad of 1911. This
information was supplied from photographs and texts in the Faurote
collection of Curtiss data acquired several years ago. The Naval
Bureau of Ordnance Laboratory was lent a scale model of the Curtiss
SB2C for use in preparing a larger model, and the Bureau of Navi-
gation was assisted in identifying an early bubble sextant adapted
SECRETARY’S REPORT 129

for aerial navigation. The Navy’s research workers investigating
rocket propulsion were given information regarding some of the basic
work performed by Robert Goddard by reference to the collection of
Goddard rockets and apparatus in the Museum.

The spectacular employment of helicopters in the Korean war was
the subject of a meeting called by the Public Relations Office of the
Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics at which the curator furnished data
on types and assisted in planning a display and flight program held
later in the year in Washington under the direction of the Aviation
Industries Association. The National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics received assistance in editing articles on the scientific aspects
of the Wright Brothers’ accomplishments. One of the flight projects
being conducted by that Committee required the use of an F-61 North-
rop Black Widow, a night fighter developed during World War II.
Use of the Museum’s example was requested; it was flight-conditioned
and lent to the N. A. C. A. for this important purpose.

Both the Air Force and the Navy were aided in the preparation of
educational exhibits for Armed Forces Day displays involving use
of Museum material. The Naval Historical Foundation was assisted
in the preparation of a Naval aviation historical exhibit at the Trux-
tun-Decatur Naval Museum in Washington. Two airlines—United
and Capital—celebrated anniversaries this year and requested assist-
ance from the Museum in planning their programs and displays. Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft required basic information on cooling of aircraft
engines and were gratified to find helpful examples in Museum ma-
terial; this company was also assisted in making available to the
Museum of Science in Boston an early example of their Wasp engine.
The compilers of the Aircraft Year Book again called upon the Mu-
seum while preparing their review of the year’s accomplishments,
and many authors, artists, and modelmakers were helped in various
projects.

The National Aeronautic Association again appointed the curator
a member of their committee that selected the annual recipient of the
Brewer Trophy, awarded for advancing the interests of air youth
education; the recipient was Lt. Comdr. John Burton. The Institute
of Aeronautical Sciences was lent one of the rockets from the Robert
Goddard collection, with approval of the Daniel and Florence Guggen-
heim Foundation, which prepared the original exhibition.

During the year the curator by request lectured on the history of
aeronautics before several church, school, Boy Scout, and business
organizations; and he and other members of the staff conducted a
number of special tours of the collection for special groups including
four large units of Air Force and Naval officers studying aeronautical
history, structural characteristics, and aircraft recognition features.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Each year the Air Museum receives, in addition to its accessions,
very helpful assistance from many sources. Particular acknowledg-
ment this year is accorded to the United States Air Force for trans-
porting the X-1 supersonic airplane from Boston to Washington; to
the Bell Aircraft Corp. for preparing this plane for exhibition; and
to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics for furnishing
data on its flights. The United States Air Force also supplied a crew
to assist the Museum’s exhibits workers in dismantling the DeHav-
illand-4 to make room for the X-1. The United States Air Force
and Republic Aviation cooperated in preparing for exhibition the
cockpit and nose portion of the F-84 thunderjet previously men-
tioned. The Navy furnished a crew to move the F9C-2 Akron fighter
airplane and to move, repair, and paint the hull of the transatlantic
NC-+4. William B. Stout, Advisory Board member, constructed a
replica of his Sky Car fuselage and fitted it to the existing units of
this famous plane previously in the Museum’s custody, thus restoring
it to its original appearance.

The reference files, which constitute a valuable source of informa-
tion used in preparation of labels for specimens, for research by the
staff, and in answering inquiries from visitors and correspondents,
were greatly improved during the year by important donations. The
Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp. gave a collection of 44 framed
photographs of aircraft produced by this company and its associates ;
Mr. and Mrs. W. S. Clime, of Old Lyme, Conn., presented photo-

APPENDIX 10

Report on the Canal Zone Biological Area

Sir: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report on
the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951.

IMPROVEMENTS

A contract was awarded for the construction of a new 2-story build-
ing to provide much-needed space for laboratory expansion. ‘Two of
the eight rooms on the ground floor will be used for photographic
work; another will be a general dry room provided with heaters; and
the others will be ‘for laboratory work, toilets, and showers. The eight
upper-floor rooms will house the library, herbarium, card-index rec-
ords, laboratory glassware, microscopes, incubators, chemicals, and
other scientific apparatus. With each room a unit by itself, it will be
easier to control humidity and temperature, and most of the rooms
will have dehumidifiers. The roof, an inverted-V type, will be of alu-
minum and will have gutters to collect the rain water and direct its
flow into a large concrete water-storage tank, to be constructed. This
reservoir is urgently needed because the other large one, of creosoted
timber, is badly deteriorated.

During the year the new addition to the building for deterioration
and corrosion tests, started last year, was completed, and the interior
was remodeled. The building for the resident manager and the fore-
man’s former building (now a dormitory) were thoroughly bat-
proofed.

All the trails were inspected to determine their general condition
and to note any markers that might be missing. Four students from
Cristé6bal—Larry Cox, Andrew Bleakley, Jr., John Delaney, and Don
Smith, Jr.—were recommended for this task by Scout Master Richard
D. Cox, and to them was entrusted this important job, which they did
extremely well. In addition, they kept a record of the animals they
saw. A number of markers and posts will have to be replaced, but
on the whole the trails are in excellent condition.

CONDITION OF BUILDINGS

The main laboratory building remains in satisfactory condition, but
eventually should be converted into one with less fire hazard. The
134
SECRETARY’S REPORT 135

Haskins library building is in excellent condition, but should have
better humidity controls.

The resident manager’s house is in excellent condition, and the Bar-
bour cottage, the Z-M—A house below the main building, and the house
formerly occupied by the foreman are all in satisfactory condition for
the present. ‘They should be provided with dry closets, but our pres-
ent supply of electric current is not sufficient for this.

The kitchen and storeroom, though somewhat small for present
needs, are in good shape but still remain a fire hazard. It is proposed
to rebuild this unit of concrete blocks. The two buildings for the cook
and laborers are serviceable.

All the generators are in bad shape and cannot be operated on a
24-hour basis. This is a serious handicap to our food refrigeration.

The floating equipment is in good condition.

MOST URGENT NEED

The generation of electric current on the island is not only expensive,
but it is impossible to insure an adequate and constant supply. To
the high cost of the necessary daily attention to the generators, the
constant hauling of fuel, and periodic overhaul and repairs must be
added the loss incurred by spoilage of food, damage to books, and
deterioration of scientific equipment due to a drop in the voltage or
complete failure of the supply of current. Also, because of the
deterioration and corrosion caused by the high humidity in the Trop-
ics, the life of a generator on the island is, at best, only 8 or 9 years.
The present installation is urgently in need of new units; but new gen-
erators will not solve the problem, as the high operating cost will
continue, and in 8 years new units will again be required.

A very careful study of the problem has been made, in consultation
with electrical engineers of the Panama Canal and the armed forces.
The logical solution would be to tap the transmission line of the
Panama Canal, install transformers at Frijoles, lay an underwater
cable to the island, and there install transformers to step down the
voltage to 115-230. This would insure the island an adequate and
dependable supply of electricity at a cost of 2 cents for the first 100
kilowatts and 114 cents for each additional 100 kilowatts. At this
very substantial reduction in the cost of current, the system would
pay for itself in 10 or 12 years.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

During the year 383 scientists came to the island. High cost of
transportation to the Canal Zone still deters many from coming to the
Area.

136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Dr. A. M. Chickering, chairman of the division of science and
mathematics at Albion College, Michigan, continued his research on
spiders, collecting a large series for further study. This is his fifth
visit to the island for this purpose. In Turtox News for May 1951
Dr. Chickering published an interesting account of his explorations
in the Canal Zone and Panama, particularly on Barro Colorado
Island. His estimate of 1,200 species of spiders on the island is
indicative of the variety of species in other groups that may be
expected to exist. During the past 12 years he has published 15
papers on the spiders of this general area, one on the Salticidae
covering 474 pages.

Dr. Eugene Eisenmann, of New York City, returned again to
resume his studies of the birds of the island. He prepared an an-
notated list of the birds definitely known to inhabit the island, cov-
ering 306 species, which is to be published by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. In this he includes reference to the many other scientists
who have studied the bird life of the island. This will be the first
published list of birds of the Area to bring together all available
records. The obvious gaps should stimulate interest and further
study.

Dr. Frank A. Hartman, research professor of physiology, Ohio
State University, a recognized authority on the adrenals of verte-
brates, returned for a more extended stay. With the aid of his assist-
ants, Harry Beckman, a graduate-school assistant, and Ratibor and
Armageddon Hartmann from Chiriqui, he collected and preserved
what is probably the most extensive and comprehensive series of adre-
nals ever brought together. Half of the total of 1,447, from birds,
mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, are from the Canal Zone, and the
rest from the Volcan area of Chiriqui Province. About 200 skins, as
well as whole animals in formaldehyde, were prepared, the former
for identification and the latter for future anatomical studies. Care-
ful drawings were made of the adrenals and also of the thyroids of
birds. The preserved adrenals and thyroids will be used for extensive
histological and cytological studies. The bird skins will be placed
in the U. S. National Museum.

Dr. Bernard Lowy, of the botany department of the State Uni-
versity of Iowa, spent several months on the island studying princi-
pally the fungi, making large collections and many observations and
taking many notes and photographs (more and more essential in
mycology). Of Myxomycetes and Phycomycetes he collected more
than 70 species and made a thorough study of his specialty, the
Auricularias. He also collected much material from the Ascomycetes,
the Basidiomycetes, and the Fungi Imperfecti, as well as lichens,
mosses, and liverworts—the last two groups being exceptionally pro-
lific. Of the Meliolales more than a hundred species have been de-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 137

scribed from the island. Dr. Lowy was most fortunate in obtaining
excellent specimens of Cordiceps. He was not limited by his special
interest in the fungi, but collected also many of the higher plants, and
obtained rich material and notes particularly on the unique saprophyte
Ophiomeris panamensis and the very rare achloriferous Apodanthes
flacourtiae of the family Rafilesiaceae, known only from the island,
growing on Xylosoma.

Dr. Nicholas E. Collias, of the zoology department of the University
of Wisconsin, spent several months studying the population density
and social organization of the island’s howler-monkey clans, for
comparison with the studies made 18 years ago by Dr. Carpenter.
He had with him as collaborator Charles Southwick, graduate student
of the University of Wisconsin, Department of Wild Life Manage-
ment. The study showed significant changes in the number of indi-
viduals, location and size of the clans, reduced sex ratio, and proportion
of young in each clan. Detailed studies of the daily locations and
movements of the Lutz clan were made over an extended period,
preliminary to the census. The task was much greater than it would
seem at first, and suggests the desirability of asking scientists who are
on the island, with time to do so, to make similar observations of this
particular clan. These data should, over a period of years, yield
information that may explain why there are such significant changes.

During his stay Dr. Collias also definitely identified 123 species of
birds, including several new to the island list. Charles Southwick,
who assisted Dr. Collias, made significant observations on many of
the other mammals. In this work the two covered the entire island.

Dr. Lorus J. Milne, professor of zoology, and Dr. Margery Milne,
assistant professor of zoology, of the University of New Hampshire,
came to the island to study the light-sensitive structures of animals,
particularly the invertebrates. While on the island and in its vicinity,
they exposed more than 3,000 feet of 16-mm. Kodachrome movies, and
a large number of 35-mm. color stills and 4-x-5 black and whites,
which comprised a well-documented account of the plants and animals
of this part of the American humid Tropics. They also had the oppor-
tunity to study in great detail the rare Peripatus.

Dr. Hazel R. Ellis, head of the biology department of Keuka Col-
lege, Keuka Park, N. Y., spent considerable time on the island study-
ing the bird life, particularly nesting habits and songs. Although she
noted 76 species, her interest was not in the number of different kinds
of birds, but rather in observing how they live and behave. In detail
she studied the fruit crow (Querula purpurata) , of whose habits little
is known. She also made lengthy notes on the nests of the tinamou,
Hicks’s seedeater, the double-toothed kite, the boat-tailed flycatcher,
the tityra, the spotted antbird, and the Nicaraguan hermit humming-
bird. Dr. Ellis also made observations on most of the more common
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

mammals and on the plants, particularly those that are used by birds.

Robert M. Laughlin, student at Princeton University, came for an
extended stay and made many interesting observations. He dis-
covered the nest of the double-toothed kite not previously noted. Also,
he added the second-known record of the red-thighed dacnis. During
his stay he identified 96 species of birds. He also made observations
on eight of the mammals and took back with him about 500 moths and
other insects for further study.

Dr. Serge Korff, professor of physics, New York University, and
Mrs. Korff, revisited the island, on their return from the Fifth South
American Congress of Chemistry, to continue their observations on
plants and animals.

Robert Lewis Cumming, student at the University of Florida, spent
considerable time on the island during which he made a very thorough
study of the dragonflies and damselflies, increasing the number of
species previously recorded to 38, including a number new to science.
He made careful notes on the ecology of the Odonata. In addition
he added valuable data on the mammals and birds.

Dr. Car] Koford, of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University
of California, and Mrs. Koford spent a week on the island en route
to Perti, where they will spend about a year in research work. Dr.
Koford was interested mainly in the vultures, and Mrs. Koford spe-
cialized on the bats.

Dr. John H. Davis, professor of botany, University of Florida,
returning from New Zealand, visited the island to acquaint himself
with the flora of the humid American Tropics, particularly its ecologi-
cal aspects. He was so impressed with the plant life, and with the
facilities the island offers for study, that he plans to make it possible
for students of his university to study there. While at Barro Colo-
rado, he made a good collection of plants.

Ross Robbins, botanist at the Auckland University, on transfer to a
similar post in the University College of the West Indies, in Jamaica,
accompanied Dr. Davis, to observe the tropical flora and, in particular,
to make a good collection of mosses, which are his special field. Both
he and Dr. Davis were greatly impressed with the opportunities for
research offered by the island.

Dr. Francis J. Ryan, associate professor of zoology, Columbia Uni-
versity, and Mrs. Ryan, spent a short time on the island while en route
to the Fifth International Congress on Microbiology at Rio de Janeiro.
Their objective was to get acquainted with the plant and animal life
of the humid Tropics preparatory to a return later for more extended
research.

Ledlie I. Laughlin, associate director of admissions to Princeton
University, came, with his son Robert, to observe the birds and mam-
mals of the Tropics in their natural environment.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 139

Dr. R. T. Scholes, of the medical staff of Gorgas Hospital, and
Mrs. Scholes, spent considerable time on the island studying the bird
life and added many valuable records which will be incorporated in
Dr. Eisenmann’s list of the birds. They took a splended series of
Kodachrome photographs, part of them with a long-range telephoto
lens.

M. Francois Edmond-Blanc and Mme. M. C. Brot, from France,
visited the island to study at close range the birds peculiar to the
American humid Tropics.

Dr. C. C. Soper, director of the Tropical Research Laboratory of
Eastman Kodak Co., continued and expanded this firm’s exposure
tests, assisted by Paul Hermle, physicist, and Ismael Olivares, micro-
biologist. The results are most gratifying and emphasize the need
of such tests to study the rate of deterioration and corrosion. After
10 years, the importance of this work is more and more evident, and
Barro Colorado Island is particularly well suited for these studies
and for the evaluation of biocides.

Dr. Walter F. Clark, of the Research Laboratories of Eastman
Kodak Co. at Rochester, and an authority on infrared photography,
revisited the island for his annual inspection and conferences con-
nected with the tests under way. He also did considerable experi-
mental color photography, particularly under difficult conditions.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
revisited the island and held conferences with the resident manager
on plans for the future of the Area, proposed improvements, and
details of the new building, and solution of the problem of an adequate
supply of electricity. As in the past, W. M. Perrygo, of the U.S.
National Museum, accompanied him.

John E. Graf, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
likewise revisited the island and held conferences with the resident
manager, particularly regarding the plans for the new building and
the matter of electricity. He held conferences with electrical engi-
neers of the Panama Canal, with Dr. Soper of the Tropical Research
Laboratory of Eastman Kodak Co., and others, and made a thorough
inspection of the island installations and facilities, discussed opera-
tions, and worked on plans for further improvements and expansion.

Thomas F. Clark, administrative accountant of the Smithsonian
Institution, made a special trip to the island to establish the required
procedure to be followed in advertising for bids for the new building,
the inclusion of additional provisos in the specifications, the opening
of the bids, the awarding of the contract, the various bonds required,
and other details.

The resident manager continued his special research problems,
particularly the long-term termite-resistance tests, and completed his
forty-third report. He also continued the fruit-fly studies, particu-
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

larly in regard to population, fluctuations, and host-fruit relations.
The new building just erected embodies the very latest improvements
in termite protection, bat-proofing, and (with a more dependable and
adequate supply of electricity) humidity-temperature control for the
protection of the library, herbarium, microscopes, balances, and other
delicate laboratory apparatus. In addition he made a detailed study
of the problem of electricity sources, evaluating the pros and cons of
generators on the island, both Diesel and others, and the use of current
from the Panama Canal line—the logical and economical solution,
as set forth earlier in this report. The Bureau of Entomology and
Plant Quarantine tests with soil poisons were continued. The large
Berlese funnel was kept in operation and yielded an abundance of rare
insects, mites, and other forms difficult to find in any other way.

The following quotation from a letter from the late Dr. Thomas
Barbour to President Hopkins of Dartmouth College, June 17, 1931,
aptly defines the general purpose of the Canal Zone Biological Area:

“T don’t think I have ever received a letter that warmed the cockles
of my heart more immediately than did your letter of June 15th
* * *, No man ever goes to Barro Colorado Island without being
a more inspiring teacher on his return. This remark has been made
to me by men connected with over a dozen institutions. I emphasize
this feature because so much has been said of the opportunities for
research that I sometimes feel that the opportunity for just the plain
broadening of man’s mental horizon has not always been sufficiently
emphasized.”

VISITORS

There were fewer visitors this year than the year before. Among
numerous others were the following: The Honorable John M. Vorys,
Member of Congress from Ohio and a Regent of the Smithsonian
Institution, with his family; Col. Standley Carpenter, in charge of
the army malaria work on the Isthmus; Marvin Keenan, in charge
of the army’s sanitation; The Honorable Monett Davis, Ambassador
to Panama, with his family; several Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops
with their leaders, and also a large group of these leaders; Irving
Johnson and members of the Yankee, students from LaSalle College
and Miramar College of Panama, with their professors; Frank E.
Masland, Jr., and family; members of the Balboa Camera Club; Dr.
John B. Chadwick of Gorgas Hospital; several groups of high-school
students from Panama and their teachers; Dr. J. Russell Smith, of
Colombia University ; Dr. Norman Elton, director of the Gorgas Board
of Health Laboratory and members of his staff; a large group from
the Cristébal High School; William E. Lundy of Balboa, Don Biery
SECRETARY'S REPORT 141

and other members of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs, and
members of the staff of the United States Embassy; Ambassador
Mariani of Italy with his family; Dr. David Potter, of Clark Uni-
versity; members of the student class of the Balboa Junior College
under the leadership of Prof. George O. Lee; and William Burgoyne.

The outstanding scientific event of the year was the week-long Con-
ference on Corrosion and Deterioration, in which the island partici-
pated, and which was attended by a host of delegates from the United
States. More than 40 of the delegates visited the island as part of
the program.

RAINFALL

In 1950, during the dry season, rains of 0.01 inch or more fell on
30 days (84 hours), and during the wet season (8 months) on 207 days
(947 hours) ; a total for the year of 237 days (1,031 hours). Rainfall
was 7.44 inches above the 26-year station average. November and
December were the rainiest months (54 days, 352 hours), 41.64 inches,
36.3 percent of the year’s total. The dry season, while below average,
was considerably wetter than that of 1949.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1951, $10,781.87 in trust funds was available.
Of this amount $10,555.97 was spent, leaving a balance of $225.90.
In addition to this, $583.80 is still on deposit, representing local
collections.

The following items are paid out of trust funds: Food, freight,
and express, salaries and wages, office expenses, parts and repairs to
automobile, parts and repairs to floating equipment and to generators,
and sundry bills for general upkeep. Food represented 32.5 percent
of the total expended, and salaries and wages 57.4 percent.

During the year $868.50 was collected as fees from scientists,
$126.50 more than the previous year.

Despite the rising costs of food, wages, and other items, which were
higher than the previous year, the laboratory has not yet increased
its per-diem charge to scientists for meals and lodging and has con-
tinued to give a 25-percent discount to those who come from institu-
tions that sustain table subscriptions.

The following institutions continued their support to the laboratory
through the payment of table subscriptions:

It is most gratifying to again record donations from Dr. Eugene
Eisenmann of New York.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 143

In addition to its table subscription, the Smithsonian Institution
contributed $5,500 from its private funds, which is included in the
$10,781.87 in trust funds, mentioned above. Other expenditures
amounting to $1,341.38, made from Washington, bring the total
Smithsonian contribution from private funds to $7,141.38.

The Smithsonian Institution further allotted $18,000 from Govern-
ment-appropriated funds, of which the sum of $13,100 was expended
for the new permanent building.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We wish to express our appreciation for the whole-hearted coopera-
tion of the various units of the Panama Canal and the Panama Rail-
road Co., to become united at the start of the new fiscal year as the
Panama Canal Company, a corporation. We look forward to the
same cordial relations with the new organization. We also wish to
acknowledge especially the assistance of the Governor of the Panama
Canal, Brig. Gen. F. K. Newcomer and his staff; Alton White and
his Dredging Division; the various units of the Commissary Division;
the Panama Railroad officials and employees; the Municipal Engi-
neer; and Maj. George Herman, Chief of the Police Division and the
able men under him. The police have cooperated regularly in the
suppression of poaching, which is always a problem, though this
trespass on the island is not so great as might be expected.

Respectfully submitted.

James ZetTEK, Resident Manager.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 11

Report on the Library

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian Library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951:

The 52,685 publications received in the library during the year came
from 91 foreign countries, dominions, colonies, and protectorates, as
well as from the United States. Access to this world-wide literary
coverage of scientific and cultural progress in its own special subject
fields, so important to the work of all branches of the Smithsonian
Institution, is made possible largely by the cordial exchange relations
maintained between the Institution and the academies and learned
societies, the universities, museums, art galleries, observatories, and
other scientific and cultural organizations both at home and abroad.
This year 465 new exchanges were arranged, and 8,227 books, pam-
phlets, and periodical parts were received as the gratifying result of
576 special requests sent to issuing agencies for publications needed to
fill gaps in our collections.

Although the larger number of the library’s acquisitions were ex-
change publications, gifts were also numerous, and 9,552 volumes,
pamphlets, and periodicals came from many generous friends both in
and outside the Institution. The largest single gift of the year, a
collection of some 500 books and periodicals on philately, presented by
Malcolm Macgregor, of Bronxville, N. Y., is an especially noteworthy
addition to the philatelic sectional library in the Department of
History.

Most of the 2,111 volumes purchased during the year were recent
publications, but a few were some of the older out-of-print works
needed for reference in the Museum and the Bureau of American
Ethnology, which fortunately came into the market at reasonable
prices. Subscriptions for 348 periodicals not obtainable by exchange
were also purchased.

The grand total of 19,016 publications transferred to the Library of
Congress included 5,321 currently received volumes and periodicals
recorded and marked as permanent additions to the Smithsonian
Deposit there. Others were 1,526 doctoral dissertations mostly from
foreign universities, and 12,169 documents and miscellaneous publica-
tions on subjects having no immediate bearing on the work of the
Institution.

144
SECRETARY'S REPORT 145

Noteworthy publications among the 3,859 transferred to other scien-
tific libraries of the Government were 604 medical dissertations sent to
the Army Medical Library.

Cataloging and entry of current accessions of books and periodicals
were kept up, but with difficulty under the serious handicap of under-
staffing.

The number of volumes cataloged was 6,991, and 29,981 cards were
filed in catalogs and shelflists. Periodical entries numbered 17,854.

There was little opportunity to continue the much-needed work of
correlating and unifying entries in the periodical records with those
in the catalog, but some progress was made in the last quarter toward
completing this project.

An important piece of work completed by the staff was the check-
ing of Smithsonian serial holdings for inclusion in the forthcoming
Supplement to the Union List of Serials in Libraries of the United
States and Canada, consisting mostly of new titles published in the
years 1944-49. The library reported holdings of 478 of the titles listed
in the checking edition, and added 19 new titles not appearing in
the checklist. This cooperative undertaking on the part of the prin-
cipal libraries of this country and Canada results in the continuation
of one of the library’s most useful and time-saving bibliographical
tools.

Small withdrawals were frequently made from the collection of
duplicates, and 2,415 pieces from among the titles specially wanted
by participating libraries of the United States Book Exchange were
sent to the stockpile at that center for exchange credit.

With funds allotted for binding, 1,250 volumes, mostly periodicals,
were prepared for binding and sent to the Government Printing
Office. In the Museum library, 1,300 old books and pamphlets, some
of them irreplaceable, were repaired. There continues to be a large
backlog of binding and repair.

The library’s service to readers and research workers, both in and
outside the Institution, its primary reason for being, is so full of
intangibles that statistics of circulation and such other countable
records as it is possible to keep, where there are so many decentralized
units without immediate library supervision, can do little more than
suggest the actual work and time required to produce the right pub-
lication or to answer a question accurately.

The reference use of the library was increasingly heavy in all its
_branches, and answers to 17,688 reference questions were given, many
of them requiring hours of painstaking research among out-of-the-
way sources.

Loan-desk records show that 11,869 publications were borrowed by
members of the staff of the Institution and by 101 different Govern-
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

ment, university, and other libraries throughout the country to which
1,493 books and periodicals were sent as interlibrary loans.

The library, in turn, borrowed 1,398 books from the Library of
Congress, many of which were Smithsonian Deposit copies, and 297
publications were borrowed from other libraries, chiefly from the
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Army
Medical Library.

Overcrowding and understafling continue to be the library’s most
serious unsolved problems. To find shelf room for new books in
stacks, branches, and sectional libraries already taxed beyond their
normal capacity requires continuous contrivance of makeshift arrange-
ments and rearrangements.

Report of the Executive Committee of the Board of
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution

For the Year Ended June 30, 1951

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your executive committee respectively submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Smithsonian Institution, together with
a statement of the appropriations by Congress for the Government
bureaus in the administrative charge of the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN ENDOWMENT FUND

The original bequest of James Smithson was £104,960 8s. 6d.—
$508,318.46. Refunds of money expended in prosecution of the claim,
freights, insurance, and other incidental expenses, together with pay-
ment into the fund of the sum of £5,015, which had been withheld
during the lifetime of Madame de la Batut, brought the fund to
the amount of $550,000.

Since the original bequest, the Institution has received gifts from
various sources, the income from which may be used for the general
work of the Institution. These, including the original bequest, plus
savings, are listed below, together with the income for the present
year.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Karly in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for con-
struction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his will,
probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to the
estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis&Co. As this stock advanced in
value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the fund

now amounts to $6,613,510.49 in selected securities.

The practice of maintaining savings accounts in several of the
Washington banks and trust companies has been continued during
the past year, and interest on those deposits amounted to $637.64.

In many instances, deposits are made in banks for convenience in
collection of checks, and later such funds are withdrawn and de-
posited in the United States Treasury. Disbursement of funds is
made by check signed by the Secretary of the Institution and drawn
on the United States Treasury.

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the
Institution.

The Institution gratefully acknowledges gifts from the following:
Laura D. Barney, to establish Alice Pike Barney Memorial Fund, for the mainte-

nance and increase of the Alice Pike Barney collection of paintings and puastels

and for the encouragement of American artistic endeavor.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 7, 1951
To THE Boarp OF REGENTS,
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington 25, D. C.

We have examined the accounts of the Smithsonian Institution relative to its
private endowment funds and gifts (but excluding the National Gallery of Art
and other departments, bureaus or operations administered by the Institution
under Federal appropriations) for the year ended June 30, 1951. Our examina-
tion was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and
accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

The Institution maintains its accounts on a cash basis and does not accrue in-
come and expenses. Land, buildings, furniture, equipment, works of art, living and
other specimens and certain sundry property are not included in the accounts of
the Institution.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly the posi-
tion of the private funds and the cash investments thereof of the Smithsonian
Institution at June 30, 1951 (excluding the National Gallery of Art and other
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

departments, bureaus or operations administered by the Institution under the
Federal appropriations) and the cash receipts and disbursements for the year
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on
a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

GENERAL APPENDIX

to the

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1951

161
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
staff members and collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a
general character or on special topics that are of interest or value to
the numerous correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report of 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1951.

Stormy Weather on the Sun’

By WALTER ORR ROBERTS

Superintendent of the High Altitude Observatory, Boulder, Colo.

[With 2 plates]

Astronomy has come a long way from the heyday of ancient Greece
when Socrates admonished the astronomers to stick to their proper
business, the calendar, and advised them that “speculators on the
universe and on the laws of heavenly bodies are no better than mad-
men.” Instruments to observe the sun, likewise, have progressed
far beyond the simple pinhole viewer with which Fabricius watched
the sunspots.

But for all our progress, the sun worries us yet with the many un-
solved riddles of its behavior. We no longer hold, with Aristotle,
that the sun and moon are living beings. But we are still at a loss
to explain many features of its behavior, such as the fact that the
sun’s equator rotates faster than its higher latitudes.

To solve these diverse problems, many of our greatest astronomers
from Galileo’s day to the present have devoted major portions of their
scientific careers to the study of the sun and the features of its at-
mosphere. The growth of our knowledge has been vastly encouraged
by such people as C. G. Abbot of the Smithsonian Institution, G. E.
Hale of Mount Wilson Observatory, Father Secchi of the Vatican,
Sir Norman Lockyer, Robert R. McMath, L. d’Azambuja, C. E. Saint-
John, Bernard Lyot, and many others. And in the course of their
work astronomers have given the name of the sun to a whole class
of new astronomical instruments, such as helioscopes, pyrheliometers,
spectroheliographs, heliometers, heliostats, coronagraphs. As the
years pass, increasingly powerful tools of modern science are brought
to bear upon the sun. And the riddles of its behavior are gradually
yielding to analysis.

The clues to a great number of the mysteries of solar behavior
seem to be locked up in the sun’s atmosphere—in the phenomena that
become spectacularly visible during total solar eclipse. And it is

1Bighteenth James Arthur lecture, given under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion on March 22, 1951.

163
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

for this reason that astronomers trek to distant parts of the globe
from solar eclipse to solar eclipse, and from year to year. From time
immemorial eclipses have interested men. In ancient times they were
greeted by mystic rites, and engendered fear and uncertainty in the
people visited by them.

As with the products of modern science, the results of the ancient
science of eclipse prediction gave to its users information of vast
political significance. And so it was, according to Prof. S. A. Mit-
chell in his book Eclipses of the Sun, that an ancient Chinese imperial
edict charged the court astronomers with the responsibility for pre-
dicting all solar eclipses. It appears, however, that in approximately
2000 B. C. the astronomers Hsi and Ho let their calendars fall into
disorder, became dead drunk, and then were caught unawares by
the occurrence of a solar eclipse. For this it seems that the un-
fortunate royal astronomers were put to death. Modern astronomers,
happily, have an easier time. They predict their eclipses with auto-
matic calculators, and, furthermore, have devised many types of
astronomical instruments with which to observe the eclipse features
of the sun by artificial means.

At a total eclipse, features of the sun that are normally invisible
show up spectacularly. By extensive study of these eclipse features,
modern astronomers are making great progress in attacking the un-
solved problems of the sun. But let me turn first to a discussion
of some of the basic facts about the sun.

The sun interests astronomers particularly because it is the near-
est star to earth. It is the only star close enough for them to study
in great detail. All other stars in the sky appear as mere pinpoints
of light, even in the most powerful telescopes. But on the sun, in-
dividual features are readily distinguishable, and we can gain a rela-
tively intimate view of what goes on in a rather typical star.

As far as we on earth are concerned, the sun is distinguished pri-
marily by proximity. By comparison with the other stars, it is a
rather undistinguished body. It is neither extremely large nor
strikingly small. It is midway within our realm of experience as
to brightness, color, chemical composition, and many other char-
acteristics. Fortunately for us it is also a very stable star, not
partaking of the violent excursions that characterize some of the stars
we have studied in detail. The sun is a mere 93 million miles away.
The nearest other star we know of is more than 200,000 times farther
from us. Its proximity makes the sun by far the most important
source of energy available to man. This tremendous available reserve
of heat, light, and other radiations provides a climate and environ-
ment favorable for life as we know it here on the earth.
STORMY WEATHER ON THE SUN—W. O. ROBERTS 165

The sun is an enormously large sphere of gas. Nowhere within
it do we know of solids or liquids. Its diameter is approximately
864,000 miles. ‘The visible surface or “photosphere” glows with an
intense yellow-white light. The temperature of the photosphere, ac-
cording to several independent methods of estimation, is about 6,000°
K. (centigrade absolute). But as you go down toward the center of
the enormous sphere of gas, the temperature mounts rapidly ; probably
near the center it reaches values as high as 25,000,000° K. There near
the nucleus the pressures reach perhaps to tens of millions of tons per
square inch, and the gaseous material is compressed till its density is
probably more than 10 times that of a bar of iron. Our knowledge
of the interior conditions depends upon theoretical researches of the
very highest quality carried out by such people as Lane, Eddington,
Jeans, Russell, and Chandrasekhar, just to mention a few of the many
who have worked profitably in this field of analysis. It is here in the
depths that the atomic energy derived from nuclear fusion supplies
the sun with its heat. It is here in the depths that the fuel hydrogen
is “burned” by atomic fusion, leaving the ash, helium, as the end
product.

Lying directly on the surface, and cooled by processes as yet not
fully understood, are the giant sunspots. These huge, dark, irregular
spots fluctuate in size and number with the also-mysterious 11-year
solar cycle. They are the focus of extensive and intense magnetic
fields from which are emitted potent corpuscular streams that fly
out into space. Perhaps even cosmic rays are born in or near these
giant blemishes on the sun’s smooth face.

The transition layer between the spotted surface of the sun and the
solar atmosphere has many interesting properties. It may seem queer
that a body like the sun, which is entirely gaseous, can have a sharply
defined edge, so that it shows up in a telescope just as clearly as though
it were the edge of the moon. Yet this is the way the edge of the sun
looks. The theory of this behavior and of the rapid transitions of
the opacity of the sun’s gases near the surface layers has been studied
by many investigators, including E. A. Milne of England, who recently
died after a brilliant and useful scientific career. At the edge of the
sun, a mere 20 miles or so carries us from regions where the gases are
nearly opaque out to the tenuous and transparent gases that charac-
terize the solar atmosphere. This short distance carries us from the
dense regions, where the spectrum of the sun consists of a continuum of
light of all colors, out to the region where the gases show the bright line
spectrum that is characteristic of tenuous gases. Much of the success of
modern solar astrophysics depends upon observations of the spectrum
lines of the nearly transparent atmosphere, and also of the absorption
spectrum formed just above the opaque surface of the sun by the rela-
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

tively cool gases of the transitional layer to which we ascribe the term
“reversing layer.”

It is the transparent gaseous region above the opaque photospheric
surface that shows so spectacularly at eclipses. The radiating gases
of this zone, shining both by faint continuous light and by intense
monochromatic light, form one of the principal realms of study for
modern astrophysical devices, and comprise the objective of most of
the work of astronomers who travel to distant lands to be present at
the brief moments of total eclipse.

The intercession of the moon between the earth and the sun at a
total eclipse gives us a unique opportunity to observe the faint atmos-
pheric gases above the sun without the overpoweringly distracting
effects of the light of the photosphere. Normally, the light from the
face of the sun so intensely illuminates the atmosphere of the earth
that the gases above the surface of the sun make no impression at all
upon our viewing instruments. But at eclipse we are unhindered by
this normal handicap, and are able to take photographs and spectro-
grams that reveal the very remarkable characteristics of the sun’s
atmosphere.

The very transparency of the atmosphere makes it accessible to
study. Wecan see through it, and thus we can study what goes on in
it. By virtue of the fact that its light is radiated, for the most part, in
cliscrete lines of the spectrum, we can study any one constituent of its
gaseous atmosphere quite independently from the others. The interior
workings of the sun are screened off from view by the very opacity of
the photosphere of the sun, so that we cannot glimpse beneath the su-
perficial markings of the sunspots and the other surface features, such
as the faculae, and the granulations. To be sure, we study the surface
markings in all possible detail, and have learned many remarkable
things from these studies—as, for example, the completely unexplained
equatorial acceleration discovered many years ago by the English
astronomer Carrington. This baffling acceleration causes the sun’s
equator to turn a full revolution in a shorter time than do the higher
solar latitudes. People in the path of a total eclipse become acutely
aware in the final minutes before totality of the rapid diminution of the
brightness of the sunlight illuminating the landscape. But the truly
spectacular phenomena do not appear until the final climax, known
technically as “second contact,” when the moon finally cuts out all
the light from the photosphere, leaving only the atmosphere in view.
The first thing that one sees is the striking effect of the “Baily’s Beads,”
which result from the tiny portions of the bright photosphere that
shine through the depressions of the moon’s surface where there are
craters with low areas in the line of sight. Then immediately fol-
lowing comes the brilliant “chromospheric flash.”
STORMY WEATHER ON THE SUN—W. 0. ROBERTS 167

This brilliant flash of light was first described in detail by a Cap-
tain Stannyan, who traveled to an eclipse in Berne, Switzerland,
around the year 1700. For some time astronomers believed it to
be a glow in the lunar atmosphere. Many years later, Sir Norman
Lockyer, at the suggestion of his friend, Dr. Sharpey, attached the
name “chromosphere” to this solar layer, because, in his words, “it is
the region in which all the various and beautiful color phenomena are
seen.” The flash of red light results from the bright emission of
the spectral line Ha of hydrogen glowing intensely in the thin layer
of incandescent gases of the chromosphere.

This chromosphere, transparent in some colors, opaque in others, is
one of the principal objects of modern solar research. In it are
tied up many of the problems of the definition and evaluation of
solar temperatures. Because of it and the need to understand its phys-
ical properties, large radio receivers of special design operating at
radar frequencies and designed to pick up the radio emanations
of the chromosphere, will, for example, travel to Khartoum in the
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, for the eclipse of February 25, 1952, just as
they traveled to Attu Island in 1950. With these receivers, scientists
from the Naval Research Laboratory will make temperature determi-
nations for comparison with optical measurements that will be made
simultaneously at the eclipse. In the past there have been great
discrepancies between optical temperature determinations and those
made from radio observations. This shows that we have here a
major problem worthy of careful study.

The chromospheric flash lasts a mere 2 or 3 seconds. After that,
the chromosphere gases remain obscured until just a second or two
before the end of totality. Then all the phenomena appear again in
reverse order. During the totality, which may last from a few seconds
to nearly 8 minutes, many other features of the sun’s atmosphere can
be studied. The principal of these are the solar prominences and
corona. They differ greatly in appearance and physical composition.

The prominences are huge clouds of solar atmospheric gases, extend-
ing high above the photosphere. They exhibit fascinating, jagged,
irregular shapes that change rapidly but that display regularities
that astrophysicists look upon today as revealing clues to their expla-
nation. They, like the chromosphere, shine with an intense rosy
color—characteristic of the Hea line of the spectrum of incandescent
hydrogen, one of their principal chemical constituents. Plate 1, figure
1, shows a typical solar prominence of large dimension at the south-
west limb of the sun on June 4, 1946. The prominences consist of
gases probably nearly identical in composition with the chromosphere,
even though the proportions of the various constituents probably
differ.

The giant prominence clouds are supported in delicate equilibrium
against the powerful forces of gravitation, more than 25 times as
potent as terrestrial graviation. What holds the prominences up has
long been a matter of major astronomical concern. Now it seems that
we can say, thanks to the recent work of Donald H. Menzel, of the
Harvard College Observatory, that they are supported in large part
by the magnetic fields of the sun. We can also say that the thousands
of tons of gaseous hydrogen, helium, and other gases in the promi-
nences are constrained to move generally parallel to the lines of force
of the magnetic fields of the solar atmosphere. Menzel’s work indi-
cates that prominences probably become luminescent as they are af-
fected by powerful compressive forces generated in the presence of
streams of prominence gases. The reason for the very complex shape
and appearance of the prominences is to be found, according to the
new theory, in the complex structure of the magnetic fields surround-
ing sunspots. Initial deformities in the magnetic fields may be fur-
ther aggravated by the gravitational and other forces that also af-
fect prominences, once they come into being. Menzel’s new theories
have resulted in part from his extensive studies of prominence motion
pictures, most of them photographed at our High Altitude Observa-
tory station at Climax, Colo.

The corona, on the other hand, surrounds the eclipsed sun like a
giant halo; it radiates a soft pearly-white light. Today we know
that the corona is no simple phenomenon, but that it consists of sev-
eral components. Recent work has carried us far toward under-
standing the different constituents of the corona, while, on the other
hand, spectroscopic studies have told much in detail about the ele-
ments from which originate the bright-line spectrum that makes up
a significant part of the corona’s light.

It was a mere 11 years ago that the distinguished Swedish astron-
omer Bengt Edlén first succeeded in establishing that the long-known
lines of the coronal spectrum arise from gaseous iron, nickel, and
calcium, at fantastically high temperatures. The story of the iden-
tification of these lines of the spectrum, long believed due to some
mysterious nonterrestrial element called “coronium,” is a fascinating
one, but too long for telling here.

The coronal gases described above form one of the three principal
components of the corona, but they do not explain its soft pearly-
white light. That, in turn, is not simple either. Researches of the
postwar years have succeeded in identifying it as consisting of at
least two components, the so-called “electron corona” and the “dust
corona.” One of these is not solar, in the strictest sense. The former
is made of streams of electrons in the sun’s atmosphere which are so
numerous as to scatter the brilliant sunlight that passes through them,
STORMY WEATHER ON THE SUN—W. 0. ROBERTS 169

so that even though the bright face of the sun is obscured, some of
its light is scattered toward us from the clouds of electrons near the
sun. The electrons move so fast that the well-known absorption
lines of the spectrum of sunlight are smoothed away by the Doppler
effect. Also the light scattered by the electrons is polarized, in exact
and gratifying accordance with optical theory.

The “dust corona,” on the other hand, has recently been deduced
independently by van de Hulst of Holland and Allen of Australia.
These two astrophysicists agree in attributing it to particles between
the sun and the earth. Of course, they cannot be too near the sun,
because there the particles would all be vaporized by the heat. The
dust corona, then, is not really a part of the sun at all. It is a sort
of dust halo only apparently radiating from the sun and is perfectly
symmetrical, unlike the electron corona, which exhibits pronounced
streamers in some directions and which changes in shape with changes
in solar activity as the electron streams change their density.

Measurement of the absolute brightness, the spectrum, the inten-
sity changes, the brightness in different colors, the relations of coro-
nal structure to surface features—these and many other important
scientific problems provide the incentives for eclipse research.

But eclipses are rare events, and their locations often difficult to
reach. Weather vagaries increase the hazards of eclipse observing.
On the average, less than one total eclipse a year takes place on the
earth, and even then it lasts for just a few minutes at any given loca-
tion. It is expensive and risky, however valuable, to travel to eclipses
for scientific studies.

Thus, it is no wonder that many famous astronomers have tradi-
tionally directed their efforts to observing the atmosphere of the sun
without total eclipses. The first real success came in Guntoor, India,
on August 19, 1868, when P. C. Jules Janssen, of France, the day
after a famous solar eclipse that he had gone to India to observe,
first placed the slit of a powerful spectroscope at the very edge of the
sun and looked successfully for the appearance of the lines of the
spectrum of solar prominences at the sun’s edge. Today many
observatories operate spectroheliographs that are the direct descend-
ants of Janssen’s experiment. Most notable are those at the McMath-
Hulbert Observatory in Michigan, at Mount Wilson in California,
at Greenwich in England, at Meudon in France, and at Kodaikanal
in India.

Nor is it any wonder that the success of Janssen, soon duplicated
independently by Lockyer of England, stimulated others to try to
observe the coronal spectrum by similar means. Today we know why
the corona did not yield to the same method but withheld its feeble
light from noneclipse research until the brilliant efforts of Bernard
Lyot of France were crowned with success in 1930.
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

Lyot invented an entirely new type of solar telescope—the Lyot
coronagraph. It permits the unwanted light from the sun’s face to
be excluded from the final viewing eyepiece or film of the telescope,
but allows the light from the corona to come through undiminished.
The photographs of solar phenomena illustrating this article are all
taken with the Lyot-type coronagraph of the High Altitude Observ-
atory of Harvard University and the University of Colorado at
Climax, Colo. Figure 1 illustrates the principles of the corona-
graph and explains in brief terms why it works. The coronagraph
is one of the most important new research instruments developed
during our century, and it ranks in importance with the classic work
of Lockyer and Janssen.

Today, scattered throughout the world, are coronagraphs of the
Lyot type. These permit their users to photograph prominences
and corona on all suitably clear days. I say “suitably” because the
standards of clarity are stringent. Coronagraphs have to be located
at high elevations in the mountains, and the slightest trace of atmos-
pheric dust or smoke blanks out their operation.

But what of the results from the operation of the instruments de-
rived from the pioneering of Janssen and of Lyot? The results make
up a major part of our knowledge of the sun and its variability.
Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas of knowledge.

First of all, perhaps, in potential practical importance for man is
our growing knowledge of the influences of the sun on the weather.
At the Smithsonian Institution, for example, pioneering work has
long gone on. Other groups as well have devoted much effort to the
problem. Not only have C. G. Abbot, H. H. Clayton, H. C. Willett,
and others worked intensively on these problems, but the more recent
work of a man-and-wife team, the Duells, has uncovered a most un-
expected direct relationship between certain outbursts of solar activ-
ity and the trend of barometric pressures at terrestrial stations. This
problem has just been made the subject of over a year of most inten-
sive study by Richard A. Craig, of the Harvard College Observatory,
working closely with us at the High Altitude Observatory. In spite
of the fact that the field of solar-terrestrial correlation studies is one
filled with pitfalls, Craig seems to have demonstrated beyond ques-
tion the reality of the fact that solar activity tends to have a direct
and statistically significant effect on terrestrial atmospheric pressure
changes.

We have long known, from the pioneering studies of A. E. Douglass
of Arizona, the relationship between tree-growth rings and sunspot
activity. In fact, the relationship now gives us one of the main meth-
ods of dating the wood of Indian pueblo ruins. The cause? Still
unknown. And, of course, the relation between sunspot activity

Ficure 1.—The operating principles of the coronagraph are illustrated in this schematic
diagram of the High Altitude Observatory coronagraph. Lyot, inventor of the corona-
graph, found that sunlight scattered into the image of an ordinary telescope from the
following sources rendered such telescopes useless for artificial eclipse photography:

(1) Diffraction of light from the edges of the objective lens cell.

(2) Reflection from the second face of the objective lens to the first, and then a second
reflection back into the instrument.

(3) Diffraction around dust particles and imperfections of the objective lens.

Any one of the three sources is enough, usually, to render an ordinary telescope useless
for coronal photography. The first two may be eliminated completely and simply. The
third may be reduced by employing the very highest skill in making the telescope objective
and in cleaning it. Diffraction at the edges of the objective lens can be eliminated by
placing a diaphragm (A) with a sharp edge in front of the objective, and by means of the
field lens focusing an image of this diaphragm (thus focusing the diffracted light) on
diaphragm B, just in front of the camera lens. If diaphragm B is slightly smaller than the
image of diaphragm A, all scattered light from the first source will be eliminated. The
multiple reflections from the objective form a small image of the sun very near the objective
lens. This small image, since it lies near diaphragm A, will then be focused by the field
lens at a position near diaphragm B. If a small opaque screen is placed on the camera
lens, at its center, the small solar image formed by multiple reflections will be focused
upon it by the field lens, and thus prevented from reaching the 35-mm. camera film.

In normal operation the coronagraph, thus, works as follows: The objective lens images
the sun and its corona at the position of the occulting disk; at that point the light from
the face of the sun is blocked by the occulting disk. The camera lens then images the
artificially eclipsed sun on the 35-mm. camera film. In an alternative arrangement, a
mirror located beyond the field lens can be used to direct the image into the spectrograph.
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

and the outbreak of “northern lights,” as well as erratic disturbances
to the aiming of delicate compasses, has been a matter of widespread
knowledge for perhaps a century or more. With the advent of radio
we have learned that the passage of a large spot group past the central
meridian of the sun generally heralds by about one day the onset of
poor long-distance radio reception. In recent years the origin of
many seemingly cyclical phenomena have been blamed on the sunspots.
Such things, for example, as business cycles and the quality of wines
have been suspected of cyclical variations in phase with the sunspot
changes. Most of these speculative suspected correlations I regard
as inadequately substantiated.

More recently we have gained undeniable evidence of a whole gamut
of new and unexpected influences of sun on earth. Theory tells us
that these new influences ought to be intimately associated with the
solar atmosphere, even though our observational studies have not yet
revealed the clues that allow us to explain what we observe. The work
of the Australian radio-scientists Pawsey, Yabsley, Payne-Scott, Wild,
and others, supplemented by work in England by Ryle, in France by
Denisse, in the United States by Reber, Burrows, Hagen, and by still
others, has indicated to us that the sun is, at times, a powerful trans-
mitter of very short-wave radio pulses, sometimes thousands of times
as powerful as we seem to be able to explain. Here is one of the most
fertile new fields of research. And it has potential significance of a
most practical sort. One scientist, Kiepenheuer of the Fraunhofer In-
stitute in Germany, even. goes so far as to speculate tentatively that
substantial effects on the rate of growth of plants and animals may
occur when the solar radiations at radio wavelengths of about 1 meter
grow abnormally intense.

The known effects on radio reception have given birth to a whole
science of radio-propagation prediction and analysis. Work of this
sort makes up one of the main tasks of the Central Radio Propagation
Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standardsin Washington. The
activity of the sun is the principal sustaining source not only of the
radio-reflecting layers so intensively studied at that laboratory but also
of the day-to-day and hour-to-hour changes in the character of those
layers predicted at the National Bureau of Standards. The sun, ac-
cording to the studies done there, behaves in a far more complex fashion
than a simple luminous sphere of gas at the established solar surface
temperature of 6,000° Kelvin. Brilliant prominences known as “solar
flares” for example, can send radiation to the earth with the velocity
of light that in turn can cause a complete blackout of long-distance
radio communications on the entire sunlit hemisphere of the earth—
the well-known “Dellinger effect” first noted by the pioneer in radio
propagation analysis, J. H. Dellinger.
STORMY WEATHER ON THE SUN—W. 0. ROBERTS 173

The coronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory has been op-
erated at Climax ever since it was first established there in 1940 by
Donald H. Menzel. This instrument has played a modest but import-
ant role in our study of thesun. For example, work conducted jointly
by Alan Shapley, then of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and myself in the years of the
last war, led us to uncover a new relationship between the bright re-
gions of the sun’s coronal emission as determined from spectra of the
sun’s limb (see pl. 1, fig. 2) and the behavior of magnetic storms, with
their associated aurorae, erratic compass-aiming, and the related dis-
turbances of radio communications. We found that during the years
of minimum sunspot activity, whenever a region of very bright coronal
emission passed the east edge of the sun, moved along by the 27-day ro-
tation of the sun, it tended to produce magnetic storms 2 or 3 days later.
These storms thus occurred when the coronal emission presumably re-
sponsible for the disturbance was still located in the east half of the
sun’s face. So far, we are at a loss to explain why the corona should
be in this preferred location on the sun at the time of producing its
maximum effects.

Another discovery made with the Climax coronagraph was that of
the tiny chromospheric spicules. These spicules are tiny jetlike prom-
inences of very short lifetime and very simple structure. I first noted
these tiny prominences in 1942, and found them to be most pronounced
in the regions of the poles of the sun, where the normal prominence
activity is very minor. The spicules seemed to be consistently directed
outward, along radii from the center of the sun. A typical spicule,
like that shown in plate 2, forms as a little bubble which then bursts
and jets outward to a height of perhaps 10,000 miles. The entire life-
time of a spicule lasts only something like 4 minutes on the average.
The spicules seem the only major evidence of prominence activity that
transports mechanical energy consistently in the outward direction
through the solar surface to the atmosphere of the sun. We think
that perhaps their role in the heating of the sun’s corona may be sig-
nificant. Also from the Climax coronagraph have come many thou-
sands of feet of motion-picture films of prominences. These films,
similar to the excellent pictures taken with the spectroheliograph at
the McMath-Hulbert Observatory, and taken by means of the motion-
picture technique developed by McMath, show very graphically the
violence of the behavior of the gigantic solar “storms” that charac-
terize solar “weather.” These motion-picture films, as I have already
stated, form the main body of observational material used by Menzel
in deriving his new theories for the activity of the stormy atmosphere
of the sun.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

And finally, just to mention a few of the major new fields of work
with the Climax coronagraph, we are paying great attention to the
regions from which a still-unidentified line of the sun’s corona comes.
This unidentified line is the yellow coronal line at 5694 A. This is
the only major line of the coronal spectrum that is still not certainly
identified. Edlén has stated that it may be calcium in a very high
state of ionization. If Edlén’s identification is correct, it demands
the highest temperature of all the lines of the sun’s corona, up in the
millions of degrees Kelvin. But the remarkable thing that our spec-
trograms show, and that is also confirmed in the observations of Wald-
meier with the coronagraph in Switzerland, is that the yellow coronal
line is excited in close association with certain very intensely active
and rapidly moving prominences. ‘These prominences associated
with the yellow coronal line are invariably of special form known as
the “sunspot” type. It seems highly likely that the excitation of
the yellow coronal line is in some way related to the formation of the
explosive solar flares that produce instantaneous and drastic influences
on long-distance radio communications over the entire sunlit hemi-
sphere of the earth whenever they are very large. At the present time
we have a program of work under way that should lead us to definite
conclusions about this strange relationship between the sun’s corena
and the activity of its prominences. Just where this work will finally
take us we do not yet know.

For the astronomer, the basic science of the physical conditions of
the solar atmosphere is fully as interesting as the applications. And
so today a host of people work daily at the study of the temperatures,
pressures, gas densities, and other physical conditions of the sun’s
chromosphere, corona, and prominences. From their research will
come ever-expanding knowledge. No matter how improbable it may
seem today, this knowledge will rapidly find practical application
in some new activity of importance to man. If only we can stabilize
sufficiently the political affairs of our planet, we have a long and
profitable time ahead of us for the exploration of the nearest star,
our sun.

An Appraisal of Cloud Seeding as a Means

of Increasing Precipitation’

By Henry G. Houcuton

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Tue tremendous economic implications of the artificial control of
rainfall have led to overoptimistic statements in the public press and
to ill-advised commercial applications of rain-making techniques by
persons who do not possess the necessary technical qualifications.
These events have been viewed with concern by all responsible mete-
orologists. It is unfortunate that much of the money which has been
spent by public and private agencies in an effort to increase precip-
itation in specific areas has contributed so little to our scientific under-
standing of the processes involved. Without adequate scientific
information it is impossible to determine, with any assurance, the
economic value of cloud seeding or to prescribe the most favorable
conditions and procedures.

As in the case of all scientific research, the several groups and
individuals who are working in this field have criticized one another’s
experiments and interpretations. This normal scientific interchange
has been unduly accentuated by the glare of publicity which has caused
some of those concerned to be more dogmatic than is justifiable in
view of the present incomplete information. In the view of the public
the meteorological world has been divided into believers and non-
believers. This is an unfortunate and ridiculous concept. The fact
is simply that the information at hand is not sufficient to permit an
unequivocal conclusion regarding the possibilities of the artificial
control of precipitation.

It is the purpose of this paper to assess the seeding techniques for
stimulating precipitation on the basis of present scientific information
and to point out the more significant gaps in our knowledge. The
writer has not been associated with any of the research groups in this
field but has kept himself informed through the literature and per-
sonal contact with many of the active investigators. For the sake of

brevity and continuity no specific references will be made to papers
and reports describing the results of seeding experiments. The sum-
mary of the results as required for the present discussion is well known
to most readers. Those who wish to read the original accounts are
referred to the excellent bibliography recently published (1).2 It is
not the intent of the writer to attempt to refute or support specific
claims of individuals; rather it is proposed to survey the subject as
impersonally as possible. Lack of complete information makes the
inclusion of certain personal opinions of the writer inevitable.

METHODS AND RESULTS

Modern rain making owes its origin to the discovery by Schaefer (2)
that the insertion of dry ice or any object colder than about —40° C.
into a supercooled water-drop cloud converts the cloud to ice crystals.
Later Vonnegut (3) showed that the same result could be obtained by
introducing tiny crystals of silver iodide, which are presumed to act
as sublimation nuclei because of the dimensional similarity of the
crystal lattices of silver iodide and ice. The mechanism by which dry
ice forms ice crystals is still in debate, as is the whole problem of
sublimation nuclei, but it is a demonstrable fact that either agent will
convert a supercooled cloud to an ice cloud. Knowledge of the mech-
anism of ice- crystal formation is desirable, however, for an estimate
of the number of ice crystals created by a known amount of the
nucleating agent.

The application of the nucleating agents to rain making is based on
the Bergeron-Findeisen ice-crystal theory of precipitation. Accord-
ing to this theory, all moderate to heavy precipitation is initiated by
the appearance of a few ice crystals in a supercooled cloud. By virtue
of the fact that the vapor pressure over ice is less than that over water
at temperatures below freezing, the ice crystals grow by sublimation
at the expense of the supercooled water drops. If the number of ice
crystals is very small compared to the number of water drops, the ice
crystals will become large enough to fall. After further growth by
sublimation and collision they leave the cloud as precipitation ele-
ments. It was suggested that many natural supercooled clouds do
not release precipitation because of a failure by nature to provide ice
crystals. The use of the newly discovered methods for producing
ice crystals in a supercooled cloud to initiate precipitation in such
clouds was a logical step.

The reported results of cloud-seeding experiments have been quite
diverse. Ina vast majority of the tests there has been visible evidence
of the transformation of supercooled clouds to ice crystals. It seems
safe to conclude that the occasional absence of such effects has been

due to poor observing conditions or to the choice of a cloud which
either was not sufficiently supercooled or was already composed of ice
crystals. Nucleation of stratiform clouds often leads to the produc-
tion of “valleys” or “canyons” and occasionally to the formation of
holes through which the ground may be seen. Holes seem to occur
most often when the cloud deck is relatively thin. The effect of the
seeding is observed to progress laterally from the seeding line, often
reaching a width of 1 to 2 miles in 30 to 50 minutes. Precipitation
in the form of virga is a common observation, but only rarely does
any precipitation reach the surface from stratiform clouds.

The observational evidence on the effects of seeding cumulus clouds
is extremely varied. Again there is evidence that seeding converts the
supercooled portions to ice crystals, but observation is much more
difficult. It appears that some cumulus clouds dissipate when seeded,
some are little affected, and, occasionally, accelerated vertical develop-
ment results. Reports on precipitation range from none to very heavy.
It is extremely difficult to say whether the precipitation results from
seeding or from natural processes independent of the seeding. Obser-
vations made in a few cases of the elapsed time between seeding and the
appearance of the precipitation are reasonably consistent, suggesting
a cause-and-effect relationship. The data suggest that small cumulus
clouds are usually partially or completely dissipated by seeding. It
appears that the seeding of more active cumulus clouds often results in
virga or light precipitation and, vely occasionally, in heavier pre-
cipitation. Claims have been made that the seeding of large cumulus
clouds under proper conditions may lead to the development of wide-
spread precipitation. Very few cases of this type have been reported.

Langmuir (4) has suggested that “warm” clouds, in which the ice
nuclei can have no effect, may be induced to precipitate by seeding
them with water. The injected water drops grow as they fall by
colliding with the cloud drops. If the cloud is deep and wet with
strong updrafts the drops may grow to such size that they will rupture.
The broken portions might then be carried up in the updraft so that
the process would become self-sustaining. The conditions requisite
for the operation of this process are likely to be those that lead to
natural precipitation. A few tests of water seeding have been made
but results are still inconclusive. There is little question that injected
water drops will grow by collision and fall out as rain but there is
reason to doubt that the continuing process visualized by Langmuir
can operate except in clouds that are ready to release precipitation
from natural causes. Because of the lack of adequate tests of this
method and the more widespread interest in seeding with ice nuclei,
no further discussion of the water-seeding process will be undertaken
here.

ARTIFICIAL NUCLEI

Taken by itself the observational evidence, reviewed very briefly
above, does not constitute an adequate basis for a sound appraisal of
the potentialities of the cloud-seeding techniques. It is the purpose
of this paper to amplify and supplement the observational evidence
with the aid of existing knowledge of cloud physics and synoptic
meteorology. It is considered that both the laboratory and flight ex-
periments prove beyond any reasonable doubt that dry ice and silver
iodide will both convert a supercooled water cloud to an ice-crystal
cloud. The only necessary condition is that the cloud temperature be
a few degrees below the freezing point. For silver iodide, Vonnegut
(5) states that the maximum temperature is near —4° C.; dry ice has
been shown to cause ice crystals to appear at —0.7° C. (6), but the
temperature should be low enough to allow an appreciable difference
between the vapor pressures over water and ice. There is no reason to
doubt that ice crystals will grow in a supercooled cloud. The size
attained by the crystals is dependent on their number, the initial liquid
water content of the cloud, the temperature and the depth of the super-
cooled portion of the cloud. It is an essential feature of the Bergeron-
Findeisen precipitation theory that the number of ice crystals be small
compared to the number of supercooled drops; otherwise the terminal
size of the ice crystals would be of the same order as that of the cloud
drops and no precipitation would ensue. There is no satisfactory
information on the number of ice crystals produced by dry ice. The
estimate of Langmuir (7) that one pellet of dry ice forms 10’* ice
nuclei would imply concentrations of the order of 10° nuclei/cm* even
if the nuclei produced by a few pounds of dry ice were distributed
through several cubic miles of cloud. Quantitative estimates of the
number of nuclei produced by silver-iodide generators have been made,
but it is nearly impossible to estimate their concentration in the cloud
after release. Atmospheric seeding experiments have resulted in the
formation of precipitation elements with a wide range of seeding
rates. The inference is either that a much smaller number of nuclei
is formed than has been estimated or that there is a marked selective
action such that only a small fraction of the nuclei become ice crystals.
If the latter is true, the situation would be analogous to natural con-
densation in which only a small fraction of the total number of con-
densation nuclei become cloud drops. It is not intended to imply that
overseeding is impossible, but it appears that this has seldom been an
important factor in the seeding experiments which have been reported.
When dry-ice pellets are dropped the initial seeding is in a vertical
plane from which the ice crystals appear to diffuse laterally. It
would be expected that the concentration of “seeds” would be a maxi-
mum at the center and would decrease rapidly on either side. If
CLOUD SEEDING—HOUGHTON 179

overseeding occurs anywhere it should be found along the seeding line,
There is no convincing evidence of overseeding in this region.

It may be concluded that it is often possible to release some precipi-
tation from supercooled clouds by seeding them. The pertinent ques-
tion is how much precipitation can be released in this way which would
not fall from natural causes. If the answer to this in unfavorable,
it is still important to know whether the time of release of precipita-
tion and the total precipitation can be altered by seeding.

Unless the seeded cloud is replenished, the upper limit to the pre-
cipitation is determined by the total liquid water contained in a verti-
cal column through the cloud. Measurements indicate that a liquid
water content of 1 g/m is rather a high value. If all the water in a
cloud 10,000 feet deep of this water content were deposited as rain,
the total rainfall would be about one-eighth of an inch. This is
clearly an overestimate, since it is not likely that all the water could be
precipitated and some would evaporate before reaching the ground.
Most clouds would contain less water than has been assumed in this
example. It is concluded that, unless the cloud is continuously re-
plenished, the precipitation released by seeding will be very light
and the cloud will be partially or completely dissipated by the re-
moval of its water. Stratiform clouds have released practically no
precipitation when seeded, as would be expected in view of their small
total water content.

THERMODYNAMIC EFFECTS

It is next in order to consider the ways in which seeding might
stimulate the growth and replenishment of the cloud. The phase
transformation induced by the seeding releases the latent heat of fu-
sion and the latent heat of sublimation of the water vapor which
sublimes as a result of the lower equilibrium vapor pressure over
ice. The exact value of the resultant temperature rise of the air
depends on the initial temperature, the air density, and the liquid
water content, but for a typical case it is of the order of 1° C. It is
important to note that this heating occurs only in the supercooled
portion of the cloud and that the temperature rise ordinarily increases
with elevation. To be really effective the heating should occur in
the lower part of the cloud and below the cloud base. Unless there
is a temperature inversion of 1° C. or more, the heating will produce
accelerated vertical motion in the supercooled portion with a maxi-
mum near the cloud top. As a consequenee, there will be horizontal
inflow above the freezing level. It is probable that a small pressure
fall will ensue with a correspondingly small horizontal inflow into
the column below the freezing level. None of these effects will induce
additional vertical motion below the freezing level since they do not
180 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

provide buoyancy forces in the lower levels. Air cannot be “sucked”
up but must be driven up by a force applied to each element of the
air column. There will be a tendency for the supercooled portion of
the cloud to separate from the portion below the freezing level. Un-
less the environment above this level is very moist and the lapse rate
steep, it is doubtful that there will be any marked growth of the upper
portion of the cloud. If there is to be an acceleration of the cloud
development as a result of the heat released by seeding, a natural
convective circulation must be active in the lower layers. If this
natural convection has been terminated somewhere above the freezing
level by a small inversion or a slightly stable lapse rate, the heat re-
leased by seeding may extend the convective activity upward. This
requires rather special conditions. It may be remarked that a tempera-
ture rise of 1° C. in the upper portion of a cloud is not very impressive
when viewed on an adiabatic chart. The evaporation of the solid
carbon-dioxide pellets will cause the cooling of the air through which
they pass. This will cause localized subsidence, but in view of the
small amounts of carbon dioxide used this cooling will have little
effect after the first few seconds.

An effect similar to the heating discussed above will result if the
liquid water of the supercooled cloud is caused to precipitate. This
removal of mass will result in an upward accleration. It is easy to
show that the removal of 1 g of water per cubic meter will cause the
same vertical acceleration as a temperature rise of about 0.8° C. Note,
however, that the falling precipitation will impose a downward accel-
eration on the lower levels of the cloud. This downward acceleration
will increase as the precipitation elements grow in their fall through
thecloud. It is believed that this downward force of the precipitation
is partly responsible for the downdraft in a mature thunderstorm.
The convective circulation in a thunderstorm is strong enough to main-
tain an upward motion in part of the cloud in spite of the downdraft.
It is hard to see how the release of precipitation from a seeded cloud
can increase the convective circulation.

It is reasonable to conclude that seeding only rarely will stimulate
the vertical development of acloud. In the vast majority of cases dis-
sipative effects are to be expected. These conclusions seem to be borne
out by the results of cloud-seeding tests.

ARTIFICIAL VERSUS NATURAL NUCLEI

The basic premise of the method for the release of precipitation by
seeding is that there is often an insufficient number of natural nuclei of
sublimation or crystallization present in supercooled clouds to initiate
precipitation by the Bergeron-Findeisen mechanism. The regular
existence of supercooled clouds in the atmosphere supports this as-
CLOUD SEEDING—HOUGHTON 181

sumption. Present knowledge of the concentration and properties of
natural nuclei of crystallization and sublimation is incomplete. Super-
cooled clouds are much more frequent than ice-crystal clouds down to
about —10° to —15° C. At lower temperature ice-crystal clouds be-
come more and more frequent although supercooled clouds have been
reported at temperatures at least as low as —35° C. Measurements
of the number of ice crystals appearing in an expansion chamber by
Findeisen and Schultz (8) have indicated that the first crystals appear
in the neighborhood of —7° C. The number of crystals formed was
found to increase slowly as the temperature was lowered. At a tem-
perature variously reported to be from —82° to —42° C. a very large
increase in the number of crystals occurs. Thus, this experimental
evidence is in general accordance with the observed temperature distri-
bution of supercooled clouds. The nuclei introduced by seeding are
active at temperatures of about —5° C. and below. It is well to point
out here that it is not at all certain that ice crystals are a necessary pre-
requisite for natural precipitation. Moderate rain often falls from
tropical clouds that do not extend to the freezing level. The mech-
anism responsible for such precipitation presumably can operate also
in a supercooled cloud although the ice-crystal mechanism is more
effective if the ice crystals are present.

The vertical development of convective clouds is often terminated
by an inversion. If the temperature at the top of such a cloud were
below —5° C. but still not low enough to activate the natural ice nuclei,
seeding might release rain that otherwise would not fall. From the
prior discussion it is evident that the precipitation could be substantial
only if the cloud were also deep and in active development. This is
the most interesting case considered so far. It is difficult to estimate
the frequency of occurrence of the requisite combination of conditions
from the data that are available. Certainly many convective clouds
are topped by inversions at a temperature level of between, say, —5°
and —20° C. but how many of them remain in active development after
they reach the inversion and in how many cases is there a lack of natu-
ral freezing nuclei? Even though it might not be possible to secure
data on the freezing nuclei, a well-designed observational program
should help to answer these questions.

It is of interest to consider whether continuous seeding would be
required to maintain precipitation in the case discussed above. It
has been suggested that when snow crystals are once formed they shed
tiny splinters as they fall, which then serve as very effective sublima-
tion nuclei. If this happens, the process would tend to be self-per-
petuating, after the initial seeding, as long as the circulation was such
as to carry the splinters into the updrafts. Information on splinter-
ing is very incomplete and no definite conclusions can be drawn. It
182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

seems probable that the effectiveness of this process depends on the
form of the snow crystals; the dendritic (feathery) type would ap-
pear to be a much better source of splinters than the columnar and
tabular forms. It has been stated that natural snow often appears to
fall from below the —10° C. level, thus suggesting that something like
the splintering process is active. A more careful study of this might
yield some useful clues, particularly if samples of the snow crystals
could be obtained. If splintering does not occur, continuous seeding
would be required.

SEEDING OF PRECIPITATING CLOUDS

It is next in order to consider the possibility that seeding will alter
the timing or the total amount of precipitation that falls from a
cloud which is about to release precipitation from natural causes.
It is almost impossible to answer this by means of individual seeding
experiments. An objective answer might be obtained by seeding all
potential rain clouds over a well-defined area for a long period of
time (a year or more) and then comparing the precipitation in the
area to that in similar control areas. Even here, there are pitfalls
and the experiment should be very carefully designed in advance by
a competent statistician-meteorologist team.

Evidence has been presented above that the activation temperatures
of the artificially introduced ice nuclei are higher than those of most
of the natural ice nuclei. If an active cloud, which is about to release
precipitation by natural processes, is seeded, the onset of precipitation
may be advanced by the time interval which would be required for
the cloud to grow from the temperature level corresponding to the
activation of the artificial seeds to that of the natural ice nuclei. The
vertical distance between these levels might be of the order of 2 km.
The corresponding time interval might range from say 20 minutes
for an active cumulus to a few hours for frontal cloud systems. This
might provide a means for increasing the precipitation in a selected
area from a given cloud even though the total precipitation from the
cloud were not changed. The net increase of precipitation in a given
area from a large number of clouds would be small because only a
few of them would be in the proper stage of development as they
approached the area. It is possible that the seeding would decrease
the precipitation from the cloud by causing the precipitation elements
to form at a lower level, thus decreasing the total water condensed in
the cloud. It may be concluded that although the time of precipita-
tion may be advanced it would be difficult to obtain any practical ad-
vantage from this prospect except under very special circumstances.

Because of inadequate knowledge of natural precipitation processes
it is not possible to make an unequivocal statement as to whether or
CLOUD SEEDING—HOUGHTON 183

not it is possible to increase the rainfall from a precipitating cloud
by seeding it. Precipitation requires vertical motion and the conse-
quent condensation of water vapor followed by a process which con-
verts the condensed water vapor into larger elements which can fall to
to the ground. A “precipitation efficiency” might be defined as the
ratio of the rainfall to the mass of water vapor in the rising current.
An efficiency of 100 percent could be achieved only if all the water
vapor were condensed and all the condensate were converted to pre-
cipitation. The “precipitation efficiency” can be considered as the
product of a “condensation efficiency” and the efficiency with which
the condensate is converted to precipitation elements. The condensa-
tion efficiency is determined primarily by how far the water vapor
is lifted. The efficiency of conversion of the condensate to precipita-
tion depends on the temperature at which the ice nuclei operate and
on their number. The condensate which is not converted to precipi-
tation finds its way into the downward circulation required by con-
tinuity and is evaporated. Seeding provides ice nuclei which are
active at a lower elevation (higher temperature) than the natural
ice nuclei. If there is an insufficient number of natural ice nuclei
which are active at or above the lowest temperature in the cloud,
seeding might increase the precipitation by reducing the amount of
condensate which would otherwise be lost in the descending branch
of the circulation (increase in the efficiency or conversion). On
the other hand, if there is a sufficient number of natural ice nuclei
which are active at temperatures found within the cloud, seeding
may reduce the precipitation by causing the precipitation mechanism
to operate at a lower level in the cloud where less of the water vapor
will have been condensed (decrease of the condensation efficiency).
Finally, if the splintering mechanism is a regular and effective natural
means of nucleating clouds once precipitation has started, seeding
will have no effect since splinters of ice are the best possible ice nuclei.
Lack of knowledge on the number and type of natural ice nuclei and
on the importance of the splintering effect leaves the answer in doubt.
It is the opinion of the writer that a significant fraction of the con-
densed cloud water is often lost by evaporation in the downward
branches of the circulation. If true, this suggests that the precipi-
tation. can be increased by seeding if the proper number of nuclei
can be introduced in the right place.

It has been suggested that silver-iodide nuclei may be effective at
a considerable distance from the point of release. ‘There is no doubt
that the particles can be transported for considerable distances by
the winds. The particles will diffuse laterally and vertically, thus
infecting an increasing volume of air with a corresponding decrease in
concentration. It is not known with certainty how long the silver-

9814455218
184 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

iodide particles will retain their nucleating ability. The chance
that the nuclei will encounter the proper conditions is evidently
increased by permitting them to diffuse and cover considerable areas.
On the other hand, this makes the task of assessing the results exceed-
ingly difficult. There is little to gain from this technique at least
until more adequate information is available on the effects of seeding
individual clouds under carefully determined meteorological condi-

tions.
LARGE-SCALE EFFECTS

The general conclusion reached so far is that seeding may induce
significant amounts of precipitation only under rather special con-
ditions which are very close to or identical with those that lead to
natural precipitation. Suppose that these conditions are met and
the cloud or clouds are seeded. Under the most ideal conditions the
seeding may result in enhanced convective activity and the release
of precipitation. The amount of precipitation is limited by the
large-scale horizontal transport of water vapor into the area. This
can be increased only by the creation or intensification of a circulation
the size of a cyclone. There is no evidence that local convective ac-
tivity will lead to cyclogenesis. In fact, widespread convective
activity often breaks out in an area characterized by flat pressure
gradients without any subsequent effect on the pressure distribution.
Tt must be admitted that knowledge of the causes and mechanism of
cyclogenesis is incomplete but there is evidence that changes in the
upper troposphere and stratosphere are important. It is difficult
to imagine any influence of seeding at these heights. This is con-
sistent with other evidence which strongly suggests that the location
of cyclogenetical areas is largely determined by the large-scale hemi-
spheric circulation patterns rather than by local effects. If seeding
increases the amount of precipitation it will also result in a proportion-
ate increase in the latent heat released. If a substantial increase in
precipitation could be produced over a large area the latent energy
released would doubtless have an effect on the circulation pattern
though not necessarily in the region of increased rainfall. Natural
precipitation anomalies are much larger than those which might
conceivably be produced by seeding, but even in such cases the effect
of the release of latent energy on the circulation is not clear. In
any discussion of a net increase of rainfall over large areas it is im-
portant to remember that precipitation is only one segment of the
hydrologic cycle. An increase in rainfall requires increased evapo-
ration and a greater transport of water vapor. It may be concluded
that there is little prospect that cloud seeding will produce large-
scale effects in the atmosphere.
CLOUD SEEDING—HOUGHTON 185

The hope that large-scale effects might result from seeding is based
in part on the assumption that large segments of the atmosphere are
often in a metastable condition such that a small impulse will suffice
to release the instability. A logical corollary of this theory is that
the point at which the activity will start spontaneously is indetermi-

nate, but that a small artificial impulse may be sufficient to initiate
the release of the instability at a predetermined point. If this princi-
ple of indeterminancy i is correct, it sets a basic limit on the precision
with which it is possible to eben weather. Most meteorologists
will agree that this principle often seems to hold in the development of
such small-scale phenomena as thunderstorms and tornadoes. This
may be due, of course, to the fact that the scale of these phenomena
is small compared to the spacing of the observations. In the case of
large-scale phenomena there is no real evidence in favor of the inde-
terminancy principle. To be sure, many errors are made in forecasts,
but these appear to be explicable in retrospect when adequate data
are available. The motion of such disturbances seems to be contin-
uous without the erratic behavior to be expected from the indetermi-
nancy principle. Studies of the motion and development of cyclones
strongly suggests a dependence on the large-scale fields of motion
and temperature. These large-scale variations appear to be of much
more importance than any small-scale, accidental differences.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The principal conclusions reached in this paper may be summa-
rized as follows:

1. Seeding of supercooled clouds with dry ice or silver iodide will
convert the clouds to ice-crystal clouds if the temperature is below
about —5°C.

2. Seeding of an inactive cloud will not induce an important
amount of precipitation.

3. Seeding a cloud will not accelerate the growth of the cloud
unless there is active vertical motion below the freezing level and
the environment above the freezing level is moist and only slightly
stable. Partial or complete dissipation is more likely due to the
lifting-off and drying-out of the top of the cloud and the downward
force exerted by the falling hydrometeors.

4. Seeding of an active cloud which does not quite reach the
activation temperature of the natural ice nuclei may release useful
precipitation.

5. It appears possible to advance the onset of precipitation from
a cloud that is about to precipitate from natural causes by seeding it.

6. The possibility of increasing precipitation initiated by natural
processes by seeding cannot be determined because of incomplete
186 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

information about natural precipitation processes. There is at
least some possibility that the precipitation can be increased in cer-
tain cases.

7. The conditions under which it appears possible that seeding
might cause, or increase, precipitation are almost or exactly the
same as those required for the natural release of precipitation.

8. Inasmuch as the most favorable conditions for the augmenta-
tion of precipitation by seeding are almost or exactly the same as
those requisite for natural precipitation, definitive results cannot
be expected from isolated seeding experiments.

9. On the basis of present physical knowledge and synoptic ex-
perience there appears to be no prospect that large-scale effects can
be produced by seeding.

In view of the above conclusions it is considered that attempts at
the practical application of cloud-seeding techniques: to increase nat-
ural rainfall are premature. The entire problem is still in the
research stage, and any funds available should be devoted to research
on the basic mechanisms involved. Useful research results cannot be
expected from personnel without extensive training and experience
in cloud physics and synoptic meteorology.

It is the opinion of the writer that not enough attention has been
paid to the meteorological factors in most of the past cloud-seeding
experiments. It is believed that this omission is in large part respon-
sible for some of the diametrically opposed conclusions of certain
workers in this field.

There are two general approaches to further research in this field:
full-scale experimentation with a properly designed experimental
plan and adequate meteorological data; and detailed studies of cloud
physics, both in the laboratory and in the free atmosphere. If
possible, both approaches should be prosecuted simultaneously. The
second plan is less expensive than the first and promises more funda-
mental results. However, the full-scale experimental trials must be
made in the end since a complete knowledge of cloud physics would
still leave out some important meteorological factors.

In some quarters it is argued that cloud seeding has been a failure
and that further experimentation is unwarranted in view of the high
cost. It must be admitted that the high hopes of weather control
proclaimed by the popular press have not been realized. Nevertheless,
the demonstration that several cubic miles of supercooled cloud can be
converted to ice crystals with a few ounces or pounds of suitable
material is extremely spectacular in the light of previous efforts to
control meteorological processes. This should be sufficient to stim-
ulate further investigation. It is quite possible that further funda-
mental discoveries lie ahead which will not be uncovered unless the
CLOUD SEEDING—HOUGHTON 187

research is allowed to proceed. It is indeed unfortunate that public-
ity and argument have clouded the immediate issue, but this must
not be allowed to obscure the long-range scientific view.

On Einstein’s New Theory’

By Leopoup INFELD

Physics Institute, Warsaw, Poland

In 1905, when our century was still young, Einstein was 26 and
a clerk in the Swiss patent office. In that year he wrote a paper
that changed the face of science. It contained the basic ideas of
Special Relativity Theory and revolutionized the concepts of space
and time. Einstein was the first man on our planet to deduce the
relation between mass and energy—a simple but fundamental relation
that, 40 years later, led to the discovery and utilization of atomic
energy. Thus, 45 years ago, the first Einstein revolution in science
was accomplished.

If Einstein had done nothing since then, his name would live for
centuries in the history of science. Yet only 10 years later, around
1915, Einstein finished his work on General Relativity Theory. Here,
for the first time since Newton, a new theory of gravitation was formu-
lated. This theory explains how the earth attracts the moon, how the
planets move around each other; it explains the structure of our
universe. As a logical system, Einstein’s theory of gravitation is
superior to Newton’s old theory. Whenever the conclusions of New-
ton’s and Einstein’s theories differ, observation—the supreme judge
of all physical theories—seems to favor Einstein’s. Thus, 35 years
ago, the second Einstein revolution in science was accomplished.

The characteristic feature of Einstein’s genius is his complete in-
dependence of mind. He accepts no man’s dogma; he thinks for
himself, always and about everything. From 1918 to 1949, for over
30 years, he has worked on one of the deepest and most diflicult
problems in science: to find a theory that would embrace the large-
scale phenomena (as his old theory of gravitation did) and, at the
same time, the small-scale phenomena concerning the elementary
particles of which atoms are built. Many scientists believed (and
still believe) that so ambitious a plan can never be realized—that the

laws that govern the suns and the nebulae are different from those
that govern the electrons in the atom, that no unifying principle
embracing both is, or ever will be, possible. Yet on this very problem,
Einstein has thought incessantly, finding solutions and rejecting them
because they did not satisfy his high standards of logical simplicity
and beauty. While discussing a theory, Einstein would often re-
mark to me: “Could God have created the world this way?” A good
physical theory, Einstein feels, must reflect the beauty and the glory
of the universe.

In 1949, Einstein was 70 years old. In this year, he believes, he
found the solution for which he strove for 30 years. The results of
his last two decisive steps appeared, one in the Canadian Journal of
Mathematics (published for the Canadian Mathematical Congress
by the University of Toronto Press), the other in a third edition of
“The Meaning of Relativity” (published by the Princeton University
Press).

Did Einstein solve the great problem of finding one law for the
large- and small-scale phenomena? It may be a Jong time before
mathematical analysis and observation pronounce their verdict—
before we find the treasures hidden in Einstein’s new equations. No
one yet knows whether the third Einstein revolution in science has
been accomplished.

THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

To understand, even in general terms, the problem on which Ein-
stein has worked for 30 years, we must go back to the nineteenth
century, to the times of James Clerk Maxwell, who was the first to
create a successful field theory.

From the broadcasting antenna to my radio receiver, the radio
wave—that is, the electromagnetic wave—spreads with the velocity
of light. From the atoms in a neon tube to my eye, optical rays—
that is, an electromagnetic wave—spread with the velocity of light.
Radio and optical waves are governed by the same laws, expressed
by Maxwell’s equations. They tell us how the electromagnetic wave,
or, as we say nowadays, the electromagnetic field, changes in space
and time and what its physical properties are. Maxwell’s theory is
a field theory because it considers changes in time and in our three-
dimensional space. It is very different from a mechanical theory
that deals with such problems as the motion of the moon around the
earth. In a mechanical theory, the particles and their motion are
important; in a field theory, the important factors are changes of a
field in space and time.

If we analyze a piece of gossip we may be interested in the speed
with which this gossip spreads and how far it penetrates. ‘These
EINSTEIN’S NEW THEORY—INFELD 191

would be the “field” aspects of the “gossip phenomenon.” On the
other hand, we may be interested in the men who carry the gossip and
in the mechanics of their actions. These would be the “mechanical”
aspects of the gossip phenomenon.

Yet, in describing the electromagnetic phenomena in the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, we did not use the field concepts alone.
Electrons—that is, negatively charged particles—produce an electro-
magnetic field while in motion. Thus, in Maxwell’s theory, and later
in Lorentz’s theory, we still find a mixture of the field and particle
aspects. Particles (electrons) move in an electromagnetic field and
influence the field by their motion. Yet it is the field aspect that is
the new and predominant feature of Maxwell’s theory.

The electromagnetic field is characterized at each point of space by
two arrows or vectors. One of these represents the electric field, the
other the magnetic field. But an arrow can be described by its three
projections upon three mutually perpendicular axes. (An arrow in
a plane is characterized by two projections, in a three-dimensional
space by three.) Thus the field at each point (remember that there are
two arrows) is represented by six numbers, three denoting the electric
and three denoting the magnetic field. These numbers change from
one point to another. These two arrows, and therefore the six num-
bers, change at the same point from one moment to another. Max-
well’s equations tell us the laws of this change. Or: the electro-
magnetic field is characterized by six functions of space and time.
Maxwell’s equations tell us how these functions change in space and
time.

THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

We can now characterize in general terms at least one aspect of
Einstein’s second revolution: it did for gravitational phenomena
what Maxwell’s theory did for electromagnetic phenomena.

Newton’s theory of gravitation follows the mechanical pattern.
Particles (moon, earth) are attracted by other particles (earth, sun).
In it there is no place for the concept of field, the scenery of which is
all of space. There is no place for a gravitational field spreading
through space in time.

Einstein’s theory of gravitation is not an improved version of New-
ton’s theory; it is an entirely new theory based upon new assumptions,
logically more satisfactory than those of Newton. Yet, the results,
which can be tested by observation, are very similar in the two theories.
There is a great area of agreement and a small area of disagreement.
The most famous new phenomenon, predicted by Einstein’s theory
only, is that of light rays bending while passing near the edge of the
sun. Indeed, it was this phenomenon, discovered during a solar
192 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

eclipse, when one can see stars near the darkened sun, that started the
great fame of the Relativity Theory and its creator. Another dif-
ference between the two theories concerns the motion of planets around
thesun. The discrepancy between results deduced by the two theories
is small, yet detectable in the case of Mercury, the planet nearest the
sun. Whenever such disagreement exists, and whenever experiment
can pronounce its verdict, it seems (to put it cautiously) to favor Ein-
stein’s theory of gravitation. But the importance of Einstein’s
achievement lies rather in the beauty and simplicity of his theory
than in the discovery of new phenomena.

The gravitational field in Einstein’s theory is characterized by
10 functions changing in space and time. They play a role similar
to that of the six functions in Maxwell’s theory. Einstein’s gravi-
tational equations tell us how these functions change in space and
time. '

We remember that in the electromagnetic theory, we have a mixture
of field and particle concepts. The field is produced by the electrons
and their motion. Similarly, in Einstein’s original theory, the gravi-
tational field is produced by the bodies (stars and nebulae) and their
motion. Thus, comparing Maxwell’s and Einstein’s theories, we have
the following analogy:

Electromagnetic field — Gravitational field
Charged particles ==, Gravitational masses
Motion of charged particles - Motion of gravitational masses

Our analogy is not complete, and in some respects even misleading.
We must now mention one novel feature of Einstein’s field equations.
The appearance of any form of energy is accompanied by a gravi-
tational field. The gravitational field is influenced not only by the
moving gravitational masses but also by the electromagnetic field
itself, because such a field represents energy. ‘Thus the sources of a
gravitational field lie in moving masses, in moving charges, and in
the electromagnetic field. A pure gravitational field can exist without
an electromagnetic field. But a pure electromagnetic field cannot
exist without a gravitational field.

PHYSICS AND GEOMETRY

Let us now adopt the view of 1920 (when the structure of Rela-
tivity Theory was finished), without which we cannot understand
what happened later. We see one essential difference between the
gravitational and the electromagnetic field: the gravitational field
is a geometrical field ; the electromagnetic field is a physical field.

The understanding of the gravitational field as a geometric field
is the result of one of the greatest and most revolutionary ideas that
EINSTEIN'S NEW THEORY—INFELD 193

ever entered physics. It is impossible to grasp the importance of
Kinstein’s achievement without being aware of this point. We know
the properties of a Euclidean space from our high-school days:
through a point outside a line, we can draw one, and only one, line
parallel to the given one. But since the nineteenth century we know
that Euclidean geometry is only one of the many possible geometries.
The simplest case of a non-Euclidean geometry would be, for example,
the one experienced by two-dimensional creatures living on the surface
of asphere. They would find that a journey “straight ahead” (that
is, along a great circle for you) leads them to their point of departure;
that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is smaller
than 7x.

The background of our physical events is a four-dimensional world.
There is nothing mysterious about it. Every event, like the death
of Julius Caesar, is characterized by the “place” and time in which
it took place. The “place” of an event is characterized by three num-
bers; hence, together with time, we have four. The totality of all
possible events forms one four-dimensional world. All this has been
known and successfully applied since 1908 when the great mathe-
matician H. Minkowski gave the beautiful four-dimensional mathe-
matical form to Einstein’s Special Relativity Theory.

Yet General Relativity Theory goes one important step farther.
We ask: Is our four-dimensional world flat, like the plane in two
dimensions? Or is it curved, like a curved surface of two dimensions?
The difficulty with these questions is that, whereas we can easily
visualize a two-dimensional flat or curved space, it is difficult to do
so if the space is four-dimensional. But where our intuition stops,
mathematics does not. Even before Einstein’s time, the mathematics
describing many-dimensional curved space was known, though it
developed fully only under the impetus of relativity. The develop-
ment of this branch of mathematics is connected with the names of
Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Riemann, Ricci, Levi-Civita, and others.
Let us say here only that a four-dimensional space is characterized
by 10 functions; that, once we know these functions, we know the
geometry of such a space; we know whether such a space is curved
and how its geometry changes from point to point.

In my room I ean characterize the position of the end of my pencil
by quoting its distances from the ceiling and two perpendicular walls.
Or, generally, the position of a point is designated by three numbers
in a given coordinate system. In a town, the names of streets and
house numbers form two coordinates denoting with sufficient accuracy
the positions of its inhabitants on a piece of a surface (at least when
they stay at home). Similarly, in our four-dimensional world of
events, we must have a coordinate system so as to name the four
194 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

coordinate numbers that denote an event. But besides these, we need
10 functions that tell us whether the world we describe (in a given
but arbitrary coordinate system) is flat or not flat, or, as we often
say, Euclidean or Riemannian.

We can now formulate Einstein’s great and new idea: The 10 func-
tions that characterize the geometry of our four-dimensional world
are the same 10 functions that characterize the gravitational field.
A world without masses, without electrons, without an electromagnetic
field, isan empty world. Such an empty world is flat. But if masses
appear, if charged particles appear, if an electromagnetic field ap-
pears, then a gravitational field appears too. If the gravitational
field appears, then our world becomes curved. Its geometry is
Riemannian—that is, non-Euclidean.

Thus the same 10 functions characterize the metric and the gravi-
tational field. The word “metric” indicates the connection between
these 10 functions and the geometry of our world. The word “grav-
itational” indicates that the same 10 functions describe the gravita-
tional phenomena of our world. The fact that we can use either or
both of these words indicates that the physical gravitational field
has its geometric counterpart. Physics—as far as the gravitational
field is concerned—is reflected as geometry. The geometry of our
world and the gravitational field are shaped, formed, by moving
masses, moving electric charges, and by the electromagnetic field.
Thus the connection

Physics «<— Geometry

exists only for the gravitational field. We repeat: The gravitational
field is a geometric field too; the electromagnetic field is a purely
physical field.

About 1920, General Relativity Theory presented a curious mixture
of geometry and physics. To understand Einstein’s later endeavors,
we must understand his reason for dissatisfaction with the structure
of field theories as they were then known. Thus, in Maxwell’s
equations we have:

Given: Charges and their motion
Unknown: The electromagnetic field
In Einstein’s relativity theory, we have:

Given: Masses and their motion
Unknown: The gravitational or metrical field

In relativity theory, the given and unknown form a strange mixture.
Mass, energy has no geometrical counterpart. But the field has!

THE TWO SINS

General Relativity Theory was born because of Einstein’s dissat-
isfaction with the classical theory of gravitation. The new theory was
EINSTEIN’S NEW THEORY—INFELD 195

born because of his dissatisfaction with General Relativity Theory,
a weak point of which was the artificial mixture of geometric and
physical concepts. But another weak point is perhaps still more
important. Both the electromagnetic and the gravitational theories
are dualistic theories. In both of these theories, we have sources of
the field (charges, particles) and the field itself. Thus we see in both
theories a mixture of two concepts: matter and field. It would be
philosophically much more satisfactory if we were able to build a
unitary theory based on only one of these concepts. The triumphs
of field theory were too great to allow us to abandon the field concept.
Hence, Einstein’s aim was to build a pure field theory. In such a
theory we would have only field concepts and equations of the field.

But we could argue: How can we be satisfied with field equations
alone? We know that matter is as real as the stone on which we
stumble. The supporter of the unitary field view would say that the
existence of what is known as matter should be deduced from the field
equations alone. What is regarded as matter is situated in regions in
which the field is especially strong. Motion of matter means that the
regions in which the field is especially strong change with time.
Hence, a resting electron has to be represented in a unitary eleetro-
magnetic theory by a small region, inside which the field is very strong,
and outside which it dies out quickly. Such a region, with a strong
but finite field, represents concentrated energy—that is, matter.

A good field theory describes and interprets matter in terms of strong
fields. Hence, from the point of view of logical simplicity, great prog-
ress would be achieved if both Maxwell’s theory and General Relativ-
ity Theory were to change into a pure field theory. Such a theory
would deal only with the concepts of the electromagnetic field, charac-
terized by 6 functions, and of the gravitational field, characterized
by 10 functions. But the laws of these fields would have to be changed.
Unlike Maxwell’s theory and General Relativity Theory, such new
theories would have to admit solutions representing matter. The old
theories failed to do that.

But even if we were to succeed in formulating a pure field theory,
such a theory would still be tainted with another fault. We saw, in
the old theories, that the gravitational field was a geometrical field too,
but the electromagnetic field was a purely physical field. ‘This divi-
sion is again artificial, and, according to Einstein, a satisfactory theory
ought to have the following features:

1. It ought to be a pure field theory.

2. In it, electromagnetic and gravitational fields ought to be treated
on the same footing—that is, both should characterize the geometry
of our universe.
196 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

So Einstein tried to remove the fault of a double dualism from our
theories; the dualism of field-matter and the dualism of physics-geom-
etry—that is, the dualism of electromagnetic versus gravitational field.
He believed that a search for a simple geometry of our universe, but
more general than that of Riemannian geometry, would lead us to pure
field equations that describe electromagnetic and gravitational phenom-
ena. More than that, such a theory, if successful, should disclose to us
the properties of elementary particles from which atoms are built, and
at the same time explain the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies.

THE END OF THE SEARCH?

Einstein believes that he may have solved this great problem. In-
deed, his new theory is fully a unitary theory. In it only the field
appears, no sources of the field. The existence of matter will have to
be deduced from the field equations by finding solutions that repre-
sent great concentrations of the field. The new theory is a purely
geometrical theory. Whereas the electromagnetic field is character-
ized, in Maxwell’s theory, by 6 functions; whereas the gravitational
field is characterized in Einstein’s old theory by 10 functions—in the
new theory, the metrical field is characterized by 16 (10+6) func-
tions. To put this in technical language: the electromagnetic field
is characterized by an antisymmetric tensor with 6 components, the
gravitational field by a symmetric tensor with 10 components, and
the geometry of the new Einstein world by a general tensor of the
second order with 16 (6+10) components.

In General Relativity Theory, the Einstein field equations char-
acterized the Riemannian geometry of our world. But the geometry
of our world, according to Einstein’s new theory, is a non-Rieman-
nian geometry, and Einstein’s new field equations characterize this
new non-Riemannian geometry of our world. Every concept that
appears in the new theory has its geometrical image. The distinc-
tion between purely physical concepts and those with a geometrical
interpretation is gone. The distinction between matter and field is
gone too. There is only the field that is both geometrical and physical.
There are only the field equations that represent the geometry of
our world and the laws of physics.

THE TEST OF THE NEW THEORY

For weak fields, we regain from the new theory the laws of the
old theories—that is, Maxwell’s and the gravitational equations. This
must be so, because every new theory must explain the phenomena
that the abandoned theory explained. As always, so here, the dis-
carded theory appears as a first approximation to the new one.
EINSTEIN’S NEW THEORY—INFELD 197

Although Einstein’s new theory has many attractive features, we
do not yet know whether it is a successful unitary field theory; we do
not know whether it contains solutions that can be interpreted as
elementary particles. We know that the old Maxwell and Einstein
theories did not give solutions of field equations that could be re-
garded as particles. In the old theories, the existence of matter had
to be assumed independently. Will the new theory succeed where
the old theories failed? This is a crucial question, and we do not as
yet know the answer.

But the situation is still more complicated. The modern develop-
ment of physics concerns quantum laws which are valid inside the
atom. It is not clear whether, and in what way, such laws could be
deduced from Einstein’s field theory. Yet one should not be too
skeptical. Ejinstein’s work has always met temporarily with skep-
ticism because his genius was ahead of his times. This happened
twice, and it may have happened again at the turn of our half-
century.

Some Results in the Field of High-Pressure
Physics’

By P. W. BripcmMan

Department of Physics, Harvard University

In ruts article I shall describe some of the physical phenomena that
are produced in various materials when exposed to high hydrostatic
pressures. Pressure is not usually thought of as having any impor-
tant effect on the properties of materials, and indeed under the ordi-
nary conditions in which human beings live it does not. The effect
of temperature is usually far more important for us, for temperature
changes may produce such important results as the conversion of ordi-
nary liquid water to solid ice or gaseous steam. One reason for the
comparative unimportance of pressure is that the variations of pres-
sure that we can easily produce are, so far as the molecules are con-
cerned, not large. Under pressures that are large for the molecules,
changes may be produced quite as drastic as those brought about by
changes of temperature. For example, water may not only be frozen
solid by the application of pressure alone, but pressure is capable of
producing seven different kinds of ice, something that mere alteration
of temperature is unable to accomplish.

The pressures that are large enough to affect molecules are in gene-
ral of the order of thousands of atmospheres, and it is with such pres-
sures that we shall be concerned here. To set the scale, a thousand
atmospheres, or some 15,000 pounds per square inch, is approximately
the pressure at the deepest part of the ocean, produced by a column
of water 6 miles high. Two thousand atmospheres is approximately
the pressure in the explosion chamber of a large gun. From the cos-
mic point of view, the importance of understanding the effects of
pressures of this magnitude is obvious, because all except a small frac-
tion of 1 percent of the matter in the universe exists under pressures
greater than 1,000 atmospheres.

In extending scientific measurements into the realm of pressures of
this magnitude, various technological problems are encountered.
There is in the first place the problem of preventing leakage of the
liquid by which pressure is transmitted. This problem may be solved

by designing the packing in such a way that the pressure in it is main-
tained automatically, by the liquid pressure itself, at a level higher
by a fixed percentage than that in the liquid. The principle will be
clear from figure 1, which illustrates the packing on the end of a
piston by which pressure is generated. A piston packed in this way

cannot leak, so that all one needs to do to produce any desired pres-
sure is to push the piston into the pressure vessel with the necessary
force. The force driving the piston is most advantageously obtained
from a hydraulic press or some other form of hydraulic intensifier.

“Any desired pressure” is, however, obviously subject to several
limitations, in particular the strength of the containing vessel and of
the piston. It might perhaps be thought at first that the strength
of the containing vessel could be increased indefinitely, merely by
making the walls of the vessel of unlimited thickness. This unfortu-
nately is not so, for even an infinitely thick vessel has only a finite
strength. The reason for this is that stress and strain are concen-
trated at the inner parts, so that the outer parts do not do their
HIGH-PRESSURE PHYSICS—BRIDGMAN 201

proportionate share in supporting the pressure. In practice it turns
out that the limit for heavy cylinders of the best heat-treated steels
is about 15,000 atmospheres; this may be increased for brief operations
to 20,000 or more. Still higher pressures can perhaps be achieved
by shrinking hoops onto the vessel, as in a well-known method of gun
construction, but even with such vessels the upper limit yet reached,
in some experiments by Newitt, is in the neighborhood of 30,000 atmos-
pheres. While the pressure vessel is reaching its limit the piston also
is reaching its limit, the upper limit for the compressive strength of
any steel now available being also in the neighborhood of 30,000
atmospheres.
|

Ficure 2.—Simple method of giving external support to a pressure vessel by using the
thrust on the piston, which produces internal pressure to push the whole vessel into a
supporting conical sleeve.

To reach higher pressures, a radical change in design is necessary.
For the piston, however, it is sufficient to change the material of
which it is made to carboloy, which has a compressive strength more
than twice that of the best steels. Carboloy is a product of powder
metallurgy, and is a sintered aggregate of tungsten carbide cemented
with a small amount of cobalt as binder. To obtain greater strength in
the pressure vessels more elaborate methods are necessary. In all my
experiments it has involved giving the pressure vessel some sort of ex-
ternal support to counteract the effect of the internal pressure. The
simplest way of doing this is to make the vessel conical on the outside
surface and to push the entire pressure vessel into a conical supporting
sleeve as internal pressure increases. The vessel may be pushed into its
sleeve in various ways. The simplest is to let the thrust that drives
the piston drive the vessel also into its sleeve; a method of doing this
202 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

is indicated in figure 2. Alternatively, the pressure vessel may be
forced into its sleeve by an independent hydraulic press coupled in
the proper ratio to the press which produces the internal pressure.
The choice of method depends on the size of the apparatus, and is
determined by various factors such as friction, which we cannot dis-
cuss here. The limit to the pressures that have been used in the
laboratory in apparatus constructed with conical external support
has been about 50,000 atmospheres. At this pressure a new limiting
