UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1902,

BY

RicHarp RarusBun,

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the US. National Museum.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The United States National Museum had its origin in the act of
Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the
latter, and provided that—

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their recep-
tion, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may
be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when-
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the
museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise,
the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged.

The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund
amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that
the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 1846 probably not
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer-
ica had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of
Congress that the fund was suflicient both for the erection of a build-
ing and for the care of the collections which would be turned over
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The
Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate
with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Goyern-
ment collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the

°

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Con-
gress began to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose.
So inadequate, however, were the sums voted, that for many years the
slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure
the maintenance of what was then justly called the Smithsonian
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a
considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property
of the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the
ofticials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense.

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Insti-
tution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but
valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who
was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute, and a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London.

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired
by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring
Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Goy-
ernment collections retained in Washington. Another important sery-
ice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has
said, in the direction of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the
establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the
United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which
‘ame practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material
directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held
there until 1883.

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and
through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F.
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850.
The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish-
ment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Hs

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations
were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other
branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson’s Bay,Com-
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by
these beginnings bas been lasting and widespread, as shown in the
extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other
bureaus of the Government.

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in
January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its Important
functions:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution,
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science,
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn-
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge. “

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day.

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab-
lished, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the pro-
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be
derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880:

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history,
archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National
Museum.

_ Although the name ‘‘ National Museum” was sometimes used in the
earlier reports of the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any
of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition
of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the
people of the United States the existence of national collections at

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting
museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of col-
lege or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period. After
its close the Government exhibits brought back to Washington,
together with the extensive gifts made to the United States by private
persons and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early erec-
tion of a new and separate building, devoted entirely to museum
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the
fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithson-
ian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio
the keeper—a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform
policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes,
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific bureaus at Wash-
ington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and
caring for the national collections.

The scope of the National Museum as defined by law comprises
practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for making pur-
chases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character
of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations,
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology
and archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. <A fair beginning
has been made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial
arts and American history, and scarcely more is required to place
these two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater
part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which
must sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government.

The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, com-
prising the bulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of
scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to
which students are freely admitted: the other, selected with regard
to their general educational value and public interest, and accompanied
by descriptive labels, being displayed in glass-covered cases in the
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as
opportunity offers. Papers deseriptive of the collections, both tech-
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the
extent of three or more volumes yee ee and, finally, the Museum
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all

by

subjects with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned,
the correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its
heaviest tasks.

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Dr. Goode,
may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur-
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research.
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except
as a foundation for scientific description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the

‘National Cabinet of Curiosities,’ to 1876. During this period the Museum became
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col-
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable,
made to serve an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research,
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three
ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

In the same connection, Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects
of the Museum in the following concise manner:

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD.

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal
and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institu-
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi-
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small
appropriation in recent years has permitted of some purchases to

supply desiderata.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized
as follows:

1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con-
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments,
and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward
the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.

2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from
1838 to 1842, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine
waters.

3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and
consular service abroad.

4, The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Army; and the activi-
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army
stationed in remote regions.

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. 8. Fish
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches
of the Government.

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi-
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition
at, Philadelphia in 1876, the international fisheries exhibitions at Berlin
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at
the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World’s
Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the
collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign govern-
ments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of numer-
ous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and America.

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi-
viduals.

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building,
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was
about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the new
building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large
fp

aceessions received from Philadelphia, and from other sources, the
number had grown to 1.471.000. At the close of 1902 it amounted to
nearly 5,500,000.

While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec-
tions, when it is considered that by 1885 all of the space in both build-
ings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci-
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsate
structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great
intrinsic and scientific value to fll an additional building as large as
that now occupied by the main collections.

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH.

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in

the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the

extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete
in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, 1s given to all
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor-
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited
every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction,
coming from the scientific centers of Huropean and other foreign
countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions
having the means of providing for its safekeeping, when required in
the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection
with their own collections.

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most
imperative duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National
Museum, its members find comparatively little time during office hours
for advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for
such work, being selected with special reference to their ability to
identify and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance
with the latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff
does produce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the
collections, which together constitute an important contribution to
scientific hterature.

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con-
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose
results the Museum shares.

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the
Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul-
ture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car-
ried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased. ;

Though haying little means to expend for field work, members of
the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate in
the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi-
tions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on,
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new and
valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it
occurred in nature.

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM.

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the
general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper installa-
tion of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit,
the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory
development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in
this respect grow worse instead of better through the increased crowd-
ing of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in
the methods of display, in the character of individual and group
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional
progress has been made.

A year ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for pub-
lic use were then for the first time permanently open, though none
were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work-
rooms.

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of Dr.
Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better under-
standing of the public needs. He labored earnestly and conscien-
re

tiously to make this a museum for, as well as of, the people, and the
plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of his
making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and
maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the
interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of
nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his sur-
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some
definite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Dr. Goode’s labors
in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to the
most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official con-
nection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quarter
of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums of
Europe and the United States: gave him exceptional opportunities for
observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died,
none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy
of being followed.

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col-
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identitied and labeled, and
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have
already been given away.

Scarcely a year passes that some expedition, either at home or
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi-
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one
another so closely and have required such extensive preparations as to
interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one,
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washing-
ton, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum
methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating
the growth of museums in many quarters.

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the
publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way, as belong-
ing to its educational side, being the medium through which the nature
and extent of its collections are made known. ‘The Annual Report,
first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report in 1884,
and now in its nineteenth volume, consists,. besides the administrative
part, mainly of semi-popular papers on interesting portions of the
collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the larger
and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings twenty-
three complete volumes have been issued and of the Bulletins fifty-one
numbers.

PRESENT CONDITION AND NEEDS OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum now occupies the building erected for its use
in 1881, the greater part of the Smithsonian building, parts of three
detached buildings on the Mall, and several rented buildings south of
B street SW. The floor area represented, together with the general
use to which the several floors of the larger buildings and each of the
smaller buildings are devoted, is shown in the following table:

An inspection of the several buildings shows conditions which are
very deplorable for the National Museum of a great country. Every
branch is seriously hampered by the total inadequacy of the space
assigned it, and the proper disposition of specimens long ago became
impossible, with the result that year after year valuable collections,
often of large size, have had to be packed away in insecure rented
buildings, where they are also inaccessible. While the Museum
building is not ill adapted to exhibition purposes, it is much too small
to serve the present needs. Its halls are overcrowded, the cases being
generally placed so near together that two persons can scarcely pass
between them and no effective view of their contents can be obtained,
An increase in space of one-half to two-thirds at least would be neces-
sary to properly display the present contents of these halls.

Having practically no basement, the only space available for the
reserve storage, workrooms, and offices is in the small rooms of the
central towers and corner pavilions, except that some of the galleries
designed for exhibition have from necessity been turned over to these
purposes. In these quarters the specimens are packed almost solidly,
in cases generally reaching to such a height as to make access to the
upper ones extremely inconvenient. The workers have scarcely room
in which to place their tables, and there is little place anywhere for
the spreading out of specimens for purposes of study and classification
or of preparation for exhibition.

In the Smithsonian building, which was originally intended to be
used only in small part for museum purposes, the conditions are simi-
lar. There are four exhibition halls, three used for zoology and one
for prehistoric archeology. The latter, occupying the entire upper
floor of the main building, has, through the loosening and fall of large
areas of plaster from the ceiling, been pronounced unsafe and closed
to the public until funds can be obtained for its repair and renovation.
The large corresponding room on the ground floor has four galleries
extending nearly its entire length, which, some fifteen years ago, were
turned into work and storage quarters for several branches of zoology.
They are overcrowded with cases and tables and are, moreover,
extremely unhealthful places for the assistants stationed there because
of the impure air rising from the exhibition floor below.

In the basement is stored the greater part of the valuable alcoholic
collection of the Museum, in a series of dark, damp rooms, wholly
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

unsuited to the purpose, and where a great deal of work has to be car-
ried on. The other workrooms and storerooms in the Smithsonian
building, besides two or three small ones on the main floor, are in the
north tower, which is utilized for these purposes up to the height of
the seventh story. It is scarcely necessary to explain that many of
these rooms, all of which are very small, are inconvenient of access,
and that specimens can be carried to and from them only with
difficulty.

Many of the activities of the Museum and much the greater part of
its storage have, for a long period, had to be provided for in outside
buildings, partly on the Mall and partly rented at an annual expense
of over $4,000. The taxidermists are quartered in the upper part of
the Smithsonian stable and in a temporary frame structure back of
the Smithsonian building. On Armory square, adjoining the Fish
Commission building, is an old, dilapidated wooden shed filled with
specimens. On Ninth street SW. there is under lease a large area of
land, covered with wooden sheds containing an immense amount of
raluable collections and much other Museum property. The greater
part of the so-called Marsh collection of vertebrate fossils, which has
been valued at above $150,000, is still stored in a rented building at
Tenth street and Maryland avenue, which also provides space for sev-
eral preparators’ workshops. Two other rented buildings are likewise
used to accommodate the extensive carpenter, paint, and glazing shops
which are required for the making of furniture and for the repairs
upon the main buildings. ‘

In order to carry out the purposes for which it exists, the National
Museum requires a greatly increased amount of space, and that any
additional space provided be better adapted to its wants than that now
occupied,

For the exhibition collections a connecting series of relatively large
rooms or halls is needed to permit of the arrangement of the specimens
and groups of specimens, many of considerable size, in such manner as
will best adapt them to the comprehension of the public and, by the
avoidance of crowding, allow them to be viewed effectively.

The record collections, commonly knownas the reserve or study series,
comprising the bulk of the material in most departments, while demand-
ing such a convenient disposition as will insure the ready examination
of specimens, require relatively less space than the exhibition collec-
tions, as they can be much more compactly arranged in drawers and
on shelves. Yet their extent is so great that the question of their
accommodation is one of the most important ones for consideration.
They have been mainly derived from the Government surveys of the
past sixty years, and represent a very large expenditure of publie
money. :

For the activities of the Museum are needed many well-lighted and
well-appointed rooms to serve as laboratories for classifying collections

and for scientific research, and as workshops for the preparation of
specimens for study and for exhibition. It should also be noted that
the Museum is called upon to furnish workrooms for several of the
scientific bureaus, whose collections are partly studied there, and that,
by a recent act of Congress, it is incumbent upon the Museum to pro-
vide facilities for such students and investigators from other parts of
the country as may choose to visit it for purposes of research.

Finally, space must be provided for certain general and miscella-
neous purposes, such as the mechanical workshops and storerooms,
the heating plant, public-comfort rooms, the library, a lecture’ hall,
the administrative offices, etc.

An, estimate of the amount of space needed has been reached by a
careful consideration of the several requirements as set forth below,
namely:

(1) To relieve the present very congested condition of the exhibi-
tion halls.

(2) To provide for the display of objects now in storage which are
suitable and intended for public exhibition.

(3) Convenient and systematic storage for the vast reserve or record
collections which are now for the most part inaccessible for examina-
tion.

(4) Suitable scientific laboratories, preparators’ workshops, ete.

(5) The mechanical workshops required in making repairs to build-
ings and in the construction and repair of cases and other furniture
and fixtures.

(6) Offices necessary for administrative and other purposes common
to all the branches of the Museum.

(7) The space required for the heating plant, the library, a lecture
hall, public-comfort rooms, and other miscellaneous purposes.

(8) Provision for future growth.

The growth of the Museum fora number of years past has been
mainly through the receipt of material which by law it must receive
and care for. The amount of material declined or diverted elsewhere
during the last ten or fifteen years because of the lack of room would
have occupied a very large proportion of the present exhibition space
and have greatly increased the money value of the collections. The
same conditions have prevented the Museum authorities from solicit-
ing large contributions, but with adequate facilities many extensive
exhibits can be had for the asking. The department of arts and
industries, the more practical side of the Museum, has perhaps suf-
fered most from the lack of accommodations. Large exhibits have
had to be removed to storage, and the growth of this most important
and striking branch was necessarily stopped some time ago. It should
be made here, as it has been in all the larger capitals of the world,
one of the most important features of the national collections, and its
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

increase, once stimulated, would go forward rapidly and at relatively
small expense, as generous donations might be expected from all
quarters.

Using the above topics as a basis for calculations, the amount of
space immediately required has been worked out in a tentative way
for each of the departments. This information is summarized in the
following table, which gives also for each subject the space now occu-
pied. With regard to fae present storage areas, it should be borne in
mind that raueh of the material is now Suna stored in packing
boxes, and if transferred to classified storage would spread out over
many times the space. The departments named are those under which
the Museum is classified for convenience of administration.

Deducting this area from the total area now occupied (238,689 square

available and appropriate for the future needs of the Museum. Again,
deducting this amount from the total space named aboye as required
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 17

for the Museum (670,000 square feet) there remain approximately
487,000 square feet to be provided for in a new building.

The facts on which the above remarks are based having been sub
mitted to Congress in connection with the estimates for 1902-3, the
following item was included in the sundry civil appropriation act
approved June 28, 1902:

For the preparation, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, of preliminary plans for an additional fireproof, steel frame, brick and terra-
cotta building, to cost not exceeding one million five hundred thousand dollars, for
the United States National Museum, to be erected when appropriated for, on the Mall,
between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, said plans when completed to be transmitted
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to Congress, five thousand dollars.

It is hoped that through this initial enactment a period of greater
prosperity for the Museum is about to ensue.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of
the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1902, was
$289,400, as against $263,540 for the previous year. The principal
changes as compared with 1901 were as follows: An increase of $2,500
under furniture and fixtures, an increase of $5,500 under heating and:
lighting, of which $5,000 was for completing the electric installation
in the Museum building, and an increase of $360 under rent of work-
shops and storage quarters. The two following special appropriations
were made: For the purchase and installation of new boilers in the
Museum building of a capacity for heating both buildings, $12,500;
for the construction of two galleries in the Museum building, $5,000.

The expenditures up to the close of the year from the appropria-
tions for 1901-2 amounted to $274,271.20, leaving a balance of $15,128.80
to meet outstanding liabilities. During the same year $15,052.81 were
disbursed from the balance of $15,293.77 of the appropriations for
1900-1901 on hand July 1, 1901.

The following tables show the expenditures during the year 1901-2
under each item of the appropriations for the past two years:

aThe total balance on June 30, 1901, was $16,715.33. No appropriations except those from which

disbursements were made during the year are mentioned in this table.

Disbursements from the appropriation for 1899-1900 were made as
follows: Preservation of collections, $291.24; books, pamphlets, and
periodicals, $2.55, leaving balances of 540.15 and $28.09, respectively.
These balances, together with unexpended balances of the appropria-
tions for furniture and fixtures, heating and lighting, building repairs,
and rent of workshops, amounting to $12.80, have reverted to the
surplus fund of the Treasury.

The appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1903, are as follows:

BUILDINGS.

Several important alterations and improvements have been made in
the Museum building. Some additional space has been gained through
the construction of galleries in three ranges—the west-north, the north-
west, and the south-west—which are being fitted up for the library
and as laboratories for the departments of anthropology and geology.

The steam boilers, which had become entirely worn out after a
service dating from the erection of the building, have been replaced
by a pair of water-tube boilers of modern pattern, with capacity
for heating both buildings. The introduction of these made it neces-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21

sary to overhaul the entire heating plant and to make new and more
ample connections with the Smithsonian building. The boilers for-
merly used in the latter building will be retained in place to guard
against emergencies, and the employment of one set instead of two is
expected to result in the economy of both fuel and labor.

The installation of a complete system of electric-light wiring and
fixtures extending to all the exhibition halls as well as to the offices, labo-
atories, and storerooms, begun the previous year, was finished satis-
factorily. Should it be decided to open the building at night, how-
ever, an increased appropriation will be required to cover the cost of
extra current and the pay of several additional attendants.

The quarters allotted to the purposes of a lunch room have been
somewhat extended and improved, but this very desirable museum
adjunct must always remain poorly provided for in the present building.

The sundry civil appropriation act for 1903, passed just at the close
of the year, contains an item of $5,000 for the preparation of prelim-
inary plans for an additional fireproof building for the National
Museum, to cost not over $1,500,000.

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The number of accessions received during the year was 1,409, con-
taining an aggregate of 448,872 specimens, two and one-half times as
many as were added in 1901, and increasing the total number of spec-
imens in the national collections to 5,418,284, as shown by the records.
This figure is, however, below the actual one, as the contents of many
packages filled with very small objects are estimated at a nominal
figure.

The most constant and important sources of accessions are certain
bureaus of the Government whose collections are, by law, transferred
to the custody of the Museum as soon as their study has been com-
pleted. Among these bureaus are the Geological Survey, the Fish
Commission, the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology
and Plants of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. Large quantities of valu-
able material are received from individuals and private establishments
through donation and exchange, and many interesting features are
added to the exhibition series through loans or deposits. Lack of
funds has prevented the carrying on of field explorations by members
of the Museum staff except to a very limited extent, but scarcely a
year passes without some good returns through this means.

With a maximum annual appropriation of $10,000 for the purchase
of specimens, not much can be done toward filling the innumerable
gaps'which occur throughout the collections, though many important
desiderata are thus supplied from year to year.
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

As a complete list of the accessions for the year is given in Appen-
dix II, and the more important ones are described in the reports of
the head curators, attention will be called in this connection to only
such as are especially noteworthy.

The total number of specimens added to the Department of Anthro.
pology was 40,083, prehistoric archeology heading the list with 22,197
specimens, ethnology following with 14,335 specimens, and history
and biography standing third with 2,279 specimens.

Among the important contributions in ethnology were a quantity of
baskets, weapons, ornaments, and parts of costumes collected by Dr.
W. L. Abbott in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, some of which
have been described and illustrated by Lieut. W. E. Safford, U.S.
Navy, in the Smithsonian Report for 1901; and many other objects,
including crania, native clothing, lamps, and articles connected with
the industries of the Eskimo, obtained in northern Greenland and Elles-
mere Land by Mr. Robert Stein, of the U. 5. Geological Survey,
during his Arctic expedition. A number of Guatemalan costumes
and of objects illustrating the first steps in the weaving of cotton as
practiced in that country, as well as other ethnological material, were
received from Mrs. Mary W. Owen, of Panzos, Guatemala. Two
interesting donations were a series of weapons captured during the
Philippine insurrection, including several Filipino swords of the ordi-
nary type, some bolos, and a kris, from Maj. E. L. Hawks, U. S.
Volunteers; and a collection consisting principally of the different
types of ‘*punal de kris,” a weapon carried by the women and children
in the Philippine Islands, together with a device formerly used in the
Philippine army for decapitating wounded soldiers, from Dr. W. C.
Warmsley, of Norwich, Connecticut. Another Philippine collection,
secured by purchase from Mr. J. N. Harkins, of Calhoun, Georgia,
comprises weapons, cooking utensils, tobacco boxes, charm belts,
models of boats, newspapers, statuettes, and coins.

A collection of choice objects brought together by the late Dr. G.
Brown Goode, and secured during the year, includes musical instru-
ments, Japanese porcelains, domestic utensils, gambling devices,
plaques, vases, an incense box, old Kutani ware, Marcusi ware, Cloi-
sonné plates and bowls, trays, English chinaware, and ironstone china
from China. Other additions to the collection of musical instruments
were a small series of instruments used by the American Indians and
several from European countries, including a nyckleharpa obtained
by exchange from Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, of Orange, New Jersey,
and 78 pieces, comprising instruments of the Javanese, Chinese, Tib-
etans, Japanese, and Persians; Syrian and Egyptian kettledrums, a
Turkish mandolin, etc., presented by Dr. Ryan Devereaux, U.S. Army.

A complete set of the gold and silver coins of Siam, and a series of
Spanish coins minted in Mexico and the Philippine Islands, embracing

Army. <A desk and quadrant used by Dr. C. F. Hall on his Polaris
Arctic expedition, were received as a gift from Miss Anne $. Hall,
of Cincinnati, Ohio

Among the important accessions in archeology were the collection
of flint implements, bone utensils, and remains of extinct and recent
mammals resulting from the examination of a sulphur spring at Afton,
Indian Territory, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, and a very large amount of
material, comprising pottery, implements of stone, wood, and shell,
bones, and human remains, obtained by Dr. Walter Hough during his
investigations in Arizona, partly in conjunction with Mr. Peter G.
Gates.

About 10,000 prehistoric objects from Georgia, including carvings,
spearheads, polished stone hatchets, and other articles of stone, ivory,
and pottery, were acquired from Dr. Roland B. Steiner. A collection
of the implements used by the ancient inhabitants of the area now
forming Columbia County, Pennsylvania, consisting of stone articles
of domestic utility, stone hatchets, banner stones, arrow points, and
spearheads, was presented by Mr. Charles Hummel, of Espey, Penn-
sylvania; a large series of prehistoric objects from the Potomac Valley
was obtained by purchase; and material from the guano caves of Las
Cruces, New Mexico, was contributed by Mr. J. R. De Mier.

Among the accessions in archeology from other countries were
over 600 specimens of prehistoric vases, stone figures, carvings, and
polished instruments, and figures and dishes in earthenware, from
Mexico, received from Mr. E. O. Matthews; an image, mortar, and
pestle of stone, from Porto Rico, presented by Mr. Henry Bird; and

24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

The additions to the technological collections include several of his-
torical value, such as pieces of apparatus devised and used by Dr.
Elisha Gray in his experiments with harmonic multiple telegraphy
and with the telephone, received from Mrs. Gray; one of the tin-foil
records made by Edison’s first phonograph when exhibited before the
National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in 1878,
contributed by Mr. William J. Rhees; a number of electric-lighting
and telephone devices, and one of the early forms of typewriting
machines. a

In the Department of Biology the additions numbered 377,227 speci-
mens, of which 324,687 were zoological and 52,540 botanical. Among
the Pooleeieal divisions the greatest increase was of mollusks, namely,
173,262 specimens, followed by insects with 118,202, marine inverte-
brates, exclusive of mollusks, with 18,380, mammals with 6,301
specimens, ete.

The collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the East Indies, con-
sisting principally of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, formed the
most important zoological accessions. Of mammals there were 848
specimens, including many new species, from the islands of Andaman,
Nicobar, Sumatra, Linga, Sinkep, Johore, and others farther eastward;
of birds, over 700 apes ‘imens, and of reptiles, a considerable number.
The region visited by Dr. Abbott is in large part a new field, not
previously represented in ine National Museum, and the generous
contributions from this indefatigable explorer give the Museum a col-
lection from this region which is absolutely unrivaled.

Other specimens of mammals received deserving of mention were
a fine skeleton of the huge Kadiak (Alaska) bear from Mr. J. H.
Kidder, of Boston; African antelopes, monkeys, and birds from Dr. A.
Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia; many skulls of moose, elk, and
other deer from Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, of New York, and a
large series of small mammals from Germany and of squirrels from
Asia.

Among the ornithological material were about 300 Cuban and Porto
Rican birds collected by Mr. B. 8. Bowdish; a quantity of Cuban
birds collected by Mr. William Palmer; a series of East Indian birds
from the Royal Museum of Natural History at Leiden, Holland; a
large number of Brazilian birds from the Museu Paulista at Sao
Paulo, Brazil, besides smaller collections from Mexico, Cocos Island,
Hawaii, and Great Britain. Several rare species of birds’ eggs were
also obtained.

The reptilian collection was enriched by the field work in Cuba and
Porto Rico of Mr. B. S$. Bowdish and Mr. William Palmer, and
valuable specimens were also received from Japan, Sumatra, and the
Philippine Islands.

The Division of Fishes was fortunate in securing, through Messrs.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. yA5)

Anderson and Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark
(Lhinodon) 13 feet long, the first of its kind recorded as having been
taken in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Leland Stanford Junior Uni-
versity presented the types of a large number of Japanese fishes described
by Dr. David S$. Jordan, and also specimens from Panama, Cocos
Island, and the Galapagos Islands. <A collection of Egyptian fishes
from the Nile was contributed by Dr. Bashford Dean, of Columbia
University, and interesting material from several sources was trans-
mitted by the U. S. Fish Commission.

Twelve species of land shells from Cocos Island, cotypes of species
described in E. von Marten’s work on the mollusks of that locality,
were donated by Mr. William H. Dall. Some 2,000 shells from Lower
California were received from Lieut. C. A. Clarke, U. 8. Navy, and
a number of new species of North American land shells from Mr. J. H.
Ferris, of Joliet, Illinois.

The largest addition to the Division of Insects comprised about
65,000 specimens collected in Arizona by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Cus-
todian of the Coleoptera in the Museum, at his own expense, and by
him presented to the national collections. The Museum was already
indebted to this generous friend for the gift of his extensive private
collection previously formed.» Some 7,000 -insects of several groups
were brought from the Hawaiian Islands by Mr. W. H. Ashmead,
and 10,000 specimens of lepidoptera from Colorado by Dr. H. G.
Dyar, assisted by Mr. A. N. Caudell. The expeditions on which this
material was secured are referred to elsewhere. Ten thousand beau-
tifully prepared specimens of butterflies, mainly from Mexico and
Yentral America, have been deposited in the Museum by Mr. Wil-
liam Schaus, of Twickenham, England.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received from the U.S. Fish
Commission a series of Porto Rican sponges, identified by Dr. H. Y.
Wilson, of the University of North Carolina; echini and holothurians
from the same locality, identified by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet
College; the crustaceans and echinoderms collected during the expedi-
tion of 1901 to the Hawaiian Islands; and a quantity of material from
the marine station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The extensive col-
lection of corals made some years ago at the Philippine Islands by
Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C. Worcester was obtained by pur-
chase. Among the smaller accessions of importance were a quantity
of marine invertebrates from Ellesmere Land, collected by Mr. Robert
Stein; a series of the cave crustaceans of Kentucky and ‘Tennessee
from Prof. W. P. Hay; a number of Alaskan crustaceans from Mr.
R. 5S. McGregor, of the U. S. Coast Survey steamer Pathfinder, and
samples of the Atlantic sea bottom from the U. S. Navy.

Through the generous bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville,
North Carolina, who died in July, 1901, the Division of Plants became
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

possessed of his entire collection of flowering plants, comprising more
than 18,000 specimens, chiefly from the southern United States. Two
years previously Dr. Mohr had presented to the Museum his collection
of about 3,000 specimens of cryptogamic plants from the same region.
From his trip to Central America during the summer of 1901 Dr.
J. N. Rose brought back a large number of plants, including specimens
from Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl, and also some living
plants, which were deposited in the greenhouse of the Department of
Agriculture. A valuable collection from China and the Philippine
Islands was contributed by the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew, Eng-
land; over 6,000 plants from various parts of the United States and
from Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, and Porto Rico were transmitted by
the Department of Agriculture; and about 4,200 Chinese plants were
acquired by purchase.

In the Department of Geology the accessions have been numerous,
and in some of its divisions of more than ordinary importance. The
total number of specimens received was 31,563, nearly 90 per cent
being fossil invertebrates. Among the rocks and ores transmitted by
the U. S. Geological Survey were many specimens illustrative of its
recent explorations in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon. <A _ large
quantity of ore samples from the United States exhibit at the Paris
Exposition of 1900 was turned over to the Museum by the Government
board. The minerals added comprise many varieties, a number of
which were not previously represented. Especially worthy of mention
are a fine specimen of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada; a mag-
nificent mass of moss gold on quartz from the ‘* Miner’s Dream” mine,
Old Chester district, California; characteristic samples of Alaskan gold;
fine specimens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Washington;
axinite from Switzerland and Japan; beautiful crystals of tourmaline
from Mesa Grande, California; zeolites from Golden, Colorado; anda
beautiful mass of the so-called needle ore (Géthite) from Ironwood,
Michigan. The following species new to the collection were also
obtained: Narsarsukite, percylite, yttrocerite, picroallumogene, bornite
(in crystals), espistolite, plumboferrite, ankylite, sulvanite, thalenite,
elpidite, and lossenite. Fine specimens of tourmaline and amethyst
were received as a gift from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, Honorary Custo-
dian of Gems and Precious Stones.

The meteorite collection was increased during the year to the extent
of 20 falls, and now comprises specimens representing a total of 356
distinct falls. The most valuable addition was a stony iron meteorite
from Admire, Kansas. The sources of other important specimens
were as follows: Misshof, Courland, Russia; Rafriti, Switzerland;
Cereseti, Piedmont, Italy; St. Mesmin, Salles and Lancon, France;
Sao Juliio de Moreira, Portugal; Limerick, Ireland; Shalka, Bengal,
India; Rhine Villa, South Australia; Weston, Connecticut; Algona,
z REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27

Wisconsin; Monroe, North Carolina; ‘Tombigbee, Alabama; Tonea-
noxie and Kiowa County, Kansas, and San Angelo and Kendall County,
Texas.

In invertebrate paleontology there were several very large and
important additions. Some 15,000 specimens, including 10,000 brach-
iopods, +,200 bryozoans, many cretaceous forms from New Jersey, and
eystids and crinoids from Maryland, composing the private collection
of Mr. Charles Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Stratigraphic Paleontol-
ogy, were donated by him to the Museum. Prof. George M. Perdew
also presented his entire collection of Silurian and Devonian fossils,
about 1,300 specimens, from Cumberland, Maryland. The E. O,
Ulrich collection of Ostracoda, containing about 5,000 specimens and
the type and figured specimens of 100 species was acquired by pur-
chase. The transmissions from the Geological Survey included 3,755
specimens of Cambrian brachiopods, which had been the subject of
special study by the Director, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

The extensive series of teeth of the elephant and mastodon, obtained
by Mr. W. H. Holmes at Afton, Indian Territory, associated with
prehistoric implements, has proved of great interest, several species
being represented.

The accessions in paleobotany include a valuable collection of fossil
plants, comprising the type specimens described by Prof. Ebenezer
Emmons in his American Geology, part 6, 1857; 100 specimens from
the auriferous gravels of California, collected by Mr. C. D. Voy; 40
specimens from what may be the Upper Jurassic formation in the
vicinity of the Corwin coal mine, near Cape Lisburne, Alaska; about
300 specimens from the Miocene Lake beds of the South Fork of John
Day River, in Grant County, Oregon, transmitted by the Geological
Survey, and about 100 specimens of Upper Carboniferous plants from
the vicinity of Plympton, Missouri, described by Mr. David White in
the Fossil Flora of the Coal Measures of Missouri, and presented by
Dr. John H. Britts, of Plympton.

The approximate number of specimens received by the Museum
during the year and the total number in the possession of the Museum
at the close of the year are recorded by subjects in the following table:

EXPLORATIONS.

Owing to the very limited means available for field researches, the
amount of work of this character carried on by assistants of the
Museum has been relatively small, and most of the expeditions made
were only rendered possible through cooperation with other bureaus
of the Government or through the generosity of individuals. The
Government explorations by which the Museum is most benefited are
those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the
Smithsonian Institution. Officers of the Army and Navy, with the
exceptional opportunities now efforded them, have also been doing
some excellent work for the Museum, especially in the Philippine
Islands. In this connection mention should likewise be made of the
important explorations which Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has
been carrying on for several years in the East Indies entirely at his
own expense, the results being generously donated to this Institution.
The latter comprise large collections in zoology and ethnology, whose
value is enhanced by the fact of their coming from a region hitherto
but poorly represented in any museum in the world. The field work
engaged in during the year by members of the Museum staff was as
follows:

Mr. W. H. Holmes, Head Curator of Anthropology, visited Indian
Territory and Missouri, in the former investigating an interesting
deposit of flint implements and bone utensils associated with the
remains of extinct and recent mammals at Afton and an ancient chert
quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, and in the latter examining,
near Kimmswick, an extensive deposit of fossil mammals in which
human remains were said to occur,and an ancient village site contain-
ing stone implements and pottery. The investigations begun by Dr.
Walter Hough in Arizona, in June, 1901, were continued through the
summer, in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates, of Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, and chiefly at the expense of the latter. An archeological
section was made on a north and south line from Fort Apache to
Moki, a distance of about 180 miles, and a large amount of material
was obtained. Ethnographical work was also done among the Apache,
Navaho, and Hopi Indians, and two new groups of ruins north of
Holbrook were mapped.

Mr. W. H. Ashmead, who accompanied an expedition of the U.S.
Fish Commission to the Hawaiian Islands in May, 1901, for the pur-
pose of making collections of insects and of studying the insect fauna
of these new possessions, returned late in the summer with an impor-
tant lot of material. Mr. B. 8. Bowdish, formerly of the U.S. Army
in Porto Rico, was employed for about seven months in procuring
zoological specimens, chiefly birds, in Porto Rico, in eastern Cuba,
and on Mona Island. Mr. C. L. Pollard and Mr. William Palmer
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

accompanied Dr. Edward Palmer, of the Department of Agriculture,
in the spring of 1902 on an expedition to eastern Cuba, where they
obtained an interesting collection of plants, birds, bats, insects, and
marine invertebrates.

The station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, on the south
coast of Newfoundland, was visited during the summer of 1901 by Dr.
Frederick W. True, who made a special study of the sulphur-bottom
whales, obtained many photographs, and arranged for the preparation
and shipment to Washington of the skeleton of a large whale. Ina
collecting trip to Colorado, Dr. H. G. Dyar, in company with Mr.
A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, secured some 10,000
specimens of Lepidoptera, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz made in Arizona,
at his own expense, a very large collection of insects. Two months
during the spring of 1902 were spent in southern Illinois by Mr. Robert
Ridgway in the interest of the Division of Birds. Botanical explora-
tions were carried on in Central America during the summer of 1901
by Mr. J. N. Rose, assisted by Mr. Robert Hay, of Washington.

Important collections were made by Mr. Charles Schuchert of
Helderbergian fossils in New York and of Cretaceous fossils in New
Jersey. Mr. F. W. Crosby obtained for the Museum a remarkably
fine series of potholes from the basalt rocks near Snake River Falls,
Idaho. ,

Outfits to be used in collecting material for the National Museum
have been furnished to the following persons: Mr. F. L. J. Boettcher,
Washington, District of Columbia; Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. Army;
Mr. H. Caracciolo, Port of Spain, Trinidad; Capt. Luther S. Kelly,
Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands; Prof. O. F. Cook, U. 5.
Department of Agriculture; Mr. W. W. Simpson, Shanghai, China;
Mr. Arthur B. Chilson, New York City; Miss Thora Stejneger,
Washington, District of Columbia; Mr. Charles S. Banks, Bacolod,
Negros, Philippine Islands; Dr. 8. P. Bartlett, Quincy, Illinois; and
Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. 8. Army.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANG:! OF SPECIMENS.

Six thousand five hundred and three specimens have been sent to
specialists for study, in some cases as loans, in others to be worked up
for the Museum. The gifts to educational establishments and the
material used in making exchanges comprised 30,893 specimens. The
gifts have consisted of duplicate series of marine invertebrates and
fishes, and of the collections, recently prepared, to illustrate rock
weathering and soil formation.

A detailed statement of all the material sent out is contained in
Appendix III. The following table shows the number of lots of speci-
mens sent to each State and foreign country:

RESEARCHES.

The amount of work involved in the care and preservation of the
collections leaves to the members of the Museum staff comparatively
little time for original investigation, though the act founding the
Museum directs the classification and arrangement of the specimens
placed in its custody. By consulting the Proceedings, Bulletins, and
Annual Reports of the Museum, however, it will be seen that the
scientific assistants do contribute extensively every year toward the
advancement of science, each in the line of his special study. The
working up of many groups of objects is also intrusted to scientific
men not connected with the Museum, who give their services gratui-
tously, and many specimens are lent to aid in investigations carried on
at the various scientific establishments throughout the country. Type
specimens or choice objects, however, are only allowed to be taken
away from the Museum in exceptional instances, and when their safety
can be assured. In its present crowded condition the Museum has
very scanty accommodations for visiting students, but all applicants
are allowed to avail themselves of such facilities as exist.

In the Department of Anthropology the head curator continued his
investigations in aboriginal art and the preparation of reports on pot-
tery and stone implements. He also gave much time toward the com-
pletion of a paper on the Classification and Arrangement of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

Collections of an Anthropological Museum. Prof. O. T. Mason,
Curator of Ethnology, made considerable progress in his researches on
aboriginal basketry, on which subject he is preparing an important
monograph. Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator, was mainly occu-
pied in working up the results of his explorations with Mr. Peter G.
Gates in Arizona during the summer of 1901.

Some of the visiting specialists to the Department of Anthropology,
with the objects of their inquiries, were Dr. Franz Boas, of the Ameri-
van Museum of Natural History, New York City, mainly the Indian
tribes of the northwest coast of America; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Pueblo tribes; Lieut. W. E.
Safford, U.S. Navy, for several years stationed on the island of Guam,
collections of ethnology from the South Sea islands; Dr. O. F. Cook,
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, ethnobotanic material from
Mexico; Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army, the industries of
the American Indians; Prof. W. T. Brigham, of Honolulu, the Poly-
nesian collections; and Prof. A. C. Haddon, of Cambridge, England,
ethnological material in several branches. A collection of Hopi games
and ceremonial objects was lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin,
director of the Free Museum of Science and Art of the University of
Pennsylvania.

In all divisions of the Department of Biology a considerable amount
of research work was accomplished. Mr. G. 5. Miller, jr., published
five papers on mammals, based mainly on collections recently received
from Dr. W. L. Abbott, several notes on nomenclature and classifica-
tion, and jointly with Mr. James A. G. Rehna list of the land mammals
of North America. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., completed two papers on bats
and one on the Venezuelan mammals, collected by Capt. Wirt Robinson
and himself, and has also studied the skeletons of American hares and
pikas.

Good progress has been made by Mr. Robert Ridgway on his Manual
of the Birds of North and Middle America, the first volume of which
was published during the year, the second being now nearly ready for
the press. The birds from the Andaman and Nicobar islands, pre-
sented by Dr. Abbott, have been reported on, and those from Linga
Island identified by Dr. C. W. Richmond.

The general collection of reptiles and batrachians has been reidenti-
fied, preparatory to their rearrangement in new cases, by Mr. Leonhard
Stejneger, who also continued his researches on the reptile faunas of
the Antilles and Japan. Sixteen papers on the fishes of Japan, by
President D. 8. Jordan and Messrs. J. O. Snyder, E.*C. Starks, and
M. Sindo, were published in the Proceedings, types of the new species
described being presented to the Museum. <A collection of fishes
made in Japan in 1883 and 1885 for the Museum by Mr. Pierre L. Jouy
was also worked up by Messrs. Jordan and Snyder. Dr. Tarleton H.

34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean completed reports on the fishes of New York
for the State museum, and of Great South Bay, New York, for the
New York Fish Commission, and notes by the latter on a whale shark
from Florida, a steelhead salmon, and a larval conger eel were pub-
lished by the Museum. Dr. Theodore Gill and Mr. Bean reported on
the collection of Egyptian fishes from the Nile presented by Dr. Bash-
ford Dean.

In the Division of Mollusks the curator, Mr. William H. Dall, has
continued his work of revising and summarizing the groups of Amer-
ican bivalves, both Tertiary and recent. His researches during the
year have comprised the preparation of a report on the newly discovered
Eocene of Alaska and the revision of the family Veneride, one of the
largest and most interesting of all the groups of bivalves. -Mr. Paul
Bartsch has made good progress in his studies of the Pyramidellide of
the Pacific coast, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson has continued his inves-
tigations on the Naiades of the world.

Mr. James E. Benedict has finished his monograph, begun some
time ago, on the Crustacean family Galatheidee. The work completed
or in progress by Miss M. J. Rathbun has comprised studies upon the
macruran and brachyuran crustaceans of the northwest coast; a list of
the decapods of the northwest coast for the report of the Harriman
Alaskan Expedition; a report upon the stalked-eyed crustaceans col-
lected in Japan by Dr. D. S. Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder; a deserip-
tion of a new species of fossil crab from the northeast coast of Brazil,
for Dr. J. C. Branner’s work on the geology of that region; identifi-
cations of the brachyura and macrura collected by the U. S. Fish Com-
mission in Hawaii, in 1901, and studies upon the fresh-water crabs
belonging to the Museum of Natural History of Paris. Miss Harriet
Richardson, collaborator, has completed for Prof. A. E. Verrill a
report upon the Esopods of the Bermudas, and has begun studies upon
the Japanese Isopods collected by the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross, Dr. Jordan and Mr. Snyder, and upon the Bopyridee in the
Museum collection. She also has in press descriptions of a new fresh-
water Isopod from Indiana and a new terrestrial Isopod from Cuba.

Under arrangements with specialists connected with other establish-
ments, the collections in several of the groups of aquatic invertebrates
are being worked up for the National Museum, as follows: The sertu-
larian and companularian hydroids by Prof. C. C. Nutting, of Iowa
University, whose monograph on the Plumularide was recently issued
as a special bulletin; the holothurians by Prof. Charles L. Edwards,
of Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, and Prof. H. L. Clark, of
Olivet College, Michigan, the former having the Pedata, the latter
the Apoda; the parasitic copepod crustaceans by Prof. Charles B.
Wilson, of the State Normal School, Westfield, Massachusetts, who
completed during the year a monograph on the family Argulide,

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

which has been printed in the Proceedings; the recent corals by Mr.
T. Wayland Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey; the crayfishes
by Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, Washington, District of
Columbia; the Pycnogonide by Prof. Leon J. Cole, of the University
of Michigan; the Alpheide by Dr. H. Coutiére, of the Museum of
Natural History, Paris; the leeches by Dr. J. Percy Moore, of the
University of Pennsylvania, and the Ascidians from the North Pacific
Ocean by Dr. William E. Ritter, of the University of California.

Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of Insects, has published dur-
ing the year a large number of papers, mainly of an economic char-
acter. Mr. William H. Ashmead has continued his classification work
on the Hymenoptera, has completed his classification of the Chalcid
flies and has spent some time on the preparation of a monograph of
the North American Braconide, begun ten years ago. He has also
finished, for publication by the Washington Academy of Sciences,
reports on the Rynchota of the Harriman expedition, and on the
Hymenoptera of the Galapagos Islands, collected by the expedition of
the Leland Stanford Junior University. Mr. Ashmead has likewise
made much progress upon a catalogue of the Hymenoptera of North
America and the West Indies. Mr. D. W. Coquillett has completed
a synopsis of the dipterous family Chironomid. Dr. H. G. Dyar
has in course of publication a bulletin entitled A Catalogue of North
American Lepidoptera North of Mexico. Mr. Rolla P. Currie has
been engaged in monographing the North American species of the
ant-lion flies, and has begun the compilation of a cataloeue of the
Neuropteroid insects of North America.

In the Division of Plants, Mr. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator,
continued his investigations on the genera Sa/ir and ibes and the
preparation of a work on the flora of Alaska. His publications dur-
ing the year included papers on a new genus of Alaskan heather, //vr-
rimanella, and on two species of Pzbes. Dr. J. N. Rose was occupied
in the study of Mexican plants, and engaged with Dr. N. L. Britton in
preparing a revision of the Crassulaceze of North America. Mr. C. L.
Pollard prepared several papers descriptive of new species of violets
and of Chamecrista and a popular account of plant families. Mr.
W. R. Maxon published several notes on ferns.

The collections of mammals and birds are frequently consulted by
the assistants of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agricul-
ture. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. Army, spent the summer and
early autumn in continuing his work upon the natural history of the
Mexican Boundary Survey, more especially in regard to the mammals
and birds. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chi-
cago, examined the mammals of Mexico and Central America, and
Mr. John S. McDonald, of Milwaukee, conducted studies upon the
North American mammals in general.
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

sin, Assistant Curator of Mineralogy. ‘Two papers by the former
relating to the Felix and Admire meteorites were published during the
year, and one by Mr. Tassin on a large mass of meteoric iron from
Casas Grandes has been prepared. The latter has also continued his
studies on the dehydration of the ferric hydrates.

Mr. Charles Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Paleontology, has given
attention to the Silurian and Lower Devonian fossils of the Appa-
lachian region and to fossil starfishes. The monograph of the Ste-
gosauria, by Mr. Lucas, is still in course of preparation. He has also
made studies of certain features in the structure of //esperornis and
Baptornis, and has examined a collection of fossil birds from the
Pliocene of Oregon, submitted by Prof. J. C. Merriam.

Many specimens in the line of physical and chemical geology,
requested for research work, have been supplied to assistants on the
U.S. Geological Survey and to others, but the greatest amount of
assistance rendered by this department has been given by the division
of paleontology. Several eminent paleontologists have visited the
Museum for the purpose of examining collections, and to a number of
specialists material has been sent for investigation in their own labor-
atories. Among those who received aid in this direction were the fol-
lowing: Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of Natural
History, in connection with his monograph on the fossil mammalian
group of Titenotheres; Dr. O. P. Hay and Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the
same museum, the former having in preparation a work on the North

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

F. Eaton, of the Peabody Museum of Yale University, in his studies
of Triassic fishes of the genus /schypterus; Mr. A. P. Martin, of the
Maryland Geological Survey, and Dr. John M. Clarke, of the New
York State Museum, in their researches on the Miocene and Devonian
fossils, especially of Maryland; Prof. J. EK. Duerden, of Johns Hop-
kins University, on Paleozoic corals; Dr. C. KE. Beecher, of the Pea-
body Museum, on the fossil brachiopod genus Platystrophia; Mr. F.N.
Balch, of Boston, on arctic fossil shells; Mr. and Mrs. T. 8. Oldroyd,
of California, on the fossil shells of the Pacific coast. The entire col-
lection of Middle Devonian crinoids was sent to Miss Elvira Wood,
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who will classify and
report upon the species. The collection of fossil plants from the Cor-
win coal mine at Cape Lisburne, Alaska, presented by Mr. A. G.
Maddren, together with other specimens from, the same place, were
turned over to Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Vir-
ginia, for study in connection with. material recently procured from
the same locality by Mr. F. C. Schrader, of the U. S. Geological Sur-
vey. Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Garden, exam-
ined the collections of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary plants in
connection with researches on some parts of those groups.

PROGRESS IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The crowded state of most of the exhibition halls has prevented
extensive additions to the display collections except in a few direc-
tions. Much was accomplished, however, toward improving the con-
dition and appearance of these collections by small additions and by
the substitution in many instances of better material and of a higher
class of preparations. Considerable progress was also made toward
completing the system of labeling. It had been anticipated that pro-
vision would have to be made during the year for housing the exhibit
made by the Museum at the Pan-American Exposition. A large part
of the material was, however, sent to the South Carolina Interstate
and West Indian Exposition, but before the close of the year the
entire collection was back in Washington. The objects returned
directly from Buffalo have been mainly cared for by the transfer to
storage of some of the less desirable preparations previously dis-
played, and by utilizing temporarily a part of the lecture hall.

In the Department of Anthropology several of the halls have been
thoroughly renovated and in some the collections have been rein-
stalled. The cases in the north-west range, devoted to the northwest
coast Indians, and in the Pueblo court, have been rearranged, and
many have been removed to provide space for the large family groups
returned from the Pan-American Exposition. Material from the
Philippine and the South Sea Islands has been installed in Kensington
cases on the north gallery of the west hall.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

The work of arranging the collections of prehistoric archeology
according to geographical divisions has been continued, six slope-top
vases having been fitted up during the year with the following exhib-
its: Flint implements from ancient quarry sites and workshops in
middle Egypt; stone implements, spearheads, stone beads, shell orna-
ments and small pottery vessels from the island of Utilla, Honduras;
stone beads, carved stone pendants, a copper ax, pottery spindle-
whorls, ete., from Mexico; stone implements and utensils, shell imple-
ments, pottery vessels, ete., from the islands of St. Kitts, St. Barthol-
omew, and Nevis, West Indies; polished stone hatchets from St.
Elizabeths Parish, Jamaica; polished stone hatchets, shell implements,
and large pottery bowls from Jamaica. In the alcove containing the
antiquities from western Asia the plaster casts have been rearranged,
and casts from Persepolis and a large relief map of Palestine have
been added.

Thirty-eight wing frames containing photographs supplementing
the collections relating to the Jewish religion, Mohammedanism,
Brahmanism, and the Greco-Roman religions have been placed on the
south gallery of the west hall, and many improvements in this series
have been made.

Many articles have been added to the collections of American history
in the north hall, but this hall has long been overcrowded, and a
number of interesting objects which belong to it are still in storage.

Extensive improvements have been made in the installation of the
collections in mechanical technology, especially in the sections of land
and water transportation, and many additions have been made to the
collections in electricity. The type collection of small firearms of
early patterns and of modern breech-loading and magazine guns has
been suitably installed and labeled. The series of time-keeping appa-
ratus, including some interesting recent additions, has been arranged
in special cases in the east hall. Noteworthy among its contents are
a variety of sundials, including one used by the Montagnais Indians
of Canada—a pole set upright in the snow-—several rare sunglasses, a
fine Persian astrolobe, a German time-indicating lamp, a water clock
of the seventeenth century, and watches dating from the beginning of
the fifteenth century.

Among the additions in the Department of Biology were many
finely mounted specimens of American mammals and birds, a part of
the display at the Pan-American Exposition, the former including a
large specimen of Steller’s sea lion, an Alaskan moose, a British Colum-
bian caribou, a musk ox, a glacier and a Kadiak bear, two wild sheep
(Ovis dalli and O. stone/), and a skeleton of the Kadiak bear. Three
groups of game birds were added to the series of game animals. In
the southeast Museum range, allotted to reptiles, batrachians, and
fishes, some improvements have been made, several new cases being
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4]

provided, many new preparations replacing older ones, and a number
of large forms not previously represented being added. Among’ the
latter were a cast of the King Cobra snake with accessories represent-
ing the edge of an Indian jungle, a very large Mata-mata turtle from
the Amazon River, a hugh alligator snapper, the largest of the North
American water turtles, several boas, lizards, toads, and frogs. An
exhibit of lizards will be arranged in some of the wall cases. Amone
the additions to the exhibition series of fishes was the cast of a large
white, or man-eater, shark.

The permanent installation of insects in the hall recently assigned
to this group at the western end of the Smithsonian building has pro-
gressed to the extent of mounting about 2,700 specimens in 20 of the
standard boxes occupying several upright cases. In the labeling of
this series attention has especially been called to species of peculiar
habits and to those of most interest to the public.

A partial set of the colored plates of flowering plants, published in
the third edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas, has been placed on
exhibition in the Division of Botany.

To the display of vertebrate fossils have been added partial skele-
tons of the large T7ricerutops prorsus, of the carnivorous dinosaur,
Allosaurus, and of the toothed bird, /lesperornis regalis. The instal-
lation of the Harris collection of invertebrate fossils, In a section of
the rail-case of the gallery in the southeast court, has been practically
completed. This collection, received in 188, is one of the finest yet
made in the region it represents, being especially rich in crinoids, star-
fishes, and trilobites, containing of the last group about 600 out of the
750 species known from the Cincinnati formation.

The collections relating to physical and chemical geology have, in
part, been thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and about LOO pho-
tographs, maps, and other pictures illustrative of these subjects have
been placed on the adjoining walls. The building of galleries in the
south-west range made it necessary to remoye for a time the collection
of minerals, which at the close of the year was being reinstalled after
careful renovation.

VISITORS.

The number of visitors to the Museum building was 173,888 and
to the Smithsonian building 144,107. The tables following show,
respectively, the attendance during each month of the past year and
for each year beginning with 1881, when the Museum building was
first opened to the public.

« Years of Presidential inaugurations.

On the evening of February 17, 1902, the Museum building was
open from 8 to 11 o’clock to enable the historical collections to be
specially viewed by the Society of the Daughters of the American

Revolution, then in session in the city. The President-veneral and
other officers of the society received in the lecture hall. As the build-
ing is a public one, no one who applied was denied admission, thoueh
the attendance was chiefly made up of members of the society. The
total number present was 2,087.

The meetings of the National Academy of Sciences were also held
this year in the Museum building on April 15, 16,and 17. The offices
of the assistant secretary were used for the business meetings of the
academy and council, while the reading of papers took place in the
lecture hall.

CORRESPONDENCE.

The Museum correspondence, which has always been very heavy,
increases in volume from year to year. Outside of ordinary routine
matters, it is occasioned for the most part by requests for informa-
tion, coming from all parts of the world and relating to a wide range
of subjects. Specimens, often in large lots, are transmitted for iden-
tification, and questions are submitted in regard to all branches of
knowledge falling within the Museum’s scope. The requests also
have reference to Museum administration, the building up and main.
tenance of collections, the construction of cases, the installation, label-
ing, and cataloguing of specimens, and, in fact, no topic connected
with a great museum or suggested by its existence escapes notice. In
accordance with the time-honored custom of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, every communication made in good faith and appropriate to be
considered is fully answered, even though this necessitates incessant
demands upon the members of the scientific staff, whose regular duties
are quite sufficient to occupy their entire time. The number of lots
of specimens determined and reported upon during the year at the
request of correspondents was nearly TOO.

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information is
accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of which
more than 20,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed during the
year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents.

As the Museum has no facilities for making chemical analyses,
requests for work of this kind have to be refused.

PUBLICATIONS.

The most noteworthy publication of the year was the first volume
of a monographic series by Mr. Robert Ridgway on the Birds of
North and Middle America, which appeared in the autumn of 1901,
This volume describes the species of the family Fringillidee or Finches.
The families Tanagridx, Icteride, Coerebidee, and Mniotiltide, or
Tanagers, Troupials, Honey-creepers, and Wood-warblers will be cov

ered by the second volume, now in press. Mr. Ridgway has given
much time and care to the preparation of this important work.

Volume xxi of the Proceedings was issued in February, 1902.
It contains 35 papers (numbered from 1206 to 1240, inclusive), 24 of
which were written by members of the Museum staff and 11 by cor-
respondents and collaborators. Eight of the papers relate to fishes,
mainly Japanese, 7 to insects, and the remainder to fossil vertebrates,
reptiles, recent and fossil mollusks, marine invertebrates, and plants.
Proceedings papers 1241 to 1274, inclusive, comprising Volume xx1v,
have been published in the form of separates.

A most useful work produced during the year, constituting Bulletin
51, was a list of the publications of the Museum, being a catalogue of
all volumes and separate papers issued from 1875 to 1900, with an
index by titles. It was prepared by Mr. R. I. Geare.

The papers comprising the general appendix to the annual report
for 1900 have been issued in separate form, but the volume itself was
not received from the Government Printing Office until after the close
of the year. The opening article, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, is based on
anthropological investigations by the author in California. — Prof.
O. T. Mason describes some aboriginal American harpoons. Mr.
Charles K. Wead, of the United States Patent Office, contributes an
article on the history of musical scales, and Dr. Walter Hough one on
Hopi ceremonial pigments. A sketch of the history of ceramic art in
China, with a catalogue of the Hippisley collection of Chinese porce-
lains, is reprinted, with some additions, from the report of 1888. The
author, Mr. Alfred E. Hippisley, commissioner of the imperial mari-
time customs service of China, has had on deposit in the National
Museum for several years a most interesting and valuable collection of
Chinese porcelains, and is well fitted to write upon this subject. A
ratalogue of the collection of gems in the National Museum, by Mr.
Wirt Tassin, contains descriptions of the gem minerals and their prop-
erties, comparative tables of the colors and distinguishing characters
of the principal varieties, and articles on the cutting of gems, their
artificial formation, supposed mystical properties, etc. A descriptive
catalogue of the meteorite collection, by the same author, is designed
partly to facilitate the exchange of specimens.

Part N of Bulletin No. 39, entitled Directions for Collecting and
Preparing study Specimens of small Mammals, by Mr. Gerrit 5.
Miller, has been reprinted in a revised edition, with abstracts in Ger-
man, French, and Spanish. Directions for collectors of American
Basketry, by Prof. O. T. Mason, has been added to the same bulletin
asebart 2.

A circular designed to accompany a series of collections prepared by
the Museum, illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45

giving the results of the analyses of materials similar to those included
in the collections, has been prepared by Dr. George P. Merrill, and
published as No. 51 in the Museum series of circulars.

The distribution of Museum publications during the year to estab-
lishments and individuals in this country and abroad has amounted to
about 6,500 volumes and 25,000 pamphlets.

In Appendix IV will be found a list of the publications of the
Museum and of the members of its staff. The number of authors
represented is 91 and the total number of papers cited 327. In the
following table these papers are classed according to subjects:

Fifteen papers written by members of the Museum staff and based
on Museum collections have, by permission of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, been printed in publications other than those
of the Museum. The authors of these papers are as follows: Mr.
Robert Ridgway, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Mr.
B. A. Bean, Mr. C. L. Pollard, Mr. W. R. Maxon, Dr. M. W. Lyon,
jr., Mr. William Palmer, and Mr. J. H. Riley.

LIBRARY.

The Museum library now contains over 16,000 bound volumes and
28,500 unbound papers. The additions during the year consisted of
613 books, 13,065 pamphlets, and 5,885 parts of periodicals. There
were catalogued 750 books, 1,439 pamphlets, and $,297 parts of peri-

PHOTOGRAPHY.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, the photographer of the Museum, reports that
1,621 negatives, 2,890 silver prints, 8378 platinum prints, 32 lantern
slides, and 2,060 blue prints were made during the year. <A part of
his time was also allotted to the Zoological Park, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Mr. Smillie was appointed chairman of the jury of awards on pho-
tography for the Pan-American Exposition, causing his absence from
Washington during about a month of the summer of 1901. While
serving in this capacity he made a large number of photographs of
different exhibits for the Government Board of the Exposition.

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGICAL WORK.

Fifty-two mammals, including a specimen of Steller’s sea lion, were
mounted during the year and added to the exhibition series. Eighty-
five specimens in the flesh, from the National Zoological Park and
other sources, were received and properly treated. Between 300 and
400 of the small skins in vats were freed from grease and made over
into suitable form for permanent preservation. These included a
number of type specimens. Three new groups of game birds were
completed during the year, and 38 large birds and 12 smaller ones
were alsomounted. Fifty-one skins were prepared from birds received
in the flesh, and 112 specimens in the exhibition series were dismounted
and made into skins.

One thousand and sixty-four skulls of mammals, mostly of large
size, were cleaned by the Museum preparators, and more than 2,100
small skulls were cleaned by contract.

YOOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Valuable assistance has continued to be received from various depart-
ments and bureaus of the Government. Officers of the Army and
Navy stationed in the Philippine Islands and in other of the new pos-
sessions have made important contributions, having in some cases been
furnished with special outfits to facilitate their work of collecting.
Representatives of the Department of State abroad have also been
instrumental in securing interesting material. Special acknowlede-
ments are due to the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army for
many courtesies in connection with the transportation of specimens
and outfits to and from distant points. The relations of the Museum
to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Fish Commission, the Bio-
logical Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology,
in regard to collections transmitted, are referred to elsewhere.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Navy, Lieut. W. E.
Safford, U. S. Navy, who was stationed for some time on the island of
Guam, was permitted to spend several months at the Museum during
the winter of 1901-2 in classifying and labeling collections of anthro-
pology from the South Sea Islands.

EXPOSITIONS.

Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York,.—Vhis exposition
was opened on May 1, 1901, and continued until November 1 of the
same year. The large and attractive exhibit made by the National
Museum has been described in the Annual Report for 1901, in a joint
paper by Dr. Frederick W. True, the representative of the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Museum on the Government Board of Man-
agement, and Mr. William H. Holmes and Dr. George P. Merrill,
head curators, respectively, of anthropology and geology.

South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Lixposition, Charleston.—
In accordance with the direction of the President of the United States
that the Executive Departments and bureaus of the Government par-
ticipate in this exposition, which continued from December 1, 1901,
until May 31, 1902, a large collection selected from the exhibit of the
Museum at the Pan-American Exposition was shipped directly to
Charleston, the limitations of space making it impossible to utilize the
entire exhibit in that connection. Notwithstanding-the short period
available for arranging this display, it presented a fine appearance and
attracted much attention. A report by Dr. F. W. True on the exhibit
of the National Museum at this exposition is printed as Appendix V
to this report.

Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missour’.—¥or this expo-

appropriated $450,000 toward the erection of a Government building
and $800,000 for the preparation and installation of an exhibit by the
several departments and bureaus of the Government. Dr. Frederick
W. True, Head Curator of Biology, and with a long experience in
exposition work, has been appointed to represent the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Museum on the Government Board of
Management.

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF.

The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office
and three scientific departments, as follows: Anthropology, with 8
divisions and + sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 12 sections;
and Geology, with 3 divisions and 3 sections.

Besides the 3 head curators in charge of the departments, the
scientific staff at the close of the year consisted of 17 curators, 12
assistant curators, 14 custodians, 11 aids, + associates, and 2 collabo-
‘ators, making a total of 63 persons, of whom, however, only about
one-half received compensation from the Museum. Of the remainder,
who are serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity, the majority
were attached to other scientific bureaus of the Government.

The death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, which occurred on May 4, 1902,
deprived the Museum of one of its most earnest and helpful workers.
Widely distinguished for his studies and contributions on a variety of
anthropological subjects, Dr. Wilson’s interests lay chiefly in the field
of prehistoric archeology, and from 1889 he had charge, as curator,
of the extensive and important collections of this division of the
Museum.

Mr. William V. Cox, who was appointed to the Museum in 1879,
and has been its chief clerk since 1886, with important duties in con-
nection with all the recent expositions in which the Government has
participated, severed his official relations with the Museum in Feb-
ruary, 1902, greatly to the regret of his associates, to accept a more
responsible position elsewhere. The duties of this office have been
somewhat modified to better consolidate the administrative work, and
the title of its chief officer has been changed to administrative assist-
ant. This position was filled by the appointment of Mr. W. de C.
Ravenel, previously the assistant in charge of fish culture in the U. 8.
Fish Commission, who has joined to a long experience in the adminis-
trative work of that Bureau a familiarity with the preparation and
installation of Government exhibits.

Mr. George B. Turner has been made chief taxidermist, and Mr.
W. C. Phalen an aid in the Department of Geology. Dr. Peter Fire-
man, chemical geologist, resigned on September 9. t

Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, Curator of Reptiles and Batrachians, repre-
sented the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at the Fifth

ning on August 12. A brief account of the congress by Mr. Stejneger
will be found in Appendix VI.

A list of the members of the Museum staff is given in Appendix I.

NECROLOGY.

Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Arche-
ology in the National Museum, died on May 4, 1902. He was born
in New Brighton, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, on July 18, 1832.
He lived for a time in Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri, and later in Iowa,
enlisting in the Second Iowa Cavalry at the beginning of the civil war.
He served in the cavalry and infantry branches of the service until
1864 and was mustered out with the rank of colonel. For a number
of years he was engaged in the practice of law, from which he retired
in 1881 to enter the consular service of the United States. He repre-
sented this country at Ghent, Nantes, and Nice. His service as consul
extended over a period of five years, after which he spent two years in
traveling.

During his residence abroad Dr. Wilson devoted a great deal of
attention to the study of archeology, visited many of the localities
where ancient treasures were to be found, and had opportunities for
meeting and working with several of the noted anthropologists of
Europe. After returning to this country, he was placed in charge of
the Division of Prehistoric Archeology in the U.S. National Museum,
which position he held from 1889 to the time of his death. He was a
member of the Société d’ Anthropologie de Paris, the Société d’Arch-
éologie de Nantes, the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and
Ireland, the Order of Isabella of Spain, and the Order of Leopold; also
vice-president of the Anthropological Society of Washington, a fellow
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a mem-
ber of the American Oriental Society and of the Military Order of the
Loyal Legion. Dr. Wilson was a member of the Commission to the
Madrid Exposition of 1893, and of the Commission to the Brussels
Exposition in 1897, and a delegate to the International Congress of
Archeology in Paris in 1900.

Some of the important papers published by Dr. Wilson are as
follows: The Swastika, the earliest known Symbol, and its Migra-
tions, with Observations on the Migration of certain Industries in pre-
historic Times; Prehistoric Art, or the Origin of Art as manifested
in the Work of Prehistoric Man; Arrowpoints, Spearheads, and
Knives of Prehistoric Times; The Golden Patera of Rennes; A
Study of Prehistoric Anthropology; and Anthropology at the Paris
Exposition.

Mr. Charles T. Mohr, a generous benefactor of the National Museum,
was born in Esslingen, Wurtemberg, December 28, 1824, and died at

NAT MUS 1902-4
50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

Asheville, North Carolina, July 17, 1901. Although most of his life
was spent in the calling of a druggist, yet Dr. Mohr devoted much of
his time to the study of plants, and it is chiefly as a botanist that he is
known to the scientific world. He came to the United States in 1848,
having previously traveled to South America. He stopped first in
Cincinnati, but early the next year started for California. In 1857 he
settled at Mobile, Alabama, where he was engaged in the drug busi-
ness for many years. After making numerous smaller contributions,
he finally gave his entire private herbarium, comprising some 20,000
specimens, to the Smithsonian Institution, the cryptogamic plants hav-
ing come as a gift about two years before his death, and the flowering
plants as a bequest. This collection has now been installed and is
accessible to students of Southern plants, in which it is especially rich.
Dr. Mohr was the author of various botanical papers, but his crown-
ing work was Plant Life of Alabama, which was published posthu-
mously. It was the one regret of his last days not to see this work
finished, but he corrected all of the proofs and died only two weeks
before the volume was issued. Personally Dr. Mohr was a charming
and lovable man.

FOR THE YEAR 1901-2.

By Wiu1iam H. Hotes,
TTead Curator.

During the year a number of changes in the personnel of the
Department have taken place. Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the
Division of Prehistoric Archeology, died on May 4, 1902, after an
illness of several months. On May lt Mr. Paul Brockett was trans-
ferred from the position of clerk to the Head Curator, to the library
of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr. Paul Beckwith, Aid in the
Division of History and Biography, was designated to fill his place
temporarily. In June, Miss Louise A. Rosenbusch, stenographer,
wes transferred from the office of the curator of Prehistoric Arche-
ology to that of the Head Curator.

WORK OF THE YEAR.

The work of the year in the Department has been carried forward
with all possible dispatch. The extensive exhibit shown at the Pan-
American Exposition in Buffalo has been returned and reinstalled in
the Museum, constituting a very considerable addition to the exhibi-
tion series. ~The exhibit sent to Charleston was returned about the
close of the year and will be placed on exhibition at an early date.

The energies of the Department have been in a great measure
expended on the work of reinstalling the exhibits in halls in which
galleries were built’ during the year. The occasion was taken to
rearrange cases, perfect the classification, and improve the installa-
tion; and the close of the year finds the exhibition series of the
department much enlarged and in every way improved. ‘The new
galleries afford much additional space for laboratory purposes and for
storage.

COLLECTIONS.

The collections received during the year are of average importance,
and a number of them are enumerated in the following list:

‘COLLECTED FOR THE MUSEUM.

1. Archeological collection, consisting of a large number of flint
implements, utens?!s cf Sone, and the remains of extinct and recent

species of mammals (860 specimens), obtained from a sulphur spring at
Afton, Indian Territory, by W. H. Holmes, Head curator.

2. Explorations in Arizona, begun during the preceding year by
Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnology, yielded
a large body of material (2,200 specimens), consisting of pottery,
implements of stone, wood, shell ornaments, and human remains.

3. Explorations in Arizona conducted jointly by Mr. Peter G. Gates
and the National Museum, the latter represented by Dr. Walter
Hough, yielded large collections of archeological material. One-half
of the product, consisting of 701 specimens, was turned over to the
Museum. These collections are to be regarded as in large part a
gift to the Museum by Mr. Gates, as the expenses of the field work
were defrayed by him.

CARE OF COLLECTIONS.

The various collections received by the Department have been cata-
logued and cared for as in previous years. Much attention has been
given to the important work of destroying insect pests, and the
Department is now practically rid of them. The cataloguing is quite
up to date, and considerable work has been done on the recataloguing
of collections imperfectly entered in previous years.

In the laboratories much work has been accomplished. Numerous
‘asts of specimens have been made, a large number of vases have been
mended, and copies and models of many objects pertaining to the
Division of Technology have been constructed.

‘ INSTALLATION OF EXHIBITS.

As already indicated, much progress has been made in the work of
installing exhibits. Not only have the Exposition exhibits been
placed, but several of the halls have been entirely reinstalled and the
display made more attractive and instructive. Labeling has received
especial attention and is more nearly complete than at any previous
period.

STORAGE.

Owing to the crowded condition of the Museum, a large body of
material, comprising a considerable percentage of valuable specimens,
has been stored in outside buildings. During the year an attempt has
been made to find space for the more important storage material
within the Museum building, and nothing is now sent out which has
any special value or which could not readily be replaced in case of loss.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of this year has not been extensive. Dr. Walter
Hough continued explorations in Arizona begun during the preceding
‘REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57
year, having taken up on June 1 of the preceding year the joint explo-
ration arranged between the Museum and Mr. P. G. Gates, who fur-
nished the equipment. This portion of the season was spent in making
an archeological section from Fort Apache to Moki, about 180 miles
on a north and south line, with good results. Ethnological work was
done among the White Mountain Apaches, the Navahos, and Hopi.
After the close of the Museum-Gates expedition, Dr. Hough mapped
two new groups of ruins north of Holbrook, returning to Washineton
on September 22. During the season 60 ruins were visited and 18
excavated, many plans of ruins were made, and 3,000) specimens
collected.

The Head Curator spent a few weeks in archeological exploration in
the Middle West. A visit was made to Kimmswick, Missouri, where
examinations were made of an extensive deposit of fossil mammals
with which human remains were said to be associated, and to an
ancient village site where numerous specimens of pottery and stone
implements were secured. Later, collections were secured from an
ancient chert quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, Indian Terri-
tory, and important explorations were made at Afton, Indian Terri-
tory. Reports had reached the Museum from Dr. R. H. Harper, of
Afton, of the occurrence of flint implements in association with fossil
animals ina sulphur spring near that place. The spring was cleaned
out and about 800 very interesting implements were obtained, as well
asa great number of remains of fossil and recent animals. It was
determined that the fossil bones were connected with the original
deposits through which the spring rises and that the spring had been
made a place of sacrifice by the Indian tribes, and various articles had
been cast in as offerings to their gods.

The Head Curator also made a short trip into Pennsylvania, examin-
ing ancient soapstone quarries near Christiana, Lancaster County, and
rhyolite quarries in South Mountain, Adams County.

Dr. W. L. Abbott has continued his exploration in the East Indies,
and has forwarded important ethnological collections from Java and
elsewhere.

RESEARCHES.

The Head Curator continued his investigations in several branches
of aboriginal art, papers on pottery and stone implements being under
way. Particular attention was given to the completion of a paper on
the ‘* Classification and arrangement of the collections of an anthro-
pological museum.”

Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of the Division of Ethnology, has con-
tinued his investigations on aboriginal basketry, and has devoted much
time to the preparation of an extensive work on this subject. Assist-
ant Curator Walter Hough was engaged largely, after his return from
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

the field of his explorations in Arizona, in preparing a catalogue of his
extensive collection, and writing his report.

Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, has prosecuted studies for a num-
ber of months, giving especial attention to the ethno-botany of Guam,
and his paper is approaching completion.

The papers based on Museum material, published during the year
by the Head Curator, Professor Mason, Dr. Hough, and Dr. Thomas
Wilson, are mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix IV).
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1901-2.

By Freperick W. TRUE,
Head Curator.

The work of the fiscal year 1901-2 has been characterized by con-
tinued effort along lines already laid down rather than by new
departures. The collections have grown steadily and the scientific
investigation of new accessions has progressed continuously.

The zoological collections of the National Museum have grown to
immense size, rivaling,
other museum. Of insects there are in the Government collection
nearly 1,500,000 specimens; of recent shells nearly 1,000,000 speci-
mens; besides at least 500,000 specimens of other aquatic invertebrates,
about 200,000 specimens of fishes, more than 60,000 birds’ eges,

od

and in some cases surpassing, those of any

130,000 specimens of birds, more than 40,000 reptiles and batrachians,
and between 75,000 and 100,000 specimens of mammals, including the
collection of the Biological Survey, U. 8. Department of Agriculture.

The Pan-American Exposition (opened May 1, 1901, closed Novem-
ber 2, 1902) continued until the end of the first third of the fiscal year
covered by this report, and was followed by the South Carolina Expo-
sition (opened December 1, 1901, closed May 381, 1902), which con-
tinued until the close of the year. At both of these expositions
exhibits were made by the divisions dealing with vertebrates. A full
account of the Pan-American exhibit will be found in the Annual
Report for 1900-1901, pages 177-251.

SXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The principal improvements were in the halls devoted to the exhibi-
tion of insects and reptiles and batrachians. At the close of the last
year there were on exhibition 73 reptile casts and 11 batrachian casts.
The number of the former has been increased to 78 and of the latter
to 13. These figures do not give a just idea of the real improvement
made. Three new cases were provided and many inferior casts were
replaced by better ones, and several very large forms not previously
represented were added. These include a king cobra snake, with
accessories representing the edge of an Indian jungle; a very large

59
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

Amazon River turtle (Podocnemys); 2 mata-mata turtle, one of the
most remarkable of existing animals; a huge alligator snapper, the
largest of North American fresh-water turtles; several large boas and
other snakes, together with various lizards, toads, and frogs. The
series is far finer than ever before shown in the Museum. The space
available has now been practically all taken up, except certain cases
against the walls, in which it is proposed to make an exhibit of speci-
mens of lizards in formalin of species too small to cast. The entire
series shown, with but one or two exceptions, is American, and chiefly
North American. The reptile faunas of the Old World can not be
shown in the present restricted quarters.

An opportunity was found in April to proceed with the mounting
of a new insect exhibit, for which preparations were long under way.
With the aid of special assistants, the entire series o. North American
beetles was mounted, and in June placed on exhibition. ‘This series
occupies 20 standard exhibition boxes and comprises about 2,700
insects, representing .682 species. The collection is very carefully
installed and labeled, and in the case of species having habits or pecul-
iarities of more than ordinary interest the facts are briefly mentioned
in untechnical language. Work on other orders was progressing”
favorably at the close of the year.

In other classes than those mentioned the improvement of the exhi-
bition series was less marked, though many fine mounted specimens of
American mammals and birds exhibited at Buffalo were added. The
portion of the Pan-American exhibit sent to the Charleston Exposition
was returned just at the close of the fiscal year. The chief taxider-
mist, with the occasional help of one assistant, completed about 50
mammals for exhibition during the year, including one very large speci-
men, a Steller’s sea-lion. This spe :imen had originally been planned
for the Pan-American Expositic >, but could not be exhibited for lack
of space. It replaced a similiar mounted specimen which had been on
exhibition over twenty-five years and had deteriorated. Mention of
the principal vertebrates exhibited at Buffalo and now in the Museum
will be found in my previous report (p. 63) and in the Appendix to the
Museum Report for 1901 (p. 185).

The two large wall maps in the bird hall, representing the faunal
areas of the globe, were repainted and lettered, so as to be more intel-
ligible to the general public. Three new groups of American game
birds were added to the series begun last year, but the work could not
be continued further for lack of funds. A fine skeleton of the Kadiak
bear, presented by Mr. J. H. Kidder, and a skeleton of the giant
salamander of Japan, presented by Dr. C. Ishikawa, were added to
the exhibition series of the division of comparative anatomy. New
wall cases for the south end of the south hall were under construction
during the year, but not completed.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

The descriptive labels for vertebrates prepared for the Buffalo
Exposition were made use of in the permanent exhibition series as far
as practicable. The great series of labels of all kinds which had
accumulated in the editor’s office and was transferred to the custody
of the head curator some time ago, was examined by the curators of
tne several divisions, and such labels as were no longer of use were
picked out anc “scarded. Typewritten labels, many of them descrip-
ive, were prepared for the new exhibition series of North American
Coleoptera.

HXPLORATIONS.

As noted in last year’s report, Mr. W. H. Ashmead, Assistant Cura-
tor, Division of Insects, accompanied the U.S. Fish Commission expe-
dition to the Hawatian Islands for the purpose of collecting insects.
He left Washington in May, 1901, and returned in September, 1901,
having been in the islands about three months. An expedition to
Arizona for the purpose of collecting insects was undertaken by Mr.
E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, at his own expense. He also
paid the expenses of an assistant, and very generously turned over to
the Museum the large collection made. He was in the field from May
to August, 1901. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, accom-
panied by Mr. A. N. Caudell, who was detailed from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, made a very successful expedition to Colorado
for collecting Lepidoptera. The work occupied about two months—
from May, 1901, to July, 1901. By invitation of Dr. Edward Palmer,
Messrs. C. L. Pollard and William Palmer, of the Museum, spent two
months in eastern Cuba in the spring of 1902, and collected plants,
birds, bats, insects, and marine invertebrates. The Head Curator vis-
ited the whaling station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the
south coast of Newfoundland in June, 1901, and obtained much valu-
able information regarding the Sulphurbottom whales there taken,
and many photographs. He made arrangements for obtaining a skel
eton of one of these large animals at a later date. By arranement
with the War Department, Mr. B.S. Bowdish, a private in the Army,
was detailed to make collections of birds in Porto Rico, Mona Island
and eastern Cuba. This work was carried on in (12 winter of 1901-02
and occupied about seven months. Late in the fiscal year Mr. R.
Ridgway, Curator, Division of Birds, syent two months in southern
Illinois in collecting birds for the iiuseum. In the summer of 1901
Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Cr .tor, Division of Plants, accompanied
by Mr. Robert Hay, assistan', spent ten weeks in central Mexico in
botanical explorations. He 2scended Mount Orizaba and Mount Popo-
catepetl, and from each mcuntain obtained a large series of plants,
some of which were brovgh. living to the United States and deposited
in greenhouses of the U. 8. Department of Agriculture, where they
are now growing.
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.
ACCESSIONS.

The largest accessions of the year were Dr. W. L. Abbott’s East
Indian collections; a collection of insects from Arizona, comprising
65,000 specimens, made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz; the bequest of Dr.
Charles Mohr, consisting of 18,500 flowering plants, and the collec-
tions of invertebrates transmitted by the U.S. Fish Commission.

Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his zoological explorations in the East
Indies during the year, making numerous interesting discoveries, and
sending to the Museum great numbers of valuable specimens, espe-
cially mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. Dr. Abbott’s field of
operations during the year was in the South China Sea, between
Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo. Three months (January
to March, 1901) he spent in exploring the Andaman and Nicobar
islands, accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss. From May 26 to August
7, 1901, he visited various groups of small islands immediately east of
Singapore and also the coast and rivers of Johore. In August and
September, 1901, he explored the Indragiri River, Sumatra, and the
neighboring islands Linga and Sinkep. Linga Island had been
visited by him previously in July, 1899, on which occasion he was
accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss.

From the Andaman and Nicobar islands Dr. Abbott sent to the
Museum 278 mammals, among which were specimens of 15 new
species. This collection is by far the most complete ever brought
together from these islands and greatly increased the knowledge of
their mammal fauna. In Sumatra and Linga and Sinkep islands 166
mammals were obtained, including representatives of 11 new species.
Among the latter was a new pig related to the Borneo pig (Sus bar-
batus), and named Sus oc by Mr. G.S. Miller, jr. It is one of the most
interesting of Dr. Abbott’s many discoveries in the Malay region,
From Johore and various islands to the eastward Dr. Abbott obtained
404 mammals for the Museum. This material has not yet been
thoroughly examined, but is known to be extremely valuable. The
great collections of mammals of the East Indies resulting from Dr.
Abbott’s extensive and long-continued explorations are unrivaled, and
the mammal fauna of the region which they cover can now be studied
to better advantage in the National Museum than in any other
establishment.

Besides mammals, Dr. Abbott collected over 700 birds, a large series
of eggs of the Nicobar Island Megapode, Jlegapodius nicabarensis,
reptiles and batrachians, and numerous insects. The reptiles and
batrachians are the first the Museum has received from the Nicobar
and Andaman islands.

Dr. A. Donaldson Smith presented 6 African antelopes and 2 mon-
keys, and also 81 birds, from Somaliland, the first from that region
which the Museum has received.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

Among the important specimens received from the Fish Comuinis-
sion were the types of the fishes Mistichthys luzonens/s, of the Phil
ippine Islands, and /ilophias tanner’, together with the sponges
collected in Porto Rico in 1899, and identified by Dr. H. V. Wilson,
and the holothurians and echini from the same locality, identified by
Prof. H. L. Clark. Added to these were the crustaceans and echino-
derms collected by the Commission in the Hawaiian Islands in 1901:
about 1,500 specimens of common species of invertebrates from Woods
Hole, Massachusetts, intended to be made up into sets for distribution
to educational institutions; about 1,300 shells and 2,750 packages of
miscellaneous invertebrates of other classes which had accumulated in
the laboratories of the Commission; and seven lots of crayfishes from
Maine, The Commission also transmitted a collection of about 800
plants made by Messrs. Evermann and Clark in Indiana.

The Museum having agreed to publish a series of papers by Presi-
dent D. S. Jordan, the Leland Stanford Junior University presented
a collection of Japanese fishes, including the types of species described
by Dr. Jordan. Collections of fishes from Panama and Cocos and
Galapagos Islands, and of crustaceans from the Hopkins-Stanford
Galapagos Expedition of 1898-99 were also presented.

The Museum purchased from Prof. Bashford Dean some excellently
preserved reptiles and invertebrates from Negros Island, Philippine
Islands, and Professor Dean presented a collection of fishes from the
Nile River.

A collection of about 300 birds, including many species of importance,
was obtained for the Museum by Mr. B.S. Bowdish in Cuba and Porto
Rico (see Explorations, p. 61). Mr. Bowdish also obtained several
exceedingly rare reptiles, and one new species from these islands, and
collected reptiles in Mona Island, from which the Museum had not
previously received specimens. Other collections of Cuban reptiles
and birds were obtained by Mr. William Palmer during a two months’
sojourn at the eastern end of the island.

Mammals. —A remarkably fine skeleton of an adult Kadiak (Alaska)
bear was presented by Mr. J. H. Kidder. The skeleton conveys an
even more vivid impression of the strength of this huge beast than the
mounted skin recently added to the collection. Mr. Harry Pidgeon
presented an excellent series of skins of the wild sheep of the north-
ern Rocky Mountains, Ov/s stone7. The Museum was fortunate in
obtaining numerous additions to its collection of bats during the year,
amounting in all to about 260 specimens, of which 35 were from the
Philippine Islands; 58 specimens were the gift of Mr. Charles E.
Ashcroft, jr., U. S. Weather Observer at Rosean, Dominica Island,
West Indies.

Dr. EK. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, having received word of the strand-
ing of asmall whale near Newport, Rhode Island, notified the Museum
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

of the occurrence, and a preparator was detailed to obtain the skeleton. .
Through the good offices of Capt. James Sodermann the specimen was
held for the Museum. It proved to be the ziphioid, or bottlenose,
whale, Ziphius cavirostris. The specimen was adult, and the skeleton
is remarkably fine.

The Museum obtained by purchase about 275 specimens of obscure
and little-known Species of small mammals from Germany; 104 mam-
mals of Ecuador, including an undescribed species of native cat, named
Felis wquatorialis, by Dr. E. A. Mearns, and 60 Asiatic squirrels
especially needed for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collection. Four-
teen moose skulls, 8 elk skulls, and 12 skulls of other deer were
obtained at a nominal price from Mr. E. Thompson Seton.

Birds.—A valuable series of East Indian birds, 281 in number, which
are of special use for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collection, was
obtained from the Royal Museum of Natural History, Leiden, in
exchange. <A series of 161 Brazilian birds was obtained by exchange
with the Paulista Museum, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mr. Anastasio Alfaro
presented 12 birds from Cocos Island, a Jocality seldom visited. This
sending includes several specimens of the rare sparrow Cocornis agassiZt.
Mr. R. D. Lusk presented a specimen of the thick-billed parrot, Rhyn-
chopsitta pachyrhyncha, obtained in Arizona. This parrot had not
been taken previously within the limits of the United States. Mr.
H. W. Henshaw presented 14 rare Hawaiian birds, and Mr. A. Boucard
added 16 humming birds in continuation of his earlier donations in
1895 and 1896. Mr. J. H. Riley gaye the Museum a collection of 286
birds of Maryland and Virginia for use in exchanges.

The Museum purchased a select collection of 105 much-needed Mexi-
‘an. birds.

Birds eggs.—The great collection of birds’ eggs received several
important accessions during the year, besides those presented by Dr.
Abbott and already mentioned (p. 62). Dr. Ralph added to his numer-
ous donations of previous years a collection containing several sets of
egos of the rare Everglade Kite, Rostrhamus sociabilis. A series of
egos from Texas, including those of Vireo atricapillus, was given by
Mr. H. P. Attwater. A collection presented by Mr. J. P. Babbitt
contained eggs of Larus schistasagus, a species of which the Museum
lacked specimens.

The Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture transmitted
a number of sets of eggs from different parts of the United States,
including two sets of eggs of the Tennessee warbler, of which the
Museum had no representative previously. A small collection of
rare egos from Arizona was purchased.

Reptiles and batrachians.—An excellent skeleton of the Giant Sala-
mander of Japan was presented by Dr, C, Ishikawa.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

Mr. Robert T. Matthews presented two very rare snakes from Nica-
ragua, and Rev. Cyrus A. Clark an equally rare Japanese species,
with some other specimens. The skeleton of a large leather-back
turtle was donated by Mr. W. E. West. This was a very welcome
accession, as the skeleton in the exhibition series of the Museum was
not perfect. The Museum made a number of purchases of reptiles
during the year, of which the most important were 50 specimens from
Sumatra and vicinity for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collections, and
137 especially well-preserved specimens from Costa Rica to strengthen
the Museum collections from that country, which, though extensive,
are not in the best condition. The material obtained from the Philip
pine Islands and from Porto Rico has already been referred to (see
p- 62).

Fishes.—Besides the collections obtained from the U.S. Fish Com-
mission, Stanford University, and Professor Dean, already mentioned,
the Museum secured through the good offices of Messrs. Anderson and
Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark, RA/nodon, about
13 feet long, the first ever taken in the North Atlantic.

Mollusks.—The principal donations in this class were 2,000 shells
from Lower California, presented by Lieut. C. A. Clark, U. S. Navy;
35 specimens of new and rare species of land shells from various
localities in the United States, presented by J. A. Ferris; a collection
containing specimens of 12 species of land shells from Cocos Island,
representing cotypes of species described in Van Marten’s work on
the shells of the island. These were obtained by Mr. William H. Dall.

Insects. —The number of insects added to the collection during the
year, including deposits, exceeded 100,000 specimens, or nearly three
times as many as were received during the previous year. Included
among the accessions were four large collections, the principal of which
was that made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, assisted
by Mr. H. 8. Barber. This collection, which Mr. Schwarz made at
his personal expense and presented to the Museum, contained 65,000
insects. Mr. W. H. Ashmead collected about 7,000 insects in the
Hawaiian Islands. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, assisted
by Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, col-
lected 10,000 Lepidoptera and Orthoptera in Colorado. This collec-
tion comprised a large number of blown lepidopterous larvee prepared
in the field by Mr. Caudell. The fourth large accession was a deposit
made by Mr. William Schaus, consisting of about 10,000 beautifully
prepared specimens of butterflies, chiefly from Mexico and Central
America.

Besides these four large accessions there were 306 smaller ones, all
of which are referred to in Appendix II. Only a few can be men-
tioned in this place. Prof. T. D. A, Cockerell presented various

collections of insects from New Mexico, containing many types and
cotypes. Mr. D. W. Coquillett, Custodian of Diptera, presented a
valuable collection comprising 2,214 specimens of American Diptera.
Two accessions of insects of the Philippine Islands were received
from Dr. Paul L. Stang], and one from Maj. M. L. Robb. Mr. W. P.
Hay presented 500 Mexican Lepidoptera. A> collection of Homoptera
was presented by Prof. Elmer D. Ball, including types of many species
described by him. Types and cotypes of new species were also pre-
sented by Prof. KE. B. Williamson, Prof. H. Bird, Prof. Ralph Y.
Chamberlin, and Mr. H. H. Newcomb. The deposit of these types is
a matter of great satisfaction to the Museum, and much to the interest
of entomologists.

At the close of the year arrangements were entered into for the pur-
chase of 4,000 finely prepared Costa Rican insects, in which the Museum
collections are deficient. This was the only purchase during the year.
Several excellent collections were procured by exchange, the princi-
pal of which were 744 European Diptera from Prof. M. Bezzi, and a
series of exotic Termitidee, including many types, obtained from Dr.
Felippo Silvestri.

Marine invertebrates.— Besides the collections from the U.S, Fish
Commission and Stanford University, already referred to (p. 63), men-
tion should be made of the crustaceans from caves in Kentucky and
Tennessee, including types of two blind species, which were presented
by Mr. W. P. Hay; crustaceans from Alaska, presented by Mr. R. C.
McGregor, of the U.S. Coast Survey steamer Pathfinder; samples of
Atlantic Ocean bottom, from the Bureau of Equipment, U.S. Navy,
and a collection of miscellaneous marine invertebrates from Ellesmere
Land, presented by Mr. Robert Stein.

One large purchase was made during the year, consisting of 96
boxes of corals collected by Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C.
Worcester in the Philippine Islands. This collection contained a
great variety of valuable study material.

Plants.—The accession lots added to the herbarium for the year
were 342 in number. In 1899-1900 Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville,
North Carolina, presented to the Smithsonian Institution his collection
of cryptogamic plants, comprising about 3,000 specimens, and at the
same time bequeathed to the Institution his extensive herbarium of
flowering plants. Dr. Mohr died July 17, 1901, and on August 23,
1901, the flowering plants, comprising about 18,500 specimens, were
received from his executors. This valuable bequest is of much impor-
tance to the National Herbarium, as it consists chiefly of plants of the
Southern States, which were not well represented previously. Dr.
J. N. Rose, Assistant Curator, collected about 3,000 plants in Mex-
ico, chiefly on Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl. Dr. E. A.
Mearns, U. S. Army, presented 748 plants from Rhode Island. A
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. O7
collection of 681 plants, chiefly from the Philippine Islands, was
received as a donation from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Eneland.

A large amount of valuable material, comprising more than 6,000
specimens, was transmitted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
during the year. The more important collections are as follows: From
Porto Rico, collected by Messrs. Cook, Underwood, and Griges (1, 100
specimens); from Guatemala and Mexico, collected by Messrs. Cook
and Griges (1,000 specimens); from Brazil, collected by José de Campos
Novaes (511 specimens); from Idaho and Wyoming, collected by EK. D.
Merrill and C. V. Wilcox (804 specimens); from Alaska, Oregon,
Washington, and California, collected by F. A. Walpole (711 speci-
mens). The U. 5. Geological Survey transmitted a collection of 485
specimens, collected in Arizona by Mr. John B. Leiberg, and the
U.S. Fish Commission a collection of 314 specimens, collected by
Professors Evermann and Clark in Indiana.

Several important exchanges were effected during the year. Men-
tion may be made here of the following: 747 Porto Rican plants and
444 Mexican plants from the New York Botanic Garden; 554 Colorado
plants from Mr. Frank Tweedy.

During the year the Museum made purchases of plants to the amount
of $1,000 and about 10,100 specimens were obtained. The largest
collections were 4,249 specimens from China and 1,000 specimens from
Mexico. The remaining purchases consisted chiefly of plants from
various parts of the United States, as follows: Colorado, 1,383; Utah,
455; California, 450; Gulf States, 445; Georgia, 558; Florida, 523.

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES.

In the Division of Mammals a considerable amount of time was spent
in making uniform, complete labels to replace earlier ones, many of
which had deteriorated from long use or the infiltration of oily matter
from the skins. The rearrangement of the small mammals was prac-
tically completed last year as far as space would permit. On account
of the cramped quarters it has been necessary to store many trays of
less frequently used material in boxes, a very undesirable plan.
During the year covered by this report five new cases were made for
the large mammals, and they are now all reasonably well protected
from dust and insects, but are still much overcrowded, so that they
are to a certain extent inaccessible and can not be properly arranged.
The large skins in vats are still uncleaned and in danger of destruction.
no money having been available for their renovation. Of the small
skins, between 300 and 400 were freed from grease and made over
into‘a suitable form for permanent preservation. Among these were
included many type specimens. The rooms for mammals in alcohol
were improved by the addition of several hundred feet of shelving,
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

but as this was not put in place until near the close of the year little
was done toward rearrangement. The specimens themselves are in
good condition. During the year 1,064 mammal skulls, mostly of
large size, were cleaned by the Museum preparators, of which 590
belonged to the collection of the Biological Survey, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, and 474 to the regular collections. In addition, 2,167
small skulls were cleaned by contract. This work is of special impor-
tance, as in the study of mammals cranial characters are largely
depended upon for the discrimination of species. The additions to
the collections of the Biological Survey were catalogued in the Museum
as hitherto, and 13 new storsge cases were constructed for their
reception. At the request of Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Colum-
bian Museum, the skulls of a considerable number of types and rare
species were photographed for his work on the mammals of Mexico
and Central America.

In the Division of Birds the conditions existing last year continued
with little change. The curator being occupied the greater part of
the time in preparing manuscript for the press, the routine work fell
almost altogether on the assistant curator, who was without assistance
except for a few weeks. During this period some progress was made
toward completing the rearrangement of the birds in the new cases
provided last year. The assistant curator took charge of the repacking
of exhibits at the Buffalo Exposition and installing them at the
Charleston Exposition.

In the Division of Reptiles a beginning was made in rearranging
the study collections on the new shelving provided last year, but as
this work involves a large amount of re-identification of species it
necessarily proceeds slowly. The collections are in a good state of
preservation.

Little more can be accomplished in the Division of Fishes by the
present small force than to keep the collections from deteriorating, and
to enter and care for new accessions and to attend to the scientific
correspondence. ‘Toward the close of the year, however, the work of
preparing 100 sets of duplicate specimens for distribution to educa-
tional institutions was begun, and good progress made. The assistant
curator went to Charleston in January to install the collection of
fishes in formalin which was transferred from the Buffalo Exposition.

A large number of standard drawers was added to the equipment of
the Division of Insects, and the re-arrangement of the collections
thereby much facilitated. The Lepidoptera have now all been well
arranged by Dr. Dyar in the standard drawers. Mr. Schwarz has
been engaged in similar work on the Coleoptera and completed 50
drawers during the year. The Ichneumonidea and Chalcidoidea were
arranged by Mr. Ashmead. Mr. Currie has worked continuously on
the Neuroptera and by his effo:ts the collection of Odonata has been
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

greatly increased and improved. Work on the Diptera was continued
by Mr. Coquillett, and at present the collection of insects of that order
is probably at least as good as any other similar collection in the
country. The Diptera are still in old style boxes. Inall other orders,
except the Rhynchota, the collections are in good condition, though
less work has been done on them. The Rhynchota is a laree order
of great economic importance and should have the care of a properly
qualified specialist.

The accessions to the Division of Marine Invertebrates were for the
most part cared for as soon as received, but the large collection of
Philippine corals purchased from Professor Steere was not all unpacked
for want of room. With the present force the specimens can not be
catalogued as fast as identified, but a large amount was accomplished
during the year.

It has been fully recognized that the collections of the Division of
Plants, also known as the National Herbarium, are not housed as sat-
isfactorily as could be desired, while the offices and laboratories are
cramped almost beyond sufferance, and it has been necessary to resort
to many ingenious devices to accommodate the working force.

When the Herbarium was transferred from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to the National Museum, the old cases in which it had been
kept were also brought over and when set up were remodeled and
improved as far as possible. It was obvious, however, that they could
not be made tight enough to absolutely exclude dust and insects with-
out a greater expenditure of money than would be justified. About
three years ago a new form of case was devised, and at the beginning
of the present fiscal year 104 of these new cases were in use. During
the past year 40 additional cases were constructed, making 144 in all.
It is estimated that about 200 additional cases will still be required to
replace the old ones. Congress was asked to supply funds for these
much-needed cases, and it is hoped that the amount appropriated for
mechanical work will enable the Museum to construct the greater part
of them, if not all, during the coming year.

Mr. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator, reports as follows regarding
the cataloguing of specimens:

At the time the herbarium was actually transferred to the National Museum, in
1894, we began to stamp and record the accessions. It was assumed that there were
then about 200,000 sheets in the herbarium, and the stamp was set at 200,001.

The number of specimens catalogued during the past eight years is 202,945. Of
these 15,975 were added last year.

The work of recording the old part of the herbarium has almost ceased and speci-
mens are only stamped when they are to be sent away asa loan. This record runs
from 1 to 26346. In addition to this, specimens have been stamped with numbers
from 125000 to 156409.

The Division of Plants has been rather more favorably situated as
regards funds than any other division of the Museum. Since its trans-
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

fer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1894 it has expended

pach year, as agreed upon, the sum of $10,000, a larger amount than

allotted to any other division. In the present quarters, however, it Gan
not hope for the facilities which a less crowded building would afford.

On the other hand, it is to be stated that the division has not main-

tained an extensive exhibition series, as has been the case with nearly

all other divisions of the Museum.

Plans of the new cases adopted for the Division of Plants were sent
by request to Mr. F. D. Gardner of the Porto Rico Agricultural
Experiment Station, and to Mr. KE. L. Morris, director of biology,
Washington high schools.

CATALOGUE BOOKS.

The supply of catalogue books for the several divisions having been
exhausted, the opportunity was taken to revise the: headings, which had
been in use with but little modification for about fifty years. After
full consideration it was found impracticable to make the catalogues
conform to those of the other two departments of the Museum, but by
introducing two columns without headings a form was devised which
can be used by all the divisions of the Department of Biology, except
the Division of Plants. The size of the books was not changed.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS.

As already said in another place, much of the work done during the
year covered by this report was continuation of work begun last year
or earlier. The first voiume of the large manual by Mr. Rk. Ridgway,
entitled Birds of North and Middle America, which was mentioned
last year, was published on October 24, 1901. The second volume is
nearly ready to issue, and the third volume is well under way and will
probably go to press sometime during the coming year. Mr. Ridgway
has had little time for other duties than reading proof and completing
manuscript on this work.

Dr. C. W. Richmond prepared a report on the large collection of
birds from the Andaman and Nicobar islands presented by Dr. W. L.
Abbott, and identified the collections from Linga Island, Sumatra.

Much of the time of Dr. Stejneger was occupied in re-identifying
the general.collections of reptiles and batrachians preparatory to their
re-arrangement in the new cases already mentioned. Although this
work affords nothing for publication, it amounts to a revision of many
genera. The investigations of the reptile faunas of the Antilles and
of Japan, mentioned in last year’s report, were continued. The mono-
graph on the reptiles and batrachians of Porto Rico was not completed
as expected, owing to the receipt of new material from Mona Island

-which required description and illustration. In the course of his
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

studies in Europe Dr. Stejneger encountered important collections
which necessitated a partial revision of his manuscript.

Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., published five papers based on the mammal
collections during the year, the principal ones containing descriptions
of Dr. Abbott’s collections from the Nicobar and Andaman islands
and Indragiri River, Sumatra. In both numerous new species were
described. Mr. Miller also published several nomenclatural and classi-
ficatory notes, and jointly with Mr. James A. G. Rehn, of Philadelpha,
a very carefully prepared list of mammals of North America, entitled
Systematic results of the study of North American land mammals to
the close of the year 1900. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., published two
papers on bats and one on the Venezuelan mammals collected by Capt.
Wirt Robinson and himself. He has been engaged in the study of the
skeletons of American hares and pikas.

The Museum published during the year a series of papers by Presi-
dent D. S. Jordan, and Messrs. J. O. Snyder, E. C. Starks, and M.
Sindo, on the fishes of Japan. These papers covered 16 groups, such
as the eels, cardinal fishes, surf fishes, anglers, etc. The types of new
species were deposited in the National Museum. President Jordan
also published conjointly with Mr. J. O. Snyder a list of the fishes
collected for the Museum by the late Pierre L. Jouy in Japan in 1883
and 1885. Dr. Tarleton H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean completed
reports on the fishes of New York for the State Museum and of Great
South Bay, New York, for the New York Fish Commission. Notes
on the whale-shark received by the Museum from Ormond, Florida,
on a steelhead salmon, and on a larval conger eel were also published
by Mr. B. A. Bean. A report on the fishes of the Nile River pre-
sented by Prof. Bashford Dean was prepared by Dr. Theodore Gill
and Mr. Bean.

The conchological work accomplished during the vear is summed
up by Mr. W. I. Dall, Honorary Curator, as follows:

The curator has continued his work of revising and summarizing the groups of
American bivalves. The revision of the fossil species (Tertiary), those of the general
collection (recent), and of the American recent species all proceed together, so that
for the most part concluding the work on a group means that the specimens in the
collection belonging to that group have been brought up to date. The work which
has chiefly occupied the curator during the past year has been (1) the preparation
of a report now finished, but not yet printed, on the newly discovered Eocene of
Alaska, and (2) the revision of the family Veneridie, one of the largest and most
interesting of all the groups of bivalves, including 137 American species not inciud-
ing those of southern South America. The work on the recent species, including the
description of 22 new ones discovered during the research, is completed, but the tos-
sil forms will require further study as comprising many undescribed species.

Mr. Barisch, under the supervision of the curator, has continued his researches in
the Pyramidellidee of the Pacific coast, a wholly unexpected influx of undescribed
forms having come to light by search in the sand and gravel reserved for the scrutiny
of the student of Foraminifera. The nomenclature being in a bad state, a large
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

amount of research has been necessary, and this has occupied the time not taken up
by the multifarious duties in the division which the absence of an efficient clerk
makes it necessary to call upon Mr. Bartsch to perform.

Mr. Simpson has been continuing his work on the Naiades of the world, which
has made reasonable progress, but has called for little in the way of publication dur-
ing the year.

A very large number of identifications and lists of species for correspondents was
made during the year, as usual, but this work, though taking much time and more
or less directly beneficial to the Museum, calls for no extended remarks.

Prof. Charles B. Wilson, who has volunteered to work up the collec-
tions of parasitic copepod Crustacea belonging to the Museum, com-
pleted a monograph of the family Argulide. The monograph of the
Crustacea of the family Galatheidee by Dr. J. E. Benedict, mentioned
in last year’s report, was completed, but has not yet been published.
Miss M. J. Rathbun completed a study of the macruran Crustacea of the
northwest coast of America, and prepared preliminary descriptions of
both Macrura and Brachyura, which were published in the Proceedings
of the Museum. Shealso prepared a list of decapods of the Northwest,
with descriptions of new and rare forms, for insertion in one of the
volumes of the report of the Harriman Alaska expedition, now in
press. The collection of stalk-eyed Crustacea made by Dr. D. S. Jordan
and Mr. J. O. Snyder in Japan was also reported on by Miss Rathbun.
In addition she described a new species of fossil crab for Branner’s
Geology of the Northeast Coast of Brazil, identified the Brachyura and
Macrura collected by the U. S. Fish Commission in the Hawaiian
Islands, 1901, and renewed work on the fresh-water crabs belonging
to the collections of the Paris Museum, publishing in that connection
a description of a new species of Parathelphusa. Prof. W. P. Hay
described two blind crustaceans from Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, and
Nickajack Cave, Tennessee. Miss Harriet Richardson, collaborator,
continued studies on the isopods. She prepared, at the request of
Prof. A. E. Verrill, a report on the isopods of the Bermudas, and
began reports on the Japanese isopods. She also took up the study
of the general collection of Bopyride, and prepared descriptions of
two new isopods from Indiana and Cuba, respectively.

Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of the Division of Insects,
who is also Entomologist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
published during the year a large number of papers having for the
most part an economic bearing. <A list of these will be found in the
bibliography accompanying this report. In addition Dr. Howard
published a large popular work entitled The Insect Book, treating of
North American insects exclusive of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera.
The scientific work of other members of the staff of the Division of
Insects for the year is thus summarized:

Mr. Ashmead still continues his classificatory work on the Hymenoptera and has
published much on the subject. He has just finished his classification of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ie

chaleid-flies of the superfamily Chalcidoidea, a complex fully as large as the Ich-
neumonoidea. The material in this superfamily in the national collection is most
valuable and has been arranged by Mr. Ashmead according to his classification. He
also continues his work on a monograph of the North American Braconidie begun
ten years ago, and has every reason to believe that his manuscript will be ready for
publication in the Proceedings of the Museum this fall. He has also finished and
handed in for publication in the Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences
his reports on (1) the Rynchota of the Harriman expedition, and (2) the Hymenop-
tera of the Galapagos Islands, collected by the Leland Stanford Junior University
expedition. Mr. Ashmead has also done much work upon a catalogue of the
Hymenoptera of North America and the West Indies. A complete bibliographical
catalogue of our species has never been published, and it is believed that such a
work will be found useful and valuable. Difficulty has been found in placing some
of the species described from Mexico and Central America, and before these can be
assigned to their proper genera it will be necessary to examine the types in the
British Museum.

Mr. Coquillett has completed a synopsis of the dipterous family Chironomid.

Dr. Dyar has completed and handed in for publication in the Proceedings a cata-
logue of the North American Lepidoptera north of Mexico.

Mr. Currie has been engaged when other work would permit in monographing
the North American species of the antlion flies, family Myrmeleonidie. He has
begun the compilation of a catalogue of the neuropteroid insects of North America.

Mr. F. A. Lucas completed a paper on latiloid fishes.

The scientific work of the botanists has covered a wide field. My.
F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator of the Division of Plants, continued
his studies upon the genera Sa//x and Ribes, and is also preparing a
flora of Alaska. He published during the year a paper on a new genus
of heather, //arr/manella, of which specimens were obtained by the
Harriman Alaska expedition, and a paper on two species of L/hes.
Dr. J. N. Rose continued work on the Mexican flora, and engaged
with Dr. N. L. Britton in preparing a revision of the Crassulaces of
North America. Mr. C. L. Pollard published papers describing new
species of violets and of Chamecrista, also a popular account of plant
families and on the formation of the Florida Keys. Mr. W. R. Maxon
published various notes on ferns.

COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS AND LOAN OF SPECIMENS.

The Museum has always enjoyed the cooperation of specialists in
different branches of systematic zoology and botany in classifying
the collections and identifying species in groups with which the mem-
bers of the scientific staff are not familiar. These transactions are of
a varied nature. Sometimes the use of all the Museum specimens of
a group are solicited by a specialist engaged in preparing a monograph,
to enable him to base his conclusions on greater masses of material
than he personally has at his disposition. In cases of this kind the
Museum benefits chiefly by having the specimens in its collection identi-
fied. In other instances the Museum asks the assistance of an expert
in working up a collection, both to get the specimens identified and to
V4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

obtain a paper for publication in the Proceedings, or Bulletin. In still
other instances both the above-mentioned objects are aimed at, the
expert getting the use of material for use with other collections in a
work of general scope, and the Museum receiving a report on its own
specimens.

The system has worked to the advantage of the Museum and also, it
is believed, has facilitated in no small degree the work of zoological
and botanical specialists, both in the United States and abroad. Many
collections were in the hands of specialists at the beginning of the
year covered by this report and others were sent out during the year.
The most important were as follows: A series of 208 Patagonian mam-
mals sent to Dr. J. A. Allen, American Museum of Natural History,
for use in Connection with his work on the Mammals of the Princeton
expedition to Patagonia; 68 Alaska squirrels, also sent to Dr. Allen;
49 mammals sent to Dr. D. G. Elliot, Field Columbian Museum, for
use in connection with his work on the mammals of Mexico and Cen-
tral America; 68 martens sent to Mr. 8. N. Rhoads, Academy of Nat-
ural Sciences, Philadelphia, for use ina study of the genus Justela;
315 fishes from Negros Island, Philippines, to Dr. D. 5. Jordan, to
be identified for the benefit of the Museum; the general collection of
Salpz and simple ascidians to Dr. William E. Ritter, University of
California, to be identified for the benefit of the Museum; the general
collection of Pyenogonida (which had previously been in the hands of
Dr. Meinert, of Copenhagen) and other specimens, to Prof. Leon J.
Cole, University of Michigan, to be worked up for the benefit of the
Museum; 14 lots of Porto Rican echinoderms to Prof. H. L. Clark,
Olivet College, to be identified at the request of the U. S. Fish Com-
mission; 64 lots of Alpheide to Dr. H. Coutiere, Paris Museum, added
to the collections of the same kind previously sent him, to be classified
for the benefit of the Museum; 11 lots of leeches to Dr. J. Perey
Moore, University of Pennsylvania, added to similar lots previously
sent him and identified for the Museum. The following insects, with
many smaller lots, were lent for study: One hundred specimens of the
genus Leucania to Prof. J. B. Smith, Rutgers College; 118 specimens
of Ophionini to Dr. E. P. Felt; 188 Lepidoptera to Dr. W. J. Holland,
Carnegie Museum; about 400 specimens, illustrating the natural his-
tory of the dragon-flies and their allies, to Prof. James G. Needham,
Lake Forest University, for monographie work; 332 Tettigide to Dr.
J. L. Hancock.

Loans of plants were 30 in number, among which the following
deserve notice: 214 specimens of Amorpha and Philadelphus to the
Biltmore Herbarium; 197 specimens of /gudsetum to Mr. A. A. Eaton;
589 specimens of Cardamine to Dr. A. Engler, Royal Botanical
Museum, Berlin; 100 Hepaticee to Dr. A. W: Evans, Yale University;
474 specimens of Nyctaginacee to Dr. A. Heimerl, Vienna; 223 mis-

cellaneous plants to the New York Botanical Garden; 574 Alew to Mr.
W. A. Setchell; 140 specimens of Hucalyptis to the Botanical Garden,
Sydney, New South Wales.

The shells of the family Achatinellide which were in the possession
of the late Prof. Alpheus Hyatt at the time of his death were trans
ferred to Prof. A. G. Mayer, of Brooklyn, who is engaged in com-
pleting Professor Hyatt’s unfinished work.

LABORATORY USE. OF ‘THE COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS AND
STUDENTS.

In addition to the use made of the collections by the specialists to
whom specimens were sent, various investigators and students work
in the laboratories every year for longer or shorter periods. A ereat
deal of such work is done by the scientific staff of the various bureaus
of the U. 8S. Department of Agriculture which are concerned in
zoological and botanical researches and by the officers of the U.S,
Fish Commission. Dr. kb. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, spent the summer
and early autumn of 1901 in work on the natural history of the Mex-
ican boundary. Dr. D. G. Elliot, Field Columbian Museum, spent a
few weeks in January and February, 1902, in examining Mexican and
Central American mammals.. Mr. Outram Bangs, Museum of Com-
parative Zoology, spent some time in studying South American and
Japanese birds. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, American Museum of Nat-
ural History, examined the collections of South American, and espe-
cially Peruvian, birds. Mrs. Florence M. Bailey made some investi-
gations on the bird collections preparatory to the publication of a
work on the birds of western North America.

Prof. W. P. Hay continued the work on the crayfishes mentioned
last year, and rendered valuable assistance to the Museum by identi-
fying recent additions to the collections. Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan
continued work on the general collections of corals, as opportunities
occurred.

Numerous specialists and students examined various portions of the
collections of insects.

Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the New York Botanical Garden, was
a frequent visitor to the Herbarium during the year, especially in
connection with his studies on the Crassulacew and Cyperacex. The
collection representing the genus Plantago was studied by Mr. KE. LL.
Morris, director of biology in the high schools of Washington City.
Dr. P. A. Rydberg examined the Rocky Mountain plants, Dr. Charles
F. Millspaugh the plants of Yucatan, Dr. L. M. Underwood the fern
collection, and Mrs. E. G. Britton the mosses. Prof. EK. L. Greene,
of the Catholic University of America, was a frequent visitor to the
Herbarium, and Mr. J. B. Leiberg devoted much time during the
76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

winter in identifying a western collection of his own and one obtained
by Prof. L. F. Ward in Arizona.

Several students whose purpose was to familiarize themselves with
different groups of animals have had desks assigned to them for longer
or shorter periods. Such students are always weleome, but in the
present cramped condition of the building they work under ereat
disadvantages both as regards space and light.

ISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATE SPECIMENS.

The distribution of so-called ‘* duplicate” specimens to educational
institutions continued as far as circumstances would permit. The
preparation of these sets consumes much time, and with the limited
force only a moderate number can be got together in any one year.
The sets of marine invertebrates mentioned in last year’s report were
distributed to 71 institutions, chiefly colleges, normal schools, and high
schools. In May work was begun on the preparation of a new series
of 100 sets of fishes.

EXPOSITIONS.

The Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York, closed November
2, 1902, and certain members of the staff were detailed to repack the
exhibits of the Department. This work was under the supervision of
Dr. Charles W. Richmond. ‘The President having signified his desire
that such portion of the Government exhibit at Buffalo as could be
accommodated should be transferred to the Charleston Exposition, a
selection of objects was made, packed separately, and shipped direct to
that city. The remainder of the Buffalo exhibit was returned to Wash-
ington and installed in the permanent exhibition cases. The Charles-
ton Exposition closed May 31, 1902, and just prior to that date several
members of the scientific staff were detailed to repack the objects
exhibited there.

PERSONNEL.

The Head Curator was appointed representative of the Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum on the U. S. Government Board for
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904.

Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., returned to the service of the Department,
September 1, 1901.

Mr. George B. Turner was appointed chief taxidermist, September
21, 1901.

Miss A. R. Knapp was appointed on April 1, 1902, to a clerical
position in the Division of Plants.

FOR THE YEAR 1901-2.

By Grorar P. Merriny,
Head Curator.

The year that has passed, though characterized by no single event
of great importance, has, nevertheless, been one of steady progress
along lines essential to good administration. More has probably been
accomplished in the way of systematizing and completing the records
of the collections than in any single year in the history of the Depart-
ment. Changes of importance in the personnel have occurred, involy-
ing the resignation of Dr. Peter Fireman, on the 9th of September;
the furloughing of Mr. John W. Coleman, preparator in the Section
of Vertebrate Paleontology; the appointment of Mr. R. S. Bassler,
preparator in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, and the
appointment of Mr. W. C. Phalen as aid in the Division of Geology.
The resignations and furloughs, it should be stated, were voluntary,
Dr. Fireman retiring to accept a more lucrative position elsewhere,
and Mr. Coleman accepting temporary employment in Mexico on
account of the condition of his health. Temporary services have
been rendered by Miss Moody and Miss Vouté,

ACCESSIONS.

The total number of accessions received by the various divisions of
the Department is shown in tabular form below.

For purposes of comparison those for the years 1809-1900 and
1900-1901 are also given.

From this it might appear that there has been a steady falling off in
the amount of material received. The discrepancy is, however, largely
apparent. With the gradual increase in the size and degree of com-
pleteness of the collections we are enabled to exercise more and more

discrimination as the years go on, and material that would at one time
have been acceptable is now rejected. No idea of the value of the
accessions, moreover, can be derived from these figures, and it is safe
to say that in at least two of the divisions the materials are of a
value equal to that of any corresponding period in the history of the
Museum.

It is well to note in this connection that as time passes a propor-
tionally smaller amount of desirable material comes to the Department
in the way of gifts, while the funds that can be devoted to purchase
and collecting remain far too small. As a natural consequence the
growth of the collection is likely in time to be seriously checked.

The most important of the accessions noted above have been:

1. A collection of 173 specimens of ores and 6 transparencies of
mining regions received from the Government exhibit at Paris in 1900.

2. A fine example of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada, gift
of B. F. Swindler.

Whitman Cross; the Bohemia mining district of Oregon, collected by
J.S. Diller; the Livingston Quadrangle, Montana, collected by W.
H. Weed.

and Cystids and Crinoids from Maryland, the gift of Mr. Charles
Schuchert, the Assistant Curator of the Division of Stratigraphic Pale-
ontology. This is an important series and formed a part of Mr.

Collected by Messrs. F. H. Knowlton and John C. Merriam, and
‘received from the U. 8. Geological Survey.

24. About 100 specimens of Upper Carboniferous fossil plants from
the vicinity of Clinton, Henry County, Missouri, the gift of Dr. J. H.
Britts, of Clinton, Missouri. The collection includes a number of
types described by Dr. David White in the Fossil Flora of the Coal
Measures of Missouri.

SOURCES OF NEW MATERIAL.

The sources of the new material are in part indicated above. As
in years past the U. S. Geological Survey has been the principal con-
tributor, though several valuable specimens have been obtained by
purchase and exchange, as noted.

Mr. F. W. Crosby collected for the Museum a remarkably fine series
of pot holes in basalt, found in the vicinity of Snake River Falls, Idaho.

The meteorite collection and the collection of minerals have been
enriched mainly through exchanges and purchase. As noted, Dr. L.
T. Chamberlain has made an important addition to the gem collection.

Mr. Schuchert, during his vacation, made important additions to
the collections in the way of Helderbergian and Cretaceous materials
from New York and New Jersey. Mr. Bassler, while at the Pan-
American Exposition, devoted a few days to collecting Bryozoa in the
Devonian and Silurian rocks of the vicinity.

ROUTINE.

In all the divisions of the Department there were received upward
of 4,100 specimens requiring entering and numbering, and in many

cases the preparation of cards for card catalogues and, perhaps, labels
for exhibition purposes as well. In addition, considerable progress
was made in working over the old materials.

Much time, as before, is occupied in identifying material received
from other institutions or from individuals, and for which the Museum
receives no adequate return. Some 297 of these temporary accessions
have received attention during the year.

Mrs. Jouy, who has been placed in charge of the records of the
Department, reports the following entries in the catalogue books:
Division of Geology and Sections of Paleobotany and Vertebrate
Paleontology, 1,759; Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, 2,102;
Division of Mineralogy, 129. Three thousand one hundred and fifty-
seven catalogue cards have been prepared, also manuscript for 558
labels for the Government Printer. Some 30,000 numbers have been
painted upon specimens by Mr. Cruikshank and the Misses Vouté
and Moody.

Several of the collections, including the concretions and cave and
glacial deposits, in the Division of Geology, have been thoroughly
overhauled and rearranged, and over 500 specimens re-installed in new
exhibition jars. Some one hundred photographs, maps, and other
illustrations have been distributed among the exhibition series. The
details of this work, as in years past, have been looked after by Mr.
Newhall. The mineralogical hall was disarranged in January, owing
to the erection of the new galleries, and is now in process of restora-
tion. The work can scarcely be finished during the present. fiscal
year.

Mr. Schuchert reports that altogether he has put away in final
museum form during the year some 21,000 specimens. ‘Twenty-five
boxes of old material have been withdrawn from storage and the
material worked into the Museum collections. The installation of
the Harris collection has been completed.

Mr. Lucas, who still remains in charge of the vertebrate fossils,
reports the mounting of the hind legs and pelvis of 7r/ceratops pror-
sus and similar parts of the carnivorous dinosaur A//osaurus.

The time of Dr. Peale has been fully taken up in attending to the
routine of his department, and no progress whatever has been made
on the exhibition series. The study material, which has received his
chief attention, is rapidly becoming systematized and put in first-class
condition. F .

A systematic effort has been made toward preparing
the type and illustrated specimens in all the sections and divisions of
the Departinent. This has taken a considerable amount of time on the
part of the heads of the various divisions, the clerical work remaining
largely in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves. The manuscript
for nearly 6,000 type and illustrated specimens has thus been prepared.

a catalogue of

NAT mMuS 1902 6
82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

It was hoped that this catalogue might be completed in season to hand
in with my annual report.

In accordance with the plan originated several years ago, a small
series of rocks, illustrating the various stages of rock decomposition
and formation of soils, was prepared for distribution to schools and
colleges. Ninety-one sets were prepared, comprising eleven speci-
mens each. These were accompanied by a descriptive pamphlet of
three pages, giving localities and analyses.

As the years go on, and particularly as the halls grow more and
more crowded, there accumulates a large amount of duplicate and
less desirable material, which has been stored away in boxes or
wherever available space can be found. This is especially the case
with the Division of Geology proper, where the character of the
material is such that it often comes to the Museum in bulk to be
trimmed up and prepared for exhibition on the ground. During the
past year a systematic effort has been made to sort this and dispose, to
the advantage of the Museum, of such as was not actually needed for
study or exhibition. Nearly 2,500 specimens and upward of 4,500
pounds of rocks and ores in the rough have been thus disposed of, the
returns coming in the form of meteorites and minerals in which a
maximum value is represented by a minimum amount of material.

The regular routine of the Museum has been somewhat disturbed
this year, as in years past, by exposition work. Messrs. Newhall,
Stewart, and Bassler were at Buffalo for a period of eighteen days in
November, engaged in packing the exhibit of the department, which
had been there throughout the exposition, and in January following
Messrs. Schuchert and Stewart went to Charleston to install the
exhibit there. In May, Messrs. Stewart and Newhall and the Head
Curator visited Charleston for the purpose of packing the collections
for their return to Washington. I may note here that the collections
forming the exhibit at Buffalo and Charleston have been all returned,
those from Charleston arriving too late to receive attention during the
present fiscal year. Mr. Bassler was engaged during July, August,
and a part of September, at Newport, Kentucky, in packing the
Ulrich collection, noted elsewhere.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The condition of most of the collections of the Department is fairly
satisfactory. We are, of course, badly hampered for space, and a
large amount of material is needed to render many of the collections
complete or systematic. The final installation, in the Section of
Invertebrate Paleontology, of the Harris collection, received in 1898,
is practically accomplished. The exhibition portion now comprises
some 8,400 specimens mounted on 365 tiles and blocks and occupying
50 running feet of the gallery rail case in the southeast court.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

This collection, which has been briefly referred to in previous reports,
is the result of nearly fifty years of work on the part of Mr. Harris,
and is generally accepted as being the finest collection of its kind extant.
It is particularly rich in Crinoids, of which, in the form of slabs and
free specimens, there are not less than 1,500 specimens. It is also
extremely rich in Silurian starfishes and Trilobites, containing some
600 out of the 750 known species of this crustacean so far described
from the Cincinnati formation. The Museum, as well as the country
at large, is to be congratulated on the fact that so valuable a collection
has become permanently housed where it will be accessible to all work-
ers. Much credit is due Mr. Schuchert for the efficient manner in
which he has handled this and, indeed, all the collections that come
under his care.

It may be well to remark in this connection that the skeleton of
FHlesperornis regalis, obtained a year ago for the Pan-American Expo-
sition, has been returned in safety and now constitutes one of the most
interesting exhibits in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The collections in the mineral hall are not yet fully restored from
the confused condition into which they were thrown in January by
the erection of galleries, as already noted.

RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.

Work of research in the Division of Geology has been greatly cur-
tailed through the resignation in September of Dr. Peter Fireman,
chemist of the Department, as before noted. What investigations
have been carried on have been limited mainly to meteorites. As will
be seen by reference to the bibliography, two papers relating to the
Felix and Admire meteorites have been prepared and published dur-
ing the last year by the Head Curator, the chemical work having been
done in part by Dr. Fireman and in part by Mr. Tassin, the Assistant
Curator in the Division of Mineralogy. This investigation has yielded
what is believed to be important contributions to our knowledge of
these interesting bodies, the Felix stone having been shown to be a
tuff containing minerals of undoubted secondary origin, and that of
Admire showing the iron under such conditions as to suggest its origin
through reduction of a chloride or sulphide.

Mr. Tassin has himself studied and prepared for publication a paper
on the large mass of meteoric iron from Casas Grandes, Mexico, and
has continued his studies on the dehydration of the ferric hydrates.
He hopes to be able to publish the result of this latter work during
the next calendar year.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his study of the Silurian and Lower
Devonian of the Appalachian region, and has in preparation mono-
graphs of these fossils from the Maryland region, to be published in
the main by the Maryland Geological Survey. He has also continued
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

his work on the monograph of the fossil starfishes. A monograph on
the fossil Ostracoda is in contemplation.

Mr. Lueas is still engaged on the monograph of the Stegosauria
mentioned in my last report, and has also devoted some time to the
study of certain points in the structure of Hesperornis and Baptornis.
He has also studied a series of birds from the Pliocene of Oregon sub-
mitted by Prof. J. C. Merriam.

ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS.

The usual custom of lending material for study has been followed,
as in previous years. Material from the divisions of Geology and
Mineralogy has thus been lent to the U.S. Geological Survey and ver-
tebrate material to Messrs. Osborn, Gidley, and Hay, of the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, and to Mr. J. B; Hatcher,
of the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburg. Material from the Section of
Invertebrate Paleontology has been lent to Dr. John M. Clarke, of
Albany; Dr. C. E. Beecher, of New Haven; Mr. J. E. Duerden, of
Johns Hopkins University, and Miss Elvira Wood, of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology. The U.S. Geological Survey, as usual,
has had free access to the materials whenever occasion demanded.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.

The generalized section across the entire American continent, which
was referred to in my last annual report, remains as yet unfinished,
owing to lack of funds. The collection which was to accompany the
same is also incomplete and remains in an old wall case entirely
unsuited for this use, but which, it is hoped, may shortly be replaced.

It is expected that the skeleton remains of the Triceratops or Clao-
saurus will be mounted for exhibition during the coming year and,
possibly, also, that of the Mastodon obtained at Church, Michigan, in
the summer of 1901.

Further development Pes lines other than those already estab-
lished is rendered practically impossible, owing to lack of space.

It is extremely desirable, if not essential to the welfare of the
Museum, that the Department should be allowed to have an annual
allowance for field and collecting expenses. No museum can rely
wholly upon gifts for its advancement. Collections coming by this
means are invariably lacking in certain essential materials which can
be only in part supplied by purchase. More than that, the scientific
force can not, I believe, be kept up to the desired point of efficiency if
they are obliged to remain at their desks throughout the summer
months. I am strongly in favor of sending men into the field when-
ever it is possible. At present there are at least three regions capable
of furnishing desirable fossil invertebrates, which it is very essential
we should investigate at once, besides numerous localities for verte-
brate fossils, minerals, and general geological materials,

The use of the earwig’s forceps is found to |
be the unfolding of the wings of the insect |

before flight, not the closing of them on
alighting, in the Staphylinid beetles.
Winged insects with complete metamorphosis
are held to be more primitive, and the anal-
ogy of Dyscritina as a larval earwig with Pro-
japyx as the larva of Japyx is pointed out.
The cockroaches are less primitive than the
May flies, Odonata, and other insects with
aquatic larve, and the derivation of the
wings of insects from larval gills seems prob-

by Silvestri, indicates that the Diplopoda

This is the first part of a general treatise on
the birds of America north of the Panama
Railroad, but including the Galapagos Islands.
It embraces the family Fringillide, or Finches,
of which 391 species are here recognized as
coming within the limits of the work. Each
species is fully described, its geographical
distribution is given in detail, and an ample
synonymy is appended. Twenty plates, rep-
resenting the characters of the 69 genera
treated, accompany the volume. The first
37 pages of the work deal with the classifica-
tion of birds, with keys to the family of
Oscines, or songbirds, and to the genera of
Fringillide as represented within the geo-
graphical limits stated above. Carpodacus
mexicanus sonoriensis (p. 185), Saltator mag-
noides medianus (p. 664), and Geospiza harterti
(p. 507) are described as new.

four annual generations at Fresno, of which
one develops in the spring and threein the
fallcrop. A part of the last generation hi-
bernates, but the winter generation is in no
way distinet from those insects that hatch
late in the fall. The influence of climate on
the development of the Blastophaga is very
great, for at Niles, Cal., only two generations
were observed in the year 1900.

In this paper 3 new species Whittleseya
desiderata White, Whittleseya brevifolia White,
and Whittleseya dawsoniana White—are de-
scribed and illustrated, and their source and
age discussed. The conclusion reached as to
the age of the beds is that they are referable
to the upper part of the Pottsville. The rela-
tions and systematic position of the species
are also considered. They are found to be
more closely allied to the group of broader
proportions, in general characteristic of the
Upper Pottsville, than to the linear group
which prevails in the lower portions of the
Pottsville of the Appalachian province.
tematically they are regarded by the author
as referable to the Ginkgoales, the Whittle-
sey, in the judgment of the writer, being the
oldest representatives of the Ginkgoales stock
yet discovered.

REporRT ON THE EXHIBIT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AT THE Souri
Carouina, INTERSTATE AND West InprAn Exposrrion, CHARLEs-
TON, 1901-2

By Freperick W. TRU,

Head Curator, Department of Biology, in charge.
’ I ) DY; g

The South Carolina, Interstate and West Indian Exposition, held at Charleston,
South Carolina, opened December 1, 1901, and closed May 31, 1902. The object of
this exposition, as shown in its prospectus, was ‘*‘
commerce in the South; to open up new foreign markets, particularly in the West
Indies; to begin the twentieth century of the Christian era with an exhibition of the
arts of peace; to develop the American culture of silk and tea; to promote the South-
ern manufactures of cotton and iron; to establish new steamship lines from Charles-
ton, the central seaport of the great Southeast; to show the world the resources
and attractions of the territory along the Southern seaboard and the advantages of
Charleston as a connecting link between the producers of the Southeastern States
and the Mississippi Valley on one side and the markets of the world on the other.”

In the sundry civil bill making provision for the expenses of the Government for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, an item was inserted for a Government exhibit
at Charleston. This item was subsequently rejected, and as the Exposition would
open before the matter could again be brought to the attention of Congress the
director-general appealed to the President to order an exhibit sent to Charleston
with the understanding that the exposition company would meet all expenses.

The President was favorably inclined toward this request, and by his direction the
Secretaries of the Executive Departments instructed the proper officials to select from
the exhibits made at the Buffalo Exposition, and send to Charleston, such objects as
would be appropriate for display in the latter place. The Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution also received a request from the director-general that some part of
the exhibits of the Institution and National Museum at the Buffalo Exposition be sent
to Charleston at the expense of the exposition company, which request, after due con-
sideration of all the circumstances, was granted.

In his first message to Congress President Roosevelt mentioned the matter of a
Government exhibit at Charleston, as follows:

“The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an
exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of Congress.
I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all
the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition
have requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which
have been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken the
responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to
help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be
required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the Congress appro-
priate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose.”’

The space allotted to the Government exhibits was in the semicircular colonnades
connecting the large central building known as the Cotton Palace with two other
buildings—the Palace of Commerce and the South Carolina Building. These colon-
nades were originally designed to be open on the sides, but in order to properly
house the Government collections they were enclosed and furnished with windows
and skylights. A very good exhibition space was thus obtained at a moderate

165

to inaugurate new industries and
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902.

expense. The portion of this space assigned to the Smithsonian Institution and
National Museum was on the west side of the grounds, between the Cotton Palace
and the Palace of Commerce. Including a small building called an ‘‘exhedra,”’ it
comprised 5,682 square feet. The whole of the curved arcade, comprising 4,727 feet,
was occupied by the Museum.

After consultation with the officers of the Institution and Museum, a number of
objects in the Buffalo exhibit which were too large for the space at Charleston, or were
otherwise unsuitable, were ordered sent to Washington, and the remainder, com-
prising about two-thirds of the original exhibit, were packed separately and for-
warded to South Carolina. A number of preparators and mechanics were detailed
from Washington to install the exhibit. This work was completed January 15, 1902,
at which time the doors were thrown open to the public.

As the collections displayed by the Museum at Charleston were the same as those
shown at Buffalo, it is unnecessary to enumerate them here. A full description will
be found in the Report for 1901 (pp. 177-231).

The principal omissions at Charleston were the larger mammals, a part of the
birds, reptiles, and fishes, the larger ethnological groups and the models of aboriginal
dwellings, the skeleton of Hesperornis, the collection of native elements, ete.

The largest object exhibited was the skeleton of the huge extinct reptile, T'ricera-
tops. This stood in a central position, and, on account of the excellent lighting,
showed to even better advantage than at Buffalo. Around it were grouped the other
geological exhibits, occupying eight cases and comprising minerals, cave deposits,
and invertebrate fossils. On the two sides of the central space were the exhibits of
the departments of Anthropology and Biology.

The principal exhibit of the Department of Anthropology consisted of six large
groups, in separate cases, representing native American peoples. These were supple-
mented by collections representing the products of different arts of the native Ameri-
cans, such as basketry and pottery, and native hunting and fishing implements, fire-
making devices, etc. The group cases were placed against the west wall in a single
row, and opposite them were the smaller cases, nine in number, arranged so as to
form alcoves.

The exhibit of the Department of Biology, which was at the opposite end of the
space, had as its principal feature a case 40 feet long, containing mammals. This
was placed against the west wall, and opposite and at the extreme end of the space
were the smaller cases, arranged like those of the Department of Anthropology, in
the form of alcoves, and containing characteristic American fishes, reptiles, batra-
chians, and birds.

The collection remained on exhibition until May 31, 1902, when the exposition
closed. At this time preparators were again sent from the Museum to repack the
collections, which work was completed June 16, 1902.

On January 21, 1902, Congress appropriated $90,000 to reimburse the exposition
company for expenditures made in behalf of the Government exhibit. This appro-
priation was not disbursed under the direction of a Government board or of the
individual representatives of the several departments and bureaus, but by the Treas-
ury Department directly to the exposition company. This arrangement worked
somewhat disadvantageously, in so far as the Government exhibits were concerned,
as it was necessary for the exposition company to actually pay out money from its
own funds before reimbursement could be made by the Treasury. On June 12,
1902, tlie affairs of the exposition company passed into the hands of a receiver, and
no payments could be made until the court acted in the matter. As the president
of the exposition company declined to continue paying Government expenses from
his private purse, and the court was unable to pass upon the case at once, a consider-
able time elapsed during which no bills were settled. It is to be hoped that in
similar cases in the future provision will be made for disbursement under the direc-
tion of a Government board.
APPENDIX VI.

Report oF DELEGATE TO THE Firru INTERNATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
ConGREss, BERLIN, AuGuST 12-16, 1901.

Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

Dear Str: I have the honor to submit herewith a brief account of my visit to the
Fifth International Zoological Congress at Berlin, to which, on July 15, 1901, you
appointed me a delegate to represent the Smithsonian Institution and the United
States National Museum.

The congress was opened on August 12 and lasted until August 16, when the dele-
gates and members adjourned to attend the reception given in their honor by the
High Senate of Hamburg. The 17th was spent in Hamburg inspecting the zoological
collections there, and on August 18 and 19 most of the members visited the Marine
Biological Station on Heligoland. Having urgent business at the Hamburg Natur-
historisches Museum, I remained there instead of going to Heligoland.

The congress was in every respect a success. Not only was the attendance (about
750 members) greater than at any previous congress, but the standard of the scientific
papers and discussions was unexcelled. I need only refer to the lectures by Prof.
G. B. Grassi (Rome) on the malaria problem from a zoological standpoint, Prof.
Yves Delage (Paris) on the theories of fecundation, Professor Biitschli (Heidelberg)
on vitalismus and mechanismus, and Professor Branco (Berlin) on fossil remains
of man.

One of the main factors of this suecess was the unexampled interest in the con-
gress displayed by the German Government. A large sum of money was placed at
the disposition of the local committee by the Government, and the German Crown
Prince, as the high protector of the congress, was only prevented from opening the
congress in person by the death of his grandmother, the dowager Empress Friedrich,
afew days previous. The congress was lavishly entertained by the cities of Berlin and
Hamburg, as well as by the Zoological Society of Berlin. But the most extraordi-
nary proof of the public interest in the congress was probably the fact that the entire
“ Reichstagsgebaiide,”” the magnificent house of the German Parliament, was placed
at the disposition of the Congress for its meetings, lectures, ete. Thusall the general
sessions were held in the great ‘‘ Plenarsitzungssaal”’ of the Parliament. The Emperor
himself, though prevented from receiving the members officially on account of the
death of his mother, took occasion to greet them informally.

The more special object of my joining the congress was to take part in the delib-
erations and decisions of the committee on zoological nomenclature, of which I had
