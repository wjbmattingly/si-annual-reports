UPON THE

UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1899,

BY

RicHArRD RATHBUN,

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Mr. Charles D. Walcott, who, following upon the death of Doctor
Goode, had agreed to add to his duties as Director of the Geological
Survey those of Acting Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in charge of the National Museum, felt obliged to relinquish
the latter position with the year ending June 30, 1898. During his
incumbency there was a modification in the administration of the
Museum, which consisted in gathering the different departments under
three heads and placing three scientific men in charge of them as head
curators. One, the Head Curator of Biology, Dr. F. W. True, by virtue
of his appointment as Executive Curator, took charge of the executive
office immediately following the retirement of Mr. Walcott, and admin-
istered it with zeal and fidelity. The Secretary, who is by law Keeper
of the Museum, has always retained the direction of its policy and
attended personally to many of the important acts connected with its
administration. His numerous and exacting duties made him feel the
necessity of further aid in this direction, and in accordance with a reso-
lution of the Board of Regents removing the restrictions placed upon
the appointment of the writer as Assistant Secretary, in 1897, the latter
has given a certain oversight to the affairs of the Museum, without,
however, being able to spare sufficient time to supervise all of its
details.

The Secretary in his own report has expressed his appreciation of
the value and efficiency of the services rendered by Mr. Walcott to the
Museum during the year and a half in which he was connected with
it in an administrative capacity. It should be added that the Museum
still has the benefit of Mr. Walcott’s services as Honorary Curator of
the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, and, beyond this, that his
advice and his valuable aid have been given to the Museum on many
occasions since his official administrative connection with it ceased.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

The present National Museum is an integral part and the direct out-

erowth of the Smithsonian Institution. In the fundamental law crea-
ting the Institution, Congress provided for the erection of a building —
suitable for natural history collections, including a geological and
mineralogical cabinet, and further ordered that—
Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their receptior,
all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may
be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when-
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the
Museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or other-
wise, the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and
arranged.

From the results of this legislation sprang the Museum, yet several
propositions and institutions antecedent to the establishment of the
Smithsonian Institution contributed to the origin and development of
the present collections.

To Doctor Goode’s careful researches into the history of American
scientific institutions the reader desiring to know the history of the
National Museum in detail is referred.’ As far back as 1806 Joel Bar-
low, the well-known author of Zhe Columbiad, put forward a plan for
the establishment of a national institution in which a general museum
had a prominent part. The early students and public men of the United
States fully recognized the importance, at least for natural history
studies, of the gathering and preservation of collections, and many
such turned toward Philadelphia, which, even after it ceased to be the
national capital, continued for a time the scientific and literary center
of the country.

The first real scientific collection, both as regards material and
arrangement, which came into the possession of the United States
Government was the mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson (since
unfortunately destroyed by fire), and this, with the results of the policy
initiated in furtherance of the act incorporating the Smithsonian
Institution, formed the basis of the present national collections.

It is anticipating somewhat, however, to make this statement, since
collections began to be brought together in Washington before the
Smithsonian Institution was actually founded, although they were
directly traceable to the Smithson bequest. Not long after its
announcement there was formed in Washington, chiefly through the
exertions of the Hon. Joel R. Poinsett, an organization under the title

of ‘‘ National Institution,” later changed to ‘* National Institute,”
which had for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that
foundation. This organization, ten years before the Smithsonian
Institution was prepared to receive collections, gathered together quite
a quantity of historical and natural history material, which was kept
in the Patent Office, and which in 1862, upon the expiration of the
charter of the Institute, was delivered to the National Museum,
although a portion of the historical collection was retained at the
Patent Office until as late as 1883.

The first exploring expedition affording important collections was
that under Lieutenant Wilkes, which started out in 1838. The
material from this source was turned over to what was known as the
National Cabinet of Curiosities, being a part of the National Institute
and located in the Patent Office. Serious conflicts of authority arose,
however, between the curator of the collection, the Commissioner of
Patents, and the authorities of the National Institute, and in 1857 these
collections were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. As Doc-
tor Goode has aptly put it: ‘‘ From the marriage of the National Cabi-
net of Curiosities with the Smithsonian Institution the National
Museum of the United States was born.”

In 1850 Prof. Spencer F. Baird was appointed Assistant Secretary
of the Institution, and, with the approval of Secretary Henry, he at
once entered into relations with the numerous surveying parties then
exploring throughout the western country to secure through them
natural history and ethnological collections. Added to these were the
exertions of officers of the Army engaged in similar work, some of
whom were themselves experts in natural history or ethnology.

In 1871 new important avenue for increasing the collections of the
National Museum was opened by the establishment of the Fish Com-
mission, under the direction of Professor Baird. Many explorations
have been carried on by the Commission with a view to increasing sci-
entific knowledge, in order that results useful to the people might flow
therefrom. One of the chief factors in this work has been the steamer
Albatross, especially built for dredging and for making collections of
the fauna of the deep sea.

These and numerous other agencies, whether through surveys or
departments of the Government, through industrial and commercial
enterprises pushing their way into the little-known regions of the west
and north or through the zeal of private individuals, brought together
a great mass of valuable, if heterogeneous, material, to which was
added at the close of the exposition in 1876, partly by gift of foreign
countries and partly from private exhibitors, so great a quantity of
specimens as to render imperative the erection of a separate building
for the national collections.
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

This structure, though built at a time when the conditions required
for the proper care and display of large collections of natural history
were by no means well understood, is yet admirably adapted to
museum exhibition purposes, lending itself readily both to arrange-
ment and adjustment, and giving ample light. But though the plan
was good, the realization was unworthy. The building is cheap and
unenduring, and is, besides, without storage or laboratory facilities.
For the area covered, its cost was less than that of any other building
ever erected by the Government, and the result is commensurate with
that fact. Of its general plan many museum experts have only words
of praise; of its unworthiness as the home of the national collections
of this great nation there can be no question.

The Museum building was ready for occupancy in 1881, and it was
then deemed adequate for years to come. Yet such has not been the
‘ase. The additions to the collections have so far exceeded expecta-
tions that more than ten years ago it was already overcrowded, although
more than three-fourths of the Smithsonian building is still devoted to
the same purposes, and houses some of the most important collections.

The number of specimens in the Museum is now nearly four and
one-half millions, covering every department of knowledge, although
strongest in the fields of natural science and ethnology. It is not
possible here to name even the most important collections nor the
sources from which they have been derived; nor would such a state-
ment in any way give an adequate picture of the Museum. It is not
the possession of collections, but their availability to the public at large
and to students which really does credit to an establishment of this kind.
Of this fact no one had a keener perception than Doctor Goode, who
was associated with Professor Baird directly in the management of
the Museum from 1878 to 1887, and from that year, upon his appoint-
ment as Assistant Secretary, had complete oversight of all the details
of its management. He had the most profound desire to make the
collections available to the people, to have them arranged so that they
might be seen, and to have them labeled so that they might be instruct-
ive. Himself a scientific man and in sympathy with scientific work, he
yet regarded the public use of the Museum as its primary object, and
well was this policy rewarded by accessions and gifts from this very
public, which have gone to enrich not only the exhibition, but the
duplicate collections, thus benefiting both classes for which the
Museum was intended. So skillful was his handling of this delicate
problem that neither interest ever clashed, and the one but served the
other. :

The writer has presented these few brief statements, not with the
idea of giving a history of the Museum, nor any sort of adequate
recognition to the men who have had it in charge, but simply to show
in outline what the purposes of the Museum have been; how the devo-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

tion of its officers has made it grow; how the other Departments of the
Government have strengthened it; how private persons all over the
country have aided in building up and increasing the importance of
the national collections commensurate with the growth of intelligence
and the development of research in a country so preéminently devoted
to the arts of peace as the United States.

BUILDINGS.

Through the construction of four new galleries and the leasing of
three small buildings south of B street, some additional space has been
gained during the year, but not more than was required to meet the
urgent current demands caused by recent increases in the collections
and the needs of the mechanical work. All of the galleries in
question were designed for storage purposes, two to receive mainly
the Geological Survey collections elsewhere referred to, one in
part for the Division of Plants, and one for the overflow from the
Library. In this connection it is interesting to note that the ten gal-
leries erected during the past three years have added to the Museum
building, which contained originally 140,625 square feet on the ground
floor, an area of only about 22,600 feet, equivalent to about 16 per
cent, while the collections have increased over twenty-fold since the
first occupancy of the building in 1881.

The renting of additional outside quarters has made it possible to
remove from the Museum building or from its immediate vicinity all
of the shops in which the heavier or more noisy kinds of work are
carried on or whose contents constitute an element of danger from
fire, such as the carpenter and paint shops, as well as the laboratories
for several branches of specimen preparation.

It becomes necessary, unfortunately, to call attention to certain
structural weaknesses in the roof of the Museum building, disclosed by
the great storm of February, 1899, which caused a number of the main
iron girders to buckle badly and gave warning of more serious trouble
in the near future unless ample precautions be promptly taken. The
small size of the appropriation available for the purpose rendered it
impossible to do more at the time than repair the immediate damage,
but a thorough inspection will be made to determine what further
action may be required. This roof was built some twenty years ago,
before the extensive use of iron or steel in such constructions and
when the conditions of their use in buildings of so great a width were
but imperfectly understood.

THE COLLECTIONS.
Additions. —The scientific collections have been increased during the
year to the extent of over 210,000 specimens, comprised in 1,497
accessions. The total number of specimens now in the Museum is
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

recorded at above 4,355,000, without fully taking into account many
hundreds of bottles of small organisms, which, were it possible to
enumerate their contents, would swell the total almost incredibly.

As the custodian of all specimens obtained by Government. scien-
tific expeditions, both at home and abroad, as the recipient of innu-
merable gifts and exchanges from private sources, many of which
have been of very large size, and by purchase, the National Museum
has acquired a greater fund of material than any other similar estab-
lishment in this country, while but few in Europe can equal or surpass
it in this regard. With adequate and appropriate quarters it would
soon take rank with the oldest and best museums of the world.

Among the more important accessions of the year in anthropology
have been a collection of about 1,000 pieces representing the costumes,
implements, and ceremonial objects of the Plains and Rocky Mountain
Indians, brought together a number of years ago by M. E. Granier,
now of Paris, France; a second installment of the Steiner collection
of prehistoric stone implements and other objects from the Indian
mounds near Grovetown, Georgia; and a part of the celebrated bas-
ketry collection of Dr. W. J. Hudson, illustrating in much detail the
exquisite workmanship of the Pomo Indians of California. The above
were acquired by purchase.

In biology the Museum is deeply indebted to Mr. W. H. Ashmead,
one of its assistant curators, for the generous gift of his valuable pri-
vate collection of insects, consisting of over 60,000 specimens and
containing a very large number of types. The Division of Insects has
now nearly 1,000,000 specimens, of which 125,000 were received the
past year. This is the largest numerical showing made by any branch
of the Museum, the Division of Mollusks coming next, followed by
the Division of Marine Invertebrates.

In geology mention may be made of the large collection of verte-
brate fossils acquired by the U. S. Geological Survey, which had been
in the custody of Prof. O. C. Marsh, at Yale College. Since the death
of this distinguished paleontologist the transfer of this collection to
the National Museum has been arranged for by the Director of the
Survey, and the work of bringing it to Washington was in progress at
the close of the fiscal year. A very large amount of space will be
required for its installation.

The Government bureaus to which the Museum has been chiefly
indebted for material are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission,
and several divisions of the Department of Agriculture. In addition
to the Marsh collection, already referred to, the Geological Survey has
turned over during the year several important series of invertebrate
and plant fossils described in its recent reports, besides a number of
rock specimens and rare minerals. The Fish Commission has con-
tributed a very extensive and valuable collection from the island of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

Porto Rico and its vicinity, comprising fishes, marine invertebrates,
and land animals, and also much material from other regions. From
the Department of Agriculture mammals, insects, and plants have been
received.

Exchanges have been extensively carried on with scientific institu-
tions in all parts of the world, and, as the returns have consisted mainly
of specimens identified by competent authorities, making them imme-
diately useful for comparison in the study of new material, the
Museum has been greatly benefited by these transactions.

Installation.—The display collections in anthropology now occupy
9 halls and 4 galleries, though all of these have not yet been made
ready for the public. Much has been accomplished during the year in
the way of adding to these exhibits and improving them in every
branch of the department and with most effective results. The
changes are most conspicuous in the North Hall, or Hall of American
History, from which all the cases of small size and odd pattern have
been removed, to give place to 30 large cases of uniform and pleasing
design, arranged in 4 rows, with roomy aisles between. The most
important additions to the historical collections have related to the war
with Spain, and these, owing to their number and the large size of
some objects, have made it necessary to extend this exhibit into the
central rotunda. The Boat Hall, occupying the North East Range,
has also been entirely rehabilitated, a terrazzo pavement replacing the
old wooden floor, and a very capacious case having been built around
the four sides of the room. The boat collection, which has been
assembled at the cost of much time and effort, is a very large and com
prehensive one, representing by models and actual examples the
primitive and modern crafts of all parts of the world, and its rear-
rangement has been carried out in a systematic and instructive
manner.

Although chiefly occupied with the duties of Executive Curator,
Doctor True has still been able to make some progress in the rein-
stallation of the exhibition collections which come under his immediate
charge as Head Curator of Biology. The plans for this work, as
described in the report for 1898, contemplate a faunal basis for the
new arrangement, in which the fauna of North America shall have
special prominence. The mounted specimens of mammals have been
replaced in the South Hall, though only temporarily, pending the con-
struction of new cases. The American species remain on the ground
floor, while those of the Old World have been transferred to the
recently constructed gallery above.

The number of birds on display has been greatly reduced, though
the space occupied remains the same, thus remedying the overcrowded
condition of the cases, improving their appearance, and bringing the
exhibit more within the comprehension of the public. Experiments
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

are also being made to secure an effective lighting of the large central
part of the Bird Hall, which the absence of windows has rendered
practically valueless for exhibition purposes. A series of the game.
birds and game fishes of North America has been placed in the entrance
hall of the Smithsonian Building, and the exhibition collection of
marine invertebrates has been rearranged and relabeled.

In the Department of Geology the reinstallation in new quarters
of the systematic series of nonmetallic products, the geographic series,
and the building and ornamental stones has been nearly completed.
The collection of meteorites has now become very extensive, and that
of gems is not surpassed either in numbers or varieties by any public
collection in this country.

SXPLORATIONS AND RESEARCHES.

Though having insufficient funds for making field explorations on
an extensive scale, some work of this character, to fill in gaps in the
collections, has been carried on nearly every year, the direction given
it being along lines or into regions not covered by other Government
bureaus. Realizing the practical utility of early researches into the
natural history of the recently acquired possessions, an appropriation
for that purpose was asked of Congress, and its failure of passage at
the last session will, it is hoped, only defer the project for a short time.
Soon after the close of hostilities an agent was dispatched to Cuba and
Porto Rico to obtain material illustrative of the historical phases of
the war with Spain. Much success was met both in securing collec-
tions and in interesting persons on the ground to add to them.

Important researches in California and Mexico, with reference to
prehistoric man as well as the modern Indians, were conducted by Dr.
W. H. Holmes, who brought back a large and interesting collection.
Mr. J. B. Hatcher is carrying on extensive inquiries in Patagonia for
both Princeton University and the National Museum, and one impor-
tant lot of specimens has already been received from him. Dr. J. N.
Rose and Dr. Walter Hough spent some time in Mexico in botanical
and ethnological investigations, and a number of other small expedi-
tions were in the field at one time or another during the year, their
activities relating to several different subjects.

As before explained, the explorations by which the Museum is mainly
benefited are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Com-
mission, and certain scientific divisions of the Department of Agricul-
ture. Mention should also be made of the numerous contributions
received from officers of the Army and Navy, whose opportunities for
collecting have been greatly increased by the present activities in the
military service. There have been many accessions from these various
sources during the year, and references to the field work in connection
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. jt

with which the specimens were obtained will be found elsewhere in
this report.

While the scientific staff is constantly occupied with the routine
duties involved in the care and installation of the collections, a num-
ber of its members have found time for research work and the prepara-
tion of important scientific papers. Persons not belonging to the
staff and in part attached to other bureaus of the Government have
been given facilities for study, and specimens in many groups have
been sent away to specialists, both in this country and abroad, for
examination and report. In this way the collections are being worked
up and made known through the medium of the Museum publications,
though not nearly so fast as they are added to.

PUBLIC BENEFITS OF THE MUSEUM.

The primary object of the Museum is to store and safeguard the
Government and other collections confided to its care and to arrange
and classify these collections so as to facilitate their study. This has
been interpreted to include the display of such parts of the collections
as may instruct the general public, the granting to properly qualified
students of facilities for working up materials, and the preparation of
sets of duplicate specimens for distribution to the educational institu-
tions of higher grade throughout the country.

A public museum is, of course, chiefly known through its accessi-
bility to the visiting public, and a very large part of the work of the
National Museum consists in the proper arrangement of carefully
selected specimens in attractive cases with suitable labels attached.
The force necessary to guard the collections and to keep the building
open and in presentable condition uses up a large share of its energy
and funds, and the American public is not slow to take advantage of
the opportunity offered. During the past year 192,471 persons visited
the Museum building and 116,912 the Smithsonian building. It is not
possible to fairly institute a comparison between the number of visit-
ors to the National Museum at Washington and to great public museums
elsewhere, whether national or municipal, since the latter are usually
situated in the very largest cities in each State or country, with vast
populations whence visitors may be drawn, while in Washington there
is a comparatively small population, and it can be safely estimated that
a very large percentage of the visitors to the Museum are from places
other than the Capital, so that the influence of the Museum extends to
every part of the country.

Of almost equal importance as to results, though restricted to a
small number, is the policy of rendering the collections accessible to
properly accredited investigators and students. The Smithsonian
Institution from the outset never engaged directly in teaching in any
form, assuming that the many educational institutions throughout the
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

country afforded ample facilities for this purpose, but its collections
and to a certain extent even the time of the members of its scientific
staff have been at the service of students and scholars whose training
warranted the expectation that their researches here would be fruitful
in the advancement of knowledge. An ever-increasing number of
such persons have resorted to the Museum from time to time or have
been sent material for examination, no less than 110 having been
engaged in studies upon the collections during the past year. Their
names and the special studies in which they were engaged will be
found recorded elsewhere in this report.

Yet another class of persons have made demands upon the Museum—
those who, being unable to come to Washington, ask for information
by letter. These are sometimes scientific men engaged in special work;
more often the general public desiring answers to some question,
wishing to have some specimen which they have picked up identi-
fied, or other matters of this sort. All subjects with which the
Museum has to deal and, indeed, many which in no way come within
its scope have been included in this correspondence. Whenever the
requests for information have been at all reasonable or have come
within the province of the Museum or the knowledge of any member of
its staff, such letters have been answered, although they entail an ever-
increasing amount of research and time.

In the collections which reach the Museum there are naturally many
duplicates, and these are used for two purposes—first, for exchanges
with other museums, thereby furnishing a means for filling gaps in
the collections, and secondly, in furtherance of the general plan for
the diffusion of knowledge, being prepared in small sets, labeled, and
sent to educational institutions of the higher grades throughout the
United States.

Since the first international exposition in the United States, held at
Philadelphia in 1876, there have been many such, either international
in scope or of sufficient importance to receive recognition from Con-
gress. All Congressional acts authorizing and aiding expositions in
this country have directed participation by the Smithsonian Institution
and its bureaus, and the collections which have been sent to them have
invariably been drawn, in the main, from the National Museum. ‘This
participation of the Museum has recognized advantages to the country,
in rendering public-spirited persons in different localities familiar with
museum benefits and methods, and to it are directly traceable the
founding of several museums. It has also at times resulted in con-
siderable accessions to the National Museum, although of later years
these have been less valuable than formerly.

There are, however, on the other hand, certain disadvantages of which
mention should be made. Expositions have followed each other so
closely that there is hardly a time when a portion of the Museum staff
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

is not engaged in planning for or taking part in one or unpacking and
replacing the specimens which have been returned. The collections
which are sent out necessarily suffer to some extent, and while it has
been the policy of the Museum not to exhibit in the perishable struc-
tures usually built for such purposes any unique object or one which
could not be replaced, many excellent specimens have been displayed at
every exposition in which the Museum has been represented, and these
have unquestionably deteriorated. Should the holding of expositions
in the country continue at such brief intervals as during the past ten
years, and the Museum be expected to participate in all of them, it
would seem almost necessary that a special duplicate collection for
these purposes be kept on hand, since it is not only the injury to the
specimens which is to be deplored, but the constant interference with
the arrangement of the collections and the great amount of labor
expended in removing specimens from their cases and in properly
replacing them.

At the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition held at Omaha
during the summer and early autumn of 1898 the several scientific
departments of the Museum were extensively represented in connection
with the Government display.

The participation of the Government Departments and bureaus in
two other expositions has been authorized by Congress during the past
year. The first of these, the Pan-American, will be held at Buffalo in
1901, and the second, the Ohio Centennial, at Toledo in 1902 or 1903.
Tn each case $500,000 has been appropriated, $200,000 being for the
buildings and $300,000 for the exhibits. The preliminary arrange-
ments for the Pan-American Exposition had so far progressed before
the close of the year as to call for the appointment of representatives
composing the Government board of management. Dr. Frederick W.
True has been designated to act for the Museum in this capacity.

LIBRARY.

Through the purchase, by special act of Congress, of the scientific
library of the late Doctor Goode, the Museum has secured a very note-
worthy addition. This collection comprises 2,900 bound volumes,
18,000 pamphlets, and 1,800 portraits, autographs, etc., and contains
many rare and valuable publications, being especially rich in the liter-
ature of museums and of fishes. Its acquisition increases the size of
the working library belonging to the Museum to some 15,000 books
and 26,500 pamphlets, but besides this, in order to meet the require-
ments of the scientific work, the Smithsonian collection has at all times
to be largely drawn upon, and the accommodations assigned the library
have long since been outgrown. A gallery has recently been built
across one end of the West North Range to afford relief, but it can
only be regarded as a temporary expedient.
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications issued during the year comprise five volumes,
namely: The Annual Report for 1896; volume 20 of the Proceedings
in bound form, and the separate papers of volume 21; and parts 2 and
3 of the important bulletin entitled ‘‘The Fishes of North and Middle
America,” by Doctors David S. Jordan and Barton W. Evermann.
The number of scientific papers based upon Museum collections which
have been printed, chiefly in the above volumes though to some extent
in outside journals, is 318, representing 75 authors.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1898-99.

By Wiutiam H. Houmes
ry ’
Head Curator.

During the year a number of important changes have been made in
the manner of transacting the business of the Department of Anthro-
pology. Some of the changes relate to the abbreviation of the routine,
but the most important ones result from the introduction of the card-
catalogue system into the work of the Department staff, and the keep-
ing of all the catalogue books by a recording clerk in the office of the
head curator. Formerly, separate books were assigned to the several
divisions and independent sections. This work is now conducted by a
single expert assistant, and the curators and other keepers of the col-
lections make card catalogues for their own use.

FIELD WORK.

No systematic field work is provided for by the Museum, but limited
funds are available for use when especially important results are
promised. The work for the year has been as follows:

The head curator spent September and part of October in California
visiting various Indian tribes and giving particular attention to the
question of man’s antiquity in the Sierra region. Interesting ethno-
logical collections were made representing the Digger, the Pomo, and
the Tulare tribes, and much archeological material was secured in the
auriferous-gravel region, in the San Joaquin Valley, in the vicinity
of Los Angeles, and on the island of Santa Catalina. A visit to the
Indian tribes of New Mexico and Arizona was planned, but was aban-
doned because of the epidemic of smallpox which was discovered to
be raging among many of the pueblos.

On the breaking otit of the war with Spain it was recognized that
an important epoch in our national history had been initiated, and
measures were taken to secure for the Museum such relics and memen-
tos of the campaign as would be of interest to the people. The War
Department and the Navy Department were appealed to, and Mr. Paul
Beckwith, assistant in the Section of American History, was sent to
Cuba and Porto Rico to act as agent for the Institution. Mr. Beck-
with’s visit to Cuba was cut short by the breaking out of yellow fever,
but in Porto Rico between four and five months were spent, chiefly at
Ponce, and many valuable additions were made to the historical series,
and, besides, a number of archzological objects were secured. Unfor-
- tunately, a considerable portion of the collections, delivered to trans-
portation agents at San Juan, never reached the Museum.

NAT MUS 99 2 17

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

After returning from Porto Rico, Mr. Beckwith paid visits to Nor-
folk, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and other points, for the purpose of
examining and securing such objects of interest as had reached the
navy-yards from various points, and more especially from the war
vessels destroyed by our fleet at Santiago de Cuba.

In April the head curator was invited to be the guest of Mr. George
Brackenridge, of San Antonio, Texas, on a trip to various points in
Mexico. The journey afforded him an opportunity of revisiting sey-
eral points of interest, including the valley of Mexico, San Juan
Teotihuacan, and Orizaba, and of examining for the first time two of
the most interesting archeological sites in Mexico, namely, the ruins
of Xochicalco, near Cuernavaca, state of Morelos, and the obsidian
mines of Hidalgo. At the latter place valuable observations were
made and many minor relics illustrative of the quarrying and shaping
of the obsidian by the ancient Nahuatl tribes were obtained.

Toward the latter part of May, Dr. Walter Hough, assistant curator
of the Division of Ethnology, joined Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Division
of Botany, in an extended excursion into Mexico. Three months
were spent in the field and Doctor Hough was enabled to make the
acquaintance of the native peoples at many points and to secure col-
lections of interest in ethnology, ethnobotany, and archeology.

COLLECTIONS RECEIVED.

The more important collections received through gift, purchase,
and exchange during the year may be briefly mentioned:

1. A collection of 121 specimens of Polynesian ethnological objects,
brought together mainly by Mr. Henry Adams and acquired through
the bequest of Mr. W. H. Phillips, of which the archeological por-
tions were recorded during the preceding year.

2. Two hundred and thirty-four objects illustrating the potter’s
art as practiced in early days in Morgantown, West Virginia, pre-
sented by Miss Jennie Thompson through Dr. Walter Hough. The
period covered extends from 1790-1888.

3. A collection of considerable importance embodying archeological
and ethnological materials from Mexico and Central America, pur-
chased from Mr. E. W. Nelson, who spent a number of years travel-
ing and collecting in these countries.

4, A large number of well-preserved specimens of ancient mound
pottery, acquired by purchase from Mr. G. F. Morris, of Memphis,
Tennessee.

5. A collection of 18 ancient Peruvian trephined skulls, brought
together by Dr. M. A. Munfiz and acquired through the Bureau of
American Ethnology.

6. The most important collection received by the Division of Eth-
nology during the year was purchased from M. Emil Granier, of

Paris. It consists mainly of ethnological materials collected from the
Indian tribes of the middle-western section of the United States.

INSTALLATION WORK.

Division of Ethnology.—The installation work of the Division of
Ethnology is under the direct supervision of Prof. O. T. Mason,
curator, who has been ably supported by Dr. Walter Hough, assistant
curator, and T. W. Sweeny, preparator. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and
Mrs. M. ©. Stevenson have most generously lent their aid in the
Pueblo section, and the head curator has taken an active part in plan-

‘ning and promoting the work. The following halls and galleries are

occupied by the division: West North Range, North West Range,
North West Court Gallery, West Hall, and West Hall Gallery, north
side.

Collections illustrating many of the Indian tribes of the United
States and Canada have been assembled in the West North Range
whose walls are occupied by the great series of Catlin paintings, an
appropriate association, considering that the peoples represented in
the collections are in large part those among whom Catlin worked.
The principal series of cases have been arranged to form two sets of
alcoves, eight on the south side and eight on the north, each alcove
devoted to a single ethnographic province.

Although the exhibits are not yet as complete as could be desired,
they form undoubtedly the most complete exposition of the great
group of tribes represented ever brought together.

Within the alcoves the collections are grouped as to subject-matter,
first by tribes and second by industrial or other cultural concepts,
such as costume, weapons, and basketry. The installation unit is the
case, the half case, and the unit box. The labels are carefully drawn
up to serve asa key to the classification and grouping. The alcove
labels, standing for ethnic provinces are of generous dimensions and
are placed at the back of the alcoves, above the wall cases. The case
or section labels, standing for ethnic and industrial subdivisions, are
smaller and are placed against the upper edge of the cases or at other
points in close connection with the exhibits to which they pertain.

Brief individual labels are employed in connection with the speci-
mens. The system of labeling is carried out, so far as it happens to
be applicable, in the other halls of the Department.

The wide aisle extending lengthwise of the hall accommodates a
series of large cases occupied mainly by lay-figure groups. It is
intended that the floor space in each alcove shall, in time, contain a
family group illustrating some typical tribe of the province repre-
sented by the alcove; but as this is not practicable at present, house
groups on a small scale, showing how the people of the province live,

are used, or otherwise miscellaneous exhibits are introduced to fill the

spaces.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

This hall was until recently occupied for lecture purposes. Its
permanent assignment to the Division of Ethnology has enabled the
curators to place on exhibition a large body of material not heretofore
shown.

The North West Range contains exhibits from the northwest coast
Indian tribes and the Eskimo. The only change made during the year
had to do with the reinstallation of collections, especially the larger
objects, the aim being to enhance the general effect of the hall. The
removal of the long-coiled radiators which formerly occupied the
floor along the entire west side, and the substitution of a continuous
line of cases, was accomplished during the previous year and added
greatly to the capacity and effect of the hall.

The geographical order of the exhibits and the peoples represented
are kept in mind. In passing from Alcove VIII of the West North
Range, where the Yukon-Mackenzie province is shown, are encountered
at the north end of the hall a large group of exhibits illustrating the
Northwest Coast peoples. These oceupy the north and west walls,
parts of the east and south walls, and a number of floor cases. Eskimo
collections fill most of the floor cases toward the south, and the wall
cases and wall spaces in the east and south. In the window spaces are
a line of transparencies, the views relating mainly to the peoples
represented in the collections of the hall.

The North West Court, which contains the series of exhibits from
the Pueblo tribes of the arid region of the Southwest, has received
much attention during the year. Doctor Fewkes has arranged an
extensive series of Tusayan vases on the west side and Mrs. Steven-
son has installed a case illustrating the use of prayer sticks by the
Pueblo tribes. The collection of modern pottery has been overhauled
and a series of unit boxes containing baskets, textile products, cere-
monial objects, etc., has been placed on top of the wall case surrounding
the hall.

The Gallery of the North West Court has not yet been opened to the
public. The new wall case was finished about the close of the year
and the installation of collections from Mexico and Central and South
America has been commenced. The case on the west and north sides
of the gallery is temporarily occupied by the very extensive collection
of basketry which Professor Mason is engaged in studying.

West Hall is occupied mainly by collections illustrating the various
peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa. - These have been partially rein-
stalled during the year. The gallery on the north side has been fur-
nished with aleoved wall cases, and collections from the Indo-Pacific
have been placed in them. The work of installation is not yet com-
plete. Professor Mason has prepared a great number of labels during
the year and many of these have been typewritten and placed with the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. yal

exhibits. Many labels for alcoves, cases, and groups prepared during
the year have been submitted to the printer.

Division of History.—In no other section of the Department has such
decided advance been made as in that of American history. This
branch is under the custodianship of Mr. A. Howard Clark, but as he
is necessarily much preoccupied with editorial duties, a great deal of
the work has fallen to the share of his assistant, Mr. Paul Beckwith;
and the head curator has from the start given all possible aid and
encouragement to the work, which he regards as of first importance
in the national collection.

At the beginning of the preceding fiscal year the exhibits of the
section were confined to a few cases in the North Hall. The floor
space then accommodated the collections of ceramics, lacquers, coins,
and metal work, besides many things of minor importance. Now, the
historic collections occupy the floor space almost exclusively and the
Rotunda also is utilized by this section. Mr. Clark’s report for the
year contains the following paragraphs:

During the last decade general interest in American history has rapidly increased,
and to keep pace with this popular demand the Section of American History in the
National Museum has been gradually developed until it has become one of the most
instructive branches of the Museum.

The year ending June 30, 1899, was an eventful one in American history, and the
war with Spain caused public attention to be centered on the military as well as the
political history of the country. To illustrate and perpetuate the history of events
of the year, the head curator of the Department of Anthropology permitted an
extension of the space heretofore allotted to historical relics and encouraged the col-
lection of as many objects as possible that pertained to the war, and in making this
special increase in the collection it was found possible to add considerably to the
series of objects illustrating earlier events in the nation’s history.

The actual number of accessions during the year was 165, which included about
1,027 individual specimens. Among the most important may be mentioned a large
number of objects gathered by Mr. Beckwith during a trip to Porto Rico and Cuba,
including a very exhaustive series of swords of Toledo steel, representing the various
arms of the service, flags, uniforms, and the paraphernalia of military life.

Other very interesting accessions were received from the Navy Department, melud-
ing numerous relics recovered from the battle ship Maine, destroyed in Havana Har-
bor, bronze cannon captured from the Spanish in Manila by Admiral Dewey, relics
from Oervera’s fleet destroyed off Santiago, and numerous relics of various battles
and events of the war with Spain. The War Department also contributed some
Spanish rifles and other objects. Many individuals, particularly Gen. G. H. Harries,
Capt. H. C. Wilson, Lieut. J. C. Ord, Capt. Richard P. Leary, Admiral Charles
O'Neil, Capt. Robley D. Evans, contributed objects of special interest.

There has been installed in the section a special case devoted to historical objects,
loaned by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, including personal
relics of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, James Madison, Lord
Fairfax, and others eminent in American history.

The collection of the Daughters of the American Revolution has been made of
added interest by the exhibition of personal relics of Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,

. and some interesting objects pertaining to the colonial history of Maryland.
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Perhaps the most interesting single objects received during the year were the John
Paul Jones flag, with a musket and boarding sword, used in the battle between the
Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis, presented to the Smithsonian Institution by
Mrs. Harriet Perry Stafford.

The most striking improvement in the installation of these exhibits
has resulted from the removal of all cases of small size and odd patterns
from the hall and the assembling of some thirty large cases of the best
design. These are arranged in four rows, extending lengthwise of the
hall, having roomy aisles between, the whole effect being simplified
so that the groupings of furniture and objects conform properly with
the architectural lines and proportions of the hall. The exhibits are
arranged chronologically. Beginning at the left of the north entrance
with the period of discovery the visitor passes down through illustra-
tions of colonial and Revolutionary times to the opening of the civil
war in 1861. Returning to the north end of the hall on the east side
we have, first, collections relating to the civil war, including seven cases
devoted to the relics of General Grant, one case to the meager series
pertaining to Lincoln, and six cases to miscellaneous relics. These are
followed by cases containing exhibits relating to great American invent-
ors, and at the south end and overflowing into the Rotunda are collec-
tions illustrating the late war with Spain.

Division of Mechanical Technology.—TVhis division is in charge of
Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator, with Mr. George C. Maynard as aid. The
notable feature of the year was the rehabilitation of the North East
Range, called also Boat Hall. The east side is devoted to a series of
models illustrating the water craft of the world, beginning at the
north with the simple raft, and passing step by step through the suc-
cessive grades of elaboration in hull, propelling devices, and steering
apparatus to the modern steamship. This series is continued in the
floor cases at the south end of the hall in a very important group of
exhibits illustrating the introduction of steam power and the specializa-
tion of modern steam navigation. A number of floor cases toward the
north end contain models of boats of various semicivilized countries.

The wall case of the west side displays an extensive series of models
of fishing craft, mainly those in use in American waters, and the ceil-
ing is hung with primitive boats from many parts of America.

This division occupies also the east half of East Hall, the principal
exhibits relating to land transportation and electricity. Much prog-
ress has been made, but the work of installation has not yet reached
such a degree of completion as to warrant the publication of details.

Section of Graphic Arts.—The Section of Graphic Arts occupies the
Northeast Court, and is in charge of the head curator, with Mr. Paul
Brockett as assistant. The very complete series of exhibits was
brought together by Dr. S. R. Koehler, curator, who retired from
active supervision of the work on account of ill health. The cases
..

have been rebuilt and are arranged in alcoves, six on the east and six
on the west side. On the east side exhibits are presented in contin-
uous order, illustrating the technology of the engraver’s art; on the
west are illustrations of the pictorial product, beginning at the south
with early prints and closing at the north with the color printing of
to-day. In the aisle which extends from north to south are exhibits
illustrating the history of painting.

Division of Religions.—The Division of Religions, Dr. Cyrus Adler,
custodian, and I. M. Casanowiez, aid, has been assigned to the South
Gallery of the West Hall, where a handsome alcoved wall case has
been built. The series of exhibits begin at the east with illustrations
of the Jewish religion, and these are followed by Greek, Roman, Mo-
hammedan, and Buddhistie groups. Collections of the Division of
Historic Archeology, also in charge of Doctor Adler, are placed in
the east end of West Hall and remain about as installed the previous
year.

Division of Prehistoric Archwology.—The exhibits of this division,
which are in charge of Dr. Thomas Wilson, assisted by Mr. E. P.
Upham, have not undergone any radical change during the year,
although the work of installing new material and perfecting the
arrangement of the old has gone steadily forward.

RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS.

The usual activity has been shown by the anthropological staff in
€onducting researches germane to the work of the department. Pro-
fessor Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, has prepared and
completed a paper on the curved steel knife among the Eskimo and
Canadian tribes, in which an attempt is made to show that carving and
etching and fine netting for snowshoes are contemporaneous with this
knife. Before the steel knife the Eskimo did little creditable carving.
Also a paper on a peculiar heddle frame for belt weaving was traced
from the Pueblo country to its source in Europe.

The Indians of the Kootenai use a bark canoe, pointed at the water
line like a modern ram. It is unique in the Western Hemisphere, but
photographs and descriptions have been gathered by Professor Mason
to show its nearest congeners on the Amur.

For some time Professor Mason has been gathering material for the
study of zootechny among the American aborigines. This has enabled
him to divide the continent into certain marked zootechnic areas, in
which even the language, social institutions, and beliefs of the peoples
are modified. Following up this idea of areas of characterization, he
has pursued the subject of geographic distribution of hunting devices
associated with the capture of certain species.

It happened during the year that the Spanish-American war sud-
denly brought into conspicuous attention the ancient history of Porto
24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Rico, and the Smithsonian Institution has found it advisable to repub-
lish Professor Mason’s papers on the Jeb and Guesde collections
of West Indian antiquities.

Dr. Walter Hough, assistant curator, completed his monograph on
Eskimo lamps, and continued his investigation of the utilization of fire
and the manufacture of bark textiles.

Mr. J. D. McGuire has been engaged in making an exhaustive study
of primitive technology.

Dr. Thomas Wilson has carried on various researches relating in the
main to prehistoric archeology.

In connection with a paper treating of Museum buildings he has
conducted studies regarding the amount of light admitted through
glass of various kinds, and an extended article on the use of poisoned
arrows by primitive peoples has been prepared. Doctor Wilson has
also elaborated a paper on the subject of prehistoric trephining, and
has continued his investigation relating to arrow points, spear heads,
and knives of prehistoric times.

The head curator has been so fully occupied with administrative duties
in the Museum that little time has been at his disposal for research work.
The trip to California in the interest of the Museum collections gave
him the opportunity of visiting the auriferous gravel region, from
which a considerable body of testimony has been obtained relating to
the antiquity of man. This evidence he has carefully examined, and a
paper reviewing the general subject will appear in the American
Anthropologist for the year 1899. e
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1898-99.

By Frepertck W. TRUp,
Head Curator.

The year covered by the last report was one of great changes, due
to reorganization of the scientific staff of the Museum and the erec-
tion of galleries in the Museum building. A new plan for the exhi-
bition series in biology was decided upon and a beginning made in
carrying it into effect. This plan contemplates the arrangement of
the exhibition series on a faunal basis, the fauna of North America
being given special prominence. Good progress in this line was made
in several divisions during the year covered by the present report.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EXHIBITION HALLS.

In the Division of Mammals the old wall cases, which were no longer
suitable on the floor, were transferred to the gallery and added to, so
as to oceupy the whole length of the hall on both sides. In these were
installed the series representing the mammal faunas of the Old World,
Africa being on the east side, and Eurasia and Australia on the west
side. The cases were refitted throughout, the backs being covered
with plain burlap and the floor with linoleum. Such shelves as were
needed were made of pine and covered with burlap to correspond with
the back. This style of fitting is comparatively inexpensive, is pleas-
ing in effect, and has the excellent quality of extreme durability. All
the Old World mammals were placed in these cases, but for the small
forms—squirrels, mice, bats, ete. —temporary floor cases were brought
into use, pending the construction of cases especially adapted for this
purpose. The whole series received temporary labels. On the screen
at the south end of the gallery, which separates the exhibition space
from the paleontological laboratories, the beautiful illustrations of the
eat family from Elliot’s Monograph were displayed. There is not
sufficient space at this end of the gallery for mounted specimens.

The floor of the South Hall, as stated in last year’s report, is given
up exclusively to American mammals. The cases on hand were
arranged to give as good an effect as possible, but on account of the
galleries some new cases will doubtless have to be erected for the large
forms. The seals, sea lions, and walruses, especially, are not satisfac-

torily installed.

26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

The great progress made in the study of North American mammals
during the last decade has rendered it necessary to thoroughly revise
the exhibition series representing this fauna, and the taxidermic work
was almost entirely restricted to North American species during the
past year. The object aimed at is to have on exhibition a perfect
specimen of every known species and subspecies inhabiting North
America.

The exhibition series of North American fishes, reptiles, and batra-
chians was considerably improved and completely labeled. It can
not, however, be extended, nor can the faunas of other parts of the
world be represented without additional space. The present quarters
are far from ideal, either as regards lighting or arrangement of space.

The most radical change of the year was in the Division of Birds.
On account of the large number of specimens mounted for various
expositions, and for other reasons, the exhibition series had become
entirely overcrowded, so that nothing could be seen satisfactorily.
After long consideration of the matter it seemed impossible to apply
any other remedy than to withdraw a large proportion of the birds.
This was done under the supervision of the curator and assistant
curator, and the result has proved most satisfactory. Although the
lighting of the hall is not of the best, the whole exhibition series of
single-mounted specimens can now be seen to good advantage, except
in the quadrangular space in the center of the hall. No improvement
of the lighting is possible at that point without artificial means.
Experiments were made in that direction at the close of the year which
promise to solve the difficulty.

The groups of birds, which are among the most attractive features

of the series, are still poorly provided for. They are chiefly installed
in cases made for use in temporary expositions, and are neither dust-
tight nor sufficiently uniform in pattern.
- The exhibition series of invertebrates (other than mollusks and
insects) was very thoroughly revised. The main series, as in other
branches, is now North American. A new system of installation was
devised for the dry specimens, which are exhibited in flat table cases.
The specimens representing each species are placed in a separate shal-
low tray. All the trays are of equal depth and uniform in size (or
a multiple of the unit). When a case has its full complement of
trays it has the appearance of being divided into compartments, with
a single species in each compartment. The effect is very satisfactory.
Temporary typewritten labels were made for the larger part of the
series during the year. Certain parts of the series, such as worms,
entomostraca, ete., are still incomplete, as the Museum collections do
not at present contain specimens in these classes suitable for exhibi-
tion purposes.

The synoptic series of invertebrates, formeriy in the Division of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27
Comparative Anatomy, has been placed in the same hall with the other
invertebrates, at the west end of the Smithsonian building, in cases
specially constructed to receive it. It needs revision and the addition
of numerous types.

Nothing of special moment was accomplished toward improving the
exhibition series of insects and of mollusks.

Owing to the erection of a gallery in the East-South Range, the
whale skeletons suspended from the ceiling near the side walls had to
be removed to a position nearer the center of the hall. To protect
the roof from collapse and to sustain the skeletons, specially con-
structed wrought-iron slings were devised by the Chief of Buildings.
The hall was necessarily in confusion while these large specimens
were being readjusted, but at the close of the year it had been brought
again to an orderly condition. The exhibition series of osteological
specimens is very full and can not be much expanded in the present
quarters.

A special series, comprising the principal North American game
birds and game fishes, was placed on exhibition in the hallway of the
Smithsonian building, together with a number of mounted heads of
large game—the moose, caribou, antelope, ete.

ACCESSIONS.

The accessions of the year, though not equaling those of 1898 in
number of specimens, were of at least equal scientific interest and
importance.

The U. S. Fish Commission transmitted an extensive zoological
collection made during its recent exploration of the island of Porto
Rico. It comprised not less than 5,000 mollusks, representing some
400 species (including a number of new forms and other rare and
interesting material) and a large series of invertebrates of other
classes.

While associated with the representatives of the U. 8S. Fish Com-
mission in the zoological exploration of Porto Rico, Mr. A. B. Baker
collected an extensive series of bats, about 200 reptiles and batrachians
(including several undescribed species), and over 100 bird skins.

In the Division of Mammals, on account of the fact that the mate-
rial was largely collected to supply deficiencies, the additions were of
much interest. Some 900 small mammals were collected for the
Museum by Mr. Loring in Norway, Germany, and Italy. These were
chiefly from localities from which the types of the earlier European
mammalogists were derived, and hence of importance in determining
the identity of described species. A collection of European bats and
an additional lot of small mammals from Norway were also purchased.
These are the first collections of Kuropean mammals of any moment
which have found their way into the Museum. Baron de Selys-
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

. Longchamps, well known as an authority upon the rodentia, presented
25 specimens of small mammals, identified by himself.

A collection of 13 Alaska moose and wild sheep was obtained for the
Museum by Mr. Dall DeWeese. One of these specimens has been
made the type of a new species of moose— Alces gigas Miller.

Among the mammals received from the National Zoological Park
were an elephant and a lion.

The additions to the collections of birds, though less in extent than
in some previous years, included much important material, among
which should be mentioned a collection of 58 specimens of Colombian
birds, presented by Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, and
5 skins of the Californian Condor, purchased from Mr. F. H. Holmes,
of Berryessa, California.

Doctor Ralph, custodian of the Section of Birds’ Eggs, as in past
years, made a valuable contribution to the collection under his charge,
consisting in this instance of some 200 eggs from various sections of
North America. Mr. C. F. Baker, of Alabama, presented 127 eggs
from the Western United States.

The U. 5. Fish Commission transferred to the Museum a large col-
lection of reptiles and batrachians which had been assembled from time
to time by its field agents. This contained many specimens of impor-
tance, including unique specimens of a discoglossoid toad, the only
representative of this suborder of batrachians which has been found
inthe Western Hemisphere. It has been described by Doctor Stejneger
under the name of Ascaphus truet.

A small but interesting collection of reptiles from Java, made by
Prof. D. G. Fairchild, was transmitted to the Museum by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

A series of fishes of North and Central Asia, collected by M. Chaf-
fanjon, was received from the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris. The
U.S. Fish Commission transmitted fishes from Florida, Lake Superior,
Alaska, and Kamchatka, together with the types of Paraliparis rosa-
ceus, and Bathylagus milleri and Ulocentra meadie. Two rare fishes
were received from the Pacific coast, a specimen of a Rhamphocottus,
presented by Mr. O. E. Shaffer, Port Townsend, Washington, and a
specimen of /costeus wnigmaticus, presented by Mr. John Chapman,
of San Diego, California.

Mr. William B. Moss, of Ashton- under-Lyne, England, a valued cor-
respondent and contributor to the Museum, donated two lots of small
shells, comprising some 3,000 specimens, collected by Rey. and Mrs.
James Hadfield at Lifou Island, Loyalty Group. They belong for
the most part to species recently described and hitberto unrepre-
sented in the Museum.

Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan, New York, continued his donations
of river mussels (Unionide), including types of species described by
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

him. Rey. E. H. Ashmun, Mr. T. S. Oldroyd, and Dr. E. A. Mearns,
U.S. A., should also be mentioned as contributors of valuble speci-
mens. Miss Mary J. Rathbun collected some 800 mollusks in the
waters about Grand Manan, New Brunswick.

Regarding accessions to the Division of Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard,
honorary curator, reports as follows:

The last fiscal year was an extraordinary one in the history of the Division of Insects,
and it was not expected that such another one would occur again for some time to
come. Notwithstanding this, however, the present fiscal year surpasses it not only
in the number of accessions, but, it is believed, also in scientific value.

In 1897 the accessions numbered only 139, a large increase over previous years.
In 1898 they numbered 246, while this year they reached 285, an increase of 39 over
last year.

On account of the vast number of duplicates in the Hubbard and Schwarz collec-
tion, it was estimated that over 226,000 specimens were received, while this yearthey
amount to only 125,000. The number of specimens received this year is therefore
less than last year, although the number of species is several thousand greater.

This is due principally to the extensive collection of Hemiptera, Hymenoptera,
Siphonaptera, and Mallophaga, presented by Prof. Carl F. Baker, and to the addition
of the Ashmead collection, both being exceedingly rich in species and containing
types and co-types of species described by these entomologists, as well as those of
many other authorities. With these two collections the Museum is now well rep-
resented in the orders mentioned above and without doubt surpasses all other col-
lections in America.

The gift by Mr. W. H. Ashmead, assistant curator, of his private collection, is a
most notable one and deserves especial mention. It was largely made by this inde-
fatigable worker in the State of Florida, and has been greatly added to by a syste-
matic series of exchanges carried on for many years with entomologists in different
foreign countries; but perhaps its chief value lies in the large number of types which
it contains. Mr. Ashmead’s broad entomological knowledge and interest have led
him to undertake systematic work in a number of different groups, and the great
value of the gift thus becomes apparent.

Numerous invertebrates of other classes were received during the
year, among which should be mentioned 40 lots, chiefly crustacea
(including a number of type specimens), donated by Mr. W. P. Hay,
of Washington, D. C.; a collection of amphipod crustaceans from the
New England coast, donated by Dr. S$. D. Judd, of Washington, D. C.;
27 species of crustaceans, corals, and echinoderms, donated by Rey.
W. A. Stanton, of Balize, British Honduras, and 20 species of crabs,
shrimps, and worms, donated by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii.

The accessions to the herbarium during the past ten years have
been as follows:

Among the important additions of the past year was a portion of
Rugel’s Florida collection, comprising 1,049 specimens, donated by
the British Museum.
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Mr. J. G. Baker, of London, England, presented a large part of
his private herbarium. Mr. Louis A. Kengla, of San Francisco,
California, presented a hundred specimens of alge suitable for
exhibition. From Maj. H. E. Hasse was received the gift of 233
specimens of California lichens.

A large number of important specimens from Samoa, Mexico, Costa
Rica, and from various parts of the United States were purchased dur-
ing the year.

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES.

The principal work accomplished in the Division of Mammals, in
addition to the usual routine operations and the rearrangement of the
exhibition series (already referred to), was the improvement of the
collection of small skins and a rearrangement of the study series. A
large proportion of the skins of rodents and other small mammals which
have been accumulating from year to year have long needed making
over on a uniform model, in order to be thoroughly available for pur-
poses of comparison. During the past year it was found possible to
assign a taxidermist to this work for about six months, during which
time some 800 skins were remodeled. A rearrangement of the whole
study series of small skins, based on Troussart’s recently published
catalogue of mammals, was begun, and the greater part of the rodents
were put in order during the year. The collection of skulls of small
mammals was also rearranged.

In the Division of Birds the large amount of work done on the exhi-
bition series left little opportunity for other than current routine work.
The determination of type specimens was continued, and some 20 were
located and separated out from the general collection.

The study collection of birds’ eggs is in good condition, but the exhi-
bition series is much in need of revision and renovation. The honorary
curator of this section has not only been the largest contributor to the
growth of the collection, but has devoted much of his time personally
to the current work.

The study series of reptiles and batrachians is much in need of
revision, but up to the present time it has not been found possible to
supply the large amount of new shelves needed before a rearrange-
ment can be commenced. The curator has devoted his time chiefly to
the improvement of the exhibition series and to investigations.

Work was continued on the exhibition series of casts of American
fishes under the supervision of the assistant curator.

Much time was occupied in the Division of Mollusks in cleaning,
assorting, and naming the very extensive collection of shells presented
last year by Prof. R. E. Call. The shells of the family Helicide and
the Pyramidellide of the west coast of America were thoroughly
studied and rearranged and many species identified. The important
—

e

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

collection made by the Fish Commission in Porto Rico was also assorted
and identified. The whole study series is in excellent condition.

The same remark applies to the collections of insects, which are now
almost entirely free from pests. More standard insect drawers are,
however, needed. Many thousand insects were pinned and labeled by
the preparators during the year, but much of this material is still
unidentified. The collections of all orders of insects are now arranged
tentatively and are available for study and comparison. Special men-
tion should be made of the Lepidoptera, which has been brought into
excellent condition through the unremunerated labor of Dr. H. G.
Dyar, custodian. The division has not only had the benefit of the
gratuitous services of the honorary curator, Dr. L. O. Howard, but of
several other members of the entomological staff of the Department
of Agriculture and also of Mr. E. A. Schwarz.

Mr. W. H. Ashmead, assistant curator, arranged and identified most
of the African and Asiatic Hymenoptera during the year, together
with some material from Central and South America. The dragon
flies and Neuropterous insects were rearranged by Mr. Currie, aid.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates the card catalogue of
Brachyuran crustaceans, comprising about 5,000 titles, was revised
and transferred to standard library-bureau cards. The collection of
Hexactinellid sponges, which has been for some time in the hands
of Professor Shulz for study, was catalogued. Dr. J. E. Benedict and
Miss Rathbun, assistant curators, identified the crabs collected in Porto
Rico by the U. S. Fish Commission.

The rearrangement of the exhibition series, necessitated by the
erection of galleries, occupied a large share of the time of the staif of
the Department of Comparative Anatomy. In connection with that
work, the skeleton of the extinct Arctic sea cow, Rhytina, and of the
finback whale, were cleaned and remounted. The time of the curator
and assistants was divided between this division and that of Vertebrate
Paleontology.

The following passage from the report of the honorary curator of
the Division of Plants, Mr. F. V. Coville, gives a condensed statement
of the work accomplished in that division during the year:

The collection of plants formerly stored on the south balcony of the Museum, which
was referred to in the report of last year as having been transferred to the National
Herbarium, has greatly taxed the present capacity of our cases, and it is doubtful
whether the accumulation of mounted material, Mexican and otherwise, now on
hand can be distributed until the new adjoining balcony is fitted up. This collec-
tion, when finally arranged, listed, and stamped, numbered over 30,000 specimens,
being particularly rich in European material. The work of stamping the general
series, with a view to ascertaining the total number of specimens in the herbarium,
has been carried forward at intervals. Thus far 21,618 sheets have been stamped.

Three preparators have been engaged in mounting, labeling, and repairing speci-
mens during the year. The total number of specimens is 22,559, of which 13,314
have been stamped and distributed. The large collection presented by Prof. W. Hi.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Brewer, representing the types described in the Botany of the California Survey, has
been most carefully prepared with all the original data mounted with the specimens,
which will be determined and distributed as rapidly as possible.

The selection, verification, and marking of type specimens has been delayed,
owing to the resignation last December of the preparator employed on this work.
The total number of types thus far indicated is 1,619. It is important that this work
be continued, both for the advantage it affords to consulting botanists and for the
desirability of ascertaining definitely the exact number of types in the collection.

In the rearrangement of and research work on the collection considerable progress
has been made. We have introduced genus covers printed in colors to correspond
with the larger continental areas, the North American being black, the West Indian,
Mexican, and South American red, and the Old World blue. An extension of this
scheme is now under consideration.

The herbarium is now in orderly arrangement as far as the Ericaceze, and the work
on it will be pushed during the coming year.

The south tower room has been fitted up for the accommodation of the crypto-
gamic collections by the addition of an iron balcony supporting cases on three sides,
with a stairway leading to an attie room provided with cases suitable for storage
purposes. For several months Mr. O. F. Cook, now honorary assistant curator in
charge of Cryptogamic Botany, very kindly gave his services and those of his two
assistants in caring for these collections. Mr. Cook was commissioned to prepare an
exhibit of algee for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, and this work was
brought to completion in the early part of last summer. A supplementary series has
been placed on the exhibition front of the east balcony. It soon became evident
that an officer would shortly be required to devote his entire attention to the valua-
ble cryptogamic collections, many of which still remain inaccessible for study.
Early in January Mr. William R. Maxon was employed on a six months’ contract
to put these collections in order, and he is now, after most faithful and painstaking
labor, able to report the practical completion of his task. In the three main groups
of the lower cryptogams, the mosses, fungi, and lichens, all undetermined material
has been sorted out and will be sent to specialists in those groups for identification
and return; while the large accumulations of unmounted material have been prop-
erly placed in pockets and labeled, ready for distribution on the shelves. Mr. Maxon
has also distributed several thousand mounted sheets of ferns and fern allies, read-
justing the covers and identifying dubious specimens. During the past few weeks
he has been engaged in caring for the large collection of alcoholic material sent in by
Messrs. Swingle and Fairchild.

FIELD WORK.

Several members of the scientific staff of the department engaged in
field work during the year. The fishes of the State of New York were
studied by Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean, on Long Island.

Mr. W. H. Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway, and Mr. F. V. Coville joined
the Harriman Alaska expedition and made investigations of the mol-
lusks, birds, and plants of that Territory. Miss M. J. Rathbun spent
a month at Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick, studying the shore
invertebrates and dredging in sballow water.

INVESTIGATIONS.

A large number of scientific investigations were in progress, the
results of some of which were published during the year. Mr. G. S.
Miller, jr., published several short papers on mammals and partially
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. oe

completed a revision of the free-tailed bats. He began also a revision
of European mammals and a correlation of the life zones of Europe
and North America.

Mr. Robert Ridgway continued work on his extensive manual of
North and Middle American birds, completing the family Fringillide,
and entering upon the families Corvide and Tanagride. It is antici-
pated that the first part of this work will be ready for publication
next year. Considerable progress was made by Dr. C. W. Richmond
in the preparation of a card catalogue of described genera and species
of birds.

Mr. Barton A. Bean and Dr. Hugh M. Smith, of the U.S. Fish
Commission, prepared a preliminary catalogue of the fishes of the
District of Columbia.

Mr. William H. Dall presents the following statement regarding
his work on mollusks:

During the year the greater portion of my time given to investigation has been
specially occupied by a revision of the species and the classification of bivalve mol-
lusks belonging to the Tertiary beds of the United States, and incidentally of the
marine fauna of its shores. Many of our living species are found also in several
Tertiary strata, and therefore in studying species which are found in the Tertiary
beds it is necessary to compare them with the living species as well as with other
fossils in order to make sure that they are undescribed or identify them with already
described species. For this reason the investigation of the Tertiary fauna which I
have been carrying on for a number of years, and which is now nearly finished, has
practically included in nearly all the groups a revision of the classification of the

living animals of the same groups common to our coast. During the past year

especial attention was given to some of these groups, among which may be men-
tioned the Leptonacea, the Solens, and some groups of the Lucinidze. Nearly all the
time available for special researches has been devoted to this subject, and such other
researches as I may have made are comparatively unimportant.

Mr. C. T. Simpson continued his study of the river mussels, or
Naiades, and reports that he has completed a classification of the
group and will soon be prepared to publish the results of his work.

Mr. J. E. Benedict has continued his work on the crustaceans of the
family Galatheide. Miss M. J. Rathbun prepared an article on the
Decapod Crustaceans of West Africa for the New York State Colo-
nization Society.

Mr. F. A. Lucas has completed his study of the fossil bisons of
North America and continued his investigations on the anatomy of the
swifts and the development of the skull of the cormorant. .

In addition to his scientific labors as Botanist of the Department of
Agriculture, Mr. F. V. Coville entered upon a comprehensive study of
the genus Ribes. Mr. Rose has continued his monograph of the
Agaves, and visited Mexico for the purpose of studying and collecting
specimens of the more obscure forms. Mr. Pollard has progressed
with his work on the violets, and in that connection has prepared sets
of authentic specimens of the various species of Vola for distribution,

USE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The zoological and botanical collections have been made use of to a
very large extent during the year by naturalists from all sections of
the United States. Some investigators have visited Washington for
this purpose, and in other cases collections have been sent out of the
Museum temporarily to investigators both at home and abroad.

Among those who made use of the ornithological collections should
be mentioned Mr. E. W. Nelson, Mr. H. C. Oberholser, and Mr.
W. H. Osgood, of the Department of Agriculture; Mr. Outram Bangs,
of Boston, Massachusetts, and Miss Florence Merriam, of Washing-
ton, District of Columbia.

Mr. Oberholser, at the request of the Museum, determined the col-
lections of birds recently received from Liberia, the Kameruns,
Madagascar, and Kashmir. The committee on nomenclature of the
American Ornithologists’ Union spent a week in studying new sub-
species for the purpose of determining their claims to recognition.

Frequent use was made of the collections of fishes by the officers of
the U.S. Fish Commission, especially by Doctors Evermann, Smith,
and Kendall.

Sir Charles Elliot, British commissioner to Samoa, prosecuted inves-
tigations on the Nudibranch mollusks. Mr. G. A. Drew, of Johns
Hopkins University, studied and published on the mollusks of the
family Ledide.

The collections of insects have been very largely consulted by ento-

mologists throughout the country.

' Miss Harriet Richardson continued her study of the isopod crusta-
ceans during the greater part of the year, and prepared a special
report on the isopods of the Pacific coast of North America, which has
recently been published in the Proceedings of the Museum. Mr. T.
Wayland Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, began an inyesti-
gation of the West Indian corals, and Dr. H. F. Moore, of the U.S.
Fish Commission, studied the isopod crustaceans collected by the Com-
mission in Porto Rico. Mr. W. P. Hay assisted in determining the
crayfishes recently received, and described a new form of isopod from
a well in Irvington, Ind.

The herbarium has received a good share of attention from bota-
nists. Special mention should be made of the services of Prof. E. L.
Greene in determining various specimens for the Museum.

The practice of lending material for study to recognized experts not
residing in Washington was continued as heretofore. A large amount
of material was sent out, but only the principal loans can be noticed here.

Dr. Howard Ayers, of the University of Missouri, obtained the
myxinoid fishes in the collection for use in connection with a mono-
graph of that group which he has in preparation.

Specimens of Dinolestes, Atherinopsis, Apogon, and Hzxocetus were
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. oD

sent to Mr. E. C. Starks for dissection. Mr. Starks afterwards
returned excellently prepared skeletons of these fishes.

A series of specimens of mice was sent to Mr. Barrett-Hamilton,
London, England, who is engaged ina revision of the European species
of the genus J/us.

A series of 76 small shrikes was sent to Mr. R. M. Strong, Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, to assist him in the determination of the
percentage of variation in that group. Dr. Jonathan Dwight, jr.,
obtained the loan of some 60 specimens for use in his study of the
molting of birds. A collection of house wrens was sent to Mr. W. E.
Loucks, Peoria, Illinois, for examination. Messrs. Outram Bangs
and Arthur Stone obtained the use of Colombian birds. A series of
specimens of wrens and sparrows was lent to Mr. William Brewster,
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Mr. F. W. Gamble, of Owens College, Manchester, England, who
is monographing certain families of annelids, was furnished the speci-
mens of several genera.

Dr. J. Percy Moore received additional installments of leeches.
The Museum collection of gephyreans was sent to Prof. Henry B.
Ward, University of Nebraska, who is monographing the group.

The Caprellide in the Museum were placed in the hands of Doctor
Mayer, of the Naples Biological Station, to assist him in preparing a
supplement to his monograph.

Dr. F. Meinert, Zoological Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, was
accorded the use of the collection of Pyenogonida for a monograph of
that group.

Loans of insects were made to 12 experts during the year, among
whom were the following: Dr. Philip P. Calvert, of the Philadel-
phia Academy of Sciences, received all the unworked dragon-flies
(Odonata), partly for naming and partly in connection with his work
on the Biologia Centrali-America. In the interest also of this great
faunal publication, the Mexican and Central American Acridide were
sent to Professor Lawrence, University of Nebraska, for study. The
specimens of the family Pyralide were placed in the hands of Prof.
C. H. Fernald, of the Agricultural College, Amherst, Massachusetts,
for monographic purposes.

Loans of about 1,800 herbarium specimens were made during the
year, chiefly in small lots for purposes of identification.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., received a temporary appointment as
assistant curator, Division of Mammals, July 13, 1898, and on October
15, 1898, was regularly added to the staff. Mr. J. H. Riley was
appointed aid August 8, 1898, and Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., August 15,
1898. Mr. Riley was assigned to the Section of Birds’ Eggs, and Mr.
Lyon to the Division of Mammals.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1898-99.

By Grorce P. MERRILL,
Head Curator.

Although the year just closed compares favorably with its predeces-
sors, so far as relates to the acquisition of materials, it has not been
possible to advance the work of installation to the extent hoped for in
the beginning.

ORGANIZATION.

The department as now organized consists of the following divi-
sions: (1) Physical and Chemical Geology (Systematic and Applied),
(2) Mineralogy, and (3) Stratigraphic Paleontology, including the sec-
tions of Vertebrate Fossils, Invertebrate Fossils, and Paleobotany.

ACCESSIONS.

In the order given, the number of accessions is as follows:

In the Division of Geology a very considerable amount of the
material received is in itself of slight commercial value. It consists
in large part of specimens designed to show the mineral resources
of the United States or to fill existing gaps in the systematic series of
economic products. Especial mention should, perhaps, be made of a
small collection of monazite sands from Brazil; asbestos from Italy;
silver-lead-antimony ore from Zancudo mines in Colombia, South
America; a large and miscellaneous assortment of ores and economic
products from the Central and Western States, received from the
Omaha International Exposition; three fine slabs of onyx marble from
Colorado, and a series of 19 specimens of polished spheres of Japanese
breccia, the gift of the late Prof. O. C. Marsh.

In the Section of Systematic Geology mention should be mde of a

37
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

series of rocks illustrating the Upper Cambrian formations of the
Lake Superior region, collected by Mr. C. R. Van Hise, of the U. 8.
Geological Survey; a series of clastic rocks illustrating the geology
of the slate regions of eastern New York and western Vermont, col-
lected by Prof. T. N. Dale, of the Geological Survey; a fine series
of jointed sandstones from the Black Hills of South Dakota, collected
by Mr. N. H. Darton, of the Geological Survey; and a series of vol-
canic products from Vesuvius and other parts of Italy, collected by
Mr. F. W. Crosby.

The Division of Mineralogy has been enriched by the acquisition of
samples of 4 new minerals—erionite, wellsite, bixbyite, and clinohe-
drite—as well as of 11 other species new to the collection; and of 3
new meteorites from Polk County, Minnesota; Adams County, Penn-
sylvania, and Mount Oscuro, New Mexico, respectively.

Mention should be made of 6 specimens of roscoelite on auriferous
quartz from Eldorado County, California, and 5 specimens of crystal-
lized arsenic from Japan,

The gem collection has received, through the liberality of Dr. L. T.
Chamberlain, a fine cut citrine quartz, weighing 139} carats; 21 cut
Montana sapphires, selected to show colors, and 2 cut sapphires,
weighing 3% carats, all from Yogo Gulch, Montana; 1 opal from
Mexico, and 2 garnets of the variety rhodolite, from North Carolina.
Four opals from Mexico were also obtained by purchase.

In the Section of Vertebrate Fossils the accessions especially
worthy of note are a series of mammal skulls from a new locality in
the White River Miocene, from the Geological Survey; a fine skull
of Hyracodon nebrascensis, the gift of Mr. A. W. Barber, and the fossil
skull of a new species of bear and a small series of fish remains from
the chalk formations of Kansas, collected by Mr. A. B. Baker.

An account of the large series of fossil vertebrates forming the
Marsh collection at Yale University, which is in progress of removal
from New Haven, will be deferred for the report for next year.

The collection of vertebrate fossils from the Cope estate, mentioned
in the last report, was received early in the year. This collection, it
will be remembered, was made under the auspices of the Hayden
Survey, and comprises over 175 specimens, including many of the types
of fishes and reptiles described by Professor Cope in his volume on
the Vertebrates of the Tertiary formation of the West and in the
Bulletins of the Survey.

The accessions in the section of Invertebrate Fossils are reported by
Mr. Schuchert as being neither so large nor so valuable as last year.
A large portion of the material received was deposited by the U. 8.
Geological Survey, and consists of 6,534 Paleozoic fossils, 214 Meso-
zoic, and 16 Tertiary. Among these the most valuable is a series of
3,990 specimens of Cambrian brachiopods, determined by Prof. Charles

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

D. Walcott, and the figured specimens, 158 in number, of Lower Cre-
taceous grypheeas, described by Messrs. Hill and Vaughan in Bulletin
No. 151 of the Geological Survey. A collection comprising some
4,000 specimens of Cincinnati fossils was purchased from Mr. H. E.
Dickhaut, of the Survey. This collection is particularly rich in
pelecypods.

Three valuable collections of post-Paleozoic fossils were received in
exchange from the Geological Museum at Leyden, the University
Museum of Natural History at Turin, Italy, and the British Museum
of Natural History, London.

Asa matter of historical interest, it may be noted that the Troost
collection of crinoidea, which, together with the manuscript describing
them and drawings for 107 species, was sent by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution to Prof. James Hall in 1853, was returned last November by
the administrator of the Hall estate.

The Section of Paleobotany, until the opening of the present fiscal
year, has been in charge of honorary curators. In order to relieve
them of the detailed routine work Dr. A. C. Peale was appointed aid
and placed in charge of the collections. Much of the work which he
has had to do has been upon material which has been in the Museum
collections for many years. The comparatively small number of
accessions, therefore, furnishes by no means a measure of the work
performed. Among the principal collections which have been received
by this section during the fiscal year were: Lower Carboniferous
plants from Henry County, Missouri, described in Monograph 387 of
the Geological Survey; a series of 900 Carboniferous plants from
Indian Territory, described by Mr. David White in the Nineteenth
Annual Report of the Survey, and 26 boxes of Carboniferous plants,
comprising the Armstrong collection, purchased for the Museum by
Mr. R. D. Lacoe.

PRESENT CONDITION OF COLLECTIONS

The progress made in caring for the collections has been all that the
circumstances permitted. In the Section of Applied Geology the
work of installing the systematic series of nonmetallic products in
the new rail cases has been nearly completed. The rearrangement of
the geographic series on the ground floor of the Southwest Court is
also completed, although several thousand labels yet remain to be pre-
pared. The entire collection of building and ornamental stones,
comprising between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens, has been moved and
installed in the wall cases of the same court.

The collections in systematic geology, occupying the West South
Range, are not yet fully arranged, though the series illustrating the
materials of the earth’s crust is in order, as is also that illustrating
folding and faulting and volcanic products. A magnificent group of
40) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

basaltic columns, collected for the Museum by Mr. F. W. Crosby, has
lately been added to this series. Manuscript for upward of 2,500
labels has been prepared and is ready for the printer. The actual
work of arranging these collections, it should be stated, has fallen
upon Mr. W. H. Newhall, with such assistance as could be given by
Museum laborers.

I might add that in all the work of this department steps are being
taken toward a reduction of the number of specimens exhibited and an
improvement in the quality. The reduction in number in certain of
the collections is necessitated by lack of space, but it is believed that
on the whole a careful selection of the specimens exhibited will cause
the collections to have more educational value than will an increase in
number.

The collections in the Division of Mineralogy, as stated in my last
report, have been as well arranged as possible with the present exhibi-
tion cases. New cases are needed along the west wall. As the collec-
tions in this division are now well systematized, I submit Mr. Tassin’s
report upon them in full.

The exhibition series is arranged under the following heads: System-
atic series; comparative series; gem collection; meteorite collection.

The systematic series is divided into two general classes—native ele-
ments and compounds of the elements. The compounds of the
elements are further divided and grouped under certain heads accord-
ing to their more negative constituents, as follows:

Compounds of the halogens, fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and
iodides. Compounds of sulphur, selenium, tellurium, arsenic, and
antimony, including sulphides, selenides and tellurides, arsenides,
antimonides, sulpharsenides, and sulphantimonides; also sulphosalts.
Oxygen compounds, including oxides and the oxygen salts, borates,
aluminates, chromites, ferrites, manganites, plumbates, arsenites and
antimonites, selenites and tellurites, carbonates, silicates, titanates,
columbates and tantalates, nitrates, vanadates, phosphates, arsenates
and antomonates, sulphates, selenates and tellurates, chromates, molyb-
dates and tungstates, iodates, and uranates. Compounds of organic
origin, including salts of organic acids and carbon compounds.

Each of these classes is further separated into groups according to
their chemical relationships. Each group is preceded by a general
group label stating the class to which it belongs, the group name, a
list of the minerals composing that group, together with their chemical
formule, system of crystallization, and a short descriptién of the
occurrence, association, and characteristic form of each member of the
group. Following the group label, arranged in order from left to
right, are the several members of the group selected to illustrate, as
completely as the conditions will permit, their occurrences, associations,
color, habit, ete.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41

Each specimen is mounted on a standard block, in front of which is
a small label giving the name, locality, etc., of the individual.

The comparative series. —Here the properties of minerals are defined,
illustrated, and compared. In each case the label containing a defini-
tion of the property under consideration precedes a series of specimens
and, wherever they can be used advantageously, a series of models
illustrating that property.

The meteorite collection, including the Shepard and Museum col-
lections, now contains several hundred specimens representing 336 falls.
As in the other series, the collections are preceded by introductory
labels, on which are noted the more prominent physical and chemical
characters of meteorites, together with the classification here adopted.
The arrangement of the two collections is somewhat different, that
of the Museum being geographic, while the Shepard collection is
chronologic.

The gem collection now compares favorably with any other public
collection of this kind in the country, both in number and kinds of
stones exhibited. It is especially rich in those gems and ornamental
stones which occur in the United States, as is shown by the following
tabulated statement:

The study series contains the material which appeals exclusively to
the specialist. It comprises those specimens which serve to illustrate
the occurrence and associations of a mineral in any one locality and
which are not needed for the exhibition series, or which are not
unnecessary duplicates of material already on hand. Each specimen
in this series is numbered, labeled, and contained in a paper tray.
The several specimens are then arranged geographically by species;
the species are arranged in groups, as in the systematic series, and
placed in drawers. This series also includes all the original and type
material belonging to the division which is not needed for exhibition.
Those types used in the exhibition series are here represented by cards
giving the position of the type specimens in the cases.

Little has as yet been done in the way of permanently installing
the exhibition series of vertebrate fossils,-owing to the construction
of new cases and the absence of Mr. F. A. Lucas, the Curator, for
several weeks in New Haven. The death of Professor Marsh involved
the immediate withdrawal and turning over to the Museum of the
vertebrate fossils collected under the direction of the Geological Sur-
vey, which work has naturally taken a large share of the time and
attention of the Curator since March. This collection will be referred
to again in the next report.

The final arrangement of the collection of invertebrate fossils has
been delayed by the need of cases. The’entire Paleozoic portion has
been removed from the floor of the southwest court and placed on the
gallery in the same court. This installation is not, however, final.
With the completion of the rail cases, it is hoped to remove from the
floor of this court the Mesozoic and more recent invertebrate fossils,
thereby making room for the collections in vertebrate paleontology.
At present, the mounted exhibition series in this section consists only
of Cambrian, Upper Carboniferous, and Tertiary forms. Mr. Charles
Schuchert has labored most industriously, and reports that, with the
- assistance of Mr. Williard, he has during the year placed in final
Museum form upward of 20,000 specimens and prepared 2,900 cata-
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

logue cards, as well as manuscript for 1,319 labels. With the present
force, however, it will not be possible to complete the installation of
the exhibition series for at least two years.

In the Section of Paleobotany I have to report the installation of
an exhibition series comprising some 1,000 specimens in the wall cases
occupying the south and west galleries of the Southeast Court. Some
1,300 specimens were received and catalogued during the year, and
four volumes, comprising 2,000 entries in the old catalogues, have
been copied. At least 12,000 entries yet remain to be made of mate-
rials now in the Museum. There is need of another assistant in this
section.

RESEARCH.

But little opportunity has been offered for special investigation by
officers of the Museum. Dr. E. C. E. Lord has occupied a desk in the
laboratory of the Division of Geology and has been engaged upon the
study of the rocks collected by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 5. A., of the
Mexican Boundary Survey and other rocks collected by himself on
the coast of Maine and by Messrs. Schuchert and White in Greenland.

The head curator has partially revised for publication the manuscript
for a handbook of the collection of nonmetallic minerals which was
begun some three yearsago. He has also written sundry other papers,
the titles of which, so far as they have yet been published, are given
in the Bibliography (Appendix IV). Mr. Wirt Tassin, assistant curator
in charge of the mineral collections, has now in press a handbook of the
exhibition series, illustrating the characters of minerals, and also a
paper showing the classification adopted in the arrangement of the
mineral collections under his charge. He announces having in prepar-
ation a catalogue of the mineral collections and a handbook of the
collection of meteorites. Mr. Schuchert has been engaged, when
opportunity offered, in reworking the Lower Helderberg and Oriskany
collections, and has prepared two papers for publication. He has
practically completed a paper on the Lower Devonian Aspect of the
Lower Helderberg and Oriskany, and one on the Lower Silurian Fauna
of Baffin Land. He isalso continuing his work, begun more than three
years ago, on the fossil starfishes of America. Mr. Lucas has com-
pleted a study of the fossil bison; identified a series of vertebrates from
the White River Miocene, submitted by the Geological Survey, and
described a hitherto unknown fossil saake from the Eocene of Alabama.

SOURCES OF NEW MATERIAL.

With the exception of the collections of Kinderhook fossils made by
Mr. Pau! Bartsch, of the Division of Mollusks, while at his home in
Burlington, Iowa, no geological explorations of consequence have
been undertaken by members of the Museum staff, Mr, F, W. Crosby,
>

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

of this city, while traveling in Europe, collected many objects of
value, including a fine series of Italian asbestos and an exceptionally
large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, in Prussia. In like
manner, Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, of Hanover, New Hampshire, while
in the Hawaiian Islands, made important geological collections.
Inasmuch as the materials have not yetarrived at the Museum, further
notice concerning them is left for the next report.

Through the kindness of the Geological Survey the Museum was
enabled to detail Mr. H. E. Dickhaut, of that bureau, to collect an
extensive series of Upper Silurian fossils in the vicinity of Lockport,
New York. !

Mr. R. D. Lacoe has, by two important donations, continued to
exhibit his interest in science and in the National Museum. Through
the kindly interest of Mr. Harry Lee, the State Commissioner of
Mines, a fine series of telluride ores and other desirable materials from
Colorado has been procured.

As in the past, the chief source of accumulation is the Geological
Survey, particularly for paleontological, stratigraphical, and litholog-
ical material. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain has on three occasions manifested
his interest in the gem collection, as noted elsewhere.

ASSISTANCE AFFORDED STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS.

The custom of lending collections to workers outside of the Museum
has been adhered to. A small collection of Japanese marbles was lent
to Prof. O. C. Marsh, and 116 thin sections of granites to Prof. B. K.
Emerson. From the Division of Mineralogy a series of silicates and
several specimens of chalcedony were turned over to Messrs. Clark
and Diller, of the Geological Survey, to be used in special investigations
being conducted by them. In like manner teeth of Paleozoic sharks
have been lent to Prof. C. R. Eastman, of Cambridge. Invertebrate
Paleozoic material has been lent to Mr. J. W. Beede, of the University
of Kansas; to Dr. G. F. Girty, of the Geological Survey; to M. M.
Cossman, of Paris; and Dr. Anton Fritsch, of Prague.

The study of the collections has not been limited wholly to members
of the Museum staff. As already noted, Dr. E. C. E. Lord has con-
tinued his studies in the Division of Geology, while Doctor Fritsch, of
Bohemia, and Doctor Matthews, of the American Museum of Natural
History, have briefly studied methods of installation, and, in the case
of Doctor Fritsch, the fossil Myriapoda and Arachnida in the Lacoe
collection.

Prof. F. W. Cragin, graduate student of Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, has passed several weeks in the Museum, working on the
collection of Texas Jurassic fossils. In the Section of Vertebrate Pale-
ontology, Dr. O. P. Hay has described two new species of fossil tur-
tles and Mr. Gerrit 8. Miller, jr., one new species of Pleistocene bear.
48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Prof. Atreus Wanner, superintendent of the public schools of York,
Pennsylvania, has twice visited the Museum to utilize the Triassic
materials in the collections in connection with his work on the Triassie
plants from near York, Pennsylvania.

Twenty-six papers bearing upon subjects in the department collec-
tions have been prepared during the year, either by the staff of the
Museum or by those having access to the collections. These titles are
given in the Bibliography and need not be repeated here.

STORAGE AND WORKROOMS.

Much material (several hundred boxes) belonging to the Paleonto-
logical collections is still in storage. It is hoped that some time in
the near future this, too, may be made available to students.

With the renting of the Emery Building, on Tenth street southwest,
the workrooms and all machinery used in preparatory work were
removed to that building, thus affording a much-needed space for
packing and unpacking material, and such incidental work as could
not properly be carried on in the offices and exhibition halls.

In the Section of Systematic Geology there are several special series
of exhibits that could be prepared to advantage, such as collections
illustrating the geology of special areas, to include maps, sections,
and other drawings and photographs, besides the actual specimens.
A very attractive exhibit illustrating the geology and physical geog-
‘aphy of the Yellowstone Park has also been projected, but not yet
carried out.

In the Section of Applied Geology there is need of special exhibits
illustrative of various phases of the science. Models of one or more
important mines, or relief maps and sections of mining regions,
together with samples of the ore and wall rocks, form desirable
exhibits, as do also collections showing the origin and derivation of
ore, the geological distribution of useful minerals of various kinds,
the qualifying conditions for artesian wells, ete.

Several such exhibits have been projected, but are still far from
complete.

In my report as curator for 1892 I announced the preparation of
200 sets of rocks and ores, ranging in number from 66 to 104 specimens
each. The last of these was sent out during the spring of 1899. Since
1892 other materials have been gradually accumulated, in the line of
both geology and invertebrate paleontology, for other sets, but no
opportunity has been found to put them in order. The interest at
present manifested in the study of soils and the problems connected
therewith led the curator to begin, a year or more ago, the prepara-
tion of 100 sets of rocks and their decomposition products, as described
in his work on rockweathering. This work, too, is still unfinished.

The death of Prof. O. C. Marsh, which occurred on March 18, 1899,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49

has precipitated the work of transferring to the Museum the collec-
tions of vertebrate fossils made by him under the authority of the
Geological Survey during the years 1882 to 1893, referred to in the
last report. Representatives of the department have been at New
Haven since April 10, engaged in the work of packing. The labor of
bringing the material here and installing it, together with the inci-
dental work of cataloguing and looking after the records, will tax to
the utmost the resources of the section for many months to come. As
much of the material is still in the matrix, the services of another
preparator are essential. With this additional help, it might be pos-
sible to prepare one or more restorations of some of the more striking
forms, like Zriceratops, which would add greatly to the interest and
educational value of the display collections.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.

THE MUSEUM STAFF.

Dr. O. C. Marsh, professor of paleontology in Yale University and
for many years connected with the staff of the National Museum as
honorary curator of Vertebrate Fossils, died on March 18, 1899.

Dr. Frederick W. True has been appointed the Representative of
the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum on the Goyern-
ment Board for the Pan-American Exposition to be held in Buffalo in
1901, and Mr. W. V. Cox has been designated as chief special agent
in the same connection.

Mr. J. L. Willige continued to act as chief clerk until December 12,
when he was relieved by Mr. W. V. Cox, who had then completed his
duties away from Washington in connection with the Trans-Missis-
sippi and International Exposition.

Mr. George C. Maynard, custodian of the Electrical Collections,
was on August 1, 1898, also designated as aid in the Division of
Mechanical Technology.

Mr. J. H. Riley and Mr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., were appointed aids
in the Department of Biology on August 8 and August 15, respec-
tively, and on January 1, 1899, Miss Carrie Harrison, aid in the Divi-
sion of Plants, was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.

Mr. E. A. Schwarz has been placed in charge of the entire collec-
tion of Coleoptera, as custodian, and Mr. Nathan Banks has been made
custodian of the Collection of Arachnida.

Prof. O. F. Cook, for some time an assistant curator in the Division
of Plants, having accepted a position in the Department of Agricul-
ture, was in March, 1899, made honorary assistant curator in charge
of the Cryptogamic collections.

Dr. A. C. Peale was appointed aid in the Section of Paleobotany on
July 25, 1898.

Dr. George H. Girty, of the U. 5S. Geological Survey, was made
custodian of the Carboniferous collections in the Section of Inverte-
brate Fossils on July 29, 1898.

A complete list of the members of the scientific and administrative
staffs will be found in Appendix I.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.
The appropriations by Congress for the past fiscal year aggregated
$257,000, an increase of $24,000 over the total for the preceding year.

There was an increase of $5,000 in the item for preservation of collec-
51
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

tions, which also contained an added provision for the making of illus-
trations to an extent not exceeding $5,500 in cost. For furniture and
fixtures, including the furnishing of new galleries, $35,000 were given,
being $5,000 more than the year before. The purchase of books was
provided for in a separate appropriation of $2,000. The amount
allowed for the rent of workshops was increased from $2,000 to $4,500,
and for continuing the construction of galleries, etc., from $8,000 to
$10,000. For the purchase of the library of the late Dr. G. Brown
Goode, $5,000 were granted, and the appropriation for printing and
binding was increased from $12,000 to $17,000.

The total expenditures from these appropriations during the year
ageregated $244,368, leaving a balance, subject to outstanding liabili-
ties, of $12,632. From the appropriation for 1897-98 disbursements
amounting to $5,385.41 were made, leaving a balance of $118.18,
exclusive of small balances from the printing allotment and the appro-
priation for the rent of workshops. Expenditures to the amount of
$378.69 were made from the appropriation for 1896-97, under the titles
of preservation of collections, and heating and lighting.

The following tables show the expenditures during 1898-99 from the
appropriations for the past two fiscal years and the balances on hand

BUILDINGS.

Iron galleries have been erected in the West North Range, the West
South Range, the East South Range, and the South East Range under
the item of $10,000 appropriated for that purpose. The great snow
storm of February, 1899, disclosed certain weak places in the roof of the
Museum building and caused the buckling of several of the large iron
girders. The damaged parts have been repaired and strengthened so
far as the appropriation permitted. Two of the old wooden floors
have been replaced by terrazzo pavement, and many minor repairs and
improvements have been made.

Three additional small buildings have been leased for workshop and
storage purposes, thus supplying much-needed space and allowing for
the removal of the long frame shed which adjoined the Museum build-
ing on the east side.

ACCESSIONS AND REGISTRATION.

The total number of accessions during the year was 1,497, a slight
increase over that for the preceding year. The number of specimens
embraced in these accessions was 210,323, raising the grand total in
the possession of the Museum to 4,355,463. The details are shown in
the following table:

STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS.

Investigations upon collections in the Museum by persons not
employed upon its staff have been carried on extensively. The Chinese
kites were examined by Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch, of Hyde Park,
Massachusetts, with reference to the principles of aerial flotation
involved in their construction. The extensive collection of aboriginal
tobacco pipes has been studied by Mr. J. D. McGuire, of Ellicott City,
Maryland, in connection with the preparation of his monograph on that
subject published in the Report of the Museum for 1897. Mr. Stewart
Culin, of the University of Pennsylvania, has continued his studies on
aboriginal and modern games, as illustrated by specimens in the Division
of Ethnology.

The collections in the Division of Mammals have been constantly
consulted by the members of the staff of the Biological Survey of the
Department of Agriculture. The specimens of Dermochelys, a genus
of turtles, have been studied by Dr. O. P. Hay, with regard to the
systematic position of the genus. In the Division of Marine Inver-
tebrates, Miss Harriet Richardson has been engaged in studying cer-

the Pacific coast of North America, which has recently been published
in the Proceedings of the Museum. Dr. H. F. Moore, of the U.S.
Fish Commission, spent several weeks at the Museum in working up
the Isopoda collected by the steamer /%sh Hawk on the coast of Porto
Rico. A study of the very extensive collection of West Indian corals
belonging to the Museum has been begun by Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan,
of the U. 8. Geological Survey, whose previous researches in this field
especially qualify him for the work. Prof. W. P. Hay, of the Central
High School, has at intervals given attention to the crayfishes in the
collection, naming those recently obtained. He has also described a
new form of Isopod in a paper printed in the Proceedings of the
Museum.

Applegate, of Klamath Falls, Oregon, spent about two months in
working up a set of Oregon plants. Mr. J. B. Leiberg, of Hope,
Idaho, was occupied during a part of January and February with
plants collected in the Western timber reserves. Prof. W. L. Bray
has recently carried on extensive studies in the herbarium. Prof.
E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University, Washington, has consulted
material in various genera and has made determinations for the Mu-
seum. Prof. L. M. Underwood, of Columbia University, New York
City, visited the herbarium early in the spring for the purpose of
examining certain fern groups.

Prof. A. Wanner, who has discovered Triassic plants near York,
Pennsylvania, where he resides, has visited the Museum on two occa-
sions for the purpose of comparing his collections with those from the
Richmond coal fields of Virginia. Researches on vertebrate fossils

bia, 14 specimens; Mr. Theodor Holm, Washington, District of
Solumbia, 263 specimens; Mrs. M. R. McConnell, Washington, Dis-
trict of Columbia, 6 specimens.

Several specimens of chalcedony have been sent to Mr. J. 5S. Diller,
of the U. S. Geological Survey, for use in connection with his investi-
gations, and thin sections of rocks have been supplied to Prof. B. K.
Emerson, of Amherst College.

Specimens of the teeth of Paleozoic sharks have been lent to Dr.
C. R. Eastman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and a number of fossils to Prof. J. W. Beede, of the
University of Kansas, for use in connection with the preparation of
a monograph on the fossils of the Upper Carboniferous strata of
Nebraska and Kansas.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

As in past years, much valuable material has been received from
several departments and bureaus of the Government, notably the
Department of Agriculture, the U. 8. Geological Survey, and the U.S.
Fish Commission, under all of which extensive explorations into the
resources of this country are continuously in progress. The collec-
tions derived from this source are enumerated in the List of Accessions
(Appendix II), and those of special interest are also discussed in the
reports of the head curators. ;

In this connection reference should be made to the services rendered
by those curators and custodians who receive no compensation from
the Museum. There are now about thirty of these honorary officers,
the majority of whom are in the employ of other branches of the Gov-
ernment, and the assumption of the additional duties which they vol-
untarily perform in this connection is only rendered possible through
the courtesy of the heads of the several departments and bureaus. In
accepting the care and development of the collections placed in their
charge, they are called upon in most cases to undertake a large amount
of arduous routine work for which the Museum has not the means for
engaging paid assistants.

INFORMATION FURNISHED.

Temporary accessions, consisting almost entirely of material sent
to the Museum for identification, have been received to the number of
518 (numbers 5070 to 5587). Such specimens are usually returned to
the senders unless used up in analysis or found desirable for addition
to the collections. The amount of time consumed by members of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

scientific staff in making these identifications is necessarily very great,
and has proved especially so in the Divisions of Insects and Geology.
Many requests for technical information are received daily. When
these relate to subjects coming within the scope of the activities of the
Museum, as is very generally the case, they are promptly complied
with, though the public little realizes the amount of work which this
involves.
PUBLICATIONS.

_ The publications of the Museum issued and distributed during the
year were the Annual Report for 1896, together with the separates of
the several papers composing the appendix to the same; completed
volume 20 of the Proceedings (issued in August, 1898); the separate
editions of papers numbered from 1140 to 1178, inclusive, constituting
volume 21 of the Proceedings; and parts 2 and 3 of Bulletin 47, entitled
The Fishes of North and Middle America, by Drs. David Starr Jor-
dan and Barton Warren Evermann. Part 4 of this Bulletin, an atlas
of plates of fishes, is well under way.

The Annual Report for 1897 will be in two volumes, the second
volume being in the nature of a memorial to the late assistant secre-
tary, Dr. George Brown Goode. The proof reading of the first vol-
ume has been finished. The second volume and the Annual Report
for 1898 are both in the printer’s hands.

The Bibliography, forming Appendix IV of this volume, contains
a list of all papers based upon Museum material which have been
published during the year. The number of authors represented is 75
and the total number of titles given 318. The following table classi-
fies these papers in accordance with the subjects treated:

64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

Twenty-two papers by members of the staff, based upon Museum
material, have with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution been printed during the year in publications other than
those of the Museum. Their titles will be found in the Bibliography.
The names of the authors are as follows: Mr. Robert Ridgway, Dr.
C. W. Richmond, Mr. G. 8. Miller, jr., Mr. F. A. Lucas, Dr. J. N. Rose,
Mr. C. L. Pollard, Mr. Charles Schuchert, and Mr. B. A. Bean.

LIBRARY.

During the past year the Museum library acquired through pur-
chase, under a special act of Congress, the very important scientific
library of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, consisting of about 2,900
bound volumes, 18,000 pamphlets, and 1,800 portraits, autographs,
and engravings. This collection, brought together at the expense of
much time and labor on the part of Doctor Goode, contains many rare
and valuable publications, and is especially rich in the literature of
museums and of fishes.

The overcrowded condition of the library has been somewhat,
though only temporarily, relieved by building for its use a gallery
in the West North Range.

Six hundred and forty books, 965 pamphlets, and 5,196 parts of
periodicals, including the regular Museum accessions and a small part
of the Goode library, have been catalogued, and progress has been
made in the transfer of titles to the new catalogue cards. From the
accessions to the Smithsonian library 231 books, 649 pamphlets, and
8,616 parts of periodicals have been temporarily installed in the
Museum. About 16,000 books and pamphlets were borrowed during
the year, about one-third for the use of the sectional libraries. Among
the purchases for the year have been a large number of works relating
to the natural history of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands.
The number of books bound at the Government Printing Office was 441.

Three additional sectional libraries have been authorized, the list
now standing as follows:

Administration. Marine invertebrates.
Anthropology. Medicine.

Biology. Mesozoic fossils.

Birds. Mineralogy.

Botany. Mollusks.

Comparative anatomy. Oriental antiquities.
Editorial. Paleobotany
Ethnology. Parasites.

Fishes. Photography.

Geology. Prehistoric archeology.
History. Reptiles.

Insects. Stratigraphic paleontology.

Mammals, Technology.

EXPLORATIONS.

Explorations yielding materials of much value have been conducted
by members of tbe scientific staff of the Museum and by others. The
importance of giving early attention to the investigation of the eth-
nology and natural history of the territories recently acquired by the
United States was fully realized, but the lack of means has prevented
any considerable inquiries in that direction.

In the interest of the Department of Anthropology, Mr. W. H.
Holmes, head curator, visited California in September, 1898, and
secured a valuable series of objects illustrating the ethnology and
archeology of that State. The auriferous gravel region of Calaveras
and Tuolumne counties was studied, and many stone implements, sup-
posed to have a bearing upon the occupation of that area by Tertiary
man, were obtained. The ancient soapstone quarries and two prehis-
toric burial places in Santa Catalina Island were examined, and a num-
ber of relics were taken from the latter. The ethnological collection
brought home by Mr. Holmes consisted in greater part of examples of
the basketry, implements, ete., of the Pomo, Digger, and Tulare
Indians.

Mr. Holmes also spent the month of April, 1899, in Mexico, where
he obtained an important collection from the site of the ancient Aztec
obsidian mines in the State of Hidalgo, besides a number of relics from
the ancient cities of San Juan Teotihuacan and Xochicalco.

The autumn of 1898 and a part of the following winter were spent
in Cuba by Mr. Paul Beckwith, of the Division of History, with the
object of gathering material of historical interest relating to the war
with Spain. He was successful in obtaining many valuable objects
and also in enlisting the cooperation of military men and others in con-
tinuing the collecting.

Dr. George F. Becker, of the United States Geological Survey, for
which he has been carrying on investigations in the Philippine Islands,
has kindly agreed to look after the interests of the Museum in the
same region.

Mr. J. B. Hatcher, sent to Patagonia on an extensive scientific mis-
sion by Princeton University, has also entered into an arrangement
to supply ethnological material to the National Museum, and one
important lot has been received from him.

In May, 1899, Dr. Walter Hough was detailed to carry on ethno-
botanical researches in Mexico in connection with certain explorations
by the Division of Botany in charge of Dr. J. N. Rose. Earlier in
the year Doctor Hough had made a collection of potters’ tools and sev-
eral hundred pieces of pottery in West Virginia.

Mr. E. W. Nelson, while on a botanical expedition to Mexico, under

‘the Department of Agriculture, secured a large number of archzeologi-

NAT MUS 99 5

66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

‘al and ethnological objects, which were purchased by the Museum.
Dr. Edward Palmer, also exploring in Mexico for the same depart-
ment, made collections for the Museum. Dr. Roland Steiner, of
Grovetown, Georgia, conducted extensive explorations in aboriginal
quarries, workshops, and village sites near the mouth of the Little
Kiokee River, Georgia, where he obtained many thousands of speci-
mens, which will be included in the collection now being acquired by
the Museum.

Among the explorations which yielded important results to the
Department of Biology, those carried on in connection with the cruise
of the steamer /7sh /lawk to Porto Rico by the naturalists of the U.S.
Fish Commission and by Mr. A. B. Baker, of the National Zoological
Park, are especially worthy of mention. Of mollusks the Museum
received some 5,000 specimens, representing about 400 species, many
of which were rare and some undescribed. ‘There were also large
series of other marine and fresh-water invertebrates, about 180 birds,
200 reptiles and batrachians, and 200 bats.

A large and important series of mammals was collected for the
Museum in Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland by Mr. J. A.
Loring, of Owego, New York. Mr. Dall De Weese, who visited
Alaska during the summer of 1898, obtained for the Museum several
specimens of the Alaska moose and a large number of the wild white
sheep of that Territory.

Ornithological collections received at the Museum were made as
follows: by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A., in Texas; by Mr. Paul D.
Bergen and Mr. George D. Wilder, in China; by Mr. Outram Bangs,
in Colombia; by Mr. J. Hornung, in the Western United States; by
Mr. R. C. MeGregor, in California; by Mr. Eugene Coubeaux, in the
Northwest Territory, Canada.

A large series of reptiles and batrachians collected by field parties
of the U. S. Fish Commission has been turned over to the Museum.
This collection embraces a great deal of valuable material for the
study of geographic distribution and individual variation, and includes
a unique specimen of a discoglossoid toad,’ the first member of this
suborder which has been discovered in the Western Hemisphere. Col-
lections of fishes resulting from explorations in the Northern Pacific
Ocean, Alaska, Kamchatka, Lake Superior, and Florida have also been
transferred by the Fish Commission. Fishes obtained by Mr. Chaf-
fanjon in northern and central Asia were received from the Museum
of Natural History at Paris.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates has been enriched by material
collected by Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean, on Long Island;.
by Miss Mary J. Rathbun, at Grand Manan, New Brunswick; by Mr.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

William Palmer and Mr. Paul Bartsch, in the Dismal Swamp, Virginia;
by Mr. Haroid Heath, in Monterey Bay, California, and by the Bio-
logical Laboratory, at Cold Spring Harbor, New York.

Mr. August Buseck, of the Department of Agriculture, who accompa-
nied the Fish Commission expedition to Porto Rico, obtained there a val-
uable collection of insects, which has been transferred to the Museum.
Agents of the Department of Agriculture, collecting in Mexico, have
contributed small numbers of mollusks, some of which are valuable in
character.

At the close of the year Dr. J. N. Rose was engaged in botanical
work in Mexico. Mr. Walter Evans, who visited Alaska for the
Department of Agriculture, brought back with him a fine series of
plants, which has been transferred to the Museum. The explorations
by members of the Biological Survey of the same department, chiefly
in the far West, have added much valuable material to the Herbarium.
Important collections in botany have been made in Europe by Mr. W.
T. Swingle and Mr. D. G. Fairchild. A number of Mexican plants
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson have been obtained by purchase.

The Department of Geology acquired an extensive series of Upper
Silurian fossils, collected in the vicinity of Lockport, New York, for
the Museum by Mr. H. E. Dickhaut, of the U. S. Geological Survey;
and a large lot of Hamilton corals from near lowa City, and Kinder-
hook corals from the vicinity of Burlington, in the State of Iowa, col-
lected by Mr. Paul Bartsch.

Explorations by the Geological Survey have been illustrated by two
collections of fossil plants, one representing the Lower Coal Measure,
of Henry County, Missouri; the other the Carboniferous formation in
the vicinity of McAlester, Indian Territory. Both of these lots have
been described by Mr. David White, whose papers will be published
by the Survey.

Geological material obtained in Europe by Mr. F. W. Crosby has
been added to the collection. |

Collectors’ outfits.—Outtits have been furnished to the following
persons, who have undertaken to collect material for the Museum:
Mr. J. S. Holmes, Bowmans Bluff, North Carolina; Mr. D. W.
Prentiss, jr., Washington, District of Columbia; Dr. E. A. Mearns,
U. S. A.; Lieut. J. W. Daniel, Lynchburg, Virginia; Mr. Milton

of the Museum staff: Dr. F. W. True, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Miss
M. J. Rathbun, Mr. William Palmer, Mr. Paul Bartsch, Mr. D. G.
Fairchild, and Dr. J. N. Rose.

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGY.

Eighty specimens in the flesh, consisting of 54 mammals, 15 birds,
and 1i reptiles, have been received during the year, a large portion
having come from the National Zoological Park. The skins of most
of these were prepared for the study series, and skeletons were saved
of an elephant, a sea lion, a beaver, and several of the birds and
reptiles. The accessions also included 94 mammal skins, which came
either dry, fresh, or salted. The number of mammal skins mounted
for exhibition purposes was 36.

Besides the above the taxidermic work has included the renovation
of a large number of specimens in the divisions of mammals, birds,
and reptiles, with reference more especially to the exhibition series,
which are being rearranged and placed in more acceptable condition
for the public use. The collections in these and other divisions of
zoology which were displayed at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition,
have been unpacked, renovated, and added to the exhibition series.

The total number of osteological specimens prepared was 1,528,
consisting of 1,504 mammal skulls and skeletons, the skeletons of 14
birds, 3 reptiles, 3 fishes, and 4 miscellaneous objects.

PHOTOGRAPHY.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer, reports that 473 negatives, 582
platinum prints, 123 silver prints, and 18 cyanotypes have been made
during the year. Several collectors have received instruction in the
photographic laboratory, and outfits for field work have been fur-
nished them. Mr. Smillie has continued to act as chairman of the
United States Civil Service Board on Photography.

EXPOSITIONS.

Trans- Mississippi and International Faxposition.—The Exposition
opened at Omaha on June 1, 1898, and continued for five months.
I ,
The Annual Report for 1898 contains a brief reference to the exhibits
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

displayed by the Museum, while a more extended account will appear
in the Smithsonian Report for 1899.

Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo.—By act of Congress approved
March 3, 1899, the sum of $300,000 has been appropriated for a Grov-
ernment exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo
in 1901, besides an additional sum of $200,000 for the erection of a
building. ,.Dr. F. W. True, executive curator, has been designated
as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National
Museum on the Government board of management, and Mr. W. V.
Cox as chief special agent.

Ohio Centennial Exposition.—An appropriation similar to that for
the Pan-American Exposition has also been made by Congress for a
Government exhibit and building at the Ohio Centennial Exposition,
to be held at Toledo in 1902 or 1903, as may be determined upon here-
after. This appropriation is contingent, however, upon a grant of
$500,000 to the Exposition by the Ohio State legislature and the rais-
ing of the same amount by subscription.

Mention may here be made of the National Electric Light Exposi-
tion in New York City in 1899, where the Museum was represented
by a number of models of electrical apparatus belonging to the Henry
collection.

NECROLOGY.

Dr. Othniel Charles Marsh, Honorary Curator of the collection of
Vertebrate Fossils in the National Museum, died at his home in New
Haven, Connecticut, on March 18, 1899. Dr. Marsh had held the
position of professor of paleontology in Yale University since 1866.
He was born in Lockport, New York, in 1831. After being gradu-
ated from Yale in 1860 he spent five years in further study in the
Sheffield Scientific School and in Germany. His explorations of the
extensive fossil deposits of the West were begun in 1868. These led
him into wholly unknown fields, and the record of his work from the
time of his first connection as a professor with Yale University until
his death forms a most important part of the history of recent
progress in paleontological research.

Many valuable works embodying the results of his investigations
have been published, and others were left in an advanced stage.

In 1876 Doctor Marsh was elected president of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science, and in 1883 he became presi-
dent of the National Academy of Sciences, a position which he held
during two terms, or until 1895. He was connected with the U. 5.
Geological Survey, as paleontologist, for many years. In 18/7 a
medal was granted him by the Geological Society of London for
most distinguished researches in geology and paleontology. He was

v
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

a member of many scientific societies both in this country and abroad.
The University of Heidelberg conferred upon him in 1886 the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and Harvard University about the
same time gave him the degree of Doctor of Laws. He became a
correspondent of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France
in 1898, and as winner of the Cuvier prize he was the recipient of
one of the greatest honors ever conferred upon an American scientific
man.

Through the influence of Doctor Marsh, his uncle, George Peabody,
made gifts to Yale University which resulted in the establishment of
the Peabody Museum.

ASHMEAD, Wituram H.—Continued.

— Three new species in the genus Di-
plectron Fox.
Entomological News, X, No. 3, Mar., 1899,
pp. 5d, 56.
Gives a table of the known species and de-
scribes as new Diplectron ferrugineus, D. bi-
dentatus, and D. foviti.

—— Superfamilies in the Hymenoptera,
and generic synopses of the families
Thynnidee, Myrmosidee, and Mutillidee.

Journ. N. Y. Ent. Soc., vu, No. 1,
1899, pp. 45-60.

In this paper Mr. Ashmead has divided the
Hymenoptera into ten superfamilies: (1) Apoi-
dea, (IL) Sphegoidea, (IIL) Vespoidea, (IV)
Formicoidea, (V) Proctotrypoidea, (VI) Cy-
nipoidea, (VII) Chalcidoidea, (VIII) Ichneu-
monoidea, (IX) Siricoidea, and (X) Tenthre-
dinoidea. Generic tables are given for the
families Thynnidee, Myrmoside, and Mutil-
lidee.

Fifty-three genera are tabulated. Sixteen
new genera are defined: Iswaroides, Ephu-
tomma, Typhoctes, Odontomutilla, Dolichomu-
tilla, Bothriomutilla, Nomixphagus, Pyrrhomu-
tila, Eurymutilla, Hoplomutilla, Dasymuctilla,
Allomutilla, Trogaspidia, Alloneurion, and Mi-
cromutilla.

Mar.,

—— Four new species belonging to the
genus Plenoculus Fox.

Psyche, vu, No. 275, Mar., 1899, pp. 837-839.
Gives a synoptic table for recognizing the
known species of Plenoculus and describes
4 new species: P. punctatus, P. abdominatis,
P. niger, and P. albipes.

— On the genera of the Cleonymide.

Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., tv, No.3 (issued May
24, 1899), pp. 200-206.

Mr. Ashmead separates this family into 4
subfamilies (1) Chalcedectine, (2) Cleony-
min, (3) Pelecinelline, and (4) Colotrech-
nine. Thirty-six genera are tabulated, of
which 3 are new: Chalcidiscelis, Tomicobia,
and Eutrichosoma.

—— On the genera of the Eucharide.

Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., tv, No.3 (issued May
24, 1899), pp. 235-242.
Tabulates all the known genera, 23 in num-
ber. Two genera are new: Pseudometagea
and Dicelothorax.

— Classification of the old family Chal-
cididee.
Proc. Ent. Soe. Wash.,1v, No.3 (issued May
24, 1899), pp. 242-249.

In this paper Mr. Ashmead treats the old
family as a superfamily, Chalcidoidea, and
then divides it into 14 distinct minor families,
as already proposed by him in a previous
paper. Tables for recognizing these families,

ASHMEAD, WitirAm H.—Continued.
and the subfamilies into which they are
again divided, are given: Agaonidie, Tory-
mide with 5 subfamilies, Chalcididie with 2
subfamilies, Eurytomidee, Perilampide, Hu-
charidze, Miscogasteridx with 4 subfamilies,
Cleonymide with 4 subfamilies, Encyrtidie
with 3 subfamilies, Pteromalidee with 5 sub-
families, Elasmide, Eulophidee with 4 sub-
families, Trichogrammid with 2 subfamlies,
and Mymaride with 2 subfamilies.

— Classification of the entomophilous
wasps, or the superfamily Sphegoidea.
Paper No. 1.

Canadian Entomologist, Xxx1, No. 6, June,
1899, pp. 145-155.

Mr. Ashmead gives an introduction on the
arrangement of these wasps by previous au-
thors, exhibits the scheme of arrangement
proposed by Dr. Franz Kohl, and divides the
superfamily into 12 families, giving a table
for their recognition. The families are: Oxy-
belide, Crabronide, Pamphredonide, Bem-
becide, Larridee, Philanthidee, Trypoxylide,
Mellinidee, Nyssonide, Stizide, Sphegide,
and Ampulicide.

A generic table of the family Panur-
gidee; areply to Mr. Cockerell’s critique
on the segregation of Perdita Cockerell.

Psyche, vit, No. 278, June, 1899, pp. 372-
376.

In this paper Mr. Ashmead points out par-
ticularly the differences between Cockerellia
and Perdita; shows that four of Mr. Cocker-
ell’s recent new bee genera belonging in this
group are synonyms, and concludes by tabu-
lating the genera of the Panurgide. Nine-
teen genera are thus tabulated.

.—— Classification of the bees, or the
superfamily Apoidea.

Trans. Am. Ent. Soc., Phila., xxv1, May-
June, 1899, pp. 49-100.

Divides the Apoidea into 14 families, some
of which are again divided into subfamilies.
Dichotomous tables for recognizing the fami-
lies, subfamilies, and the bee genera of the
world are given. In all, 216 genera are tabu-
lated, of which 19 are new.

be utilized for the instruction of students,
and points out the difficulties in the realiza-
tion of any plan in which the presence of the
students in those laboratories forms a part.
Although this is a feature of most of the propo-
sitions for a National University, on the prac-
ticability of which the success of those pro-
jects depends absolutely, it has been almost
universally ignored by those persons who
have endeavored to promote®the establish-
ment of such a university.

—— Synopsis of the recent and Tertiary
Leptonacea of North America and the
West Indies.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., Xx1, No. 1177, June
29, 1899, pp. 873-897, pls. 87, 88.

This paper gives the results of a revision of
the groups belonging to the Leptonacea, a
table of the revised classification and lists (A)
of the species of the east coast of North Amer-
ica; (B) of the west coast of North America,
and (C) of the Tertiary American species.

The genus Galeomma is divided into see-
tions, of which two, Amphilepida and Para-
lepida, are new; Spaniorinus and Scintillorbis
are new subgenera of Solecardia Conrad; Vas-
coniella is proposed as a new generic name for
Vasconia, which is preoccupied. In the Len-
tonide, Epilepton (subgenus of Lepton) is
proposed for Lepton clarkixv; Ceratobornia, a
section of Bornia, Mancikellia and Kelliola,
sections of Kellia, Serridensand Dicranodesma,
subgenera of Thecodonta, and Pythinella, sub-
genus of Mysella angas, are new.

The following new species and varieties are
described: Sportella pilsbryi, S. californica, S.
stearnsii, Anisodonta corbuloidea, Erycina lin-
ella, E. emmonsi, E. periscopiana, E. fernan-
dina, E. compressa, Bornia barbadensis, B.
retifera, Mysella tumidutla, var. verrilli, Mysella
barbadensis, M. aleutica, M. pedroana, Monta-
cuta floridana, M. minuscula, M. limpida, M.
percompressa.

The following new names are applied to
species of which the names in use are preoc-
cupied or erroneous: Solecardia morchit for S.
eburnea Morch, not Conrad.

The new species are figured, the method in
which Pseudopythina attaches itself to ecrus-
tacea, and the animal of Ceratobornia are
illustrated.

for the major classification of fish-like
vertebrates.

Rep. Brit. Assoc. Adv. Sci., 1897 (1898), p.
696, 697.

Nine classes of vertebrates are recognized,
of which five have been confounded under
the designation of ‘‘fishes’’—the Leptocar-
dians, Marsipobranchs, Ostracophores, Sela-
chians, and Teleostomes. ‘‘ The gaps between
the lower classes are very great. The least
differences between the Selachians and Teleo-
stomes are manifestin the Xenacanthini and
Dipnoi of the Paleozoic; the least differences
between the Teleostomes and Amphibians
in the Crossopterygians and Stegocephals.”’

— On the derivation of the pectoral
member in terrestrial vertebrates.

Rep. Brit. Assoc. Adv. Sci., 1897 (1898), p.
697.

The most important hint respecting the
origin of the chiropterygium is furnished by
Polypterus. ‘‘The chief objection to the
derivation of the chiropterygium from the
pectoral member of such a form as Polypterus
is that at present no extinct representatives
are known. Probably future research will
reveal such, as the genus belongs to a very
archaic type.”

Some questions of nomenclature.

A republication, with corrections of former
typographical errors, of the address as vice-
president of section F (Zoology) at the Buffalo

contains an additional note on Lang’s ‘‘Meth-
odus nova Testacea—distribuendi,”’ 1722.

After an ‘‘introduction”’ (p. 457), the author
treats of the “‘commencement of binomial
nomenclature’”’ (p. 459), ‘‘trivial names”
(p. 461), ‘‘draconian laws’ (p. 462), ‘‘mis-

— The tailless batrachians of Europe.
Science (new series), VIII, Dee. 30, 1898,
pp. 9382-938, with 13 figs.

A review of ‘‘The Tailless Batrachians of
Europe, by G. A. Boulenger, F. R. S.’’ The
work is highly commended and the illustra-
tions borrowed from it.

A comparison is instituted between the
European and North American batrachians.
Dissent is expressed from previous inyesti-
gators respecting the affinities of Scaphiopus.
The families Pelobatidz and Scaphiopide of
Cope are declared to be inseparable.

“Further, examination of the skeletons of
Pelodytes, Pelobates, and Scaphiopus should
conyince a competent observer that the dif-
ferences between Pelobates and Pelodytes are
much less than those between Pelobates and
Scaphiopus,”’ in fine, ‘‘if the family is to be
divided, the two European genera should be
combined and contrasted with the Amer-
ican.’ It is further urged that an arrange-
ment of the phaneroglossate forms into three
superfamilies of which the arciferous family
of Discoglossids is the most generalized, may
Be more acceptable to some; the superfami-
lies are Discoglossoidea, Bufonoidea, and
Ranoidea.

The generic names Pediocextes and
Poocetes.
Auk, XVI, Jan., 1899, pp. 20-23.

Pediocxtes and Poocextes are formed on the
model of Ammocextes, a misspelling of Ammo-
cetes by Baird. The same author, however,
substituted for them and first published Pedi-
ecetes and Powcetes, and those should be
adopted. Powcetes graminea affinis is a new
combination.

Suggestions for a new history of
North American birds.
Osprey, III, Feb., 1899, pp. 88-94.

The suggestions are arranged under the fol-

desirability of generized biographies; pro-
posals for publication; classification to be
adopted; avine orders; natural selection
among birds; oscine families; subspecies;

—— Larval stage of the eel.

Science (new series) , IX, June 9, 1899, p. 820.
It is deduced that ‘‘Inasmuch as (1) the
seagoing eels do not mature their ova till
the winter season, (2) the leptocephalus
young are found from February to September,
or later, and (3) the transitional form be-
tween the leptocephalus stage and the cylin-
drical stage has been found in January, it
appears tolerably certain tbat the elyers
which ascend the rivers in the early spring
are the progeny of eels that descended there-
from not later than winter of the penultimate
(and not last) season.’’

The editor remarks: ‘One of the rarest of
American contributions to ichthyology is a
little work published in 1814—to be very pre-
cise, published ‘January 1, 1814’—on the
fishes of New York; in brief, the ‘Report, in

of natural history, ete., on the fishes of New
York.’ The only copies of whose existence
in the United States the editor was able to
learn are three. It contains original and de-
tailed descriptions of 49 species, with a simple
catalogue of 21 more.’’ Thirty-eight are
described or designated as new and 12
were really so at the time. Four genera also
aredesignated as new and 8 have been
adopted by recent authors.

A small edition has been published with a
historical and critical introduction and iden-
tification of the species, as well as a concord-
ance of names with those by which the
species are known at the present day.

eesthetic rather than the utilitarian point of
view, although the two are necessarily inter-
related.

The introduction contains remarks on the
theory of art.

The first and second chapters deal with all
kinds of artin the Paleolithic and Neolithic
periods, and with the differences in art be-
tween the two periods and the geometric or-
naments employed in both.

The third chapter treats of prehistoric mu-
sical instruments, describing the gold and

The question discussed in this article is the
amount or proportion of light lost in passing
through glass of different kinds. Various
mechanical applances were used to deter-
mine loss: (1) a camera obscura, (2) compar-
ative photographs, (3) photometer.

BY

GEORGE P. MERRILL,

Curator, Division of Physical and Chemical Geology,
and Head Curator of the Department.

PREFATORY NOTE.

The accompanying handbook and guide is an outgrowth of the work
of installing and labeling the collections of the economic section of the
Division of Physical and Chemical Geology. The term nonmetallic,
as used, includes those minerals which, as here exhibited, are utilized
in other than metallic forms. The collections, comprising as now
arranged, some 2,500 specimens, include therefore some materials
which—like the iron oxides—may be utilized as ores of metals. As
such they have already been considered in Bulletin No. 42, under the
title A Preliminary Descriptive Catalogue of the Systematic Collec-
tions in Economic Geology and Metallurgy, by F. P. Dewey. The
collection of building and ornamental stones which might perhaps be
included herewith has been also the subject of a special handbook
published in the Annual Report of the National Museum for 1886,
and entitled The Collection of Building and Ornamental Stones in the
United States National Museum: A Handbook and Catalogue. By
George P. Merrill.

It is scarcely necessary to remark that in the preparation of this
work the curator has been hampered by a great dearth of information
on certain subjects and burdened with a superabundance on others.
Certain materials, such as the coals, phosphates, limes, and cements,
would each require a volume, and necessarily must be very imper-
fectly treated here. In such cases the curator has aimed to give as
brief and concise an abstract as the requirements of a handbook
would permit, and make up for the deficiencies in the bibliography.
In other cases the subjects are treated as fully as the knowledge at
hand will allow. In describing occurrences the aim has heen to give
in detail one or two fairly typical deposits, referring to others more
briefly. Naturally the preference has been given to American mate-
rials. Statements as to prices and annual production are quite unsatis-
factory and of very temporary value at best. But little space has
therefore been devoted to this branch of the subject. Technical,
chemical, and crystallographic points have been but lightly touched
upon, such being already covered by existing literature. Only such
statements as to hardness, color, etc., are given as it is thought may
be of value in rough preliminary determinations.

The satisfactory installation and classification of collections of this
nature are matters of no inconsiderable difficulty. As the materials

157

158 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

are utilized for industrial purposes, it might at first thought appear
that they should be grouped according to the uses to which they
are put, as is commonly done at expositions. Such a plan, however,
involves a great amount of repetition, since many of the materials, as
diatomaceous earths, the clays, steatite, etc., are used for a variety of
purposes. On this account the method of installation, or grouping,
adopted is somewhat loose, the materials being grouped (1) by kinds,
and under kinds so far as possible (2) by uses. Further than this the
character of the material has in many instances rendered it necessary
to install those closely related and used, it may be, for quite similar
purposes in cases of quite different type as is shown in the hydrocar-
bon series, the coals, asphalts, etc., being in the deep-wall cases while
the petroleums, in bottles, are exhibited in the upright portion of the
rail cases.

SECTION OF APPLIED GEOLOGY.

THE NONMETALLIC MINERALS.

By GrorGE P. MERRILL,

Curator, Division of Physical and Chemical Geology and Head Curator of the Department.

I. ELEMENTS.
1. CARBON.

The numerous compounds of which carbon forms the chief constit-
uent are widely variable in their physical properties and origin. As
occurring in nature few of its members possess a definite chemical
composition such as would constitute a true mineral species, and they
must for the most part be looked upon as indefinite admixtures in
which carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen play the more important roles.
For present purposes the entire group may be best considered under
the heads of (1) The Pure Carbon series; (2) The Coal series, and (3)
The Bitumen series, the distinctions being based mainly on the gradu-
ally increasing amounts of volatile hydrocarbons, a change which is
accompanied by a variation in physical condition from the hardest of
known substances through plastic and liquid to gaseous forms. Here
will be considered only the members of the pure carbon series, the
others being discussed under the head of hydrocarbon compounds.

Dramonv.—This mineral crystallizes in the isometric system, with
a tendency toward octahedral forms, the crystals showing curved and
striated surfaces. (Specimen No. 53558, U.S.N.M.) The hardness is
ereat, 10 of Dana’s scale; the specific gravity varies from 3.1 in the
earbonados to 3.5 in good clear crystals. The luster is adamantine;
the colors, white or colorless, through yellow, red, orange, green,
brown to black. The transparent and highly refractive forms are of
value as gems, and can best be discussed in works upon this subject.
We have to do here rather with the rough, confused crystalline aggre-
gates or rounded forms, translucent to opaque, which, though of
no value as gems, are of the greatest utility in the arts. To such

165
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1899.

forms the name black diamond, bort, and carbonado are applied. (Speci-
mens Nos. 53668-53671, U.S.N.M.)

Origin and Occurrence.—The origin of the diamond has long been a
matter of discussion. A small proportion of the diamonds of the
world are found in alluvial deposits of gravel or sand. In the South
African fields they occur in a so-called blue gravel, formed, according
to Lewis, along the line of contact between an eruptive rock (perido
tite) and highly carbonaceous shales. They were regarded by Lewis
as originating through the crystallization of the carbon of the shales
by the heat of the molten rock. De Launay states, however, that
there is no necessary connection between the shales and the diamond,
and shows with apparent conclusiveness that the latter occur often in
a broken and fragmental condition, such as to indicate beyond doubt
that they originated at greater depths and were brought upward as
phenocrysts in the molten magma at the time of its intrusion. The
primary origin of the diamonds he regards as through the crystalliza-
tion, under great pressure, of the carbon contained in the basic magma
in the form of metallic carbides.

The diamond-bearing rock as above noted is a peridotite often brec-
ciated and more or less serpentinized (Specimen No. 62108, U.S.N.M.).
The blue and green gravel formed by the decomposition of this rock is
shown in Specimen No. 73188, U.S.N.M. With these are others of the
associated, eruptive, and metamorphic rocks, as melaphyr (Specimen
No. 73184, U.S.N.M.), quartzite (Specimen No. 73185, U.S.N.M.),
shale (Specimen No. 73186, U.S.N.M.), and basalt (Specimen No. 73187,
U.S.N.M).

Whether or not a similar origin to that outlined above can be attrib-
uted to the Brazilian diamonds is as yet unproven. ‘Their occurrence
and association with detrital materials resulting from the breaking
down of older rocks, with which they may or may not have been
originally associated, renders the problem obscure and difficult of
solution.

According to Kunz,' 95 per cent of all diamonds at present obtained
come from the Kimberly Mines, Griqua Land, west South Africa; of
these, some 47 per cent are bort. The remainder come from Brazil,
India, and Borneo. A few have been found in North America, the
Ural Mountains, and New South Wales, but these countries are not
recognized as regular and constant sources of supply.

Uses.—The material, aside from its use as a gem, owes its chief value
to its great hardness,.and is used as an abrading and cutting medium
in cutting diamonds and other gems, glass, and hard materials in gen-
eral, such as can not be worked by softer and cheaper substances.

With the introduction of machinery into mining and quarrying there

THE NONMETALLIC MINERALS. 167

has arisen a constant and growing demand for black diamonds, or bort,
for the cutting edges of diamond drills, and to a less extent for teeth
to diamond saws. (Specimens Nos. 53668 to 53670, U.S.N.M.)

According to a writer in the Iron Age’ the crystallized diamond is
not suitable for these purposes owing to its cleavage property. The best
bort or ‘‘carbonado” comes, it is said, from Bahia, Brazil, where it is
found as small, black pebbles in river gravels. The ordinary sizes
used for drills weigh but from one-half to 1 carat, but in special cases
pieces weighing from 4 to 6 carats are used. It is stated that the
crowns of large drills, 10 inches in diameter, armed with the best
grade of carbonado, are sometimes valued as high as $10,000.

Remarking on the occurrence of platinum associated with peridotites, he calls
attention to the fact that Maskelyne had shown the diamonds of South Africa
and Borneo to occur in a decomposed peridotite.
