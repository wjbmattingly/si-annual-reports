XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Dr. Welling, in presenting the report of the Executive Committee for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, called the attention of the Board
to the statement on page 5, under the head of International Exchanges
(which sets forth that an amount has been expended in this department
beyond the annual appropriation made by Congress, entailing annual
loss upon the fund of the Smithsonian Institution) and to the recom-
mendation that Congress be requested to make appropriations to reim-
burse the Smithsonian fund.

On motion it was—

Resolved, That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced
from the Smithsonian fund for governmental service in carrying on the
exchanges.

The report of the committee was then approved.
On motion of Dr. Welling it was also—

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1891, be appropriated for the service of the Institution,
to be expended by the Secretary, with the advice of the Executive Com-
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual
report of said committee, with full discretion on the part of the Secre-
tary as toitems of expenditures properly falling under each of the heads
embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

The Secretary, in presenting his report for the year ending June 30,
1889, referred especially to the fact that the Smithsonian Institution is
now, and has been for some time, paying out an increasingly large por-
tion of its annual income in service that inures either directly or
indirectly to the benefit of the Government, rather than to its legiti-
mate application for the immediate “increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge;” and in this connection quoted the opinion of Professor Henry,
expressed as long since as 1872, that the Government should then have
paid the Institution $300,000 for the use of the present building alone.

He did not ask for any immediate action, but invited the attention
of the Regents to this condition of the relation of the Institution’s
affairs to those of the Government, a general condition of which the
loss of the rent of the building might be taken as a single example.

The late Secretary had intended to provide an astro-physical observ-
atory on a modest scale, the building for which would probably cost
not over ten or fifteen thousand dollars, and with the expectation that
if this amount were contributed by private citizens and the building
placed on Government land, Congress would make an appropriation
for purchasing the apparatus, and also a small annual appropriation
necessary for maintenance. This amount having been pledged by re-
sponsible parties, the Secretary had ordered some of the principal pieces
of apparatus which would take a long time t» construct. A number of
valuable pieces had also been loaned to the Institution, and to supply
provisional needs, a cover for all these in the form of a small temporary
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XII

erection has been put up south of this building. ‘This will enable the
apparatus to be used, but it is not the “ observatory ” in question, which,
if Congress makes the necessary appropriation, will probably be erected
at some future time in some suburban site under the Regents’ control.

In this connection he presented a copy of the will of the late Dr.
Jerome H. Kidder, and letters from his executor, accompanied by a
copy of an unsigned codicil. The Secretary stated that Dr. Kidder was
a former officer of the U. S. Navy, who several years ago made a be-
quest of $10,000 to the Smithsonian Institution to be employed for
certain biological purposes. Dr. Kidder afterwards informed the Sec-
retary that owing to changes in his domestic circumstances, he had
reduced the amount to $5,000 and changed the purpose of the bequest,
which he was desirous to see applied to the astro-physical observatory
in question. It appears however that though this was well known
to Dr. Kidder’s family and friends to be his deliberate purpose, he did
not actually exeeute this provision to his will, but having ordered a
codicil to that effect to be drawn, was stricken with so sudden an ill-
ness that he was unable to sign it. (The Secretary read two letters
from the executor stating, in substance, that the family would cheer-
fully pay the $10,000, but that it earnestly desired to see this sum
applied to the astro-physical observatory, in which Dr. Kidder’s whole
interest was lately engaged. )

After the clauses of the will and the codicil had been read a diseus-
sion followed, from which it appeared to be the opinion of the Board
that if the Regents accepted, in accordance with the Wishes of the
family and the executors, the deliberate purpose of the testator in re-
gard to the object of the bequest, they should be guided by this pur-
pose also in regard to the amount which they should receive.

Mr. Morrill then offered the following preamble and resolution, which
was adopted :

Whereas the late Jerome H. Kidder having, in a will drawn up
some years before his death, bequeathed the sum of $10,000 to the
Smithsonian Institution for purposes connected with the advancement
of science, did in a codicil to said will, drawn under his direction during
his last hours, but which his sudden death prevented him from execu.
ting, reduce the amount of his bequest to $5,000, which he desired
should be applied toward the establishment of an astro-physical obser-
vatory: It is:

Resolved, That the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents
be authorized to accept, as finally and decisively indicative of the wishes
of the testator the provisions of the codicil bequeathing $5,000 for the
purpose of an astro-physical observatory, and that they be authorized
to decline to accept from his executors more than this sum; provided,
however, that before doing so they can receive sufficient assurance that
the Institution will be protected against any liability.

The Secretary exhibited recently prepared sketch plans for a new
Museum building, and called the attention of the Regents to their ree-
ommendation to Congress, in January, 1883, of the need of enlarge-
ment,
X1V JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Sinee this resolution, the collections of the Museum have enormously
increased, so that before a new building could now be completed the
material pressing for display would more than cover the entire area of
such a building as the present one. It seems absolutely necessary that
the new building should contain, beside a basement, at least two stories,
it being indispensable to have, apart from the purposes of display,
upper rooms for the preparation of the exhibits below.

The price of material has risen very greatly, so that, owing to these
combined causes, the estimate of 1883 is not applicable to the wants of
to-day. The Secretary did not conceive that any supplementary action
on the part of the Regents was now needed, but submitted these plans
and estimates that they might be advised of the probable very consider-
able increase in the sum that it would now be necessary to ask of Con-
egress,

The Chief Justice, being obliged to leave here, resigned the chair to
Senator Morrill.

The Secretary stated that in connection with this subject of the plans
he would present a letter from Mr. Cluss, of the firm of Cluss &
Schulze, arcuitects, asking for “an equitable compensation” for pro-
fessional services and expenses in former years,in connection with a
proposed building for the Museum.

On motion of General Meigs, if was

Resolved, That Messrs. Cluss & Schulze be informed that the ques-
tion of compensation to them for plans for a new Museum building
will be considered when they shall present such a bill as can be sub-
mitted for Congressional action.

The Seeretary recalled to the attention of the Regents a statement
made at their last meeting, to the fact that bills had been brought be-
fore Congress making an appropriation for the purpose of establishing
a Zoological Park under a Board of Commissioners, of whom the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution was one, and directing this Com-
mission, after purchasing and laying out the land and erecting the
necessary buildings, to turn it over to the Regents. The bill as since
actually passed, however, only instructed the Commissioners to pur-
chase the land; and, while declaring the Park to be for the advance-
ment of science, gave no intimation of the intent of Congress about its
ultimate disposal. This Commission has nearly completed the purchase,
and the time has now arrived when the Park may advantageously be
placed under scientific direction. He could not, of course, anticipate
what the final action of Congress would be in the matter, but he was
authorized to state that the Commission would feel satisfied if Congress
should place the Park under the Regents’ control. There is an increas-
ing collection of animals already in the Regents’ care, and an appropria-
tion of $50,000 has been asked for, to provide for its establishment in
the newly acquired Park, which, within its large area, would also pro-
vide suitable retirement for the small physical observatory already

alluded to. He expressed the hope that a bill providing for both meas-
ures would have the support of the Regents in the Senate and in the
House. '

After listening to statements by the Secretary relative to the esti-
mates for the ensuing year, and also to the subject of the desirability
of obtaining legislation relative to a statue of Professor Baird, the Re-
gents considered the subject of a more convenient time for their annual
meeting in January; and on motion of Senator Cullom it was—

Resolved, That hereafter the time of the annual meeting of the Board
of Regents shall be on tne fourth Wednesday in January of each year.

Mr. Wheeler called the attention of the Board to the death of their
late colleague, the Hon. 8.8. Cox, and on his motion it was—

Resolved, That a committee be appointed, of which the Secretary
shall be chairman, which shall be authorized to prepare resolutions on
the services and character of the late 8. 8S. Cox, and to make the same

of record,

The chairman announced as the committee, the Secretary, General
Wheeler, Dr. Welling, Mr. Lodge.

The committee submitted the following report and resolutions, which
were unanimously adopted :

To the Board of Regents:

Your committee report that the Hon. 8. 8. Cox was first appointed a
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1861, and that he
filled that office, except for intervals caused by public duties, to the
time of his death.

While he was a regular attendant at all the meetings of the Board,
he was ever ready to advance the interests of the Institution and of
science, either as a Regent or as amember of Congress; and although
such men as Hamlin, Iessenden, Colfax, Chase, Garfield, Sherman,
Gray, and Waite, in a list comprising Presidents, Vice- Presidents,
Chief Justices, and Senators of the United States were his associates,
there were none whose service was longer or more gratefully to be re-
membered, nor perhaps any to whom the Institution owes more than to
Mr. Cox.

The regard in which his brother Regents held Mr. Cox’s accuracy of
characterization, and his instinctive recognition of all that is worthiest
of honor in other men, may be inferred from the eulogies which he was
requested by them to deliver, among which may be particularly men-
tioned the one at the commemoration in honor of Professor Henry in the
House of Representatives; but though these only illustrate a very small
part of his services as a Regent, your committee are led by their con-
sideration to recall that his first act upon your Board was the prepara-
tion and delivery of an address, at the request of the Regents, on their
late colleague, Seaphen A. Douglas, and that on this occasion he used
words which your committee permit themselves to adopt, as being in
their view singularly characteristic of Mr. Cox himself:

“It was not merely as one of its Regents that he showed himself the
true and enlightened friend of objects kindred to those of this estab-
lishment. He ever advocated measures which served to advance
knowledge and promote the progress of humanity. The encourage-
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

ment of the fine arts, the rewarding of discoverers and inventors, the
organization of exploring expeditions, as well as the general diffusion
of education were all objects of his special regard.”

In view of these facts it is—

Resolved, That in the death of Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox the Smith-
sonian Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of a long-tried friend,
the Board of Regents of a most valued associate and active member
during fifteen years of service, and the country of one of its most dis-
tinguished citizens.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to express their deep
sympathy with the bereaved family of the deceased, and direct that
a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of their late
associate.

On motion of Senator Cullom, the Board adjourned sine die.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

The net expenditures of the Institution for the year ending June 30,
1890, were, therefore, $33,744.82, or $3,905.51 less than the gross ex-
penditure, $37,650.33, above given.

All moneys received by the Smithsonian Institution from interest,
sales, refunding of moneys temporarily advanced, or otherwise, are de-
posited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the Sec-
retary of the Institution, and all payments are made by his checks on
the Treasurer of the United States.

“In addition to the above $17,683.77 paid for salaries under general expenses,
$1,850.04 were paid for services, viz, $1,500 from the building account, and $350.04

from the library account.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1890, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, or, in his
absence, of the Assistant Secretary as acting Secretary, and a certificate
that the materials and services charged were applied to the purposes
of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the ‘ Interna-
tional Exchanges,” and of the “ National Museum,” and of the ‘‘ National
Zoological Park,” and finds that the balances above given correspond
with the certificates of the disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, whose appointment as such disbursing officer was accepted and
his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

ation for “North American Ethnology” have been exhibited to us; the

ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS RELATIVE TO THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, NATIONAL MUSEUM, ETC.

(In continuation from previous reports. )

[ Fifty-tirst Congress, first session, 1889-90. ]

CuHaP, 156.—AN ACT to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of
the discevery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international
exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and the produet of the soil, mine,
and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of Minois.

Whereas, It is fit and appropriate that the four hundredth anni-
versary of the discovery of America be commemorated by an exhibi-
tion of the resources of the United States of America, their develop-
ment, and of the progress of civilization of the New World; and

Whereas, Such an exhibition should be of a national and interna-
tional character, so that not only the people of our Union and this con-
tinent, but those of all nations as well, can participate, and should
therefore have the sanction of the Congress of the United States;
Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That an exhibition of arts,
industries, manufactures, and the products of the soil, mine, and sea
shall be inaugurated in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two, in
the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, as hereinafter provided.

Src. 2. That a commission, to consist of two commissioners from
each State and Territory of the United States and from the District of
Columbia and eight commissioners at large, is hereby constituted to
be designated as the World’s Columbian Commission.

SEC. 3. That said commissioners, two from each State and Territory,
shall be appointed within thirty days from the passage of this act by
the President of the United States, on the nomination of the governors
ot the States and Territories, respectively, and by the President eight
commissioners at large and two from the District of Columbia; and in
the same manner and within the same time there shall be appointed
two alternate commissioners from each State and Territory of the
United States and the District of Columbia and eight alternate com-
missioners at large, who shall assume and perform the duties of such
commissioner or commissioners as may be unable to attend the meet-

REPORT OF 8S. P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1890.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to subwit herewith the report for the
year ending June 30, 1890, of the operations of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and of the work placed by Congress under its charge in the Na-
tional Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the International Exchanges,
and the National Zoological Park.

The National Zoological Park has been formally placed under the
care of the Board of Regents during this year,* although its establish-
ment has been under consideration for some time and the preliminary
steps connected therewith have been referred to in previous reports.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
VYHE ESTABLISHMENT.

By the organizing act ot Congress of August 10, 1846, sec. 1,+ it was
provided that “The President, and Vice-President of the United States,
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, the Attorney-
General, the Chief-Justice, and the Commissioner of the Patent Office
of the United States, and the Mayor of the city of Washington, during
the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, and such other
persons as they may elect honorary members, be, and they are hereby
constituted an ‘establishment’ by the name of the ‘Smithsonian Insti-
tution,’” ete. In the Revised Statutes “the Governor of the District
of Columbia” was substituted for the Mayor of the city of Washing-
ton, the latter office having become extinct.

Two members having been added to the cabinet of the President
since the passage of the act, namely, the Secretary of the Interior, and
more recently the Secretary of Agriculture, there appears no good rea-
son why these should not be included in the list of officers of the estab-
lishment. This would obviously be consonant with the original inten-
tion of the framers of the act, though excluded by the phraseology
actually employed. It may be worthy of consideration of the Board of
Regents whether it would not be for the interests of the Institution to
ask of Congress a re-construction of the section referred to, whereby

*Act of Congress approved April 30, 1890.

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the President, Vice-President, Secretaries of the several Executive
Departments, and the Chief. Justice of the United States shall consti-
tute the Establishment.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The stated annual meeting of the Board was held on January 8, 1890,
at which the resignation of Dr. Noah Porter, presented on account of
failing health, was accepted in the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Board having received the resignation of Dr. Noah
Porter as a Regent accept it with an expression of their regret, and
with assurances of their high personal esteem.

At the same meeting, the appointment by the honorable the Speaker
of the House of Representatives on January 6, 1890, of the following
members of the House as Regents was announced: the Hon. Benjamin
Butterworth, of Ohio, the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts,
the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama.

The death of the Hon. Samuel S. Cox, for many years a Regent of
the Institution, and its earnest friend and supporter, was referred to in
my last annual report. By a resolution of the Board of Regents a com-
mittee was appointed, of which the Secretary was made chairman, to
prepare suitable resolutions on his services and character, and these
formal resolutions, with a brief biographical sketch, are given in full in
the “ necrology ” appended.

The institution is indebted to Mrs. Cox for a portrait of her husband,
to be placed with the collection of portraits of past Regents.

By joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President May 22,
1890, Dr. James C. Welling, whose term as a Regeut had expired, was
re-elected; and by the same resolution Judge Charles Devens, of Mas-
sachusetts, was appointed a member of the Board to succeed Dr. Porter.

I regret to say that Judge Devens has written to me to state that
there is a provision in the constitution of Massachusetts in reference to
judges of its supreme court, which it has been suggested would prevent
any one of them from holding such a position. No action had been taken
in the matter at the time of this report.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the institution remain as at the time of my
last report, namely :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

It seems to me desirable in this connection to direct attention to the
exceptional advantages offered in the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution for the administration of funds intended for the advance-
ment of science and the increase of knowledge throughout the world.
The governing board of the Institution is composed of the highest offi-
cers of the United States Government, associated with some of the most
distinguished men of learning in the country. The United States Gov-
ernment is itself pledged to the security of the funds of the Institution,
guaranteeing an interest of six per cent. annually.

[It is safe to say that no institution of learning is better known
throughout the world, and [I am impressed with the belief that were it
also more widely known that the United States, in accepting the gift of
Smithson, has signified a willingness to become the custodian of further
bequests for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, its permanent
endowment would be constantly increased.

The principal facts in relation to Smithson’s bequest have been stated
in brief in my previous reports and elsewhere at considerable length,
and need not be repeated here.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the in-
come was $11,757.47. Interest on the invested fund, amounting to
$42,180, has been received from the Treasurer of the United States,
$5,000 have been received from the estate of the late Dr. Jerome H.
Kidder, and a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell for the
prosecution of special researches in physics, to which allusion is else-
where made, and $3,905.51 have been received from miscellaneous
sources, making the total receipts $67,842.98.

The total expenditures have been $37,650.33, leaving an unexpended
balance on June 30, 1890, of $30,192.65, or, deducting the donations for
special researches noted above, amounting to $10,000, the balance
available for general expenses on July 1, 1890, was $20,192.65. This
sum, which is somewhat larger than usual, is in part held against cer-
tain anticipated grants in aid of scientific investigation and the cost of
their publication by the Institution.

The Institution has been charged by Congress with the disbursement
during the year of the following special appropriations:

The vouchers for the disbursement of these appropriations, with the
exception of those for “ethnological researches,” have been examined
by the Executive Committee, and the various items of expenditure, in-
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cluding those of the Bureau of Ethnology, are set forth in a letter ad-
dressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in accordance
with a provision of the sundry civil act of October 2, 1888, while the
expenditures from the Smithsonian fund, having likewise been examined
and approved by the executive committee, are given in their report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, forwarded to
the Secretary of the Treasury under date of October 1, 1889, were as
follows:

BUILDINGS.

I regret that Iam unable to report any immediate prospect of relief
from the over-crowded condition of the Museum building. The Re-
gents nearly eight years ago, (at their meeting of January 17, 1883,)
recommended to Congress the erection of a new Museum building, and
the previous steps taken in pursuance of their instruction have already
been laid before the Board. Since 1883, the collections of the Museum
have enormously increased, so that before a new building can now be
completed, the material pressing for display or even for storage, will
demand a considerable part of a building as large as the present one.

Sketch-plans for a building that would meet the wants of the Museum
for the immediate future were laid before the Board at their meeting in
January, 1890. These plans contemplated a building of two stories and
a basement, it being indispensable to have rooms for the preparation and
study of material apart from the rooms used purely for the purposes of
exhibition.

A bill appropriating $500,000 for a building was reported by Sen-
ator Morrill on February 19, 1890, from the Senate Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, and passed the Senate on the 5th of
Apri, 1890. It was referred in the House to its Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, from which it has not as yet been reported.
The following letter in relation to the subject transmitted to the Hon.
Leland Stanford, chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Build-
ings and Grounds, sets forth at some length the urgent need for fur-
ther accommodation:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

[Senate Mis. Doc. No. 116, Fifty-first Congress, first session. ]}

LETTER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN RELATION TO A
BUILDING FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM,
Washington, January 21, 1890.

Sir: I send you herewith a set of sketch-plans intended to show, in
a general way, the extent and character of a building such as would
seem to be necessary for the accommodation of the Museum collections
in the present and immediate future, and respectfully request for them
your attention, and a recommendation to Congress of the necessary
means for such a building.

These plans and sketches are provisional, but although not presented
in detail, they represent the results of studies, extending over many
years, of the plans of the best modern museum buildings in Europe and
America, nearly all of which have been inspected by officers of the
Smithsonian Institution.

The proposed building covers the same area as that finished in 1881.
It is intended to consist of two stories and a basement, except in the
central portion, which consists of one lofty hall open from the main floor
to the roof, the height of which will be 90 feet, galleries being placed
on the level of the second floor in other parts of the building. — Its inte-
rior arrangements are,as you will see, different from those in the actual
Museum, all the changes having been planned in the light of the expe-
rience of nine years’ occupation of the present building. It will afford
between two and three times as much available space for exhibition
and storage under the same area of roof. The fifteen exhibition halls
are completely isolated from each other, and may readily besubdivided,
when uecessary, into smaller rooms. The lighting will be as good as
in the old building, and the ventilation perhaps still better. The sani-
tary arrangements have been carefully considered.

The necessity for a basement is especially great. In this, place has
been provided for many storage rooms and workshops. The existence
of a basement will promote the comfort and health of visitors and em-
ployés, and by increasing the dryness of the air in the exhibition halls,
will secure the better preservation of the collections. These proposed
changes in the internal arrangements will not interfere with conformity
with the other points of the present Museum building in the essential
features of exterior proportion. The total capacity of this present
building in available floor space is about 100,000 square feet; that of
the new building somewhat exceeds 200,000. The present Museum
building contains about 80,000 feet of floor space available for exhibi-
tion. That proposed will contain about 103,300 square feet for exhibi-
tion. The space devoted to offices and laboratories would not be much
more, but the area available for exhibition halls, storage rooms, and
workshops far greater. The appropriation for the construction of the
present building was $250,000. This sum was supplemented by several
special appropriations: $25,000 for steam-heating apparatus ; $26,000
for marble floors ; $12,500 for water and gas fixtures and electrical
apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections, so that the total
cost was $315,400. The structure was probably completed for a smaller
sum of money than any other similar one of equal capacity in the world,
at an expense ralative to capacity which the present prices of material
make it certain cau not be repeated.

The estimates of cost on this building vary greatly with regard to
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

details of construction on which J do not here enter, further than to
say that the whole should be absolutely fire-proof throughout, and in
view of the further great variation of the cost of building materials
within the past two years, I am not prepared to state the sum which
would be necessary for its completion. It is certain, however, that
$500,000, if not sufficient to complete it, wouid be all that would be
required to be expended during the present year, and I would respect-
fully represent the desirability of an appropriation of this amount for the
purpose in question.

Your attention is directed to certain facts in regard to the character
of the materials for the accommodation of which this building is desired.
The collections of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Government
are especially rich in collections of natural history, which may be
grouped in three general classes: The zoological collections; the botan-
ical collections, and the geological collections, including not only all
the geological and mineralogical material, but the greater portion of
that belonging to paleontology, the study of fossil animals and plants
forming an essential part of modern geological work.

Besides the natural history collections, there are equally important
anthropological collections which illustrate the history of mankind at
all periods and in every land, and which serve to explain the develop-
ment of all human arts and industries. In everything that relates to
the primitive inhabitants of North America, Eskimo as well as Indian,
these collections are by far the richest in the world, and with the nec-
essary amount of exhibition space, the material on hand will be arranged
in a manner which will produce the most impressive and magnificent
effect, the educational importance of which can not be over-estimated.
Again, there are collections of considerable extent which illustrate the
processes and products of the various arts and industries, as well as
what are termed the historical collections, which are of especial interest
to a very large number of the visitors of the Museum on account of the
associations of the objects exhibited with the personal history of repre-
sentative men, or with important events in the history of America.

The collections illustrating the arts and the art industries are rela-
tivelysmall, and although in themselves of great interest and value, not
to be compared in importance with those in natural history and eth-
nology.

In a letter addressed on June 7, 1888, to the Hon. Justin 8. Morrill,
and which will be found in a report of June 12 of the same year from
the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, I madeastate-
ment of the rapidity of the recent growth of the Museum, mentioning
that in the five years from 1882 to 1887 the number of specimens in the
collection had multiplied no less than sixteen times, and endeavored to
give an idea, though, perhaps, an inadequate one, of the extent to which
the pressure for want of space was felt. The evil has grown rapidly
worse, and as I have had occasion to mention, it has been felt in the last
year in a partial arrest of the growth of the collections, which empha-
sizes the demand for more room. The present Museum building is not
laige enough even for the natural history collections alone, a number of
which are without any exhibition space whatever. The proposed build-
ing will afford accommodations for the ethnological and technological
material already on hand, and for a large part of the natural history
material also.

The collections are still increasing, and the number of specimens, as
estimated, is now not far from 3,000,000. The appended table (A) shows
the annual increase since 1882. The increase during the last year was
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. c

comparatively small. This may be accounted for by the fact that our
exhibition halls and storage rooms being filled to their utmost capacity,
it has seemed necessary to ceasein a large degree the customary eftorts
for the increase of the Museum.

Unless more space is soon provided, the development of the Govern-
ment collections will of necessity be almost completely arrested.

So long as there was room for storage, collections not immediately re-
quired could be received and packed away for future use. This can not
longer be done.

The Armory Building, since 1877 assigned to the Museum for storage
and workshops, is now entirely occupied by the U.S. Fish Commission,
with the exception of four rooms, and by some of the Museum tax-
idermists, who are now working in very contracted space, and whom it
is impossible to accommodate elsewhere.

Increased space in the exhibition halls is needed, the educational
value of the collections being seriously diminished by the present
crowded system of installation. Still more necessary, however, is room
for storage, for re-arranging the great reserve collections, for eliminating
duplicate material for distribution to college and school museums, and
for the use of the taxidermists and preparators engaged in preparing
objects for exhibition. Space is also required for the proper handling
of the costly outfit of the Museum cases and appliances for installation,
of which there is always a considerable amount temporarily out of use
or in process of construction.

The appended table (B) shows the amount of floor space now assigned
to the various collections and the amount required for the proper dis-
play of material already in hand, making a reasonable allowance for
the expansion during the three years which would probably pass before
a new building could be completed and provided with necessary cases.

The appended table (C) shows the number of feet of floor space (the
average height being 10 feet) required for laboratories, workshops,
and for the several departments. bis is in addition to storage space
under the cases in the exhibition halls, and a considerable portion may
be in cellars and attics.

In summarizing what has just been said, if may be stated in general
terms that the amount of space already required for exhibition pur-
poses alone, being (table B) 207,500 feet as against 100,675 now occupied,
and this being exclusive of the (table C) 108,900 square feet needed for
other objects, the accumulations have now reached such a point of con-
gestion that the actual space needs to be doubled, even independently
of future increase; and I beg to repeat that, unless more space is pro-
vided, the development of the Government collection, which is already
partly arrested, will be almost completely stopped.

Your obedient servant.

In compliance with the requirements of the sundry civil bill approved
March 2, 1889, an examination was made of the National Museum by
the Architect of the Capitol for the purpose of estimating the cost of
constructing a basement story under that building. The only portion
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of suck a basement suitable for workshops and storage would bea cel-
lar running around the outer walls of the building and extending in-
wards 30 feet, so that the rooms thus obtained might have light and
air. Provision was also made to floor with tiles all the rooms under
which these basements come. The total expense it is thought would
be $57,675, but by reason of the peculiar construction of the present
building the Architect has expressed the opinion that the work esti-
mated for would be one of unusual difficulty, and that a site for a store-
house and workshops required might be purchased in the neighborhood
of the Museum and a fire-proof building erected thereon for a less sum.

The improvement of the Smithsonian building proper has been the
subject of careful consideration, more especially the fire-proofing of the
west wing, the urgent need of which has already been brought to the
attention of the Regents. A bill was introduced in the Senate on Jan-
uary 15, 1890, by Senator Morrill, providing for an appropriation of
$45,000 for fire-proofing the roof of the main hall and that of the so-
called chapel in the west wing of the Smithsonian building, putting in
a Sky-light and well-hole for lighting the east wing, and making certain
changes which would add greatly to the space available for office rooms
in that part of the building, as well as adding to the facility with which
the large amount of exchange publications could be handled. This
work was to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol
with the approval of the Regents. The bill passed the Senate on Feb-
ruary 10, 1890, and was favorably reported on in the House March 3,
1890. The matter rested here at the close of the year.

The temporary wooden building for the protection of instruments for
astro-physical investigation, which was referred to as contemplated in
my last report, was begun on November 30, 1889, and was completed
about the Ist of March, 1890. This building is of the most inexpensive
character, and is simply intended to protect the instruments tempora-
rily, though it is also arranged so that certain preliminary work can be
done here. Its position however immediately south of the main Smith-
sonian building, is not well suited to refined physical investigations on
account of its proximity to city streets and its lack of seclusion. The
needs of this department are referred to more at length under the fol-
lowing head of research.

RESEARCH.

I take pleasure in reporting that the Institution has been able to do
rather more for the encouragement of original research than it has
done for several years past.

Referring to my two previous reports in regard to the project of
Professor Baird for securing an astro-physical observatory and labora-
tory, Iam able to say that this object has assumed definite shape in
the construction of the temporary shed, which has just been mentioned.
In this shed there have been built, as the most expensive part of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

structure, a number of brick piers required for the firm support of the
delicate apparatus employed.

In connection with the construction of this building, I desire to ex-
press my thanks to Col. O. H. Ernst, U.S. Army, in charge of public
buildings and grounds, for the supervision rendered by his office of the
work of excavating, etc., for the necessary sewer and water connections.

The principal instrument consists of a siderostat constructed by Sir
Howard Grubb, of Dublin, Ireland, for the Smithsonian Institution, to
meet my special requirements. This arrived in March, 1890, and has been
mounted and put approximately into position for use. Another impor-
tant and novel instrument, a spectro-bolometer, was made under my
directions to meet new and unusual demands, and has also been received
and put in place. <A third piece of apparatus, a special galvanometer,
also designed for the particular class of work in view, has been received ;
and the only considerable instrument now required to complete the out-
fit is a resistance box, which has been ordered and is expected from
London before the end of the calendar year.

The siderostat is probably the largest and most powerful instrument
of its kind ever constructed. The spectro-bolometer is the largest in-
strument of its kind, and with this improved apparatus it is hoped that
interesting investigations begun several years ago, will be continued.

Supplementary to these principal instruments is the Thaw collec-
tion of physical apparatus loaned by the executors of the late Will-
iam Thaw, of Pittsburgh, and there are a few pieces of apparatus, the
personal preperty of the Secretary, so that at the close of the year it
might be said that the Institution was in possession of the nucleus of
a modern astrophysical laboratory. With this apparatus temporarily
mounted, researches have already begun, and one of a scientific and
economic character upon “The Cheapest Form of Light” has been the
subject of a communication to the National Academy of Sciences. This
work is mentioned as indicating my intention to give greater place to
one of the chief objects of the Institution, the direct addition to knowl-
edge by original research,—which, at least as regards the physical
sciences, has received comparatively little attention since the time of
Professor Henry.

The prospects of renewed contributions to physical science by the
Institution in the field of original research are happily now better than
for many years past. The late Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, formerly an offi-
cer of the U. 8S. Navy, and later attached to the U.S. Fish Commission
and to the Smithsonian Institution, had bequeathed to the Institution,
in a will made several years ago, the sum of $10,000 to be employed for
biological researches. Dr. Kidder, having become especially interested
in the proposed astro-physical observatory, had the intention of trans-
ferring this bequest, or at least a portion of it, to such an end, afd he
even ordered that a codicil giving $5,000 to the Institution for an astro-
physical observatory should be added to his will, but he was stricken
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

with so sudden an illness that he was unable to sign it. In view of
these circumstances and after careful deliberation upon the matter, the
Regents decided to accept as finally and decisively indicative of the
wishes of the testator the provisions of this codicil bequeathing $5,000
for the purpose of an astro-physical observatory, and this sum was
therefore paid by Dr. Kidder’s executor to the Institution.

A further sum of $5,000 was likewise generously presented by Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell to the writer individually for the prosecution
of the researches in astro-physies, to which he has devoted much of his
life, but it has seemed proper to him, under the circumstances, that this
sum should be placed to the credit of the Smithsonian Institution upon
the same footing as the Kidder bequest, and with the consent of the
donor it has been so transferred. I am therefore desirous of here ex-
pressing my own personal as well as my official obligation to Dr. Bell
for this gift for the increase of knowledge.

The initial step for the establishment of an astro-physical observa-
tory under the National Government thus having been taken by private
individuals, it is hoped that Congress will see fit to place it upon a firm
footing and to make a small annual provision for its maintenance. And
it seems proper to mention that the field of research to which such a
department of the Institution would be devoted has been considered of
sufficient importance by the legislators of leading foreign nations to
justify the erection of costly special observatories and to provide for
their maintenance with a staff of astronomers and physicists of wide
reputation.

The class of work here specially referred to does not ordinarily in-
volve the use of the telescope, and is quite distinct from that carried
on at any observatory in thiscountry. It would in no way conflict with
the work of the present U. S. Naval Observatory, being in a field of
work that the latter has never entered.

Briefly stated, the work for which the older Government observa-
tories at Greenwich, Paris, Berlin, and Washington were founded, and
in which they are for the most part now engaged, is the determination
of relative positions of heavenly bodies and of our own place with ref-
erence to them. Within the past twenty years, all these Governments
but our own have established astro-physical observatories, as they are
called, that are engaged in the study of the constitution of the heav-
enly bodies as distinguished from their positions; in determining, for
example, not so much the position of the sun in the sky as the rela-
tion that it bears to the earth and to our own daily wants; how it effects
terrestrial climate; and how it may best be studied for the purposes
of the meteorologist, and so on; and it is an observatory of the latter
kind that the donors just mentioned appear to have bad prominently
in View, and which it is proposed to conduct (though on an extremely
modest seale) under the auspices of the Institution.

In connection with this renewed revival in the line of physical re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

search, I may state that steps have been taken to give effect to certain
resolutions expressed at a meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science several years ago, in regard to the establish-
ment of standard screw threads and standard diameters of tubing for
astronomical and physical apparatus. The introduction of such stand-
ards in mechanical work of all kinds has proved itself of such great
value that its usefulness need not be dwelt upon. As a preliminary
step looking to the establishment of this desired uniformity on the part
of scientific men, a conference has been had with the Superintendent of
the Coast Survey, and it is proposed to invite the co-operation of other
Government bureaus, and to give effect to their conclusions by ordering
and establishing, on behalf of the Institution, recognized standards for
the use of scientific instrument makers in all parts of the world.

I have here referred to researches in physical science alone, the work
of the Institution and of individual members of its staff and others in
natural history being given at some length under the head of the Mu-

seum.
EXPLORATIONS.

The work of exploration by the Institution has been carried on through
the Bureau of Ethnology and the National Museum, and to the Reports
of these departments reference should be made for details.

In my report for last year, mention was made of a trip to Africa by
Mr. Talcott Williams, and of the interesting results that had been se-
cured by him. A valuable collection of specimens that he obtained is
still unpacked and a complete description of them can not be given
until they have been thoroughly examined.

He was fortunate enough to secure five sheets of anextremeiy rare Ber-
ber manuscript, made probably in the thirteenth century ; a botanical
collection of about three hundred plants, of which all except four or five
are phenagamons fossils from a hitherto unexplored region; a valuable
collection of ethnographic material from Morocco; villager costumes
of men and women, representing both the Berber and mountain vil-
lages, and a collection of pottery made with the special design of in-
cluding all the wares in ordinary use between Tetuan and Fez. Arti-
cles illustrating light, fire, and the industry of comb-making and num-
erous household utensils were also secured.

It may safely be asserted that this collection, taken as a whole, is one
of the most interesting of the kind that the Museum has ever received,
and the thanks of the Smithsonian Institution are due Mr. Williams for
the manner in which he has accomplished his mission.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, whose explorations in Thibet were also referred
to in ny last report, has spent a large part of the year in Washington,
engaged in preparing an account of his remarkable travels, and he has
loaned to the Museum, in addition to his large and almost unique col-
lection of Thibetan material, a most valuable lot of cloisonnés, bronzes,
and carved lacquers collected during his residence in Pekin.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

I may also mention here collections of unusual interest and value,
made by Dr. W. A. Abbott, in the region of Mount Kilémanjaro,
and of those by Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National Museum,
while attached to the United States Eclipse Expedition to the west
coast of Africa, under the auspices of the Navy Department. Grate-
ful acknowledgments are due Dr. W. H. Rush, U. S. Navy; Mr. J. P.
Iddings, U. S. Geological Survey; Mr. E. M. Aaron, of the American
Entomological Society; Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of San Diego, Cal., from whom
specimens secured in their travels have been received or are expected.
Mr. Henry W. Elliott, who is now visiting the Seal Islands of Alaska on
United States Government business, is expected to secure for the Mu-
seum specimens of fur-seal, fishes, and other zoological material.

In the Bureau of Ethnology I would refer to the mound explorations
that have been conducted under the immediate superintendence of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, by Mr. H. L. Reynolds, Mr. J. D. Middleton, and Mr.
James Mooney; and to the general field work, chiefly among the Indian
tribes, of Mr. W. H. Holmes, Dr. W.J. Hoffman, Mr. Victor Mindeleff, Mr.
James Mooney, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, Mr. J. W. B. Hewitt, and Mrs.
T. E. Stevenson.

PUBLICATIONS.

With regard to the character of the works issued by the Institution
during the past year, little is to be added to the general statements made
in my last report. In each of the three classes of Smithsonian publica-
tions, to wit, I, The Contributions to Knowledge; II, The Miscellaneous
Collections ; and III, The Annual Reports, about the same amount of
productiveness has been maintained.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—An original memoir by Prof.
Alpheus Hyatt on the “ Genesis of the Arietidee,” illustrated with numer-
ous plates, has been published during the year, and this has permitted
the completion of the long-delayed twenty-sixth volume of the quarto
series. Two other memoirs, relating to the solar corona, have been pub-
lished in the same quarto form, but will not probably be included in the
volumes of the ‘“ Contributions.”

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—W hile the number of separate
titles under this class has been considerable, many of them are the
separate issues of articles contributed at the expense of the Institution
to the Annual Reports. It is in contemplation to devote a larger space
in the * Collections” than of late to publications connected with the
physical sciences; in which direction may be mentioned as one of the
more important issues of the year, an ‘ Index to the Literature of Ther-
modynamies,” by Mr. Alfred Tuckerman. The demand for copies of the
exhausted fourth edition of Guyot’s Meteorological and Physical Tables,
published in 1884, has been deemed sufficient to warrant the revision of
the work and the issue of a new edition, which has been for several
years under consideration. After obtaining the views of prominent me-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 15

teorologists the work was placed in the hands of Prof. William Libbey,
jr., of Princeton, New Jersey, with the expectation that the new edi-
tion will be ready for the printer during the coming year.

Among the publications of this series mention may be made of the
tenth “ Toner Lecture,” by Dr. Harrison Allen, on * A Clinical Study
of the Skull.”

A revised catalogue and index of all the Smithsonian publications to
the middle of 1886, occupying 385 pages, prepared by Mr. William J.
Rhees, the chief clerk, has also been published.

No completed volume of the Miscellaneous Collections has been issued
within the year.

Smithsonian Annual Reports.—The annual report of the Regents to
Congress for the year ending June 30, 1887, in two parts or volumes,
has been received from the Public Printer and has been widely dis-
tributed. The annual report for the succeeding year, 1888, although
printed, has not yet been received ; but is daily expected.

A detailed account of the several publications of the Smithsonian
Institution for the year, under each class, will be given in the Appendix.

Other publications.—The publications of the National Museum com-
prise the ‘‘ Proceedings of the National Museum” and the “ Bulletins
of the National Museum,” and are maintained by an appropriation an-
nually made by Congress. As stated in my last report, “It has been
decided to hereafter omit these publications from the series” of Miscel-
laneous Collections issued by the Institution.* Of the publications of
the Bureau of Ethnology the sixth annual report has been issued dur-
ing the year.

The edition of Swan’s paper on “The Indians of Cape Flattery”
having become exhausted, a new edition of 250 copies has been printed.

The Annual Report of the American Historical Association, which by
the act of incorporation the Secretary of the Institution is directed to
communicate to Congress, has been printed as Senate Miscellaneous
Document No. 170.

In October, 1859, final arrangements were made with Prof. Edward
D. Cope, whereby it is expected that his important work upon * Rep-
tilia,” undertaken several years ago at the request of the Secretary,
will be ready for the printer by the end of December, 1890.

Except in the case of the Annual Reports, the publications of the In-
stitution are generally issued with satisfactory promptness. The An-
nual Reports, which have been for some years so seriously behindhand
as to materially affect the value of the reviews upon scientific progress,
are, it is hoped, to be brought up to date during the coming year.

To avoid any possible delay on account of lack of legislation, the at-
tention of the chairman of the Committee on Printing of the United
States Senate has been called to the ny of having the bill pro-

16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

viding for the printing of the Annual Reports so worded as to allow for
the printing of future reports without special legislation each year, at
the some time increasing the number of copies to 19,000. An act of
Congress in the following terms would probably accomplish all that
is desired :

That there be printed of the Reports of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and of the National Museum, for the years ending June thirty,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, and June thirty, eighteen hun-
dred and eighty-nine, and annually thereafter, in two octavo volumes
for each year, nineteen thousand extra copies, of which three thousand
shall be for the use of the Senate, six thousand for the House of Rep-
resentatives, and ten thousand for the Smithsonian. Institution.

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
on January 8, 1890, it was—

Resolved, That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced
from the Smithsonian fund for Governmental service in carrying on
the exchanges.

In connection with this resolution the following outline of the history
of the exchanges is important:

Under the act of Congress accepting a donation from James Smith-
son ‘for the increase and diffusion of knowedge among men,” and
giving effect to this trust by the foundation of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, the Board of Regents in 1851 established a system of interna- .
tional exchanges of the transactions of learned societies and like works ;
but, in addition te such publications, it voluntarily transported between
1851 and 1867 somewhat over 20,000 packages of publications of the
bureaus of the National Government at an estimated cost to the pri-
vate funds of the Institution of about $8,000. This, however, was
understood to be a voluntary service, and no request for i's re imburse.
ment has been made or is contemplated.

Congress, however, in 1867, by its act of March 2, imposed upon the
Institution the duty of exchanging fifty copies of alldocuments printed
by order of either House of Congress, or by the United States Govern-
ment bureaus, for similar works published in foreign countries, and
especially by foreign Governments.

The Institution possessed special facilities and experience for such
work, the propriety of its undertaking which, in the interests of the
Government, is evident; but it was hardly to have been anticipated
that the Government should direct this purely administrative service
and make no appropriation for its support. Such, however, was the
case, and with the exception of a small (presently to be noted) sum,
returned by some bureaus, it was almost entirely maintained during
the next thirteen years, or until the first appropriation to the Institu-
tion for exchanges in 1881, at the expense of the private fund of James
Smithson.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

From January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, 292,483 packages contain-
ing these official Government publications, having little to do with
the object to which Congress devoted the Institution’s private funds
were transported by the Exchange Bureau at a pro rata cost of
$92,943.36 of which $29,706.85 accrued between 18381, when the first
specific appropriation was made, and 1886. Of this $92,943.56 $19,302.35
was returned from various Departments and bureaus, leaving a balance
of $73,641.01 expended in carrying exclusively Governmental publica-
tions.

What has preceded refers to the transportation of official documents,
and not to that of transactions of learnéd societies and other like works;
but it is now necessary to mention that in 1878 the honorable the Sec-
retary of State designated the Smithsonian Institution as the special
agent for the United States Government for carrying out the provisions
of an international convention at Paris, which made the respective
Governments assume the cost, not only of the transportation of official
documents, but of scientific and literary publications, between the
states interested, and it would seem that Congress itself adopted this
view of its responsibility, for from July 1, 1881, to June 30, 1886, while
the Congressional and bureaucratic exchange represented a pro rata cost
of $29,706.85 and the scientific publications $39,034.90, Congress ap-
propriated directly $35,500, somewhat more than the cost of the Govern-
ment exchange, but leaving a balance of $3,534.90 for scientific and
literary exchanges unpaid. This latter sum, $3,534.90, added to the
$73,641.01 mentioned above, makes a total of $77,175.91, for which, in
equity, repayment might be requested.

In 1886, on the 15th of March, plenipotentiaries of the United States
and various other nationalities signed a convention more formal than
that at Paris, by which the respective Governments definitely assumed
the exchange of official documents and scientilic and literary publica-
tions between the states interested.

Adopting, then, the year 18385, rather than the earlier date, 1881
(though, as mentioned in the report, equity would seem to allow the
Institution the entire sum expended in exchanges, at least since its
official recognition by Congress in 1881 as the Government exchange
agent), it appears upon deducting the amount appropriated by Con-
gress, $35,500, from the balance shown ip the preceding paragraph,
$73,641.01, that we have $38,141.01 as the amouut due the private fund
of James Smithson from 1868 to 1856.

Considering separately the period from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889,
we find that the amount expended in these years under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution on account of international exchanges was
$47,126.56; of this sum $37,000 was paid by Congressional appropria-
tions, $3,091.75 were paid by Government departments and others, and

the balance, $7,034.81, by the Smithsonian Institution.
' To recapitulate briefly it appears, then, that the following sums have
‘H. Mis, 129——2

$
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been expended from the Smithsonian funds for the support of the inter-
national exchange system in the interests and by the authority of the
National Government, namely, $38,141.01 in excess of appropriations
advanced from January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, for the exchange of
official Government documents, and $7,034.81 in excess of appropriations
from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889, advanced for the purpose of carry-
ing out a convention entered into by the United States, or an aggregate
of $45,175.82. |

A memorandum setting forth the above facts and requesting that
steps be taken to procure the return to the Smithsonian fund by Con-
egress of the sum last mentioned ($45,175.82) was transmitted on the
20th of May, 1890, to the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, ot the Board of
Regents, to be laid by the latter before Congress in due form.

The exchange work has shown the usual increase, no less than 82,572
packages having been handled during the year, or 6,606 more than
during the year immediately preceding. The number of societies and
individuals for which exchange accounts are kept is now 16,002.

The actual cost of the exchanges for the fiscal year, taking in ac-
count bills rendered and moneys received up to September 21, 1890,
for services rendered between July 1, 1889, and June 30, 1890, was
$17,401.23. Of this sum $15,000 were appropriated directly by Con-
gress, $1,986.14 were repaid by several Government bureaus to which
appropriations had been made for the purpose, $28.40 was received
from State institutions and other sources, leaving a deficiency of
$386.69, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

In my report for last year I had the honor to submit detailed esti-
mates showing the necessity of larger appropriations by Congress if
the Exchange Bureau is to be placed upon a satisfactory footing.

The chief increase in outlay would be to secure a more prompt service
and to increase the number of exchanges that are received for the Li-
brary of Congress, in return for the Government exchanges sent
abroad. Itis probable that the number of the latter would be largely
increased if special efforts were made to that end.

An improvement in the promptness of transmission to Europe has
taken place within the last few years, but packages are still unduly de-
layed by reason of the fact that we are not able to pay for rapid trans-
mission. The exchange boxes go by slow freight and we are in most
instances dependent upon the courtesy of the steam-ship companies for
free freight. The greater number of the publications now transmitted
are for the benefit of the Government and it seems unjust to continue
to make use of such privileges originally granted in the interests of
of science. The entire sum asked for was $27,500.

Our exchange relations with foreign Governments have undergone
no material change on account of the treaty at Brussels proclaimed
January 15, 1889, to which allusion has been made in previous reports.

In order to carry out in good faith, as far as our own country is con-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. £9

cerned, the convention relating to the immediate exchange of parlia-
mentary journals, a communication was directed to the honorable the
Secretary of State under date of December 12, 1889, stating the neces-
sity of procuring from Congress an appropriation of about $2,000 to meet
the expenses of transmitting abroad copies of the Congressional Record
and other published documents pertaining to the daily routine of Con-
gress; and a joint resolution introduced at the instance of the honorable
the Secretary of State was promptly passed by the Senate, appropriating
the sum named, $2,000. I regret, however, that at the close of the fiscal
year no action had been taken in the matter by the House of Repre-
sentatives, and in consequence no attempt has been made to give effect
to the treaty.

Tables showing in detail the transactions of the year will be found in
the report of the curator of exchanges appended hereto.

The progress of work on the new exchange list is mentioned under the
head of the library.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library have been recorded and cared for as dur-
ing the last fiscal year.

The following statement shows the number of books, maps, and charts
received from July 1, 1889, to June 30, 1890:

Of these accessions, 8,695 (namely, 785 volumes, 6,900 parts of volumes,
and 1,010 pamphlets) were retained for use at the National Museum
library, and 1,059 medical dissertations were deposited in the library of
the Surgeon-General, U.S. Army; the remainder were promptly sent
to the Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt.

The reading room is now almost filled with periodicals. There are
at present displayed the current volumes of 468 journals. The con-
struction of shelves above the cases in the reading room has rendered
it practicable to withdraw from the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress the complete series of the large quarto Transactions or
Memoirs of most of the great European academies; the Librarian of
Congress kindly giving every facility for this transfer.*

* The publications now deposited in the reading-room are as follows: The ‘‘ Hand-
lingar” of the Royal Swedish Academy; Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh; Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy; ‘“Skrifter” of the Royal Danish
Society of Sciences; ‘“ Deukschriften” of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Vienna;
Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy ; ‘‘ Atti” of the two Academies of the Lincei
at Rome, the royal and the pontifical; Nova Acta Academiw Cwsarew Leopoldino-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In my last report, I referred to the commencement of the work of
increasing the library by exchanges. This work has now been carried
on for a year with fairly promising results.

The labor of assigning the different journals recommended as desira-
ble to the four classes mentioned in my last report—namely, (1) journals
which receive no Smithsonian publications, and which are not to be
found in the library of the Institution; (2) journals which receive
Smithsonian publications, but which make either no return or an inad-
equate return for these; (3) journals which regularly exchange with
the Institution, but of which the files in the library are for any reason
defective; (4) journals which regularly exchange with the Institution,
and of which the library possesses a complete file—occupied the time
until January 18, 1890. The writing of letters asking for exchange or
calling attention to deficiencies was then commenced systematically.

Up to the close of the fiscal year, 1,601 such letters had been written.
In response to these letters, 201 new exchanges were received and 360
defective series were completed, either wholly or as far as the missing
parts were still in print.

A list of the new exchanges is presented in the Appendix (Report of
the Librarian) where will also be found a list of. the most important
accessions outside of the regular serials.

The work of re-organization of the library under the regulations which
I had prepared upon my appointment as Assistant Secretary, and de-
scribed at some length in my report for the years 1887-’88, has been
efficiently carried out by the librarian, Mr. Murdoch. I may also men-
tion that a plan is under consideration for the further extension of the
usefulness of the library, by establishing as a part of it a collection of
books on general literature for the use of the employés of the Institu-
tion and its dependencies, although in its present location its growth is
impeded for lack of room, owing to the pressing demands of the Gov-
ernment business in the Exchange Bureau.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Statue of Professor Baird.—I desire to call the attention of the Re-
gents to the fact that the bill introduced in the Senate and passed by
that body on February 10, 1888, making an appropriation for the erec-
tion of a bronze statue in recognition of the distinguished services to
the country of the late Professor Baird, has failed to reach final action
by Congress. I earnestly hope that steps will be taken to secure for
this measure the attention it merits, and I continue to give it my per-
sonal care.

Grants in aid of the physical sciences—In accordance with an early
established precedent, though one of late in disuse, some small grants,

Caroline Germanice Nature Curiosorum; ‘‘ Abhandlungen” of the Berlin Academy;
‘‘Nova Acta” of the Academy of Upsala. In addition to these the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society, and the ‘‘ Comptes-Rendus” of the French Aca
demy of Sciences have been deposited in the office of the editor,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ret

from the Smithonian fund, commensurate rather with the abilities of
the Institution than with its wishes, have been made this year to aid
in physical science in addition to the aid so largely given to bioloigeal
and ethnological science through the Museum, Bureau of Ethnology,
and Zoological Park.

The subscription of twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal,
which are distributed abroad as exchanges of the Institution, has been
continued.

To the Lick Observatory, through its director, Professor Holden, a
small grant has been made for the purchase of photographic plates
and apparatus to be used in securing photographs of the moon, and es-
pecially of certain regions on a large scaie, the results of the work be-
ing available for publication by the Institution.

Aid has also been promised Prof. Albert A. Michelson, of Clark
University, Worcester, Mass., in his important investigations for the
determination of a standard of length that shall depend upon the length
of a wave of light.

A small grant has been made to Mr. F. A. Seely, of the United States
Patent Office, for the purchase of certain objects of archeological in-
terest, during the course of a contemplated journey in Spain.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—A. room in the basement,
which is specially suited for delicate physical measurements, on account
of its freedom from tremor, has been continued at the disposal of the
U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for pendulum experiments, and two
office rooms have also been assigned to the temporary use of the
Zoological Park Commission. The Regents’ room, in the south tower,
was granted for a meeting of the American members of the committee
on the * International Standards for Iron and Steel” on February 19,
1890.

Facilities for study in the Museum have been accorded to a number
of students, as stated in describing the Museum work, and under special
conditions instruction has been given in taxidermy and photography.
The lecture hall in the Museum has been used by authority of the Exec-
utive Committee for the meetings of the National Academy and other
scientific organizations and for the Saturday lecture courses.

Toner lecture fund.—This fund, which hasan estimated value of about
$3,000, is in the care of a board of trustees, of which the secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution is ex officio chairman. No lecture has been
delivered this year under the auspices of this fund. The lecture de-
livered by Dr. Harrison Allen, on May 29, 1889, on the “Clinical Study
of the Skull,” has been printed.

American Historical Association.—A bill to incorporate the Ameri-
can Historical Association, which provided that the Association should
report annually to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and that
the Secretary should communicate to Congress the whole of such re-
ports, or such portion thereof as he might see fit, finally became a law
on January 4, 1889.
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In December, 1889, the annual meeting of the Association took place
in Washington, the morning session being held in the lecture hall of
the National Museum and the evening session in the Columbian Univer-
ity. The proceedings of this meeting are printed in the annual report
of the association, which, in accordance with the provisions cited above,
was submitted to me on January 14, 1890, and on June 18 was commu-
nicated to Congress and ordered to be printed as Senate Miscellaneous
Document No. 170. This report included, in addition to the proceed-
ings of the annual meeting, a number of historical papers of a high
order. :

The provision by which the Regents are authorized to permit the
deposit of the collections, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and other
historical material of the Association, has been met as well as our pres-
ent accommodations will admit, and in making an estimate for repairs
to the Smithsonian buildings arrangements were made for a suitable
and safe place in which such valuable records might be stored.

Bureau of fine arts.—The desirability of having in connection with
the Government a suitable depository of works of art has presented
itself so forcibly to Members of Congress, and without suggestion on
the part of the Regents, that a bill was introduced in the Senate by the
Hon. Wilkinson Call, on December 4, 1889, providing for the establish-
ment of a bureau of fine arts in the Smithsonian Institution. This was
referred to the Committee on the Library, but has not been reported.

The wording of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That there be, and is hereby,
created in the Smithsonian Institution a bureau called the Bureau
of the Fine Arts, the management of which is entrusted to the See-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Src. 2. That the purpose and duties of this bureau shall be to aid
in the development of the fine arts in the several States and Territories
of the United States, by the re-production, for the use of art schools and
academies, of casts of statuary and other objects used in giving instrue-
tion in art; by preparing and distributing plans for the construction of
buildings and the adaptation of rooms suitable for use as art schools,
with printed plans for the organization of various grades of art acad-
emies and classes; by causing to be held annually in Washington, Dis-
trict of Columbia, a public exhibition of works of art, open to all desir-
ing to exhibit, in which the fairest possible opportunity for exposition
shall be afforded all contributors; and by the publication of an annual
register containing an account of new discoveries, inventions and meth-
ods of instruction useful to students of art, together with a report of
the progress of the fine arts in the United States.

Sxc. 3. That the re-productions and publications of the bureau shall
be distributed amoung institutions of art, under such regulations as the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution may establish.

Sno. 4. That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution shall pro-
vide suitable quarters for the holding of the annual art exhibition.

SEC. 5. That for the purpose of carrying on the operations of this
bureau there be and is hereby appropriatedy for the fiscal year begin-

ning July 1st, eighteen hundred and eighty- , the sum of

dollars, to be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury out of any moneys”
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and expended under the
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Capron collection of Japanese works of art.—A_ bill appropriating
$14,675, introduced by the Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees on December 4,
1889, was referred to the Committee on the Library, was reported favor-
ably, and passed the Senate on March 29, 1890. It was also, on May
19, 1890, reported favorably by the House Committee, but was not
reached on the calendar at the close of the year.

The World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1892.—The act of Con.
gress approved April 25, 1890, which provides for celebrating the four
hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus, by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries,
manufactures, and the product of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of
Chicago, states in section 16:

That there shall be exhibited at said exposition by the Government
of the United States, from its Executive Departments, the Smithsonian
Institution, the United States Fish Commission, and the National
Museum, such articles and materials as illustrate the function and
administrative faculty of the Government in time of peace and its
resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our insti-
tutions and their adaptation to the wants of the people; and to secure
a complete and harmonious arrangement of such a Government ex-
hibit, a board shall be created to be charged with the selection, prep-
aration, arrangement, safe-keeping, and exhibition of such articles
and materials as the heads of the several Departments and the direc-
tors of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum may respect-
ively decide shall be embraced in said Government exhibit. The Pres.
ident may also designate additionai articles for exhibition. Such board
shall be composed of one person to be named by the bead of each
Executive Department, and one by the directors of the Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum, and one by the Fish Commission, such
selection to be approved by the President of the United States. The
President shall name the chairman of said board, and the board itself
shall select such other officers as it may deem necessary.

Under the authority conveyed by this act I have designated as the
representative upon this board of the Smithsonian Institution and Na-
tional Museum, the assistant secretary of the Institution, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, who has already devoted considerable time to the subject of the
proposed exposition in addition to his other official duties.

In connection with this requirement that an exhibit shall be made
by the National Museum, I beg leave to recur to the fact that it has
been the experience in connection with previous expositions on a smaller
scale, that the routine work of the Institution is seriously interfered
with by thus throwing upon its regular employés the great burden in-
volved in the preparation, packing, and displaying of Museum mate-
rial without adequate assistance by an increased appropriation during
this time of unusual effort. The impairment of specimens by frequent
transportation should also be borne in mind, and in justice to our per-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

manent exhibits provision should be made for repairing any damage
incurred.

Stereotype plates.—All the stereotype plates belonging to the Institu-
tion are now stored in the basement of the building, and some progress
has been made in examining, re-arranging, and where the boxes have
become worn out, in re-packing plates. Owing to the limited amount
of time that can be devoted to this work, however, it will be some months
before they can be put in a thoroughly satisfactory condition for ready
reference.

A request from Messrs. Lee & Shepard, of Boston, for the use of
plates from Professor Hyatt’s “Genesis of the Arietide” has been cheer-
fully complied with.

OCorrespondence.—I have given much attention to the improvement of
the methods of handling the correspondence of the Institution, which is
constantly growing and has already assumed very considerable propor-
tions. A simple but effective means of recording letters, showing ata
glance, what letters remain unanswered each week, has been intro-
duced, and as a result few letters remain long without reply.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the character of the cor-
respondence, except such as relates to business routine, is quite differ-
ent from that of Government bureaus. Constant inquiries are made
from all parts of the country for information on almost every conceiva-
ble topic, and requests for statistics and for information on the most
varying scientific subjects. It is intended that all of these inquiries
should receive acknowledgment, and,wherever possible, that the infor-
mation desired should be sent, thoughin many cases it requires an amount
of time and labor on the part of curators and other officers of the Insti-
tution wholly out of proportion to the merits of the case.

As properly coming under the head of ‘“ diffusion of knowledge,” it
does not seem proper to neglect such inquiries, and it is intended to give
encouragement and advice wherever possible to all interested in the ob-
jects of the Institution.

The course taken by an incoming letter is now as follows: The
mail is opened each morning in the chief clerk’s office, and all letters
addressed to the secretary or the Institution, with the exception of
those on printed forms, purely routine matters, and applications for
Museum publications, are placed on the secretary’s desk at 10 o’clock,
together with letters for signature. Having been acted upon, the
date stamp of the secretary’s office is affixed to each communication
and the letter is then returned to the chief clerk’s office. Should
the secretary have written in his own hand the name of any em-
ployé or officer of the Institution upon a letter, such action means
that tbe letter is to be referred to the person named, who is expected:
to prepare a reply thereto for the secretary’s signature.

The one exception to this rule is when the secretary refers a letter to
the assistant secretary, who exercises his discretion as to whether the

ee ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

letter should be answered at all or not, and if so, whether he or the
secretary should sign the reply.

In case no comment has been made by the secretary, the disposition
of the letters is left to the chief clerk, who assigns them to the officers
or clerks having in charge the matter treated of. The letters are then
sent to the registry clerk, who affixes the registry number and records
the letter in a book suitably ruled with the following columns:

1. Registry number of letter. . By whom referred.

2. Name of writer. 8. When referred.

3. Address. 9, Date of answer, or indication no an-
4. When written. | swer required.

5. When received. . | 10, Synopsis of contents.

6. To whom referred.

A special form is sent with letters referred to the Museum, by means

of which an accurate record of the disposition of the letter may be kept,
and a similar form is used for letters referred to employeés of the Smith-
sonian Institution proper.
- The object of this system is, as above stated, to insure that each let-
ter requiring an answer Shall receive it with all attainable promptness,
or that a record shall be made of the fact that no answer is required,
and, as a rule, it is believed that letters are now being answered on the
day after receipt, except in the case of the somewhat numerous class
referred to, upon which the report of an expert is first necessary. In
the latter case, a limit of six days has been fixed upon from the date
of receipt in which to answer ordinary routine letters. A report is
rendered each week of the letters that are then unanswered. This
system, while entailing some additional labor, appears to be fully
justified by the results.

Representative relations.—In response to an invitation from Dr. Henry
Schliemann, forwarded through the Department of State, to designate
a representative of the Smithsonian Institution to participate in an
International Conference, held on the ruins of ancient Troy during the
latter part of March, 1890, Dr. Charles Waldstein, director of the
American School of Classical Studies at Athens, was requested to act
as representative of the Institution, and he has most kindly complied
with this request, transmitting an interesting report of the proceed-
ings of the Conference.

Prof. H. Carrington Bolton courteously represented the Institution at
the installation of Dr. Low as president of Columbia College, New York,
on February 3, 1890.

Prof. Otis T. Mason was appointed as the representative of the Insti-
tution upon a joint board composed of delegates from different bureaus
of the Government interested in the subject to consider and decide
questions of geographical orthography and nomenclature. This board
met for organization at the office of the Superintendent of the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey on the 18th of March, and its work is one
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

that has already proved to be of great value to the Government and to
others interested in geographical matters.

I take occasion to express to the Director of the Mint, the Hon. E. O.
Leech, my acknowledgments for his kindness in having prepared an
intaglio head of the late Professor Henry for certain official correspond-
ence,—an excellent work of art.

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The operations of the National Museum are fully described in the
separate Report of the Assistant Secretary, in which are included (1)
the report of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum ; (2)
the reports of the curators of the scientific departments of the Muse-

um; (3) Special papers based upon and illustrative of collections in the -

Museum; (4) bibliography of the publications of the Museum and of
papers published by Museum officers and other collaborators; (5) a
list of the accessions to the Museum during the year.

Increase of the Museum collections.—A small number of specimens were
purchased during the year. The necessity of expending a considerable
sum of money in the purchase of new material becomes every year more
apparent. The donations of friends of the Museum are to a large ex-
tent miscellaneous in character, and they frequently duplicate, rather
than enlarge and complete, the various series of objects already in the
collections. The Museum has now reached a point where the complete
presentation of subjects by means of full suites of specimens is of the
highest importance, and this can be accomplished only by purchase.

The increase in the number of accessions during the year has been
less than in tke preceding year by nearly 200 numbers. This is not
surprising, since no special efforts have been made to secure new
material, excepting in certain directions, in which the completion of
special series of objects was desired, in view of the crowded condition
of both the storage and exhibition space. This matter has repeatedly
been referred to in the more recent reports of the Institution and of the
Museum, and efforts have been made to obtain an appropriation from
Congress for the construction of a new Museum building. The Senate
has acted favorably in regard to the matter, but its action has not
received the support of the House of Representatives.

The contributions during the year, althougb less in number than in
the previous year, are, taken as a whole, equal in importance. Espe-
cially is this true in the case of material acquired from foreign countries,
and of collections received through the assistance of the Departments
and Bureaus of the Government.

The extent and character of the accessions during the year and each
year since 1881 is shown in the appended table. The total uamber of
specimens received during the year covered by this report is estimated
at 81,992. :

This is explained by the apparent absence of any

increase in the Departments of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart
ments combined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, ow!ng to the rejection of worthless material.

3 Although about two hundred specimens have been received during the year, the total number of
specimens in the collection is now less than that estimated for 1889, owing to the rejection of worth-

less material.

4 The collection now contains between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens.

) These numbers have reference ouly to specimens received through the Museum, and do not include
specimens received for the National Herbarium through the Department of Agriculture.

* Collections combined in October, 1889, under Department of Geology. The apparent decrease of
more than 50 per cent. of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by the rejection of several
thousands of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the specimens
in the reserve and duplicate series is included. Of the total fur 1890, about 16,000 specimens consist
chiefly of petrographical material stored away for study and comparison in the drawers of table cases.

3 Transferred to the National Zoological Park.

Catalogue entries.—The number of entries made in the catalogue of
the several departments of the Museum during the year is 28,293.

The number of boxes and packages recorded by the registrar as having
been received during the year, and entered upon the transportation
record of the Smithsonian Institution, is 52,079. Of this number 827
contained specimens for the Museum. Although the total number of
packages received is more than three times as great as that for last
year, the number of packages containing specimens for the Museum is
only a little more than one-third of the number received during 1889.

Co-operation of the Departments of Government.—The friendly interest
displayed in the work of the National Museum by officers of the De-
partments of the Government has been continued. In no previous year
has the Museum had occasion to acknowledge more gratefully the cour.
teous assistance rendered by the Secretaries of the Departments and
the chiefs of many of the Bureaus.

Through the medium of the Department of State, several United
States ministers and consuls have brought their influence to bear in
obtaining for the Museum representations of the fauna and flora of the
regions in which they are residing.

The Secretary of the Treasury has extended the usual courtesies in
connection with the free entry of specimens. Special facilities have
been afforded in connection with the visit of Mr. Henry W. Elliott to
the Seal Islands of Alaska, which, it is hoped, will result in the addition
of several specimens of fur-seal, fishes, and other natural-history objects
to the collections. The Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Revenue Ma-
rine Division, the Life-Saving Service, and the Light-House Board have
assisted collectors for the Museum in special ways.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

Several officers of the U.S. Army have made valuable contributions.
The Quartermaster’s Department has extended important assistance in
connection with the transportation of bulky material for the Museum.

Froin officers of the U.S. Navy many collections have been received
from foreign countries, including the West Indies, Liberia, the Samoan
Islands, and Mexico.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Interior, the Museum
has received a very valuable collection of ethnological specimens from
the Indians of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington. The material
transmitted to the Museum by the U.S. Geological Survey is large in
extent and quite equal in importance to the collections received from
that source in previous years.

From the Divisions of Animal Industry, Entomology, Botany, For-
estry, and Ornithology and Mammalogy, in the Department of Agricul-
ture, numerous contributions have been received.

Distribution of Duplicate Specimens.—Collections of ethnological, zoo-
logical, botanical, and geological specimens, contained in two hundred
and one packages, have been distributed during the year to about one
hundred and twenty educational establishments at home and abroad.
A large number of duplicate sets of minerals and marine invertebrates
were included in these distributions.

Numerous applications for duplicate specimens, chiefly minerals, still
remain unfilled. It is hoped that during the next fiscal year it will be
possible to send out bird-skins and rocks also.

Museum Publications.—This department of the Museum work has
been unusually active during the year.

The Museum Reports for 1886 and 1887 have been published. Hach
of these volumes contains several papers based upon collections in the
Museum by Museum officers and other collaborators.

Volume XI of the Proceedings of the National Museum, for 1888, has
been issued. This contains xi+703 pages, 60 plates, and 122 text fig-
ures. It includes eighty-five papers by forty-three authors, nineteen
of whom are officers of the Museum. The papers composing Volume
XII of Proceedings of the National Museum, for 1889, are twenty-nine
in number (Nos. 761-789); and were all published as separates dur-
ing the year, although the bound volume has not yet been issued.
Commencing with this volume the system of issuing sixteen pages at
a time—forming a signature—as soon as sufficient manuseript had
accumulated, has been discontinued. Each paper is now printed separ-
ately, in advance of the bound volume, and is immediately distributed
to specialists.

Five numbers of the Bulletin have been published (Nos. 34-38, inclu-
sive). Bulletin 34 relates to “The Batrachia of North America,” by
Prof. E. D. Cope. Bulletin 35 contains a “ Bibliographical Catalogue
of the Described Transformations of North American Lepidoptera,” by
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. Henry Edwards. Bulletin 36 is entitled “Contributions to the
Natural History of the Cetaceans, A Review of the Family Delphinide,”
by Mr. Frederick W. True. Bulletin 38 has the title: ‘‘Contribution
toward a Monograph of the Insects of the Lepidopterous family Noce-
tuide of Temperate North America,” and is a revision of the species
of the genus Agrotis. This Bulletin, by Mr. John B. Smith, of Rutgers
College, New Jersey, was not actually published until after the close of
the fiscal year, although it was put in type during the year covered by
this report. The manuscript for other Bulletins relating to deep-sea
fishes, by Drs. G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, and to a descrip-
tion of the metallurgical collection in the Museum, by Mr. Fred P. Dewey,
has been transmitted to the Government Printing Office.

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects have been pub-
lished by officers of the Museum and other specialists. They are re-
ferred to in the bibliography of Museum publications, constituting See-
tion Iv of the separate report of the Assistant Secretary.

Assistance to students.—The usual facilities have been granted to stu-
dents in the various branches of natural history, and several collections
have been lent to specialists for comparison and study. Dr. R. W. Shu-
feldt, U. S. Army, requested permission to study bird-skeletons. Mr.
Bashford Dean, of the College of the City of New York, received fishes
for study; a collection of bats from the British Museum was furnished
to Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia, for comparison and study; a part
of the Museum collection of Coleoptera was sent for a similar purpose to
Capt. T. L. Casey, of New York City. Several persons have received
instruction in taxidermy and photography.

Special researches.—Several of the curators in the Museum are pre-
paring for publication in the Museum Report for 1890 papers which are
the result of special investigation and research. Among these may be
mentioned a hand-book of the geological collections, by Mr. George P.
Merrill; a descriptive paper relating to the collection of humming-birds
in the Museum, by Mr. Robert Ridgway; papers relating to Japanese
religion and Japanese burials, by Mr. Romyn Hitehcock. Other gen.
tlemen, not officially connected with the Museum, have also prepared
papers for publication in the same volume.

The Museum Report each year contains a number of descriptive
papers of the kind alluded to, and the interest which they have excited
among all classes of people has been very great. During this year sev-
eral hundred copies of papers of this character, printed in the more re-
cently published reports of the Museum, have been distributed free of
cost. Among these may be especially noted the ‘** Hand-Book and Cata-
logue of the Building and Ornamental Stones in the National Museum,”
by Mr. George P. Merrill,* and the paper entitled ‘* The Extermination
of the American Bison,” by Mr. William T. Hornaday.”+

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

Museum library.—The number of publications added to the Library
during the year is 12,437, of which 1,479 are volumes of more than 100
pages, 2,250 pamphlets, 8,672 parts of regular serials, and 36 charts.
With the exception of the charts these numbers are more than double
the receipts of last year. The most notable gift was a nearly complete
set of Kiener’s ‘‘ Iconographie des Coquilles Vivantes,” illustrated with
very beautifully colored plates. This was presented by the Wagner
Free Institute of Science, in Philadelphia.

Museum labels.—During the year 3,920 forms of labels have been
printed (twenty-four copies of each form) for use in connection with
labeling the collections of ethnology, geology, mammals, comparative
anatomy, porcelains, oriental antiquities, graphic arts, foods, textiles,
and materia medica.

Meetings and lectures.—The use of the Lecture Hall has been granted
for lectures and meetings of scientific societies, as The Association of
American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, November
12-15, 1889, inclusive; the American Historical Association, December
28-31; the American Institute of Mining Engineers, February 18, 1890;
Memorial Meeting of the Academy of Sciences, March 27; the Geological
Society of America, April 17; the National Academy of Sciences, April
15-18, inclusive; Meeting of the Committee on Arrangements of the
Geological Congress, April 18; The National Geographic Society, May 2.

The course of Saturday lectures, ten in number, beginning February
1, and ending April 3, was delivered under the direction of the joint
committee of the scientific societies of Washington. A course of four
lectures relating to the anthropological exhibits at the Paris Exposi-
tion in 1889 was given in May by Mr. Thomas Wilson, curator of ar-
cheology. A lecture, under the auspices of the National Geographic
Society, was delivered on April 11 by Ensign J. B. Bernadou on the
subject of ‘* Corea and the Coreans.”

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building during the
year ending June 30, 1890, was 274,524. The number of visitors to the
Smithsonian building during the same period was 120,894. These fig-
ures are considerably less than during 1889, when, on account of the
inauguration of President Harrison, immense numbers of people visited
the Museum. On March 5, it may be remembered, more than 56,000
people visited the Museum and Smithsonian buildings. The total num-
ber of visitors since 1381 to the Museum building is 2,111,949, and to the
Smithsonian building, 970,012.

EHextension of hours for visiting the Museum.—On December 20 a bili
was introduced in the House of Representatives by the Hon. W. H.
Crain, having for its object the opening of the Smithsonian and Museum
buildings during extra hours. Mr, Crain also introduced a bill later in
“32, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the session to provide an electric plant for lighting the buildings.
Neither of these bills has been reported from the committees to which
they were referred.

Museum personnel.—Mr. George P. Merrill has been appointed Curator
of the Department of Geology, which combines the functions of the
previously existing departments of Lithology and Physical Geology,
and of Metallurgy. This change in the administration of these depart-
ments was made upon the resignation of Mr. Fred P. Dewey, who for
several years had been in charge of the metallurgical collections.

Mr. William ©. Winlock, of the Smithsonian Institution, was appointed
Honorary Curator of the Section of Physical Apparatus in the National
Museum.

Mr. William T. Hornaday, perhaps the first taxidermist in the coun-
try, through his extensive knowledge of the habits and natural atti-
tudes of animals, in a very wide range of travel as a field naturalist,
has elevated the standard of his art by the fidelity of his groupings and
his skill in the representation of life-like aspects in the plastic form.
He had rendered valuable service to the National Museum as its chief
taxidermist, and subsequently as Honorary Curator of the Department
of Living Animals, which led to his appointment as Acting Superinten-
dent of the National Zoological Park. From this position he resigned
on the 15th of June last.

Dr. Frank Baker was, in June, appointed Honorary Curator of the
Department of Comparative Anatomy in the Museum, though as it
has been found necessary to assign Dr. Baker to temporary duty as
Acting Manager of the National Zoological Park, Mr. F. W. True con-
tinues to fill the position of acting curator of that department.

A detailed statement relating to the work of the administrative offi-
cers of the Museum will be found in the volume containing the report
of the Assistant Secretary.

Explorations.—In connection with the expedition sent by the United
States Government to the West Coast of Africa to take observations of
the eclipse of the sun, the National Museum obtained the privilege of
sending a naturalist for the purpose of making collections of ethnological
and zoological objects. Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National
Museum, was detailed to accompany the expedition. Early in June,
1890, the first collections were received as the result of his explorations.
They included mammals, fishes, insects, plants, reptiles, birds, shells,
rocks, and ethnological objects. Additicnal collections will doubtless
soou be received; and will be referred to in the next report. As an
outcome of Mr. Brown’s exploration work, collections have been re-
ceived from Rev. G. H. R. Fisk, Mr. J. H. Brady, Mr. P.-MacOwan,
director of the Botanical Garden at Cape Town, Mr. Frye, of Cape Town,
and others, The thanks of the Smithsonian Institution are especially

due to several of the officers and sailors of the U.S. 8. Pensacola for
assistance rendered Mr. Brown in his work.

Dr. W. H. Rush, U.S. Navy, has kindly offered to collect marine in-
vertebrates during his expedition to the Azores, Madeira, and the En-

Mr. J. P. Iddings, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has expressed his
willingness to bear in mind the requests of the Museum during his ex-
pedition to the volcanic regions of Europe.

Mr. E. M. Aaron, of the American Entomological Society, has kindly
offered to be of service to the Museum in collecting entomological ma-

allow the Museuin to share the results of his expedition.

Mr. Henry W. Elliott, formerly of the Alaska Commercial Company,
is visiting the Seal Islands of Alaska on business connected with the
United States Government, and hopes to be able to secure for the Mu-

ical material.

Department of living animals.—Upon the passage of the bill placing
the National Zoological Park under the care of the Board of Regents,
the department of living animals of the Museum was merged in the
new park and the necessary transfers were made from the Museum
rolls. For convenience, therefore, the report in regard to the principal
accessions to this department have been included in the report of the
acting manager of the Park.

The animals are retained for the present in their sheds in the Smith-
sonian Grounds for the reason that during the fitting up of the Park
they can there be cared for at a much less expense; for instance, two
watchmen are now required instead of twenty that would probably be
needed at the Park, where each group of animals will be placed in a
center from which to grow, a plan that involves the necessity at first
of spreading the collection over a considerable area.

The interest in this small collection has constantly inereased, and
has been manifested by numerous offers of valuable gifts, most of which
it has been impossible, through lack of space and immediate accommoda-
tions, to accept.

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

In the early part of this century a naturalist traveling in Siberia

stood by the mutilated body of a mammoth still undecayed, which the
melting of the frozen gravel had revealed, and to the skeleton of which
large portions of flesh, skin, and hair still clung. The remains were
excavated and transported many hundred miles across the frozen
waste, and at last reached the Imperial Museum at St. Petersburg,
where, through all these years, the mounted skeleton has justly been
regarded as the greatest treasure of that magnificent collection.
' Scientific memoirs, popular books, theological works, poems—in
short, a whole literature—has come into existence with this discov-
ery as its text. No other event in all the history of such subjects has
excited a greater or more permanent interest outside of purely scien.
tific circles; for the resurrection of this ‘relic of a geologice time in a
condition analogous to that in which the bodies of contemporaneous
animals are daily seen brings home to the mind of the least curious
observer the reality of a long extinct race with a vividness which no
fossils or petrifactions of the ordinary sort can possibly equal.

Now, I am assured by most competent naturalists that few, if any,
of those not particularly devoted to the study of American animals
realize that changes have already occurred or are on the point of taking
place in our own characteristic fauna compared with which the disap-
pearance from it of the mammoth was insignificant. That animal was
common to all northern lands in its day. The practical domestication
of the elephant gives to every one the opportunity of observing a
gigantic creature closely allied to the mammoth, and from which he may
gain an approximately correct idea of it. But no such example is at
handinthe ease of the bison, the prong-horn antelope, the elk, the Rocky
Mountain goat, and many more of our vanishing races.

The student of even the most modern text-books learns that the
characteristic larger animals of the United States are those just men-
tioned, with the moose, the grizzly bear, the beaver, and if we include
marine forms and aretic American animals we may add the northern
fur-seal, the Pacific walrus, the Californian sea-elephant, the manatee,
and still others.

With one or two exceptions out of this long list, men now living can
remember when each of these animals was reasonably abundant within
its natural territory. It is within the bounds of moderation to affirm
that unless Congress places some check on the present rate of destruc-
tion there are men now living who will see the time when the animals
enumerated will be practically extinct, or exterminated within the lim-
its of the United States. Already the census of some of them can be
expressed in three figures.

The fate of the bison, or American buffalo, is typical of them all.
‘¢ Whether we consider this noble animal,” says Audubon, “as an ob-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

ject of the chase or as an article of food for man, it is decidedly the
most important of all our American contemporary quadrupeds.”

At the middle of the last century this animal pastured in Pennsylva-
nia and Virginia, and even at the close of the century ranged over the
whole Mississippi Valley and further west wherever pasturage was to
be found. At the present time a few hundred survivors represent the
millions of the last century, and we should not have even these few
hundred within our territory had it not been for the wise action of
Congress in providing for them a safe home in the Yellowstone Park.

Now, for several reasons it has been comparatively easy to trace the
decline of the buffalo population. The size of the animal, its prefer-
ence for open country, the sportsman’s interest in it, and its relations
to the food-supply of the Western Indians, all led to the observation
and record of changes; and accordingly I have made special mention
of this animal in representing the advantages of a national zoological
park where it might be preserved; but this is by no means the only
characteristic creature now threatened with speedy extinction.

The moose is known to be at the present time a rare animal in the
United States, but is in less immediate danger than some others. The
elk is vigorously hunted and is no longer easily obtained, even in its
most favored haunts. The grizzly bear is believed to be rapidly ap-
proaching extinction outside of the Yellowstone Park, where, owing
to the assiduous care of those in charge, both it and the elk are still
preserved. The mountain sheep and goat, which inhabit less accessi-
ble regions, are becoming more and more rare, while the beaver has
retreated from a vast former area to such secluded haunts that it may
possibly survive longer than the other species which I have just enu-
merated, and which are but a portion of those in imminent danger of
extinction.

Among the marine forms the manatee still exists, but, although not
exterminated, it is in immediate danger of beecomimg so, like the Cali-
fornian sea-elephant, a gigantic creature, often of greater bulk than the
elephant, which has suffered the fate of complete extinction within a
few past years; at least it is uncertain whether a single individual
actually survives. The Pacific walrus, upon which a large native popu-
lation has always in great part depended for food and hides, is rapidly
following the sea-elephant, and so on with other species.

This appalling destruction is not confined to mammals. Disregard
ing the birds of song and plumage, to which the fashions of the milli.
ner have brought disaster, nearly all the larger and more characteristic
American birds have suffered in the same way as their four-footed con-
temporaries. The fate of the great Auk i$ familiar to all naturalists ;
but it isnot so well known that the great Californian vulture and sev-
eral of the beautiful sea-fowl] of our coasts have met the same fate, and
that the wild pigeon, whose astonishing flocks were dwelt upon by Au-
dubon and others in such remarkable descriptions and which were long
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the wonder of American travelers, with the iess known, but magnificent
ivory-billed woodpecker, and the pretty Carolina parrakeet, have all
become, if not extinct, among the rarest of birds.

Apart from the commercial value of its skins, the tax upon which
has paid for the cost of our vast Alaskan territory, the singular habits
and teeming millions of the northern fur-seal have excited general in-
terest even among those who are not interested in natural history. In
1849 these animals abounded from Lower California to the lonely
Alaskan Isles, and it has been supposed that the precautions taken by
the Government for their protection on the breeding-grounds of the
Pribilov Islands would preserve permanently tke still considerable
remnant which existed after the purchase of Alaska and the destruction
of the southern rookeries. But it is becoming too evident that the
greed of the hunters and the devastation caused by the general adop-
tion of the method of pursuing them in the open sea, destroying indis-
criminately mothers and offspring, is going to bring these hopes to
naught.

For most of these animals, therefore, it may be regarded as certain
that, unless some small remnant be preserved in a semi-domesticated
state, a few years will bring utter extinction. The American of the
next generation, when questioned about the animals once characteristic
of his country, will then be forced to confess that with the exception of
a few insignificant creatures, ranking as vermin, this broad continent
‘possesses none of those species which once covered it, since the present
generation will have completed the destruction of them all.

The Yellowstone Park is doing excellent work under the present
management, and too much can not be said in praise of the action
which has given it to the country. It is, however, also desirable and
necessary that, if these vanishing forms are to be preserved, there
should be some zoological preserve or garden nearer the Capital, where
representatives of all these races, not only of the land, but of the water
also, may be preserved under the care of those permanently interested
in their protection, in the charge, that is, of men who not only have
special professional knowledge of their habits and needs, but who may
be considered as having an unselfish interest in looking to their preser-
vation, and who may act as scientific advisers, whenever such advice
is deemed desirable by Congress or by the heads of Departments.

Is it realized that nearly all the principal animals indigenous to the
United States are either substantially extinct or in danger of becom-
ing so and is it sufficiently realized that, once extinct, no expenditure
of treasure can restore what can even to-day be preserved by prompt
action of a very simple and definite kind ?

It is such considerations as these that have induced me to ask the
earnest attention of the Regents, of Congress, and of the country to the
immediate necessity for action. The trust is unquestionably for the ad-
vancement of science as well as for the instruction and recreation of

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

the people, and thus becomes a fitting object for the care of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

In my Report for last year the preliminary steps for the establish-
ment of a Zoological Park in the District of Columbia were detailed.
The District of Columbia bill, which received the approval of the Presi-
dent on March 2, 1889, contained an appropriation of $200,000 for the
purchase of the land and established a Commission, composed of the
Seeretary of the Interior, the President of the Board of Commissioners
of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, for the purpose of selecting and acquiring a suitable site upon
Rock Creek.

The utmost care was exercised to keep within the limitsof this appro-
priation, and the Commission is even able to turn into the Treasury a
small balance upon the completion of its work. To accomplish this,
however, it was necessary to leave out a strip of land of about 8 acres
on the east side of the creek, which it seemed to the Commission very
desirable to secure, and I venture to express the hope that Congress
will see fit to make special provision for the purchase of the property at
an early day.

rom a commercial point of view the enterprise has already proved
a most successful one, the land having risen in value since its condem-
nation from 200 to 300 per cent.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the ground had yet to be acquired.
A careful consideration of the property in the neighborhood of Rock
Creek, described in the act of Mareh 2, 1889, had been made and an
area of 166.48 acres selected.* The difficulty of establishing the bound-
arjes of certain tracts described in the older deedscaused a long delay,
but the survey was finally completed on the 21st of November, 1889.

*The following list shows the tracts in detail and the amount eventually to be
paid for each:

38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A map of the park, showing the location and quantity of each lot,
was filed in the public records of the District of Columbia. On exam.
ination of the list it will be seen that for 131.14 acres an agreement
was effected with the owners as to the sum to be paid. For 34.49
acres no such agreement could be made, and the Commission therefore
took the course prescribed by the act of March 2, 1889, for this con-
tingency, and petitioned the Supreme Court of the District to assess
the value of the land. This was done by three appraisers appointed
by the Court, and the finding of the appraisers was approved by the
President of the United States. At the close of the year title deeds had
already passed for the greater portion of the property.

The site thus selected is, it is believed, admirably suited for the purpose
for which it is designed. Situated at a convenient distance from the
city in a region of remarkable natural beauty, it has a surface of great
variety, offering unusual advantages of varied exposure for animals re-
quiring different treatment. While some portions still retain the origi-
nal forest, others are cleared or covered by a dense second growth of
pine, excellent for cover and producing conditions similar to those of
the natural haunts of many of the animals it is proposed to preserve.
An abundant supply of water is furnished to the lower portions by Rock
Creek, a small perennial stream that during freshets swells to consid-
erable size, and at intervals of years, to rare but destructive floods.
A number-of small runlets or “ branches ” fall into the creek giving an
‘effective drainage to all parts of the park. The system of water ways
has for the most part been cut by erosion, so that the hill-sides and
valleys usually present smooth, rounded slopes, practicable for roads and
walks; yet this isagreeably varied at several places by an outcropping
of the underlying rock, giving a somewhat bolder character.

In the Appendix will be found a map showing the situation of the
Zoological Park with reference to the city of Washington, and follow-
ing if a second map giving, on a somewhat larger scale, the outline of
the park and its principal topographical features.

Having obtained the site it became necessary to procure means for
the organization and maintenance of the. park. The Commission ac-
cordingly, under date of January 16, 1890, addressed a letter to Con-
gress, concluding with the following words:

Before the expiration of. the present fiscal year the Zoological Park
Commission will have completed the duties with which it was charged
by the act of Congress which called it into existence, and the title to
the lands it has purchased will be vested in the United States. Pend-
ing the completion of the condemnation proceedings now in progress,
and the submission of a final report, it is extremely desirable that Con-
gress Should enact further legislation in regard to the park. The Com-
mission has no authority to put up fences and lay out roads or grounds,
or to erect buildings, nor is it even certain that it has the right to ac-
cept donations. The park is declared by Congress to be “ for the ad-
vancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.”
In the construction of ponds and lakes, and the erection of inclosures
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

and buildings for the purposes of zoological science, a stage will soon
be reached where scientific direction seems obviously desirable; and it
is respectfully represented to Congress that any means tor laying out
and improving the grounds can be most advantageously used in view
of the purpose of Congress as to the ultimate disposition of the park
now when the foundations of its future usefulness are being laid. If
the very considerable collection of living animals now in the custody of
the Smithsonian Institution is to form the nucleus of the zoological park
collection its transter should be effected by legislative enactment and
suitable measures taken for its maintenance. The Commission is of the
opinion that the collection referred to should, with the consent of the
Regents of the Institution, be transferred to the Zoological Park as soon
as possible after the Government takes full possession of the site.

Secretary of the Interior,
J, W. DOUGLASS,
Prest. Board Com. Dis. Col.,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,
Commissioners for the establishment of a Zoological
Park in the District of Columbia.

After thorough consideration the following act was passed placing
the park under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and transferring to it the collection formerly under the charge of
the United States National Museum :

AN ACT for the organization, improvement, and maintenance of the National Zoolog-
ical Park. ‘

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the one-half of the fol-
lowing sums named, respectively, is hereby appropriated out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and the other half
out of the revenues of the District of Columbia, for the organization,
improvement, and maintenance of the National Zoological Park, to be
expended under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and to be drawn on their requisition and disbursed by the dis-
bursing officer for said Institution:

For the shelter of animals, fifteen theusand dollars.

For shelter-barns, cages, fences, and inclosures, and other provisions
for the custody of animals, nine thousand doilars,

For repairs to the Holt mansion, to make the same suitable for ocecu-
pancy, and for office furniture, two thousand dollars.

For the creation of artificial ponds and other provisions for aquatic:
animals, two thousand dollars.

For water supply, sewerage, and drainage, seven thousand dollars.

For roads, walks, and bridges, fifteen thousand dollars.

For miscellaneous supplies, materiais, and sundry incidental expen-
ses not otherwise provided for, five thousand dollars.

For current expenses, including the maintenance of collections, food
supplies, salaries of all necessary employees, and the acquisition and
transportation of specimens, thirty-seven thousand dollars.

SEc. 2. That the National Zoological Park is hereby placed under the
directions of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, who are author-
ized to transfer to it any living specinen, whether of animals or plants,
now or hereafter in their charge, to accept gifts for the park at their
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

discretion, in the name of the United States, to make exchanges ot
specimens, and to administer the said Zoological Park for the advance-
ment of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.

Sec. 3. That the heads of Executive Departments of the Government
are hereby authorized and directed to cause to be rendered all neces-
sary and practicable aid to the said Regents in the acquisition of col-
lections for the Zoological Park.

Approved, April 30, 1890.

As it seemed desirable to have at once expert advice on the subject
of laying out and improving the park, Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted, a
distinguished landscape gardener, was requested to make a preliminary
inspection of the ground.and to express an opinion as to what, under
the conditions imposed by the primary objects of the law, would be
the best general disposition to make of it. It soon became evident that
a further survey was necessary in order to fix the boundaries of the
maximum rise to be expected from Rock Creek. This stream, ordina-
rily small, drains a water-shed having an area of some 83 square miles,
with a slope so considerable that after copious rains the water rapidly
rises far beyond its usual limits and becomes destructive to any build-
ings or other fixtures situated along its course. A remarkable inunda-
tion of this character occurred in June, 1889, the extent of which was
noted at several points along the creek. It would bé evidently im-
practicable to place any buildings of importance within the area sub-
ject to these heavy floods, and the suitable locations and plans for the
bridges to be constructed could not be prepared until their height and
Span were determined with reference to the inaximum rise of water.
The survey of the creek was not completed at the close of the year, but
it has since been finished as shown in the map previously referred to,

Having once secured the picturesque features of the land from oblit-
eration by the rapid encroachment of the city, it has been the policy to
proceed slowly with improvements and to utilize the natural advantages
of the location, interfering as little as possible with its original aspects.
Even with these economical principles the cost of converting the tract
to the uses of a park is far beyond what would ordinarily be imagined,
for it should be remembered that the cost of improving Central Park,
New York, has already been not less than $14,000 per acre, and that of
Prospect Park, Brooklyn $9,000 per acre, while that of the large Frank-
lin Park, Boston, is estimated at $2,900 per acre.

In following this policy and keeping within the limits of the appro-
priations, no immediate provision has been made for the considerable
expense involved in opening at once to the public the entire area of 166
acres. The complete establishment of the park in a manner befitting
its national character will be a work of considerable time, and for the
present it has been deemed advisable to set aside nearly 40 acres, se-
lected on account of accessibility and moderate elevation, as well as on
account of its being adapted to the purposes of the park without great
expense, while a further tract of some 15 acres will be so arranged that

«

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

it can‘ be opened to the public, though it may not have a strictly park-
like cultivation. There will thus be free to the public, it is hoped by
next year, between 50 and 60 acres, an area larger than that of the
Zoological Gardens in the Regents Park of London, or the Jardin des
Plantes of Paris.

A distinct area of some 10 or 15 acres will be reserved in another
portion of the park for administrative and other purposes requiring
seclusion, and will contain a lodge for the resident superintendent,
offices, stable, infirmary for animals, and a proposed laboratory.

It should be remembered that a most important feature of this under-
taking is that it is not only a place for public resort and amusement,
but it is also intended te furnish secluded places for the breeding and
restoration of the various animals indigenous to this country.

At London and Paris the zoological gardens are chiefly for the
amusement of the people by the exhibition of curious and foreign ani-
mals, and for the benefit of the naturalist; our paramount interest is to
preserve the indigenous animals, and then to provide, in the words of
the act, for the instruction and amusement of the people.

Though anticipating the report for the coming year it does not seem
out of place in the present connection to allude to the fact that the See-
retary, in his private capacity, has been appointed by the Presidentone
of the commissioners of the more extensive national park upon Rock
Creek, contiguous to the Zoological Park, a charge which he has
accepted with some reluctance on account of the pressure of present
official duties, but with a feeling that by reason of the necessary inti-
mate connection between the two national parks the public interests
will be subserved by this action.

I can not close the report in relation to this new undertaking of the
Institution without reference to the loss we have sustained in the death
of Senator Beck, who, though not upon the Board of Regents, took a
lively interest in the Institution, and a special interest in establishing
and placing under its care the preservation of the natural scenery in the
neighborhood of the Capital.

T regret, also, toreport that near the close of the year, the Institution
was reluctantly obliged to accept the resignation of Mr. W. T, Hornaday,
curator of living animals in the National Museum, who, having been as-
signed to the duty of superintendent of the park under the Commission,
it was hoped would be able to accept the position of superintendent of ”
the park upon its transfer to the Board of Regents. His efforts assisted
the Commission greatly in the selection of the land, and did much to
insure the success of the measure before Congress.

Dr. Frank Baker honorary curator of the Department of Comparative
Anatomy in the Museum, was appointed on June 1, 1890, acting mana-
ger of the Zoological Park.
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnologic researches among the North American Indians were con-
tinued by the Smithsonian Institution, in compliance with acts of Con-
gress, during the year 1889-90, under the direction of Maj. J. W. Pow-
ell, Director of the U. S. Geological Survey.

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology during the year has proceeded
along accustomed lines. Investigations in relation to the Sign Lan-
guage and Pictography of the American Indian, preliminary reports of
which subjects have appeared in annual reports of the Bureau,
have been discontinued and the final results of this study will soon
appear. Investigations of the Mounds of the eastern United States
have also been practically brought to an end and the final discussion
of the subject will speedily be published.

The archeologie researches which have been inaugurated in the vicin-
ity of Washington have already been fruitful of results of more than
local interest. Excavations into the quarry sites and workshops of
ihe district have shown that the class of archeologic objects from this
vicinity, which have hitherto been assumed to be paleolithic and to
represent the rude implements of primitive man, are in fact nothing
but the “rejects” of much more recent times; and that however far
back in point of time some of them may date, they are not separable
from the rejects of the historic Indian.

As usual, considerable attention has been paid to the collection of
linguistic material, both because it is thought that languages form the
only safe basis for classifying peoples, and because no material relating
to our Indians is vanishing with such rapidity. The latter reason has
also impelled the collection of Indian mythology. Myths are hardly
more enduring than the languages in which they are preserved. Though
they may persist to some extent after a language decays and falls into
partial disuse, it is only in a degraded and emasculated form that de-
prives them of their chief value, as embodying the religious ideas and
the philosophy of primitive peoples.

The medicine practices of the Indian have also received much atten-
tion and a large number of the plants used in the Indian Materia
Medica have been collected, preserved, and their Indian and botanical
names obtained. In addition, the formulas and secret practices attend-
ing their use have been carefully recorded. As was to be expected, it
has been found that so intimately interwoven are the Indian systems
of religign and medicine that it is practically impossible to say where
the one ends and the other begins. It has also been demonstrated that
contrary to popular belief, the chief and almost sole effacacy possessed
by so-called Indian medicine lies, not in the inherent virtue of the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

plants used, but in the mystic properties imparted to them by the sor-
cerers or professional ‘ Medicine men.”

During the year one of the Bureau assistants visited Casa Grande,
in Arizona, with a view to determining the best method to give effect
to the act passed by Congress for preserving the ancient ruin. The
preservation from the hand of the vandal and the effects of time and
exposure of the more important Indian mounds and ruins which are
situated within the national domain, is one that may well receive at-
tention. The land upon which many of them are situated is of little
value for economic purposes, and the comparatively small outlay re-
quired for their restoration, when such is necessary, and for their pres-
ervation, is small when contrasted with their historical and archieologi-
cal value and their popular interest.

No phase of tribal life and society presents a more curious and inter-
esting study than that exhibited by the Pueblo Indians, who, in many
respects, were far in advance of less sedentary tribes. Study of one of
them, Sia, was begun during the year, and other Pueblos will be visited
and studied in succession.

Further details respecting the work of the Bureau will be found in
the report of its director, Major J. W. Powell, given in full in Appen-
dix I;

NECROLOGY.

SAMUEL SULLIVAN COX.

TI am called upon to record here the death of one of the most public-
spirited and versatile members of Congress that have served upon the
Board of Regents, the Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox, a member of the
House of Representatives, who was born at Zanesville, Ohio, Septem-
ber 30, 1824, and first elected a Regent on December 19,1861. He died
at his home in New York on the 10th of September, 1859.

At a meeting of the Board, held on the 8th of January, 1890, a com-
mittee was appointed to prepare resolutions on the services and char-
acter of Mr. Cox, consisting of the Secretary, Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
Dr. Welling, and Hon. Mr. Lodge, and they subsequently reported as
follows:

To the Board of Regents :

Your committee report that the Hon. 8. 8. Cox was first appointed a
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1861, and that he
filled that office, except for intervals caused by public duties, to the
time of his death.

While he was not aregular attendant at all the meetings of the Board,
he was ever ready to advance the interests of the Institution and of
science, either as a Regent or as a member of Congress; and although
such men as Hamlin, Fessenden, Colfax, Chase, Garfield, Sherman,
Gray, and Waite, in a list comprising Presidents, Vice-Presidents,
Chief-Justices, and Senators of the United States, were his associates,
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

there were none whose service was longer or more gratefully to be re-
membered, nor perhaps any to whom the Institution owes more than
to Mr. Cox.

The regard in which his brother Regents held Mr. Cox’s accuracy of
characterization and his instinctive recognition of all that is worthiest
of honor in other men may be inferred from the eulogies which he was
requested by them to deliver among which may be particularly men-
tioned the one at the commemoration in honor of Professor Henry in
the House of Representatives. But though these only illustrate a very
small part of his services as a Regent, your committee are led by their
cousideration to recall that his first act upon your Board was the prep-
aration and delivery of an address at the request of the Regents on their
late colleague, Stephen A. Douglas, and that on this occasion he used
words which your committee permit themselves to adopt, as being in
their view singularly characteristic of Mr. Cox himself:

‘It was not merely as one of its Regents that he showed himself the
true and enlightened friend of objects kindred to those of this estab-
lishment; he ever advocated measures which served to advance knowl-
edge and promote the progress of humanity. The encouragement of
the fine arts, the rewarding of discoverers and inventors, the organiza-
tion of exploring expeditions, as well as the general diffusion of educa-
tion, were all objects of his special regard.”

In view of these facts it is

Resolved, That in the death of Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox the Smith-
sonian Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of along-tried friend,
the Board of Regents of a most valued associate and active member dur-
ing fifteen years of service, and the country of one of its most distin-
guished citizens.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to express their deep
sympathy with the bereaved family of the deceased, and that a copy
of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of their late associate.

Mr. Cox was descended from a long line of distinguished ancestors.
His father, Hon. Ezekiel Taylor Cox, who moved from New Jersey
to Zanesville early in the century, held the position of State senator
and clerk of the supreme court of Ohio; his grandfather, General
James Cox, was an officer in the Revolution, speaker of the New Jersey
assembly, and member of Congress at the time of his death; his great-
grandfather, Judge Joseph Cox, was a distinguished man of his time,
as were his great-great-grandfather, James Cox, and his great great-
great-grandfather, Thomas Cox, one of the original proprietors of the
province of East New Jersey.

‘Upon the completion of a classical course Mr. Cox studied law, and at
theage of twenty-five, turning his attention to journalism, was the editor
of the Columbia Statesman; at twenty-nine he was the chairman of
the committee of the Democratic party of Ohio. When scarcely more
than thirty he was offered an appointment as secretary of legation to
Great Britain, but declined the honor, though he afterwards accepted
a similar position and represented the United States at Peru. At
thirty-two he was elected to Congress aad continued as a member of
that, body, almost without interruption, for a period of over thirty years.
He was elected Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

in 1876, and was minister to Turkey during the first part of President
Cleveland’s administration, receiving from the Sultan shortly after this
mission the degree of the order of the Mejidieh.

Of Mr. Cox’s political career it is unnecessary to speak. The unani-
mnity with which his fellow-Congressmen hastened to pay tribute to his
memory, in terms most glowing and affectionate, attests his esteem in
the House of Representatives. No one upon the floor of the House of
Representatives in late years has appreciated more fully or bas cham-
pioned to such an extent the cause of science. To him the scientific
departments of the Government looked for assistance and appreciation ;
as a member of the Board of Regents he was a firm supporter of the
liberal policy laid down for the Institution by Professor Henry.

Respectfully submitted.
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDICES TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the work of the year,
dividing it for convenience into two general heads, viz, field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations and (2) general
field studies, the latter having been directed during the year chiefly to archeology,
language, religious practices, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the eastern United
States was, as in former years, under the superintendence of Prof. Cyrus ‘Thomas.
During this year he discontinued explorations in person, being engaged almost the
entire time upon the preparation of the second volume of his report and of an ad-
ditional bulletin, with accompanying maps of the archologic localities.

Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, however, was employed during the summer in exploring
the works in Manitoba and the two Dakotas with special reference to their types and
distribution. The results of this investigation proved very satisfactory, as the types
within this area are found to be unusually well defined, according to physical struct-
ure and contents. While thus employed other archeological remains were noted and
examined, such as the bowlder outlines of circles and animals and the ancient village
sites on the Missouri River. A full report concerning these investigations will ap-
pear in the forthcoming report of Professor Thomas. Mr. Reynolds also made a visit
to certain earthworks in Iowa and Indiana for the purpose of ascertaining their
types. In the autumn he was employed in South Carolina and Georgia exploring
the mounds of that section, about which little was known, Two mounds—a large
one on the Wateree River, below Camden, South Carolina, and one on the Savannah
River, Georgia—proved of special interest. The contents of the latter consisted of
as fine specimens of every class of primitive art as have been found in mounds.

Mr. James D. Middleton, who had acted as a regular assistant from the organiza-
tion of the division, wasengaged during the month of July, 1889, in surveying and
making plats of certain ancient works of Michigan and Ohio. At the end of the
month he resigned his position in the Bureau.

Mr. James Mooney, although engaged in another line of research, obtained impor-
tant information for the Mound Division, in reference to the location, distribution,
and character of the ancient works of the Cherokee in western North Carolina and
adjoining sections.

General Field Studies.—In the autumn of 1889 Mr. W. H. Holmes was directed to take
charge of the archeologie field-work of the Bureau. In September he began exca-
vations in the ancient bowlder quarries upon Piney Branch of Rock Creek, near
Washington. A trench was carried across the principal quarry, which had a width of
more than 50 feet and a depth in places of 10 feet. The ancient methods of quarrying
and working the bowlders were studied and several thousands of specimens were col-

47
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

lected. Work was resumed in the next spring and five additional trenches were
opened across widely separated portions of the ancient quarries. Much additional
information was collected, and many specimens were added to the collection. In
June work was commenced on another group of ancient quarries, situated north of
the new Observatory, on the west side of Rock Creek. Very extensive quarrying and
implement-making had been carried on in this place. The conditions and phenomena
were almost identical with those of the Piney Branch site. Subsequently an ancient
soapstone quarry near ‘enallytown was examined. The ancient pitting corresponded
quite closely with that of the bowlder quarries and the condition of the pits indi-
cated equal age.

Dr. W. J. Hoffinan proceeded early in July to White Earth Reservation, Minnesota,
to continue the collection and study of mnemonic and other records relating to the
Midé’ wiwin or ‘‘ Grand Medicine Society ” of the Ojibwa Indians. He had already spent
two seasons with this tribe, and having been satisfactorily prepared, was initiated
into the mysteries of the four several degrees of the society, by which means he was
enabled to record the ceremonials of initiation, which was desired by the Indians, so
that a complete exposition of the traditions of the Ojibwa cosmogony and of the
Midé’ Society could be preserved for the information of their descendants. Through
intimate acquaintance with, and recognition by, the Midé’ priests, Dr. Hoffmann
secured all the important texts employed in the ceremony—much of which is in an
archaic form of speech—as well as the musical notation of songs sung to him for that
purpose; also the birch-bark records of the society, and the mnemonic songs on bireh-
bark, employed by the Mide’ priests, as weli as those of the Jé’'ssakki’d and the Wa-
béno’, which represent two other grades of Shamans.

The so-called cosmogony charts, four versions of which were secured, had not pre-
viously been exhibited to a white man, nor to Indians until after the necessary fees
had been paid for such service, preparatory to admission into the society.

He also secured, as having connection with the general subject, a list of plants and
other substances constituting the materia medica of the above-named locality, the
method of their preparation, administration, and reputed action, the whole being
connected with incantation and exorcism.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff made ashort trip (from December 7 to January 20) to the ruin
of Casa Grande, in Arizona, visiting also the sites of Mr. F. H. Cushing’s work while
in charge of the Hemenway expedition. Plans and photographs were secured on
this trip, and fragments of typical pottery were collected from the principal ruin
visited. Casa Grande was found to be almost identical in character with the many
ruins scattered over the valleys of both the Gila and Salado.

On July 3 Mr. James Mooney started on a third trip to the Cherokee reservation
in North Carolina, returning November 17. During this time he devoted his atten-
tion chiefly to the translation and study of the sacred formulas used by the Shamans,
obtained by him during a previous visit. In this work he employed the service of the
most prominent medicine men, among them being the writers of some of the original
formulas, and obtained detailed explanations of the accompanying ceremonies and
the theories upon which they were based, together with descriptions of the mode of
preparing the medicine and the various articles used in the same connection. He was
also permitted to witness a number of these ceremonies, notedly the solemn rite
known as ‘‘ going to water.” About three hundred specimens of plants used in the
medicine practice were also collected, with their Indian names and uses, in addition
to about five hundred previously obtained, These plants were sent to the botanists
of the Smithsonian Institution for identification under their scientific names. The
study of these Cherokee plant names, in connection with the medical formulas, will
throw much light upon Indian botanic classification and therapeutics. The study of
the botany is a work of peculiar difficulty, owing to the absence of any uniform sys-
tem among the various practitioners. Attention was also given to the ball play, and
several photographs of different stages of the ball dance were secured. One of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

oldest men of the tribe was also employed to prepare the feather wands used in the
eagle dance, the pipe dance of the prairie tribes, and the calumet dance spoken of by
the early Jesuit writers, which has now been discontinued among the Cherokees for
abont thirty years, These wands were deposited in the National Museum as a part
of the Cherokee collection, obtained on various visits to the reservation.

A considerable amount of miscellaneous information in regard to myths, dances,
ete., was obtained, and a special study was made of their geographic nomenclature for
the purpose of preparing an aboriginal map of the old Cherokee country. With this
object a visit was made to the outlying Indian settlements, especially that on Cheowah
River, in Graham County, North Carolina, and individuals originally from widely-
separated districts were interviewed. ‘Lhe maps of the Geological Survey, on a scale
of 2 miles to an inch, were used in the work, and the result is a collection of probably
more than one thousand Cherokee names of localities within the former territory of
the tribe, given in the correct form, with the meaning of the names and whatever
local legends are connected. In North Carolina practically every local name now
known to the Cherokees has been obtained, every prominent peak or rock, and every
cove ind noted bend in a stream having a distinctive name. For Georgia and a por-
tion of Tennessee the names must be obtained chiefly from old Indians now living in
the Indian Territory. It may be noted here that as a rule the Cherokees and some
other tribes have no names for rivers or settlements. The name belongs to the dis-
trict and is applied alike to the stream, town, or mountain located in it. When the
people of a settlement remove, the old name remains behind, and the town in its
new location takes the name attached to the new district. Each district along a
river has a distinet name, while the river as a whole has none, the whole tendency
in Indian languages being to specialize. The last six weeks of this field season were
spent by Mr. Mooney in visiting various points in North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Tennessee, and Alabaina, within the former limits of the Cherokees, for the purpose of
locating mounds, graves, and other antiquities for an archieologic map of their ter-
ritory, and collecting from former traders and old residents materials for a historic
sketch of the tribe.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin spent July, and until Angust 28, 1889, at various points on the
Klamath River, from Orleans Bar to Martin’s Ferry, Humboldt County, California,
in collecting myths and reviewing vocabularies of the Weitspekan and Ehnikan lan-
guages. From August 30 to September 10 he was at Blue Lake and Arcata, Hum-
boldt County, California, engaged in taking down a Wishoshkan vocabulary and
collecting information concerning the Indians of the region thereabout. Arriving in
Round Valley, Mendocino County, California, September 16, he remained there till
October 16, and took vocabularies of the Yuki and Palaihnihan language. From
Round Valley he went to Niles, Alameda County, California, where he obtained partial
vocabularies of three languages formerly spoken in that region. Of these one was
spoken at Suisun, another was kindred to the Mariposan, a third was Costanoan.
On October 27 he arrived in Redding, Shasta County, California, where he obtained a
considerable addition to bis material previously collected in the form of myths and
additions to the Palaihnihan vocabulary. During this work he visited also Round
Mountain. On January 10, 1890, he returned to office work.

From July 10 to November 9, 1889, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in field work.
Until September 7 he was on the Onondaga reservation, near Syracuse, New York,
where legends, tales, and myths were collected and recorded in the vernacular; also
accounts of the religious ceremonies and funeral rites were obtained, the terms form-
ing the Onondagan scheme of relationships of affinity and consanguinity were
recorded, and valuable matter pertaining to the league and its wampum record was
also collected.

From the last mentioned date to the 9th of November he was engaged on the Grand
River reservation in Canada, where he successfully made special etfort to obtain the
chants and speeches used in the condolence council of the league. The religious doc-

trines and beliefs of the pagan Iroquois were recorded; plant and animal names were
collected ; many religious and gentile songs were secured, and accounts of the prin-
cipal Iroquoian ‘‘ medicines” in the vernacular were obtained. A Wyandot vocabu-
lary was also recorded. :

Mrs. T. E. Stevenson left Washington in March, 1890, to study the Sia, Jemez, and
Zuni Indians. She made Sia her first point of investigation, and found so much of
ethnologic interest in this Pueblo that she continued her work there to the end of the
fiscal year engaged in making a vocabulary and studying the habits, enstoms, mythol-
ogy, and medicine practices of these people. She has been admitted to the cere-
monials of the secret societies and has made detailed accounts of them, the altars
being photographed by Miss M. 8. Clark, who accompanied her. Her investigations
so far have resulted in a clear exposition of the religion of the people.

OFFICE WORK.

The Director was engaged during the year, when his other duties would permit, in
the preparation of a work on the characteristics of Indian languages.

Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army, was occupied in continued study of sign language
and pictography with the collection and collation of additional material obtained by
personal investigation, by correspondence, and by the examination of authorities,
This work was performed with special reference to the preparation for early publica-
tion of a monograph on each of those subjects, that on pictography to be first pre-
sented. The re-arrangement and revision of material already published in the pre-
liminary papers on the sign language and on the pictographs of the North American
Indians which respectively appeared in the first and fourth annual reports of this
Bureau, and the insertion of matter obtained later by exploration and research, have
been conjoined with discussion and comparison. By this treatment it is hoped that
the monographs on sign language and pictography, having as their text the attain-
ments of the North American Indians in those directions, may contribute to the
understanding of similar exhibitions of evanescent and durable thought-writing,
whether still employed in other parts of the world or now only found in records of
material remains.

During the fiscal year Mr. H. W. Henshaw was engaged, in addition to his admin-
istrative duties, in assisting the Director in the final preparation of the linguistic
map of North America north of Mexico, and the accompanying report, which is now
completed and in the hands of the printer. He also began the final revision for the
printer of his dictionary of Indian tribal names.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey completed his editorial work in connection with the publica-
tion of Riggs’ Dakota-English Dictionary. He wrote articles on the following sub-
jects: Measures and valuing ; The Dha-du-ghe Society of the Ponka tribe ; Omaha
dwellings, furniture, and implements; Omaha clothing and personal ornaments;
Ponka and Omaha songs; The places of gentes in Siouan camping circles; Winne-
bago folklore notes; Teton folklore; Omaha folklore; The gentile system of the
Siletz tribes; and a Dakota’s account of the sun-dance. He revised some of his
Omaha and Ponka genealogical tables and began the arrangement of Kansa tables or
a similar character. He continued the elaboration of his monograph on Indian per-
sonal names, and completed the following lists in which the Indian names precede
their English meanings: Winnebago, 383 names; Iowa, Oto, and Missouri, 520;
Kwapa, 15; and Kansa, 604.

Dr. Dorsey finished the preparation of his texts for Contributions to North Ameri-
can Ethnology, Vol. 6, The Gegiha Language. Part u. Additional myths, stories,
and letters, and corrected proof for the volume as far as page 651. He prepared w
manuscript of other Omaha and Ponka letters, to be published as a bulletin. He
began an article entitled “A study of Siouan cults,” for which over forty colored
illustrations were prepared by Indians, under his direction; and of this article he

¢
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

completed four chapters, treating of the cults of the Omaha, Ponka, Kansa, Osage,
Iowa, Oto, Missouri, and Winnebago tribes, and half of a fifth chapter that describes
the cults of the Dakota and Assiniboin. When not otherwise engaged, he was occu-
pied in making entries on slips for the Gegiha-English Dictionary. From September
to December, 1889, he obtained from George Miller, an Omaha, who came to Wash-
ington to aid him, additional myths, legends, letters, folklore, and sociologic material,
grammatical notes and corrections of dictionary entries, besides genealogical tables
arranged according to the subgentes as weil as the gentes of the Omaha tribe.

During the year Mr. Albert 8. Gatschet was wholly engaged in office work. He
finished his last draught of the ‘‘ Klamath Grammar,” a language of southwestern Ore-
gon, making numerous additions, also appendices, as follows: Idioms and dialectic
differences in the language; colloquial form of the language; syntactic examples;
complex synonymous terms; roots with their derivatives. The typographic work on
the grammar was terminated, the proofs and revises having all been read by the au-
thor. The last portion of the entire work, being the ‘‘ethnographic sketch of the
Klamath people,” was then re-written from earlier notes while consulting the best
topographic and historical materials obtainable. Mr. Gatschet also drew a map of
“the headwaters of the Klamath River,” the home of the tribes, being on a scale
of 15 miles to the inch, which will appear as the frontispiece in Part 1. The
“ethnographic sketch” is now in the hands of the printer.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was engaged from January 10 to June 30, 1890, in arranging
the myth material collected by him in the field and in copying vocabularies. The
Hupa, Ehnikan, and Wishoshkan vocabularies were finished and the Yana partly
done on June 30, 1890.

The office work of Dr. W. J. Hoffman consisted in arranging the material gathered
by him during the preceding three field seasons and in preparing the manuscript for
publication, which has been completed. During the first three months of the year
1890 a delegation of Menomoni Indians were at Washington, District of Columbia, on
business connected with their tribe, and during that period Dr. Hoffman obtained
from thein a collection of facts relating to mythology, social organization and govy-
ernment, the gentile system and division of gens into phratries, together with many
facts relating to the Miti/wit, or ‘‘Grand Medicine Society” as they term it. These
are interesting and valuable, as some portions of the ritual explain doubtful parts of
the Ojibwa phraseology, and vice versa, although the two societies differ greatly in
the dramatized portion of the forms of initiation.

On his return from the field in November Mr. James Mooney devoted his attention
to the elaboration of the sacred formulas already obtained. Two hundred of these
formulas, being about one-third of the whole number, have now been translated. In
each case the translation from the original manuscript in Cherokee characters is
given first, then a translation following the idiom and spirit of the original as closely
as possible, and finally an explanation of the medicine and ceremonies used and the
underlying theory. About one-half of the whole number relate to medicine. The
others deal with love, war, self-protection, the ball play, agriculture, and life-con-
juring. A preliminary paper with a number of specimen formulas will appear in the
seventh annual report of the Bureau. The whole collection will constitute a unique
and interesting contribution to the aboriginal literature of America. All the words
occurring in the formulas thus far translated have been glossarized, with granimatic
notes and references from tbe original texts, making a glossary of about two thousand
words, a great part of which are in the archaic or sacred language. Several weeks
were also given to the preparation of an archeologic map of the old Cherokee
country from materials collected in the field and from other information in possession
of the Bureau.

During the year Mr. W. H. Holmes has been chiefly engaged in the preparation of
papers on the Arts of the Mound Builders, to form a part of the monograph upon the
Mound Builders, by Prof. Cyrus Thomas, Four papers are contemplated ; one upon
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Pottery, a second upon Art in Shell and Bone, a third upon Textile Fabrics, and a
fourth upon Pipes. Three of these papers are well advanced towards completion.
In addition to this work he has prepared papers relating to his field explorations.
These include a report upon excavations in the ancient quartzite bowlder workshops
and the soapstone quarries of the District of Columbia, and a rock shelter in West
Virginia. Portions of these papers have been published in the American Anthro-
pologist.

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued to devote such time as he could command for
the purpose to the preparation of bibliographies of the languages of North America.
At the close of the fiscal year 1888-89 the proof-reading of the Bibliography of the
Muskhogean Languages was completed, but the edition was not ready for delivery.
It was delivered August 8, 1889.

After the Muskhogean Bibliography had been finished, work was at once begun on
the Algonquian, by far the largest of those yet undertaken. Much of the material
for this was already in hand, the collection having been gradually pursued during
several years preceding, and the greater part of the work remaining consisted in
assembling, arranging, revising, and verifying that material. August 16-22 were
profitably spent by Mr. Pilling in the Lenox, Astor, and New York Historical Society
libraries, at New York City, and the Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston Athe-
neum, and Boston Public libraries, at Boston, chiefly in verifying and revising the
material in hand. The first portion of the manuscript was transmitted to the Public
Printer November 15, 1889. At the close of the fiscal year final proof had progressed
to the two hundred and fifty-eighth page, carrying the work approximately half way
to completion.

From the 1st to the 10th of July, 18-9, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in collat-
ing and recording Iroquoian proper names, both of persons and places, as they occur
in the narratives of the early explorers and historians of the pristine habitat of the
Iroquoian peoples. Afterwards, to the 9th of November, he was employed in field
work.

Upon his return to the office and until the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in
translating and annotating the myths, legends, tales, and all of the other matter
which he had previously collected in the field ; and in translating and recording for
easy reference, for the purpose of verification and exposition of the matter so col-
lected, the mythologic, ethnographic, and other anthropologic data found in the early
French narratives of the New World, and especially that which is found in the works
of Champlain, Lafitau, Charlevoix, and in the Jesait Relations. Much linguistic
material has been obtained from the translations of the matter which Mr. Hewitt per-
sonally collected while engaging in field work.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was personally engaged during the entire year on the prepara-
tion of his report on the field work and collections of the preceding seven years. A
bulletin giving the archologic localities within the mound area, together with a
series of accompanying maps, was completed for publication. It will form a closely
printed octavo of about two hundred and fifty pages. His report, which requires
much comparison and reference as well as study of the works explored and objects
obtained, is progressing as rapidly as is consistent with proper care and due regard
for details, and will be completed and presented for publication during the next
fiscal year.

Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, on his return from field duty, assisted Professor ‘Thomas
in the preparation of that part of his report and bulletin relating to those archeo-
logic districts the works of which he had visited. He then resumed the preparation
of his paper on the aboriginal use of metal. In May he made an examination of the
metal specimens in the private and public archeological collections of New York
City, and in June visited Providence and Boston ip search of certain rare historic
data relating to the early life and customs of the Indians, both in respect to the use
of metal and to other matters. He was engaged in the office upon this work at the

close of the fiscal year.
*
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. aD

During the year Mr. Victor Mindeleff was engaged upon a report on the architect-
ure of Tusayan and Cibola. This work was interrupted by a short field trip to the
ruin of Casa Grande, as mentioned under the head of field work, and was resumed on
his return from that trip. The report, togeiher with the data for its illustrations,
has been finished for publication. A report was also prepared on the repairs and
protection of the ruin of Casa Grande, on the Gila River, in Arizona. This report
was accompanied by diagram, plans, and aseries ef photographs. He also was occu-
pied in an architectural discussion on this ruin, together with one on the ruins on
the Rio Salado, excavated by the Hemenway expedition, which were visited by him.

During the first four months of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was engaged
in revising manuscript and otherwise assisting Mr. Victor Mindeleft in the prepara-
tion of a report on Pueblo Architecture, his own portion of the report having been
previously finished. The report was handed in for publication in December, 1889.
He then commenced the preparation of a series of maps, upon which the location of
all known ruins in the ancient Pueblo country will be plotted, in order to show their
distribution. The maps were partly done and the plotting of the ruins was com-
menced. When completed the maps will show the location of all ruins mentioned in
literature or known to explorers and will be accompanied by a card catalogue con-
taining a description of each ruin and reference to the literature relating to it, the
whole forming a valuable record. It is intended that a résumé of this shall be pub-
lished.

During the year the work of the modelling room was continued under the direction of
Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, and was confined almost entirely to the enlargement of the
“duplicate series,” referred to in previous reports. The large model of Penasco Blanco,
one of the Chaco ruins, reported last year as commenced, was completed, cut into sec-
tions for convenience of shipment, and boxed. A duplicate of a model of the Pueblo
of Tewa, the original of which was made in 1833, was finished and exchanged for the
original in the National Museum. The original was condemned and destroyed and
another duplicate was made for the duplicate series. A duplicate was also made of a
model of Schumepovi, and the original was put in order and added to the series. A
duplicate of a model of the Pueblo of Shipaulovi was also finished and added to the
same series. The original model of Casa Blanea cliff ruin was withdrawn from the
Museum, and a number of duplicate casts were made, one of which was finished and
re-deposited in the Muscum. Duplicates were also made of models of Great Elephant
Mound, Great Etowah Mound, and two others. In the latter half of the fiscal year
work was commenced on the duplication of two very large models, one of Walpi and
the First Mesa, the other of Mummy Cave eliff ruin. The original models had been
very hurriedly made for the New Orleans Exposition, and, being cast in plaster of
paris, had suffered considerably in transportation. An attempt was made to cast the
models in paper, and in both cases the attempt was very successful. The first dupli-
cate of the Walpi model was completed and deposited in the National Museum, to
replace the original which was destroyed. The finished model weighed about 500
pounds, instead of 2,500 pounds, the weight of the original. The model of the
Mummy Cave was cast, but was nos finished at the close of the year. A second dupli-
cate of Walpi, for the duplicate series, was cast, but not finished, at the close of the
year. It will be divided into sections for convenience of shipment. Toward the
close of the year work was commenced on two new models which will be used to
illustrate a report of Mr. Holmes, upon his work of the Archeology of the District
of Columbia.

But one demand was made during the year upon the duplicate series. This was
for a number of transparencies to be exhibited as a part of the display of the United
States at the Paris Exposition. Sixty of these large photographs on glass were sent
and two grand prizes were awarded them. Upon the conclusion of the exposition
the transparencies were returned, and some damage suffered in transportation was
made good by the United States Commission.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

During the year nine models, ranging in size from 2 feet square to 14 by 5 feet, were
finished ; twelve models, including duplicate casts, were finished but not painted ;
and four models were commenced and not finished.

Mr. De Lancey W. Gill during the year succeeded Mr. Holmes in the charge of pre-
paring and editing the illustrations for the publications for the Bureau. ‘The fol-
lowing list shows the number of drawings that have been prepared under his super-
vision for actual publication during the year:

These drawings were prepared from field surveys and sketches, from photographs,
and from the objects themselves. No field work has been done by Mr. Gill’s divis-
ion during the year although many valuable drawings and photographs were pro-
cured in Arizona by Mr. Victor Mindeleff and in the District of Columbia by Mr. W.
H. Holmes.

The photographic work remains under the able management of Mr. J. K. Hillers.

EXPENSE.

The expenses of the Exchange Bureau are met in part by a direct appropriation
made by Congress in the following terms:

“* For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, fifteen thousand dollars.”

This is supplemented by appropriations to several Government Bureaus by which
they are enabled to pay a portion of the cost of the exchange of their documents at a
rate of 5 cents per pound weight as established by the Board of Regents. Smaller
sums have been received from State institutions desiring to make use of the service,
and the deficiency is paid from the Smithsonian fund.*

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian
Institution on account of the international exchanges, as shown in his statement for
the fiscal year, dated July 1, 1890, were as follows:

*The actual cost of the exchanges from July 1, 1889, to June 30, 1890, compiled from
the accounting officer’s books and including the receipts and disbursements for the
fiscal year, entered up to September 24, 1890, was $17,407.30.

Fifteen thousand dollars of this sum ($17,407.30) were appropriated by Congress
directly to the Smithsonian Institution, $2,009.34 were repaid to the Institution by
Government Bureaus, $28.40 by State institutions and the deficiency, $369.56, was
met by the Smithsonian fund.

Bills for the transportation of exchanges have been rendered to all Gavernment
Bureaus receiving or sending publications during the year, except in a few instances
where the amount was trifling. The total received from such sources was $1,771.53,
as mentioned above.

It may not be superfluous to repeat the statement made in previous years, that this
method of meeting the expenses of the Exchange Bureau is extremely unsatisfactory
both to the Smithsonian Institution and to the Government Bureans that have occa-
sion to make use of the service, and I again recommend that a sufficient appropriation
be procured to cover the entire cost of the exchanges, thereby enabling it to under-
stand at a glance the exact amount appropriated for such purposes. At present the
appropriation is distributed through all the principal appropriation bills of the
Government.

In order to effect the desired change, that is, to collect in a single item the entire
appropriation for international exchanges and at the same time to make allowances for
the payment of ocean freight, the sum of $27,500 was asked for, for the fiscal year
1889-90 based upon the detailed statements submitted in my last report. The amount
finally appropriated was $15,000, the same as that for the year preceding.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The number of correspondents now upon our books is 16,002, divided into societies
and institutions, individuals, foreign and domestic, as follows:

A comparison with similar figures for last year shows a net increase of 2,572.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

The exchange of official documents between the Government of the United States
and that of foreign countries has been carried on through the intermediary of the
Smithsonian Institution, though this exchange has only been placed upon a defi-
nite diplomatic footing since January 15, 1889, the date upon which the convention
signed at Brussels on March 15, 1856, was proclaimed by the President of the United
States. This convention, the text of which was given in fullin Dr. Kidder’s report on
exchanges for the year 1887-’38, provided that there should be established in each of
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

the contracting countries a bureau for the special transmission of the publications of
its Government, the transactions of its learned societies, etc., to foreign governments
and individuals, and for the receipt from the similar bureaus of other countries of
the publications of their government and scientific and literary societies. This in-
volves, as will be seen. but little or no modification of the present long-established
Smithsonian Institution exchange system, and it is hoped that the official recognition
of the value of such a service by so many governments will result in extending the
scheme that has been in operation here for the past forty years, the expense of which
has been borne largely by the funds of James Smithson.

In accordance with a provision made in the Brussels Convention the Governments
of the Argentine Republic and of Paraguay have signified their adhesion to the con-
vention, the former on September 3, 1889, and the latter on December 10, 1889.
The countries therefore included in the international agreement are:—The United
States of America, the Argentine Republic, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Paraguay, Portu-
gal, Servia, Spain, Switzerland, Uruguay. :

While neither England nor Germany appear in the above list, both of these countries
have addressed inquiries to this institution through diplomatic channels with regard
to exchanges with our Government, and it is most gratifying to report that the Brit-
ish Government, through Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, has presented to the Govern-
ment of the United States, for deposit in the Library of Congress, an important col-
lection of the publications of the parliamentary and executive offices from the years
1882 to 1889, constituting a most valuable series of documents and forming apartial
return for the series of publications issued by our own Government since 1868 and
sent regularly to the British Museum. Moreover we have the assurance that this
valuable series will be continued in annual shipments.

The Government of Germany has also expressed its appreciation of the international
exchange service in such a way as to lead us to expect that it will in due time make
fitting acknowledgment of the series of United States Government publications pre-
sented to the Royal Public Library, and to the Library of the Imperial German Par-
liament at Berlin.

A second convention made at Brussels, and also proclaimed by the President on the
15th of January, 1889, provided fortheimmediate exchange of Parliamentary journals
and the like, but it had not at the close of the fiscal year been set in satisfactory
operation. An effort was made by a letter addressed to the Department of State on
December 12, 1869, to carry out the stipulations of this treaty as far as the United
States Government was concerned, and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of
State a joint resolution appropriating $2,000 for the purpose was passed by the Sen-
ate on January 22, 1890, but it has not yet been acted upon by the House.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

An inspection of the tables presented at the beginning of this report bears suf-
ficient evidence that the Bureau has not decreased in efficiency during the past year,
especially when it is considered that the increased number (6,606) of packages was
handled and accounted for with a decrease in the clerical force during eleven months.
At the close of the year there were but 321 packages on hand and the record work
was tolerably well up to date.

tIn addition to a large amount sent by mail.

t By mail.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the pro-
visions of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, has been 27,300, and there have
been received in return but 1,820 packages or volumes. The United States Govern-
ment Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad through the Bureau
16,496 packages or volumes, and have received in return 8,886. The total, then, of
the exchanges for the enrichment of the Government libraries has been 10,706 pack-
ages received and 43,796 packages sent abroad, a total of 54,502 packages, or 66 per
cent. of the total number of packages handled.

Of the 82,572 parcels received by the Exchange Bureau, 69,356 were for foreign
and 13,216 for domestic distribution.

While it is thus shown that more work has been done and with Jess force than in
the preceding years, I strongly recommend that a slight increase in the office force
be made in order that it may be possible to handle more rapidly the large and con-
stantly increasing amount of exchange material. An additional assistant in the ship-
ping room will, I am confident, prevent any reasonable complaints of delays in the
office proper. Delays that occur by reason of slow ocean transportation will be ob-
viated when sufficient appropriation is made to pay for freight; the delays that occur
in the foreign exchange bureaus or agents, except those in the pay of the Smithsonian
Institution, lie of course beyond the control of the Institution.

The foreign agents of the Institution, Dr. Felix Fliigel, Leipzig, and Messrs. Wiil-
iam Wesley & Son, London, bave given the same careful attention to the interests of
the Institution as in former years and are entitled, as well as the immediate employés
of the Bureau, to my warmest thanks. Grateful acknowledgments are also due to
the following transportation companies and firms for their continued liberality in
granting free freight or otherwise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels
and boxes, while to others we are indebted for reduced rates in consideration of the
disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge among men.

62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Upon January 1, 1890, a new system of recording the correspondence was adopted,
having been submitted to a preliminary trial of several months to test its applicability
to the special wants of the office. Every letter or invoice received is assigned a cur-
rent number, and is entered at once in a book for the purpose, a card index facili-
tating reference to the letters filed chronologically. All out-going letters are entered
in a similar book.

The collection of scientific and other directories, Government year-books, and lists
of members of learned societies, has received a number of valuable additions, and it
is hoped that with increased funds at command and a diminution of more pressing
needs this collection will be made-an important feature of the Exchange Bureau.

Perhaps the most serviceable information to those having occasion to make use
of the service is that contained in Exhibit A, appended, showing the number of
shipments each month to the various countries With which we are in correspondence.

Very respectfully yours,
WILLIAM C, WINLOCK,

Curator of Exchanges.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

It has hitherto been impossible to give suitable housing to these animals, most of
which are gifts to the Government, and many of them are kept ina long, low shed,
imperfectly lighted and heated, wherein animals accustomed to the most diverse cli-
mates are of necessity indiscriminately placed, the common Virginia opossum receiy-
ing the same heat and treatment that serves for the parrots and cockatoos. In an
annex to this shed the monkeys are placed, and it has been possible to give them
somewhat more suitable protection. The larger animals are confined either in sep-
arate out-door cages or in shelter-barns and pens, but these constructions are un-
suitable and insufficient even for the small number of such animals kept. Happily,
this condition is not a permanent one, as Congress has provided for the care and
maintenance of the collection in the National Zoological Park.

No zoological collection has ever been placed in a site so satisfactory. It is ample
in extent, being about four times larger than any zoological garden in this country
and from ten to fifteen times the size of most of the gardens of Europe. It is within
a short distance of the city, being but little over one-half mile from its limits (see
map No. 1) easily accessible by excellent roads; yet it has all the quiet and seclusion
of a remote country district. Within its bounds every variety of slope exposure is
found, from the north sides of hills covered with dense growth, suitable for animals
requiring coolness and shade, to the sunny southern aspects for tropical and sub-
tropical species. The natural variety of surface is also great. Rocks form natural
cliffs where wild sheep and goats can jump and climb ; densely wooded portions form
an excellent cover for shy animals, and a large open field along the creek affords an
opportunity for excellent grazing grounds. In the creek itself aquatic animals and
birds may be suitably reared.

That the picturesqueness of the region is notable isshown by the names given to
different parts of it in the grants and early deeds of the eighteenth century. There
it is found that a considerable part of the park was known as ‘‘ Pretty Prospect,”
also as “The Rock of Dunbarton,” while other parts are from the tracts of ‘‘ Mount
Pleasant” and ‘‘ Pleasant Plains.” The actual owners from whom the site was im-
mediately derived are shown on the accompanying map No. 2. A portion of it
was once owned by John Quincey Adams, who built upon the creek the ‘Columbia
Mill,” for nany years past known as ‘‘Adams’s Mill.” Fragmentary ruins of some
of the mill buildings still remain.

The only habitable building found within the limits defining the park was that
knownas the ‘‘ Holt House.” This mansion is one of the few remaining in the District
dating back to near the beginning of the century, it having been built in 1805,
Though in a very dilapidated condition, it is thought desirable to repair it, pre-
serving as far as possible its characteristic features, and it will be used for the offices
of the Park.

The original forest covering this land was doubtless mainly oaks, hickories, and
tulip trees. A portion of this was cleared away, and the land was probably cultivated
for many years. Being then allowed to lie fallow, there sprang up upon it a thick
second growth of scrub pinesand cedars. A large variety of trees of natural growth
is found. A list of those already noted that may be classed as indigenous follows :

ORNITHOLOGY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

This region has long been known to be, because of its seclusion and natural ad-
vantages, one of the favorite nesting grounds for the birds that visit the District of
Columbia. At my request Mr. H. W. Henshaw, a well-known authority in orni-
thology, has made the special report which follows:

‘‘For many reasons the situation of the site of the National Zoological Park is seem
to be a wise one, and from no point of view do its advantages appear greater than as.
a haunt of our native birds. A section which has long been known to be the chosen
home of birds and animals in a state of nature would seem to be a peculiarly fitting
abode for them in astate of captivity. It is certain that neither within the District
nor in the region immediately about it is there a spot which is resorted to by such
numbers of birds, nor one where the rarer migratory species can so certainly befound.
The park region has long been familiar to every bird collector who has ever made
Washington his headquarters, and probably no area of equal size has furnished so
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

many specimens to the collection of the National Museum and of private collectors
as this.

‘“To appreciate its advantages asa haunt in which to’study the habits of our
birds one must visit it in early morning about the middle of May. At this time
thousands of birds are eagerly winging their way to their northern homes, and the
little groves of pines and the outlying deciduous thickets are filled with hundreds of
warblers, flycatchers, and sparrows. Among others one may be pretty sure to find,
amid througs of commoner species, numbers of Bay-breasted and Blackburnian
Warblers. Should the visitor carefully scan the low thickets a Mourning or Con-
necticut Warbler, rare birds indeed in this latitude, may, perchance, reward his
search,

“The Worm-eating and Kentucky Warblers are always present about that date,
though insmall numbers. So, too, are the Yellow-bellied and Least Flyeatchers ; while
the Traills Flycatcher is an occasional visitant. There is a thicket on the west bank
of the creek which Lincoln’s Finch, long unnoticed in the district, visits each spring,
and I have seen seven or wight of a morning. The Scarlet Tanager, whose bright
colors arrest the eye of even the most careless, finds here a favorite resort, and the
Rose-breasted Grosbeak, always a prize to the collector, isa regular and common vis-
itor to the tall oaks that cover the eastern slopes. The northeast corner of the park
is the only spot known to me where the song of the Summer Tanager may be heard
with anything like certainty, for it is one of our rarest summer visitors. Not so the
Olive-backed Thrushes. Several of the five species are common elsewhere, but no-
where do they all occur so abundantly as here, even the Gray-cheeked being numer-
ous. The above are but a few of many species that throug the tree-tops and brush-
piles at this time of year.

“To explain just why this spot of all others in the District should be the favorite
resort for our birds would be difficult, Rock Creek is elsewhere as well wooded as it
is here. Elsewhere its banks furnish far more picturesque places, and if we can
suppose that birds are influenced in their choice of a resort by the wsthetic sense,
why are not such places equally favored with their presence?

“T am inclined to believe that the answer is to be found in the somewhat prosaic
reason that the gentle slopes of the creek at this point invite the early sunshine, and
that the succession of woods, thickets, aud open spots favor the presence of insects
and seed-producinug plants. In other words, that here the birds find the exact kind
of shelter they require and food in abundance,

“A list of the birds that are known to have nested within the limits of the park,
small though this area is, would include alinost all the land birds credited to the
District. A catalogue of the birds of the District was prepared by Doctors Coues
and Prentiss several years since (1883), and published by the National Museum under
the title of ‘ Avifauna-Columbiana.’

“As, however, having a more intimate relation to the Park, I subjoin a list of the
birds which are known to have nested within the Park area within recent years.
Many of them, it is to be hoped, will refuse to recognize as valid the exclusive
title of possession conferred by Congress, ana will continue to occupy their old
homes as theirs by squatters’ rights. Others doubtless, let us hope a small minority,
will prefer to yicld their ancient titles and move to more secluded spots in the ad-
joining territory.

“‘ But ninety-one species of land birds are known to breed within the limits of the
District, and the following list shows that of this number sixty-one species, or
more than 76 per cent., breed regularly or occasionally within the Park. The
superior advantages it offers to bird life will therefore be readily appreciated.”

Many other creatures likewise find a natural home within these limits, and though
no systematic collection has yet been made, there has been observed during the sea-
son in the Park or its immediate vicinity the common woodchuck, the cotton-tail
rabbit, the Virginia opossum, and the flying squirrel.

BOTANY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

An examination of the flora has been made by Mr. W. Hunter, an employé of the
Park and a competent botanist, who received advice and assistance from Prof. Lester

F. Ward and Prof.

W. H. Knowlton.

The list of plants is necessarily incomplete,

owing to the fact that the observations did not commence until late in the season.
Excluding the trees a list of which has already been given, the following were noted:

GEOLOGY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

A special report upon the geology of the Park has been kindly furnished by Mr.
W.J. McGee, geologist to the Geological Survey.

“There is transmitted herewith a geologically colored map of the National Zoolog-
ical Park.

“Except that the prevailing rock formation is complex in structure and of age not
yet definitely determined, the geology of the Park is exceedingly simple. The for-
mations are:

Re COMbiqece cee es memitome rata oats meisege eeinicet ts Alluvium.
PIGiStOCeN es fe sap seeeaticeeee emacs eeeaeee Columbia loam and gravel.
@retaceousi(?) ses aor icters soca tae eeeeeer Potomac gravel.
Piedmont gneiss.
Arche ama? oases cctecieeciseicecreciars ee cle neers } Vein quartz.
Steatite.

‘Tn addition to these well characterized formations there is a limited variety of
residua left on decomposition of rock in place, of torrential or overplacement depos-
its formed by wash adown slopes, ete.

“The recent alluvium is confined to the channel and flood plain of Rock Creek. It
consists of loam, sand, and gravel partly derived from the older formations within
the Park, but mainly brought in by Rock Creek from beyond the limits of that reser-
vation. These materials are sometimes irregularly stratified, but again assorted into
sheets, sand-banks, gravel-bars, and more extended stretches of loam. It should be
observed that the alluvium area, together with the channel meandering tirough it,
are coterminous wit h the flood plain of Rock Creek, and hence are subject to over-
flow during great freshets.

“The Columbia formation is a deposit of loam, gravel, bowlders, etc., formed dur-
ing the first ice invasion of the glacial period. Its age is therefore early Pleistocene.
About rivers the formation commonly consists of two members, the upper a homoge-
neous loam commonly red or brown in color, and the lower a bed of sand, gravel,
cobble-stones, and bowlders commonly stained brown by ferrie oxide, sometimes
stratified, and here and there displaying a peculiar black stain which is mainly fer-
ruginous, but has been found to contain a trace of cobalt. Along the rivers of the
Middle Atlantic slope the formation is sometimes fashioned into terraces; and some
of its best developments in the District of Columbia (from which the name is taken)
are terraciform. In the Park the deposit displays the usual division into a superior
loam and an inferior bed of coarse materials; and the usual topographic form is as-
sumed since the deposit is practically confined to the pine-clad terrace or bench north
and west of Rock Creek, in the central part of the reservation. The formation is in-
deed confined to these terraces, save that an ill-defined and perhaps scarcely continu-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

ous spur extends into the little valley of the branch that forms the principal affluent
of Rock Creek, and that another spur (from which the loam has been washed, lay-
ing bare the coarse materials of the inferior member) extends southeastward beyond
the terrace-scarp toward the upper angle in the course of Rock Creek. The red loam
of the upper member was derived mainly from the Piedmont gneiss of the upper
reaches of Rock Creek ; while the lower member consists of sand and some loam from
the same source, well-rounded pebbles and cobble-stones from the Potomac formation,
angular or slightly water-worn fragments of quartz from the veins of that material
cutting the gneiss both within the Park and beyond its limits, bowlders of gneiss, ete.

“The Potomac formation is a series of sands, clays, ana gravels extending from tho «
Roanoke to the Delaware, but best developed along the Potomac River, in honor of
which the formation was christened. The age, determined through paleo-botany by
Professor Fontaine, is early Cretaceous; determined from vertebrate paleontology by
Professor Marsh, is Jurassic; and as determined by physical geology the formation
represents the beginning of the Cretaceous. Along its westernmost margin the
formation is usually represented by outlying patches of gravel commonly crowning
eminences; and this is the character displayed in the Park, Five small areas only
occur in the reservation: There is a remnant retaining the original structure crown-
ing the second greatest eminence in the northwestern part; there are two small rem-
nants, one certainly displaying the original structure upon the eminence occupied by
the Holt mansion in the southeastern corner of the reservation; there is a fourth
remnant, which may be in place, but is probably a residuum lef down and disturbed by
the decay of the subjacent gneiss, mid-length of the southwestern boundary; and
there is another small area, which is certainly residual in the northeastern portion.
These remnants and others of like character beyond the limits of the Park are of
especial interest in that their cobble-stones were extersively used by aboriginal men
for the manufacture of rude implements. Modern man also utilizes the cobble-stones
extensively for road-making and other purposes.

‘The Piedmont gneiss is a vast complex of crystalline rocks extending from Ala-
bamato New Jersey. Many rock varieties are recognized within the complex; but
they have not yet been systematically differentiated throughout any considerable
part of the terrane. Within the Park the prevailing rocks are schists varying in
composition from place to place, and varying also in dip and strike. In general the
dip is high, sometimes nearly vertical, and the prevailing strike is northerly and
southerly. The gneissis the prevailing formation of the Park. It is overlain in part
by alluvium and by the Columbia formation, as well as by the isolated remnants of
the Potomac formation; and elsewhere it has been decomposed to a considerable
depth so that it is concealed by a mantle of materials derived from its own destruction
either in place or carried down slopes by gravity and the wash of storm waters. This
mantle of decomposed rock may be 20, 50, or even more feet in thickness, and proba-
bly averages no less than 15 or 20 feet over the entire reservation. So profound has
been this decomposition of the crystalline rocks that exposures occur only in the
steeper bluffs where Rock Creek has corroded rapidly during the later Neocene, Pleis-
tocene, and recent times. The rocks of the Piedmont belt are seldom sufficiently
firm, tough, and durable to yield valuable building stones, and within the Park they
give little promise in this direction. At three points only is the promise even fair:
In the extreme northwestern corner of the reservation, toward the northern end of
the old quarry mid-length of the eastern side, and in the old quarry opposite Adams’s
Mill.

“‘ Within the Park, as beyond its limits, the Piedmont gneisses are frequently inter-
sected by veins of quartz. These range from sheets but a fraction of an inch thick
to great masses many yards across. Some of the more conspicuous examples have
been mapped. No law governing the trend or inclination of these veins is indicated
by these exposures, and no such law has thus far been formulated; but although the
relation of the quartz veins to the gueisses is not apparent, there is an obvious rela-
74. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ‘

tion between these obdurate rock masses and the topography. Many of them appear
in eminences or in the extremities of salients jutting streamward from the general
upland; and even where they have not been observed their existence may be sus-
pected in all the more sharply-cut salients.

‘‘The Piedmont gneiss varies from place to place in mineral composition as well as
in structure, and now and then sheets or masses of steatite—the soapstone of the
aborigines and early white settlers—may be found. This is true within the Park as
well as beyond its limits, and at two points quarries have been opened for the extrac-
tion of these materials for industrial purposes.

“The topographic configuration of the Park is well shown upon the map. The grace-
fully curved hills and steep ravines characteristic of the country about the National
Capital here represent the work of Rock Creek during ages of erosion, and from hills,
valleys, and ravines the systematic geologist reads a record of erosion upon lines
first determined by rock structure, afterward modified by the superposition of an ex-
tensive formation—the Potomac—and finally developed under the influence of these
conditions affected albeit by the structure of the rocks reached by the stream in the
latter stages of its cutting. It is by reason of the varied conditions represented in
this complicated history that, while the configuration is commonly adjusted to the
hard quartz veins, there are cases in which quartz and topography are manifestly
independent in their distribution.

“The Park is watered as well as drained by Rock Creek and a few spring-born
streamlets. Within the reservation there are two walled springs, two others that
have received some attention, and a number of minor seeps; but the yield of these
springs is trifling, none now giving permanent streams and all threatening to diminish
as the surface is further deforested or trampled. Wells of small yield may doubtless
be found by excavating in nearly any part of the Park; but the Potomac and Colum-
bia areas are too small to afford reservoirs; the dips of gneiss are too steep to give
strong subterranean streams, and the structure of the prevailing formation is too
complex to permit determination of such small subterranean water-ways as may
exist; moreover, wells east of Rock Creek will inevitably be contaminated within a
few years, if not at present, in consequence of the recent spread of population over
the adjacent uplands; and there is prospective danger of like contamination west ot
the water-way. Accordingly the Park must look either to Rock Creek or beyond its
own limits for permanent water supply.”

Unmistakable signs of Indian occupation have been found. Professor Holmes,
the archeologist of the Geological Survey, made a careful examination of the bowlder-
beds of the Potomac formation, and found many chipped implements, showing that
here, as elsewhere in the Rock Creek region the quartzite pebbles are shaped into
weapons. While most of those found were the imperfectly formed and rejected
stones, some portions of finished blades were discovered. It is not improbable that
an Indian village once existed within the Park limits, near the soapstone quarry on
the eastern side of the creek.

At the close of the fiscal year, the development and adaptation of this beautiful
region to the purposes of a zoological park were already commenced ; competent
professional advice was procured, and plans were under consideration for accommo-
dating the animals now in the collection and those that will shortly be Added.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX VI.

REPORT ON PROFESSOR MORLEYS RESEARCHES.

WASHINGTON, January 17, 1891.
Prof. 8. P. LANGLEY,

DEAR Sir: The accompanying letter from Prof. A. A. Michelson I can gladly in-
dorse in every particular. Iam familiar with Professor Morley’s work, having fol-
lowed it from the start, and I know it to be the best work of its kind in the history
of science. A part of it involves a re-determination of certain physical constants of
oxygen and hydrogen; and on this side of the question the classical researches of
Regnault are far excelled by the investigations so far made by Morley. Hitherto (for
a period of 3 or 4 years), the experiments have been carried on by Professor Morley at
his own personal expense, without aid from any institution. Such a burden no
private individual should be compelled to bear; and I feel sure that aid given by the
Smithsonian Institution will redound to its credit, and in the most direct manner tend
to fulfill the intention of its founder, himself a chemist.

The work upon which Professor Morley is engaged is, from a chemical stand-point,
fundamental in its character, and it has both a theoretical and a practical hearing.
All of the calculations upon which accurate chemical analyses depend rest upon our
knowledge of the atomie weights; and the ratio between oxygen and hydrogen is the
corner-stone of the entire system. It is both the most important and the most diffi-
cult to measure of all the atomic weight ratios, and it directly affects nearly every
other value in the whole series of constants. Furthermore, all the physical properties
of the atoms are now believed to be functions of their mass, and thisidea is dominant
in the periodic law of Mendelejeff. That law shows the elements to be not independ-
ent of each othez, but closely related ; so that the exact measurement of their atomic
weights bears directly upon the problem of the ultimate constitution of matter. If
all matter is one entity, then the weights of the different so-called ‘‘elementary ”
atoms should be connected by some definite mathematical law; and such a law can
only be developed upon the basis of the most refined experimental researches. In
the measurement of atomic weights ‘‘ accidental errors,” which practically vanish
from averages, do little harm; but the ‘‘ constant errors” are troublesome and all-
pervasive. Furthermore, since one atomic weight serves as the starting point for the
determination of others, the constant errors become cumulative, and their climina-
tion is anything but easy.

In Morley’s determinations of the atomic weight of oxygen, the errors are controlled
by exact manipulation on the one hand, and by wide variations of method on the
other. If six or seven distinct methods of measurement, involving different possibili-
ties of error, give at last the same value sought, then the presumption is that constant
errors have been eliminated altogether. Up to the present date Professor Morley has
investigated the preparation of oxygen and hydrogen in absolute purity, the influence
of impurities in known amounts, the composition of water by volume, and the rela-
tive densities of the two gases. The series of experiments upon the composition of
water by volume have already been made public, and the results obtained are accurate
for a single experiment, to within one part in 26,000. Such accuracy was never before

83
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

approached, even remotely, in investigations of this kind. He now has in view the
synthesis of water by several distinct quantitative processes, and these involve large
weighings. For example, hydrogen is so light that large bulks must be taken in
order that the errors of weighing may not exercise an appreciable influence. In order
to do this, glass globes holding 20 litres are used; and their weight is considerable.
The ordinary analytical balances, ranging from 200 to 1.0000 grammes, are wholly
unavailable for the purpose, and hence an exceptional balance, such as Riiprecht has
made for the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Paris, becomes neces-
sary. In the office of our own Coast and Geodetic Survey there is a balance approach-
ing these in character; so sensitive as to show the difference between two standard
kilogrammes placed side by side or one on top of the other. This difference in posi-
tion of two weights is a difference of distance from the center of the earth of a few
centimetres only, and yet it corresponds to a difference in weight of about .000015
gramme. This difference, according to Professor Mendenhall, is perfectly appreci-
able with the balances now in use. I can not say whether or not Riiprecht keeps
these finer balances in stock, but I suspect that one would have to be built to order,
so that some months would elapse before it could be delivered. The cost should not
exceed $500, and the balance, after serving Professor Morley’s purpose, might be
returned to the Institution, where it would have permanent value. The present
investigation could thus be assisted with little or no actual sinking of capital, and
the aid to research would continue long after the single investigation of Professor
Morley was finished. I sincerely hope that the assistance sought may be given.
Very respectfully,
F. W. CLARKE.

REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ORIENTALISTS.

Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Washington, D. C.:

Sir: In accordance with your instruction I attended the Eighth International
Congress of Orientalists as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution. The meetings of
the congress were held in Stockholm and Christiania, under the auspices of His
Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway, from September 1 to September 12, 1889.
The members assembled in Stockholm on September 1 and adjourned on September
7 to meet in Christiania from September 8 to September 11. September 12 was spent
in Gébtheburg, where a farewell reception was given.

Five general meetings were held and the various sections met daily for the trans-
action of business.

There were registered as subscribers to the congress 710 names (204 Scandinavians
and 506 foreigners); more than one-half of the (286) foreign members were present.
The foreign members came from twenty-eight different countries, as indicated in the
following table:

* In the London Academy of November 1, 1890, it is stated that the congress was
attended by 459 Europeans, 16 Americans, 13 Asiatic, and 5 African scholars. This
calculation is evidently based on the supposition that the Swedish and Norwegian
subscribers were all present.

Comparing these figures with those of the preceding Oriental congresses it would
seem that there is an increase of devotion to Oriental studies among European schol-
ars. At the Seventh Congress, held at Vienna in 1886, there were 414 subscribers
and 228 members present; at the Sixth Congress, held at Leyden in 1883, there were
453 subscribers and 219 members present; at the Fifth Congress, held at Berlin in
1881, there were 296 subscribers and 189 members present.

This marked increase was no doubt chiefly due to the circulation of a special
American edition of the programme for the Stockholm Congress, published by the
Smithsonian Institution at the request of the secretary-general of the congress,
Count Landberg. This circular contained a revised English translation of the original
programme ineluding additions and corrections especially furnished for this purpose
by the secretary-general of the congress. Copies of this circular were sent to all the
members of the American Oriental Society as well as to a great many libraries and
colleges in this country.

But three American institutions were represented by delegates: Brown University,
Providence, Rhode island, by Prof. Alonzo Williams, and the Smithsonian Institution
and the Johns Hopkins University by Prof. Paul Haupt.

It is to be regretted that the American Oriental Society did not sent a delegate to
the congress. The sending of a representative and the presentation of a complete set
of the journal ot the American Oriental Society to the honorary president of the con-
gress would have been appreciated. There was no delegate of the United States
Government, nor had England, Germany, or Prussia responded to the invitation to
send governmental delegates. The following countries sent such delegates.

Austria, Coburg-Gotha, Italy, Russia,
Baden, Denmark, Japan, Roumania,
Bavaria, Egypt, Netherlands, — Saxony,
Bosnia, France, Persia, Siam,
Brazil, India, Portugal, Turkey.
The following universities were represented :

Bombay, Giessen, Kasan, Petersburg,
Brown, Greifswald, London, Prague,
Cambridge, Halle, Rund, Rome,
Copenhagen, Helsingfors. Munich, Upsala,
Edinburgh, Johns Hopkins, Oxford, Vienna.

‘T may be allowed to mention especially Charles A. Briggs, D. C. Gilman, Profes-
sor Henry, Professor Salisbury, A. Van Name, Andrew D. White, W. D. Whitney;
the American Oriental Society, the Philosophical Sagiety, of Hartford, Connecticut ;
the Smithsonian Institution. The late Dr. Schliemann, too, is registered as one of
the American subscribers.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89

Among the learned societies and institutions represented by delegates may be men-
tioned the Royal Asiatic Society, the Society of Biblical Archeology, the Palestine
Exploration Fund, the India Ottice of London, the Asiatie Society of Bengal, the
Société Asiatique of Paris, the German Oriental Society, the Vatican Library, the
Royal Academies of Rome, Turin, Munich, Pesth, ete.

In accordance with the statement in the programme that the patron and honorary
president of the congress would be pleased to accept such works as would be depos-
ited for presentation to His Majesty, scholars and institutions all over the world
offered more than 3,000 valuable works and serials covering the entire range of orien-
tal studies.

The following works were presented by American institutions and scholars:

1. American Mission Press and American Bible Society, Beirut, Syria. About 50
Arabic publications. (See Liste des auvrages offerts, p. 19.)

2. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.

a. The American Journal of Philology, volumes I-1x, Baltimore, 1878~89.

b. Johns Hopkins University Circulars, volumes I-viil, Baltimore, 1872~89.

ce. The Williams Manuscript. Reproduction in phototype of 17 pages of a Syriac
MS. containing the Epistles known as ‘‘ Antilegomena,” Baltimore, 1876.

d. Contributions to Assyriology and Comparative Semitic Philolegy, edited by
Friedrich Delitzsch and Paul Haupt, with the codperation of the Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, Maryland, volume 1, part 1, Leipsic, 1889,

3. The Smithsonian Institution on behalf of the U. S. National Museum:

Assyrian and Babylonian seals, facsimiles and flat impressions, illustrating the
method after which the smaller Assyro-Babylonian objects preserved in private Amer-
ican collections are reproduced for the study collection at the U.S. National Mu-
seum.

Owing to a mistake of the European Express Company the box containing these
objects did not arrive in time to be presented to the king at the general meeting of
the congress in Stockholm. At the request of the Smithsonian delegate the United
States minister to Sweden and Norway, Gen. W. W. Thoinas, submitted the presents
to King Oscar at a special audience. The expression of interest by the king on that
occasion was conveyed in a letter of General Tbomas herewith subjoined :

UNITED STatTEs LEGATION,

Stockholm, November 12, 1889.
Prof. PAUL HAUPT:

My Dear Sir: Your note from on board the steamer was duly received, and some
time after the box came to hand.

I might at once have sent the box through the usual official channels to the king,
but on opening it I found its contents of such value, and so neatly and orderly ar-
ranged and classified that I desired to make sure that His Majesty should see this
model gift of the Smithsonian.

The opportunity desired has occurred.

I to-day had an audience of the King.

I took the box with me and had it carried into the audience chamber. In the ante
room I unpacked and took out the inner box, and also unpacked some of the little
boxes and the ancient seals contained therein. His Majesty himself took up the fine
inner box or tray, containing all the small boxes, placed it on his writing desk, read
the large general inscription in gold letters on black ground, and examined carefully
several of the Assyrian seals and casts, and expressed his admiration at the beauty and
clearness of the seals and the skill and method of the arrangement.

The King said he should take time at his leisure to look over the seals more thor-
oughly, and would then decide where to place the tray. His Majesty also desired me
to express his thanks to the Smithsonian Institution for this beautiful and useful gift-
as well as his appreciation of the method and skill displayed in the cases and general
arrangement.
90) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congratulating the Smithsonian and yourself, not only upon this present and its
gracious reception, but upon the general exhibit made by the United States at the
Oriental Congress at Stockholm in seals and books, and last and best, in men,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

meeting was opened in the name of the King by the minister of public instruction. The
King had offered two prizes (by special decree of January 6, 1886), one for a work on
the History of the Semitic Languages, and the other on the Civilization of the Arab
Muhammed. No works of European or American Orientalists were submitted to the
special committee appointed for the purpose of reporting the recommendation for the
award of the prizes. But six Arabic workson the second-named subject by Oriental
authors had beer sent to the committee, and one of these Oriental scholars, Mahmud
Shookree el-Aloasee of Baghdad, though not coming up fully to the requirements,
was considered worthy of King Oscar’s gold medal for art and science, with the rib-
bon of the order of Wasa.

Quite a number of native scholars from the East were present and took an active
part in the proceedings.

Abdallah Fikri Pasha spoke on the Divan of Hasan Ibn Thabit.

Sheikh Hamza Fathallah: On the right of women in the Islam.

Mahmud Omar: On Arabic proverbs in Egypt.

Emin Bey Fikri: Against those who prefer modern Arabic tothe classical language.

These three papers were in Arabic, the following native Oriental scholars spoke in
English:

Jivanji Jamshedji Modi: On the position of the Haoma in the Avesta of the Parsecs.

In his opening address the secretary-general called attention to this special feature
of the congress, and expressed the hope that this active participation on the part f
native Oriental scholars would be the starting point of a new era for the civilization
of the East.

A great many of the most distinguished Orientalists from all parts of the globe were
present, among them may be mentioned: Brugsch, Biihler, Chwolson, Dillmann,
Euting, Giusburg, de Goeje, Donner, Gubernatis, Guidi, Halévy, Kern, Kremer,
Mehren, Max Miiller, Oppert, Reinisch, de Rosny, Rost, Sayce, Schefer, Schlegel,
J. Schmidt, Spiegel, Weber.

Over a hundred papers of great value were read :

Twenty-four in the Semitic section Ia (Arabie and Islam).

Twenty-six in T section Ib (cuneiform research, etc).

Twenty-two in section II (Aryan).

Nineteen in section III (Egyptian, etc.),

The following papers were read by American Orientalists:

a. Prof. Paul Haupt, The Death of Sargon IT.

b. Prof. Henry Hyvernat, the paleographical introduction to his Acts of the
Martyrs in Egypt.

e Chas. G. Leland: The Pidjin (Chinese-English) dialect and its relation to
other mixed dialects, followed by a communication on the dissidence of the Chi-
nese philosophers concerning the question of human nature.

The scientific character of the meeting, however, was somewhat impaired by the
almost excessive hospitality of the Scandinavian hosts, and especially by the number
of tourists who attracted by the programme attended. It looked occasionally as
though the Congress were rather a succession of festivities than a serious gathering
of scholars for scientific purposes. It was especially regretted that there was hardly
any time for private intercourse between individual fellow-workers. Since the meet-
ing of the Congress some feeling has developed against so great a display of hospi-
tality in the future.

Where the next International Congress of Orientalists is to meet has not yet been
determined.

At the general meeting of all the sections held at Stockholm on August 6, under
the presidency of King Oscar, it was suggested by the delegate of the Smithsonian
Institution (after a special meeting of all the American orientalists present, with the
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Awerican minister in the chair) that the Tenth Congress should be held in America in
1893. The idea seemed to meet with general approval, but it remains to be seen
whether the American orientalists will be ready to extend a formal invitation.

Professor Haupt addressed King Oscar at this occasion as follows: -

‘‘T have the honor to present to your majesty the first part of a new publication
which is intended to contribute, above all, to the solution of the problem set by your
majesty, viz, the history of the Semitic languages. The series is entitled Contri-
butions to Assyriology and Comparative Semitic Philology. I submié the first part
on behalf of the Johns Hopkins University, of Baltimore, with whose co-operation the
work is published. I beg leave to add some other publications issued under the au-
spices of the Johns Hopkins University.

“1, The photo lithographic re- production of 17 pages of a Syriac MS.

“2, A complete series of the Johns Hopkins University circulars, which report on
the development of this new university since the year 1879 and which contain at
the same time numerous contributions to Oriental research. :

“©3. The 9 volumes of the American Journal of Philology (published at Baltimore
under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins University) which contain several impor-
tant articles of our venerable leader in Oriental philology, Professor Whitney, as well
as papers by other American orientalists, both Indo-European and Semitic.

“ Tam also instructed as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution to present to your
majesty on behalfof the U. S. National Museum a number of Babylonian and As-
syrian seals (facsimiles and flat impressions) illustrating the methods after which
smaller Assyrian and Babylonian objects preserved in private American collections
are reproduced for the study collection of the U. S. National Museum.

‘‘Your majesty will see what interest is had in America in Oriental studies, espe-
cially in cuneiform research. There are more instractors in Assyriology now in the
United States than at all the European universities combined. Also at this con-
gress there are nearly forty American orientalists inscribed as members.

‘¢7, Ican not suppress the hope that our European follow-workers in view of the pro-
gress of Oriental studies in America will be willing before long to have, perhaps, the
Tenth International Congress of Orientalists meet in the United States. The dis-
tance will hardly deter many. It will, perhaps, be possible to place at the disposal of
the members a steamer which would carry them to America and back again to
Europe. Nor would the attendance at the Congress take much time. Even in case
there should be 6 days in Washington (or wherever we should agree to meet), followed
by an excursion to the West, Chicago, the Lake region, Niagara Falls, and thence,
again, through Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to Washington, it
would be possible to do all that (including the passage across the Atlantic both ways)
in a little more than one month. The gracious interest which your majesty has
devoted to Oriental studies will always exercise an encouraging influence, and I
trust that at the meeting of the Congress on American soil we shall not be too far
behind the older Enropean centers of Oriental learning.”

Respectfully submitted.
PAUL HAUPT.
GENERAL APPENDIX

SMITHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1890.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charac-
ter or on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly
to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in
the Smithsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous Collections as -
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more reinarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, been
carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would possess
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the dis-continuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthropol-
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfac-
factorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1890.

THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
TO THE PRESENT DAY.*

By HERMANN SCHUBERT.

J.—UNIVERSAL INTEREST IN THE PROBLEM.

For two and a half thousand years both trained and untrained minds
have striven in vain tosolve the problem known as the squaring of the
circle. Now that geometers have at last succeeded in giving a rigid
demonstration of the impossibility of solving the problem with ruler
and compasses, it seems fitting and opportune to cast a glance into the
nature and bistory of this very ancient problem. And this will be
found all the more justifiable in view of the fact that the squaring of
the circle, at least in naine, is very widely known outside of the narrow
limits of professional mathematicians.

The resolution of the French Academy.—The Proceedings of the French
Academy for the year 1775 contain, at page 61, the resolution of the
Academy not to examine, from that time on, any so-called solutions of
the quadrature of the circle that might be handed in. The Academy
was driven to this determination by the overwhelming multitude of pro-
fessed solutions of the famous problem, which were sent to it every
month in the year—solutions which, of course, were an invariable attes-
tation of the ignorance and self-consciousness of their authors, but
which suffered collectively from a very important error in mathematics :
they were wrong. Since that time all professed solutions of the problem
received by the Academy find a sure haven in the waste-basket, and re-
main unanswered for all time. The circle-squarer, however, sees in
this high-hauded manner of rejection only the envy of the great towards
his grand intellectual discovery. He is determined to meet with recog-
nition, and appeals, therefore, to the public. The newspapers must
obtain for him the appreciation that scientific societies have denied.
And every year the old mathematical sea serpent more than once dis-
ports itself in the columns of our papers, that a Mr. N. N., of P. P., has
at last solved the problem of the quadrature of the circle.

98 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

General ignorance of quadrators.—But what kind of people are these
circle-squarers, when examined by the light? Almost always they will
be found to be imperfectly educated persons, whose mathematical know-
ledge does not exceed that of a modern college freshman. It is seldom
that they know accurately what the requirements of the problem are
and what its nature. They never know the two and a half thousand
years’ history of the problem, and they have no idea whatever of the
important investigations and results which have been made with ref-
erence to the problem by great and real mathematicians in every cen-
tury down to our time.

A cyclometric type.—Yet great as is the quantum of ignorance that
circle-squarers intermix with their intellectual products, the lavish sup-
ply of conceit and self-consciousness with which they season their per-
formances is still greater. I have not far to go to furnish a verification
of this. A book printed in Hamburg in the year 1840 lies before me, in
which the author thanks Almighty God at every second page that He
has selected him and no one else to solve the “ problem phenomenal”
of mathematics, ‘so long sought for, so fervently desired, and attempt-
ed by millions.” After the modest author has proclaimed himself the
unmasker of Archimedes’s deceit, he says: “It thus has pleased our
mother nature to withhold this mathematical jewel from the eye of bu-
man investigation until she thought it fitting to reveal truth to sim-
plicity.”

This will suffice to show the great self-consciousness of the author.
But it does not suffice to prove his ignorance. He has no conception of
mathematical demonstration; he takes it for granted that things are so
because they seem so to him. Errors of logic, also, are abundantly
found in his book. But apart from this general incorrectness, let us
see wherein the real gist of his fallacy consists. It requires consider-
able labor to find out what this is from the turgid language and bom-
bastie style in which the arthor has buried his conclusions. But it is
this: The author inscribes a square in a circle, cireumscribes another
about it, then points out that the inside square is made up of four con-
gruent triangles, whereas the circumscribed square is made up of eight
such triangles; from which fact, seeing that the circle is larger than
the one square and smaller than the other, he draws the bold conelusion
that the circle is equal in area to six such triangles. It is hardly con-
ceivable that a rational being could infer that something which is
greater than 4 and less than 8 must necessarily be 6. But with a man
that attempts the squaring of the circle this kind of ratiocination is
possible.

Similarly in the case of all other attempted solutions of the problem,
either logical fallacies or violations of elementary arithmetical or geo-
metrical truths may be pointed out.. Only they are not always of
such a trivial nature as in the book just mentioned.

Let us now inquire whence the inclination arises which leads people
to take up the quadrature of the circle and to attempt to solve it.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 99

The allurements of the problem.—Attention must first be called to
the antiquity of the problem. A quadrature was attempted in Egypt
500 years before the exodus of the Israelites. Among the Greeks the
problem never ceased to play a part that greatly influenced the pro-
gress of mathematics. And in the middle agesalso the squaring of the
circle sporadically appears as the philosopher’s stone of mathematics.
The problem has thus never ceased to be dealt with and considered.
But it is not by the antiquity of the problem that circle-squarers are
enticed, but by the allurement which everything exerts that is caleu-
lated to raise the individual out of the mass of ordinary humanity, and
to bind about his temples the laurel crown of celebrity. It is ambition
that spurred men on in ancient Greece and still spurs them on in mod-
ern times to crack this primeval mathematical nut. Whether they are
competent thereto is a secondary consideration. They look upon the
squaring of the circle as the grand prize of a lottery that can just as
well fall to their lot as to that of any other. They do not remember
that—

Toil before honor is placed by sagacious decrees of Immortals,

and that it requires years of continued studies to gain possession of the
mathematical weapons that are indispensably necessary to attack the
problem, but which even in the hands of the most distinguished math-
ematical strategists have not sufficed to take the stronghold.

About the only problem known to the lay world.—But how is it, we
must further ask, that it happens to be the squaring of the circle and
not some other unsolved mathematical problem upon which the efforts
of people are bestowed who have no knowledge of mathematics yet
busy themselves with mathematical questions? The question is
answered by the fact that the squaring of the circle is about the only
mathematical problem that is known to the unprofessional world—at
least by name. Even among the Greeks the problem was very widely
known outside of mathematical circles. In the eyes of the Grecian
layman, as at present among many of his modern brethren, occupation
with this problem was regarded as the most important and essential
business of mathematicians. In fact they had a special word to desig-
nate this species of activity, namely, cetpaywxilev, which means to
busy one’s self with the quadrature. In modern times, also, every ed-
ucated person, though he be not a mathematician, knows the problem
by name, and knows that it is insolvable, or at least, that despite the
efforts of the most famous mathematicians it has not yet been solved.
For this reason the phrase “to square the circle,” is now used in the
sense of attempting the impossible. *

Belief that rewards have been offered.—But in addition to the antiquity
of the problem, and the fact also that it is known to the lay world, we
have yet a third factor to point out that induces people to take up with
it. This is the report that has been spread abroad for a hundred years
now, that the Academies, the Queen of England, or some other influen-
100 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE,

tial person, has offered a great prize to be given to the one that first
solves the problem. Asa matter of fact we find the hope of obtaining
this large prize of money the principal incitement to action with many
circle-squarers. And the author of the book above referred to begs his
readers to lend him their assistance in obtaining the prizes offered.

The problem among mathematicians.—Although the opinion is widely
current in the unprofessional world that professional mathematicians
are still busied with the solution of the problem, this is by no means
the case. On the contrary, for some two hundred years, the endeavors
of many considerable mathematicians have been solely directed towards
demonstrating with exactness that the problem is insolvable. It is, as
a rule—and naturally—more difficult to prove that something is impos-
sible than to prove that it is possible. And thus it has happened, that
up to within a few years ago, despite the employment of the most varied
and the most comprehensive methods of modern mathematics, no one
succeeded in supplying the wished-for demonstration of the problem’s
impossibility. At last, Professor Lindemann, of Koénigsberg, in June,
1882, succeeded in furnishing a demonstration—and the first demonstra-
tion—that it is impossible by the exclusive employment of ruler and
compasses to construct a square that is mathematically exactly equal
in area toa given circle. The demonstration, naturally, was not effected
with the help of the old elementary methods; for if it were, it would
surely have been accomplished centuries ago; but methods were requis-
ite that were first furnished by the theory of definite integrals and de-
partments of higher algebra developed in the last decades ; in other
words, it required the direct and indirect preparatory labor of many
centuries to make finally possible a demonstration of the insolvability
of this historic problem.

Of course, this demonstration will have no more effect than the reso-
lution of the Paris Academy of 1775 in causing the fecund race of
circle-squarers to vanish from the face of the earth. In the future as
in the past, there will be people who know nothing and will not want
to know anything of this demonstration, and who believe that they
can not help but succeed in a matter in which others have failed, and
that just they have been appointed by Providence to solve the famous
puzzle. But unfortunately the ineradicable passion of wanting to
solve the quadrature of the circle has also its serious side. Circle-
squarers are not always so self-contented as the author of the book we
have mentioned. They often see or at least divine the insuperable
difficulties that tower up before them, and the conflict between their
aspirations and their performances, the consciousness that they want
to solve the problem but are unable to solve it, darkens their soul and,
lost to the world, they become interesting subjects for the science of
psychiatry.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 101
I1.—NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.

Numerical rectification.—If we have a circle before us, it is easy for us
to determine the length of its radius or of its diameter, which must be
donble that of the radius; and the question next arises to find the num-
ber that represents how many times larger its circumference, that is the
length of the circular line, is than its radius or its diameter. From the
fact that all circles have the same shape it follows that this proportion
will always be the same for both iarge and small circles. Now, since
the time of Archimedes, all civilized nations that have cultivated math-
ematics have called the number that denotes how many times larger
than the diameter the circumference of a circle is, z—the Greek initial
letter of the word periphery. To compute z, therefore, means to calceu-
late how many times larger the circumference of a circle is than its
diameter. This calculation is called ‘‘the numerical rectification of the
circle.”

The numerical quadrature.—Next to the calculation of the cireumfer-
ence, the calculation of the superficial contents of a circle by means of
its radius or diameter is perbaps most important; that is, the computa-
tion of how much area that part of a plane which les within a circle
measures. This calculation is called the “numerical quadrature.” It
depends, however, upon the problem of numerical rectification; that is,
upon the calculation of the magnitude of z. For it is demonstrated in
elementary geometry that the area of a circle is equal to the area of a
triangle produced by drawing in the circle a radius, erecting at the ex-
tremity of the same a tangent—that is, in this case a perpendicular—
cutting off upon the latter the length of the circumference, measuring
from the extremity, and joining the point thus obtained with the center
of the circle. But it follows from this that the area of a circle is as
many times larger than the square upon its radius as the number x
amounts to.

Constructive rectification and quadrature.—The numerical rectification
and numerical quadrature of the circle based upon the computation of
the number = are to be clearly distinguished from problems that require
a Straightline equal in length tothe circumference of a circle, or a square
equal in area to a circle, to be constructively produced out of its radius
or its diameter; problems which might properly be called “ constructive
rectification” or ‘constructive quadrature.” Approximately, of course,
by employing an approximate value for = these problems are easily
solvable. But to solve a problem of construction, in geometry, means
to solve it with mathematical exactitude. If the value z were exactly
equal to the ratio of two whole numbers to one another, the constructive
rectification would present no difficulties. For example, suppose the
circumference of a circle were exactly 31 times greater than its diam-
eter; then the diameter could be divided into seven equal parts, which
could be easily done by the principles of planimetry with ruler and
102 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

compasses, then we would produce to the amount of such a part a
Straight line exactly three times larger than the diameter, and should
thus obtain a straight line exactly equal to the circumference of the
circle. But asa matter of fact, and as has actually been demonstrated,
there do not exist two whole numbers, be they ever so great, that exactly
represent by their proportion to one another the number =z. Conse-
quently, a rectification of the kind just described does not attain the
object desired.

It might be asked here, whether from the demonstrated fact that the
number z is not equal to the ratio of two whole numbers however great,
it does not immediately follow that it is impossible to construct a
straight line exactly equal in length to the circumference of a circle ;
thus demonstrating at once the impossibility of solving the problem.
This question is to be answered in the negative. For there are in
geometry many sets of two lines of which the one can be easily con-
structed from the other, notwithstanding the fact that no two whole
numbers can be found to represent the ratio of the twolines. Theside
and the diagonal of a square, for instance, are so constituted. It is
true the ratio of the latter two magnitudes is nearly that of 5 to 7.
But this proportion is not exact, and there are in fact no two numbers
that represent the ratio exactly. Nevertheless, either of these two
lines can be easily constructed from the other by the sole employment of
ruler and compasses. This might be the case, too, with the rectifica-
tion of the circle; and consequently from the impossibility of represent-
ing z by the ratio between two whole numbers the impossibility of the
problem of rectification is not inferable.

The quadrature of the circle stands and falls with the problem of
rectification. This is based upon the truth above mentioned, that a cir-
cle is equal in area tu a right-angle triangle, in which one side is equal
to the radius of the circle and the other to the circumference. Sup-
posing, accordingly, that the circumference of the circle were rectified,
then we could construct this triangle. But every triangle, as is taught
in the elements of planimetry, can, with the help of ruler and com-
passes, be converted into a square exactly equal to it in area. So that,
therefore, Supposing the rectification of the circumference of a circle
were successfully performed, a square could be constructed that would
be exactly equal in area to the circle.

The dependence upon one another of the three problems of the com-
putation of the number =z, of the quadrature of the circle, and its reeti:
fication, thus obliges us, in dealing with the history of the quadrature,
to regard investigations with respect to the value of z.and attempts to
rectify the circle as of equal importance, and to consider them accord-
ingly.

Conditions of the geometrical solution—We have used repeatedly in
the course of the discussion the expression ‘‘ to construct with ruler and

ee
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 103

compasses.” It will be necessary (o explain what is meant by the speci-
fication of these two instruments. When such a number of conditions
is annexed to a requirement in geometry to construct a certain figure
that the construction only of one figure or a limited number of figures
is possible in accordance with the conditions given, such a complete
requirement is called a problem of construction, or briefly a problem.
When a problem of this kind is presented for solution it is necessary to
reduce it to simpler problems, already recognized as solvable ; and since
these latter depend in their turn upon other still simpler problems, we
are finally brought back to certain fundamental problems, upon which
the rest are based but which are not themselves reducible to problems
less simple. These fundamental problems are, so to speak, the under-
most stones of the edifice of geometrical construction. The question
next arises as to what problems may be properly regarded as funda-
mental; and it has been found that the solution of a great part of the
problems that arise in elementary planimetry rests upon the solution
of only five original problems. They are:

(1) The construction of a straight line which shall pass through two
given points.

(2) The construction of a circle the center of which is a given point
and the radius of which has a given length.

(3) The determination of the point that lies coincidently on two given
straight lines extended as far as is necessary—in case such a point
(point of intersection) exists.

(4) The determination of the two points that lie coincidently on a
given straight line and a given cirele—in case such common points
(points of intersection) exist.

(5) The determination of the two points that lie coincidently on two
given circles—in case such common points (points of intersection) exist.

For the solution of the three last of these five problems the eye alone
is needed, while for the solution of the two first problems, besides pen-
cil, ink, chalk, and the like, additional special instruments are required :
for the solution of the first problem a ruler is most generally used, and
for the solution of the second a pair of compasses. But it must be re-
membered that it is no concern of geometry what mechanical instru-
ments are employed in the solution of the five problems mentioned.
Geometry simply limits itself to the pre-supposition that these problems
are solvable and regards a complicated problem as solved if, upon a
specification of the constructions of which the solution consists, no other
requirements are demanded than the five above mentioned. Since, ac-
cordingly, geometry does not itself furnish the solution of these five
problems, but rather exacts them, they are termed postulates.* All

* Usually geometers mention only two postulates (Nos.1 and 2). But since to ge-
ometry proper it is indifferent whether only the eye, or additional special mechani-
cal instruments are necessary, the author has regarded it more correct in point of
method to assume five postulates.

104 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

problems of planimetry are not reducible to these five problems alone,
There are problems that can be solved only by assuming other prob-
lems as solvable which are not included in the five given: for example,
the construction of an ellipse, having given its center and its major
and minor axes. Many problems, however, possess the property of be-
ing solvable with the assistance solely of the five postulates above for-
mulated, and where this is the case they are said to be ‘“‘ constructible
with ruler and compasses,” or ‘‘elementarily” constructible.

After these general remarks upon the solvability of problems of geo-
metrical construction, which an understanding of the history of the
squaring of the circle makes indispensably neeessary, the significance
of the question whether the quadrature of the circle is or is not solva-
ble, that is, elementarily solvable, will become intelligible. But the
conception just discussed of elementary solvability only gradually took
clear form, and we therefore find among the Greeks as well as among
the Arabs, endeavors, successful in some respects, that aimed at solv-
ing the quadrature of the circle with other expedients than the five
postulates. We have also to take these endeavors into consideration,
and especially so as they, no less than the unsuccessful efforts at ele-
mentary solution, have upon the whole advanced the science of geome-
try and contributed much to the clarification of geometrical ideas.

III.—HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS.

The Egyptian Quadrature.—In the oldest mathematical work that we
possess we find a rule that tells us how to make a square which is equal
in area to a given circle. This celebrated book, the Papyrus Rhind of
the British Museum, translated and explained by Eisenlohr (Leipsie,
1887), was written, asit is stated in the work, in the thirty-third year of
the reign of King Ra-a-us, by a seribe of that monarch, named Ahmes.
The composition of the work falls accordingly into the period of the two
Hiksos dynasties, that is, in the period between 2000 and 1700 8B. c. But
there is another important cireumstance attached to this. Ahmes men-
tions in his introduction that he composed his work after the model
of old treatises, written in the time of King Raenmat; whence it appears
that the originals of the mathematical expositions of Ahmes, are half
a thousand years older yet than the Papyrus Rhind.

The rule given in this papyrus for obtaining a square equal to a cir-
cle, specifies that the diameter of the circle shall be shortened one-
ninth of its length and upon the shortened line thus obtained a square
crected. Of course, the area of a square of this construction is only ap-
proximately equal to the area of the circle. An idea may be obtained
of the degree of exactness of this original, primitive quadrature by our
remarking that if the diameter of the circle in question is one metre
in length, the square that is supposed to be equal to the circle is a lit-
tle less than half a square decimetre larger; an approximation not so
accurate as that computed by Archimedes, yet much more correct than
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 105

many 2 one later employed. It is not known how Ahmes or his pre-
decessors arrived at this approximate quadrature; but it is certain
that it was handed down in Egypt from century to century, and in late
Egyptian times it repeatedly appears.

The Biblical and Babylonian quadratures.—Besides among the Egyp-
tians we also findin pre-Grecian antiquity an attempt at circle-compu-
tation among the Babylonians. This is not a quadrature; but aims at
the rectification of the circumference. The Bablyonian mathematicians
had discovered that if the radius of a cirele be successively inscribed
as chord within its circumference, after the sixth inscription we arrive
at the point of departure, and they concluded from this that the cireum-
ference of a circle must be a little larger than a line which is six times
as long as the radius, that is, three times as long as the diameter. A
trace of this Babylonian method of computation may even be found in
the Bible; for in 1 Kings vii, 23, and 11 Chron. iv, 2, the great laver is
described, which under the name of the ‘‘molten sea” constituted an
ornament of the Temple of Solomon; and it is said of this vessel that it
measured 10 cubits from brim to brim, and 30 eubits roundabout. The
number 3 as the ratio between the circumference and the diameter is
still more plainly given in the Talmud, where we read that “ that which
measures three lengths in circumference is one length across.”

Among the Greeks.—With regard to the earlier Greek mathemati-
cians—as Thales and Pythagoras—we know that they acquired the
foundations of their mathematical knowledge in Egypt. But nothing
has been handed down to us which shows that they knew of the old
Egyptian quadrature, or that they dealt with the problem at all. But
tradition says that subsequently the teacher of Euripides and Pericles,
the great philosopher and mathematician Anaxagoras, whom Plato
so highly praised, ‘‘drew the quadrature of the circle” in prison, in the
year 434. This is the account of Plutarch in the seventeenth chapter
of his work “ De Exilio.”

Anaxagoras.—The method is not told us in which Anaxagoras had
supposably solved the problem, and it is not said whether knowingly
or unknowingly he accomplished an approximate solution after the
manner of Ahmes. But at any rate, to Anaxagoras belongs the merit
of having called attention to a problem that bore great fruit, in having

incited Grecian scholars to busy themselves with geometry, and thus
more and more to advance that science.

The quadratrix of Hippias of Hlis.—Again, it is reported that the
mathematician Hippias of Elis invented a eurved line that could be
made to serve a double purpose; first, to trisect an angle, and, second,
to square thecircle. This curved line is the tetpaywyviZovca so often men-
tioned by the later Greek mathematicians, and by the Romans, called
“quadratrix.” Regarding the nature of this curve we have exact knowl-
edge from Pappus. But it will be sufficient, here, to state that the
quadratrix is not acircle nor a portion of a circle, so that its construc-
106 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

tion is not possible by means of the postulates enumerated in the
preceding section. And therefore the solution of the quadrature of the
circle founded on the construction of the quadratrix is not an elementary
solution in the sense discussed in the last section.. We can, it is true,
conceive a mechanism that will draw this curve as well as compasses
draw a cirele; and with the assistance of a mechanism of this descrip-
tion the squaring of the circle is solvable with exactitude. But if it be
allowed toemploy in a solution an apparatus especially adapted thereto,
every problem may be said to be solvable. Strictly taken, the invention
of the curve of Hippias substitutes for one insuperable difficulty another
equally insuperable. Sometime afterwards, about the year 350, the
mathematician Dinostratus showed that the qguadratrix could also be
used to solve the problem of rectification, and from that time on this
problem plays almost the same role in Grecian mathematics as the
related problem of quadrature.

The Sophists’ solution.—As these problems gradually became known to
the non-mathematicians of Greece, attempts at solution at once sprang
up that are worthy of a place by the side of the solutions of modern ama-
teur circle-squarers. The Sophists, especially, believed themselves com-
petent by seductive dialectic to take a stronghold that had defied the
intellectual onslaughts of the greatest mathematicians. With verbal
nicety, amounting to puerility, it was said that the squaring of the circle
depended upon the finding of a number which represented in itself both
a square and acircle; a square by being a square number, a circle in
that it ended with the same number as the root number from which, by
multiplication with itself, it was produced. The number 36, accord-
ingly, was, as they thought, the one that embodied the solution of the
famous problem.

Contrasted with this twisting of words the speculations of Bryson and
Antiphon, both contemporaries of Socrates, though inexact, appear ip
high degree intelligent.

Antiphon’s attempt.—Antiphon divided the circle into four equal ares,
and by joining the points of division obtained a square; he then divided
each are again into two equal parts and thus obtained an inscribed octa-
gon; thence he constructed an inscribed dodecagon, and perceived that
the figure so inscribed more and more approached the shape of a circle.
In this way, he said, one should proceed, until there was inscribed in
the circle a polygon whose sides. by reason of their smallness should
coincide with the circle. Now this polygon could, by methods already
taught by the Pythagoreans, be converted into a square of equal area;
and upon the basis of this fact Antiphon regarded the squaring of the
circle as solved.

Nothing can be said against this method except that, however far
the bisection of the ares is carried, the result must still remain an ap-
proximate one.

Bryson of Heraklea.—The attempt of Bryson of Heraklea was better
still; for this scholar did not rest content with finding a square that was
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 107

very little smaller than the circle, but obtained by means of circumscribed
polygons another square that was very little larger tha. the circle. Only
Bryson committed the error of believing that the area of the circle was
the arithmeticai mean between an inscribed and a circumscribed polygon
of an equal number of sides. Notwithstanding this error, however, to
Bryson belongs the merit, first, of having introduced into mathematics
by his emphasis of the necessity of a square which was too large and
one which was too small, the conception of maximum and minimum
“limits” in approximations; and secondly, by his comparison with a
cirele of the inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons, the merit of
having indicated to Archimedes the way by which an approximate
value for = was to be reached.

Hippocrates of Chios.—Not long after Antiphon and Bryson, Hippo-
erates of Chios treated the problem, which had now become more and
more famous, from a new point of view. Hippocrates was not satisfied
with approximate equalities, and searched for curvilinearly bounded
plane figures which should be mathematically equal to a rectilinearly
bounded figure, and therefore could be converted by ruler and compasses
into a square equal in area. First, Hippocrates found that the crescent:
shaped plane figure produced by drawing two perpendicular radii in a
circle and describing upon the line joining their extremities a semicircle,
is exactly equal in area to the triangle that is formed by this line of
junction and the two radii; and upon the basis of this fact the endeavors
of the untiring scholar were directed towards converting a circle into a
crescent. Naturally he was unable to attain this object, but by his efforts
to this end he discovered many a new geometrical truth; among others
the generalized form of the theorem mentioned, which bears to the pres-
ent day the name of Lunule Hippocratis, the lunes of Hippocrates.
Thus it appears, in the case of Hippocrates, in the plainest light, how
the very insolvable problems of science are qualified to advance science;
in that they incite investigators to devote themselves with persistence
to its study and thus to fathom its depths.

Euclid’s avoidance of the problem.—Following Hippocrates in the his-
torical line of the great Grecian geometricians comes the systematist
Euclid, whose rigid formulation of geometrical principles has remained
the standard presentation down to the present century. The Elements
of Euclid, however, contain nothing relating to the quadrature of the
circle or to circle-computation. Comparisons of surfaces which relate
to the circle are indeed found in the book, but nowhere a computation
of the circumference of a circle or of the area of the cirele. This pal-
pable gap in Euclid’s system was filled by Archimedes, the greatest
mathematician of antiquity.

Archimedes’s calculations.—Achimedes was born in Syracuse in the
year 287 B. C., and devoted his life, there spent, to the mathematical and
the physical sciences which he enriched with invaluable contributions.
He lived in Syracuse till the taking of the town by Marcellus, in the year
108 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

212 B. c. when he fell by the hand of a Roman soldier whom he had for-
bidden to destroy the figures he had drawn in the sand. ‘To the greatest
performances of Archimedes the successful computation of the number z
unquestionably belong. Like Bryson he started with regular inscribed
and cireumseribed polygons. He showed how it was possible, begin-
ning with the perimeter of an inscribed hexagon, which is equal to six
radii, to obtain by way of calculation the perimeter of a regular dodec-
agon, and then the perimeter of a figure having double the number of
sides of the preceding one. Treating, then, the circumscribed polygons
in a similar manner, and proceeding with both series of polygons up to
a regular 96-sided polygon, he perceived on the one hand that the ratio
of the perimeter of the inscribed 96-sided polygon to the diameter was
greater than 6336: 20174, and on the other hand, that the correspond-
ing ratio with respect to the circumscribed 96-sided polygon was
smaller than 14688: 46734. He inferred from this, that the number z,
the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, was greater than the
fraction 632% and smaller than 14255. Reducing the two limits thus
found for the value of z, Archimedes then showed that the first frac-
tion was greater than 31°, and that the second fraction was smaller
than 31, whence it followed with certainty that the value sought for z
lay between 31 and 319. The larger of these two approximate values
is the only one usually learned and employed. That which fills us
most with astonishment in the Archimedean computation of z, is, first,
the great acumen and accuracy displayed in all the details of the com-
putation, and then the unwearied perserverance that he must have
exercised in calculating the limits of z without the advantages of the
Arabian system of numerals and of the decimal notation. For it must
be considered that at many stages of the computation what we call the
extraction of roots was necessary, and that Archimedes could only by
extremely tedious calculations obtain ratios that expressed approxi-
mately the roots of given numbers and fractions.

The later mathematicians of Greece.—With regard to the mathemati-
cians of Greece that follow Archimedes, all refer to and employ the
approximate value of 31 for z, without however contributing any-
thing essentially new or additional to the problems of quadrature
and of cyclometry. Thus Heron of Alexandria, the father of sur-
veying, who flourished about the year 100 B. C., employs for pur-
poses of practical measurement sometimes the value 31 for z and
sometimes even the rougher approximation z=3. The astronomer
Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria about the year 150 A. D., and
who was famous as being the author of the planetary system univer-
sally recognized as correct down to the time of Copernicus, was the
only one who furnished a more exact value; this he designated, in the
sexigesimal system of fractional notation which he employed, by 3, 8,
30—that is 3 and ;&; and ;29,, or as we now say 3 degrees 8 minutes
(partes minute prime) and 30 seconds (partes minute secunde). AS

a
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 109

a matter of fact, the expression 3 + §) + 73% = 375 represents the
number z more exactly than 3+; but on the other hand is, by reason of
the magnitude of the numbers 17 and 120 as compared with the num-
bers 1 and 7, more cumbersome.

Among the Romans.—In the mathematical sciences, more than in any
other, the Romans stood upon the shoulders of the Greeks. Indeed, with
respect to cyclometry, they not only did not add anything to the Grecian
discoveries, but often evinced even that they either did not know of tne
beautiful result obtained by Archimedes or at least did not know how to
appreciate it. For instance, Vitruvius, who lived during the time of
Augustus, computed that a wheel 4 feet in diameter must measure 124
feet in circumference; in other words, he made z equal to 34. And,
similarly, a treatise on surveying, preserved to us in the Gudian manu-
script of the library at Wolfenbiittel, contains the following instructions
to square the circle: Divide the circumference of a circle into four parts
and make one part the side of a square; this square will be equal ia
area to the circle. Aside from the fact that the rectification of the are
of a circle is requisite to the construction of a square of this kind, the
Roman quadrature, viewed as a calculation, is more inexact even than
any other computation; for its result is that 7 = 4.

Among the Hindus.—The mathematical performances of the Hindus
were not only greater than those of the Romans, but in certain directions
even surpassed those of the Greeks. In the most ancient source for the
mathematics of India that we know of, the Culvasitras, which date baek
tu a little before our chronological era, we do not find, it is true, the
squaring of the circle treated of, but the opposite problem is dealt with
which might fittingly be termed the circling of the square. The half of
the side of a given square is prolonged one-third of the excess in length
of half the diagonai over half the side, and the line thus obtained is taken
as the radius of the circle equal in area to the square. The simplest way
to obtain an idea of the exactness of this construction is to compute how
great z would have to be if the construction were exactly correct. We
find out in this way that the value of z, upon which the Indian circling of
the square is based, is about from five to six hundredths smaller than the
true value, whereas the approximate z of Archimedes, 31, is only from
one to two thousandths too large, and the old Egyptian value exceeds
the true value by from one to two hundredths. Cyclometry very prob-
ably made great advances among the Hindus in the first four or five
centuries of our era; for Aryabhatta, who lived abcut the year 500 after
Christ, states that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is
62852 — 20000, an approximation that in exactness surpasses even that of
Ptolemy. The Hindu result gives 35-1416 for 7, while z really lies be-
tween 3141592 and 3:141593. How the Hindus obtained this excellent
approximate value is told by Ganega, the commentator of Bhaskara, an
author of the twelfth century. Ganega says that the method of Archi-

medes was carried still farther by the Hindu mathematicians; that by
coutinually doubling the number of sides they proceeded from the hex-
agon to a polygon of 384 sides, and that by the comparison of the cir-
cumferences of the inscribed and circumscribed 384-sided polygons they
found that z was equal to 3927+1250. It will be seen that the value
given by Bhaskara is identical with the value of Aryabhatta. It is
further worthy of remark that the earlier of these two Hindu mathe-
maticians does not mention either the value 3! of Archimedes or the
value 3,4, of Ptolemy, but that the later knows of both values and
especially recommends that of Archimedes as the most useful one for
practical application. Strange to say, the good approximate value of
Arybhatta does not occur in Bramagupta, the great Hindu mathema-
tician who flourished in the beginning of the seventh century; but we
find the curious information in this author that the area of a circle is
exactly equal to the square root of 10 when the radius is unity. The
value of z as derivable from this formula (a value from two to three
hundredths too large) has unquestionably arisen upon Hindu soil, for
?t occurs in no Grecian mathematician; and Arabian authors, who were
in a better position than we to know Greek and Hindu mathematical
literature, declare that the approximation which makes z equal to the
square root of 10 is of Hindu origin. It is possible that the Hindu
people, who were addicted more than any other to numeral mysticism,
sought to find in this approximation some connection with the fact that
man has ten fingers; and ten accordingly is the basis of their numeral
system.

Reviewing the achievements of the Hindus generally with respect to
’ the problem of the quadrature, we are brought to recognize that this
people, whose talents lay more in the line of arithmetical computation
than in the perception of spatial relations, accomplished as good as noth-
ing on the pure geometrical side of the problem, but that the merit be-
longs to them of having carried the Archimedean method of computing =
several stages farther, and of having obtained in this way a much more
exact value for it;—a circumstance that is explainable when we consider
that the Hindus are the inventors of our present system of numeral
notation, possessing which they easily outdid Archimedes, who em-
ployed the awkward Greek system.

Among the Chinese.—With regard to the Chinese, this people operated
in ancient times with the Babylonian value for z, or 3, but possessed
knowledge of the approximate value of Archimedes, at least since the
end of the sixth century. Besides this, there appears in a number of
Chinese mathematical treatises an approximate value peculiarly their
own, in which <=3~,; a value, however, which, notwithstanding it is
written in large figures, is no better than that of Archimedes. At-
tempts at the constructive quadrature of the circle are not found among
the Chinese.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. lid kal

Among the Arabs.—Greater were the merits of the Arabians in the
advancement and development of mathematics, and especially in virtue
of the fact that they preserved from oblivion both Greek and Hindu
mathematics, and handed them down to the Christian countries of the
West. The Arabians expressly distinguished between the Archimedean
approximate value and the two Hindu values, the square root of 10 and
- the ratio 62832: 20000. This distinction occurs also in Muhammed Iba
Musa Alchwarizmi, the same scholar who in the beginning of the ninth
century brought the principles of our present system of numerical nota-
tion from India and introduced the same into the Mohammedan world.
The Arabians however studied not only the numerical quadrature of
the circle, but also the coustructive; as, for instance, Ibn Alhaitam,
who lived in Egypt about the year 1000, and whose treatise upon the
squaring of the circle is preserved in a Vatican codex, which has un-
fortunately not yet been edited.

In Christian times.—Christian civilization, to which we are now about
to pass, produced up to the second half of the fifteenth century extremely
insignificant results in mathematics. Even with regard to our present
problem we have but a single important work to mention—the work,
namely, of Frankos Von Liittich upon the squaring of the circle, pub-
lished in six books, but only preserved in fragments. The author, who
lived in the first half of the eleventh century, was probably a pupil of
Pope Sylvester 11, himself a not inconsiderable mathematician for his
time, and who also wrote the most celebrated book on geometry of the
period.

Cardinal Nicolaus de Cusa.—Greater interest came to be bestowed
upon mathematics in general, but especially on the problem of the
quadrature of the circle, in the second half of the fifteenth century,
when the sciences again began to revive. This interest was especially
aroused by Cardinal Nicolaus De Cusa, a man highly esteemed on ac-
count ot his astronomical and calendarial studies. He claimed to have
discovered the quadrature of the circle by the employment solely of
compasses and ruler, and thus attracted the attention of scholars to
the now historic problem. People believed the famous cardinal and
marvelled at his wisdom, until Regiomontanus, in letters which he wrote
in 1464 and 1465, and which were published in 1533, rigidly demon-
strated that the cardinal’s quadrature was incorrect. The construction
of Cusa was as follows: The radius of a circle is prolonged a distance
equal to the side of the inscribed square; the line thus obtained is taken
as the diameter of a second circle, and in the latter an equilateral trian-
gle is described ; then the perimeter of the latter is equal to the cireum-
ference of the original circle. If this construction, which its inventor
regarded as exact, be considered as a construction of approximation, it
will be found to be more inexact even than the construction resulting
from the value 7=31. For by Cusa’s method = would be from five to
six thousandths smaller than it really is.
112 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

Bovillius, and Orontius Fineus.—In the beginning of the sixteenth
century a certain Bovillius appears, who announced anew the construe-
tion of Cusa, meeting, however, with no notice. But about the middle
of the sixteenth century a book was published which the scholars of
the time at first received with interest. It bore the proud title * De
Rebus Mathematicis Hactenus Desideratis.” Its author, Orontius
Fineus, represented that he had overcome all the difficulties that had
ever stood in the way of geometrical investigators; and incidentally he
also communicated to the world the ‘ true quadrature” of the circle.
His fame was short-lived. For afterwards, in a book entitled ‘De
Erratis Orontii,” the Portuguese Petrus Nonius demonstrated that
Orontius’s quadrature, like most of his other professed discoveries, was
incorrect.

Simon Van EHyck.—In the period following this the number of cirele-
squarers so increased that we shall have to limit ourselves to those
whom mathematicians recognize. And particularly is Simon Van Eyck
to be mentioned, who towards the close of the sixteenth century pub-
lished a quadrature which was so approximate that the value of z de-
rived from it was more exact than that of Archimedes ; and to disprove
it the mathematician Peter Metius was obliged to seek a still more
accurate value than 31. The erroneous quadrature of Van Eyck was
thus the occasion of Metius’s discovery that the ratio 355: 118, or 3,45,
varied from the true value of z by less than one one- millionth, eclipsing
accordingly all values hitherto obtained. Moreover it is demonstrable
by the theory of continued fractions that, admitting figures to four
places only, no two numbers more exactly represent the value of z than
355 and 113.

Joseph Scaliger.—in the same way the quadrature of the great phi-
lologist, Joseph Sealiger, led to refutations. Like most circle-squarers
who believe in their discovery, Scaliger also was little versed in the
elements of geometry. He solved, however—at least in his own opin-
ion he did—the famous problem; and published in 1592 a book upon
it, which bore the pretentious title ‘“ Nova Cyclometria,” and in which
the name of Archimedes was derided. The worthlessness of his sup-
posed discovery was demonstrated to him by the greatest mathematie-
ians of his time, namely, Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and Clavius.

Longomontanus, John Porta, and Gregory of St. Vinecent.—Of the erring
circle-squarers that flourished before the middle of the seventeenth
century three others deserve particular mention;——Longomontanus of
Copenhagen, who rendered such great services to astronomy, the Nea-
politan John Porta, and Gregory of St. Vincent.. Longomontanus made

z=3) oo, and was so convinced of the correctness of his result that
he thanked God fervently, in the preface to his work “ Inventio Quad-
rature Circuli,” that He had granted him in his high old age the
strength to conquer the celebrated difficulty. John Porta followed the
initiative of Hippocrates, and believed he had solved the problem by

oat ls ai
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. PS

the comparison of lunes. Gregoryof St. Vincent published a quadrature
the error of which was very hard to detect, but was finally discovered
by Descartes.

Peter Metius, and Vieta.—Of the famous mathematicians who dealt
with our problem in the period between the close of the fifteenth cen-
tury and the time of Newton, we first meet with Peter Metius, before
mentioned, who succeeded in finding in the fraction 355:113 the best
approximate value for z involving only small numbers. The problem
received a different advancement at the hands of the famous mathema-
tician Vieta. Vieta was the first to whom the idea occurred of repre-
senting z with mathematical exactness by an infinite series of contin-
uable operations. By comparison of inscribed and circumscribed
polygons, Vieta found that we approach nearer and nearer to z if we
allow the operations of the extraction of the square root of 4 and of
addition and of multiplication to succeed each other in a certain man-
ner, and that z must come out exactly if this series of operations could
be indefinitely continued. Vieta thus found that to a diameter of 10,000
million units a circumference belongs of 31,415 million, and from
926,535 to 926,536 units of the same length.

Adrianus Romanus, Ludolf Van Ceulen.—But Vieta was outdone by
the Netherlander Adrianus Romanus, who added five additional decimal
places to the tenof Vieta. To accomplish this he computed with un-
speakable labor the circumference of a regular circumscribed polygon
of 1,073,741,824 sides. This number is the thirtieth power of 2. Yet
great as the labor of Adrianus Romanus was, that of Ludolf Van Ceu-
len was still greater, for the latter calculator succeeded in carrying the
Archimedean process of approximation for the value of z to 35 decimal
places, that is, the deviation from the true value was smaller than one
one thousand quintillionth, a degree of exactness that we can hardly
have any conception of. Ludolf published the figures of the tremendous
computation that led to this result. His calculation was carefully ex-
amined by the mathematician Griemberger and declared to be correct.
Ludolf was justly proud of his work, and, following the example of
Archimedes, requested in his will that the result of his most important
mathematical performance, the computation of z to 35 decimal places,
be engraved upon his tombstone, a request which is said to have been
carried out. In honor of Ludolf, z is called to-day in Germany the
Ludolfian number.

The new method of Snell. Huygens’s verification of it.—Although
through the labor of Ludolf a degree of exactness for cyclometrical
operations was now obtained that was more than sufficient for any
practical purpose that could ever arise, neither the problem of construe-
tive rectification nor that of constructive quadrature was thereby in
any respect theoretically advanced. The investigations conducted by
the famous mathematicians and physicists Huygens and Snell, about
the middle of the seventeenth century, were more important from amathe-

H. Mis, 129 8

114. THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

matical point of view than the work of Ludolf. Inhis book Cyclometri-
cus Snell took the position that the method of comparison of polygons,
which originated with Archimedes and was employed by Ludolf, need
by no means be the best method of attaining the end sought; and he
sueceeded, by the employment of propositions which state that certain
ares of a circle are greater or smaller than certain straight lines con-
nected with the circle, in obtaining methods that make it possible to
reach results like the Ludolfian with much less labor of calculation.
The beautiful theorems of Snell were proved a second time, and better
proved, by the celebrated Dutch promoter of the science of optics,
Huygens (Opera Varia, pp. 365 et seq.; Theoremata De Cireuli et Hy-
perbolae Quadratura, 1651), as well as perfected in many ways. Snell
and Huygens were fully aware that they had advanced only the prob-
lem of numerical quadrature, and not that of the constructive quadra-
ture. This, in Huygens’s case, plainly appeared from the vehement
dispute he conducted with the English mathematician, James Gregory.
* This controversy has some significance for the history of our problem,
from the fact that Gregory made the first attempt to prove that the
squaring of the circle with ruler and compasses must be impossible.

The controversy between Huygens and Gregory.—The result of the con-
troversy, to which we owe many valuable treatises, was that Huygens
finally demonstrated in an incontrovertible manner the incorrectness of
Gregory’s proof of impossibility, adding that he also was of opinion
that the solution of the problem with ruler and compasses was impossi-
ble, but nevertheless was not himself able to demonstrate this fact.
And Newton, later, expressed himself to a similar effect. As a matter
of fact it took till the most recent period, that is over 200 years, until
higher mathematics was far enough advanced, to furnish a rigid dem-
onstration of impossibility.

Before we proceed to consider the promotive influence which the in-
vention of the differential and the integral calculus had upon our prob-
lem, we shall enumerate a few at least of that never-ending line of
mistaken quadrators who have delighted the world by the fruits of their
ingenuity from the time of Newton to the present period ; and out of a
pious and sincere consideration for the contemporary world, we shall
entirely omit in this to speak of the cirele-squarers of our own time.

Hobbes’s quadrature.—First to be mentioned is the celebrated English
philosopher Hobbes. In his book, De Problematis Physicis, in which he
chiefly proposes to explain the phenomena of gravity and of ocean
tides, he also takes up the quadrature of the circle and gives a very
trivial construction that in his opinion definitively solved the problem,
making <=31, In view of Hobbes’s importance as a philosopher, two
mathematicians, Huygens and Wallis, thought it proper to refute
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 115

Hobbes at length. But Hobbes defended his position in a special
treatise, in which, to sustain at least the appearance of being right, he
disputed the fundamental principles of geometry and the theorem of
Pythagoras ; so that mathematicians could pass on from him to the
order of the day.

French quadrators of the eighteenth century.—In the last century
France especially was rich in cirele-squarers. We will mention:
Oliver de Serres, who by means of a pair of scales determined that
a circle weighed as much as the square upon the side of the equi-
lateral triangle inscribed in it, that therefore they must have the
same area, an experiment in which <=3; Mathulon, who offered in
legal form a reward of a thousand dollars to the person who would
point out an error in his solution of the problem, and who was actually
compelled by the courts to pay the money ; Basselin, who believed that
his quadrature must be right because it agreed with the approximate
value of Archimedes, and who anathematized his ungrateful contem-
poraries, in the confidence that he would be recognized by posterity ;
Liger, who proved that a part is greater than the whole, and to whom
therefore the quadrature of the circle was child’s play; Clerget, who
based his solution upon the principle that a circle is a polygon of a
definite number of sides, and who calculated, also, among other things,
how large the point is at which two circles touch.

Germany and Poland.—Germany and Poland also furnish their contin-
gent to the army of circle-squarers. Lieutenant-Colonel Corsonich pro-
duced a quadrature in which z equaled 34, and promised 50 dueats to the
person who could prove that it was incorrect. Hesse, of Berlin, wrote an
arithmetic in 1776, in which a true quadrature was also “ made known,”
z being exactly equal to 334. About the same time Professor Bischoff,
of Stettin, defended a quadrature previously published by Captain
Leistner, preacher Merkel, and schoolmaster Bohm, which made x
implicite equal to the square of §? not even attaining the approximation
of Archimedes.

Constructive approximations—Euler, Kocahnsky.—From attempts of
this character are to be clearly distinguished constructions of ap-
proximation in which the inventor is aware that he has not found
a mathematically exact construction, but only an approximate one.
The value of such a construction will depend upon two things—first,
upon the degree of exactness with which it is numerically expressed,
and secondly on the fact whether the construction can be more or
less easily made with ruler and compasses. Constructions of this kind,
simple in form and yet sufficiently exact for practical purposes, have
for centuries been furnished us in great numbers. The great math-
ematician, Euler, who died in 1783, did not think it out of place to
attempt an approximate construction of this kind. A very simple con-
struction for the rectification of the circle, and one which has passed
116 THE SQUARING OF THE ‘CIRCLE.

into many geometrical text books, is that published by Kochansky in
1685, in the Leipziger Berichte. It is as follows:

Erect upon the diameter of a circle at its extremities perpendiculars ; with the center
as vertex, mark off upon the diameter an angle of 30°; find the point of intersection
with the perpendicular of the line last drawn, and join this point of intersection with
that point upon the other perpendicular, which is at a distance of three radii from the
base of the perpendicular. ‘The line of junction thus obtained is then very approxi-
mately equal to one-half of the circumference of the given circle.

Calculation shows that the difference between the true length of the
circumference and the line thus constructed is less than 75,409 of the
diameter.

Inutility of constructive approximations.—Althougk such construc-
tions of approximation are very interesting in themselves, they never-
theless play but a subordinate role in the history of the squaring of the
circle; for on the one hand they can never furnish greater exactness
for circle computation than the thirty-five decimal places which Ludolf
found, and on the other hand they are not adapted to advance in any
way the question whether the exact quadrature of the circle with ruler
and compasses is possible.

The researches of Newton, Leibnitz, Wallis, and Brouncker.—The
numerical side of the problem, however, was considerably advanced
by the new mathematical methods perfected by Newton and Leibnitz,
commonly called the differential and the integral calculus. And
about the middle of the seventeenth century, some time before New-
ton and Leibnitz represented =z by series of powers, the English mathema-
ticians Wallis and Lord Brouncker, Newton’s predecessors in a certain
sense, succeeded in representing = by an infinite series of figures com-
bined by the first four rules of arithmetic. A new method of computa-
tion was thus opened. Wallis found that the fourth part of = is repre-
sented more exactly by the regularly formed product

xtxixtixtx x, x, ete,

eo bo

the farther the multiplication is continued, and that the result always
comes out too small if we stop at a proper fraction, but too large if we
stop at an improper fraction. Lord Brouncker, on the other hand, rep-
resents the value in question by a continued fraction in which all the
denominators are equal to 2 and the numerators are odd square num-
bers. Wallis, to whom Brouncker had communicated his elegant result
without proof, demonstrated the same in his “Arithmetic of Infinites.”

The computation of z could hardly be farther advanced by these re-
sults than Ludolf and others had carried it, though of course in amore
laborious way. However, the series of powers derived by the assistance
of the differential calculus of Newton and Leibnitz furnished a means
of computing z to hundreds of decimal places.

Other calculations.—Gregory, Newton, and Leibnitz next found that
the fourth part of z was equal exactly to
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. rg

if we conceive this series, which is called the Leibnitzian, indefinitely
continued. This series is indeed wonderfully simple, but is not adapted
to the computation of z, for the reason that entirely too many members
have to be taken into account to obtain z accurately to a few decimal
places only. The original formula, however, from which this series is
derived, gives other formulas which are excellently adapted to the ac-
tual computation. This formula is the general series:

a=a—sar+ lar—lat+ ee es

where a is the length of the arc that belongs to any central angle in a
circle of radius 1, and where a is the tangent to this angle. From this
we derive the following:

t

=(a+b+e+... )—d(O+R +404 ...) +) (@4P4+64 ...) 0,

He] =

where a, b,c... are the tangents of angles whose sum is 45°, Deter-
mining, therefore, the values of a,b, ¢..., which are equal to small
and easy fractions and fulfill the condition just mentioned, we obtain
series of powers which are adapted to the computation of z. The first
to add by the aid of series of this description additional decimal places
to the old 35 in the number z= was the English aritimetician Abraham
Sharp, who, following Halley’s instructions, in 1700, worked out = to
72 decimal places. A little later Machin, professor of astronomy in
London, computed z to 100 decimal places; putting, in the series given
above, a=b=c=d=1 and e=—5},, that is employing the following
series:

es pee: ae | Hs tt 1
4 . — So — re me) — —— Sees ——— eee
fe 3.5 +56 Tet | Ee 3.239 + 52308 |

In the year 1819, Lagny, of Paris, outdid the computation of Machin,
determining in two different ways the first 127 decimal places of z.
Vega then obtained as many as 140 places, and the Hamburg arithme-
tician, Zacharias Dase, went as far as 200 places. The latter did not use
Machin’s series in his calculation, but the series produced by putting
in the general series above given a=3, b=1,c=1. Finally, at a recent
date, z has been computed to 500 places.

The computation to so many decimal places may serve as an illustra-
tion of the excellence of the modern method as contrasted with those
anciently employed, but otherwise it has neither a theoretical nor a
practical value. That the computation of = to say 15 decimal places
more than sufficiently satisfies the subtlest requirements of practice may
be gathered from a concrete example of the degree of exactness thus
obtainable.

Ha) 9
118 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

Idea of exactness obtainable with the approximate values of ~.—Im-
agine a circle to be described with Berlin as center, and the circum.
ference to pass through Hamburg; then let the circumference of the
circle be computed by multiplying its diameter with the value of =z to
15 decimal places, and then conceive it to be actually measured. The
deviation from the true length in so large a circle as this even could
not be as great as the 18 millionth part of a millimetre.

An idea can hardly be obtained of the degree of exactness produced
by 100 decimal places. But the following example may possibly give
us some conception of it. Conce:ve a sphere constructed with the earth
as center, and imagine its surface to pass through Sirius, which is 13844
million million kilometres distant from us. Then imagine this enormous
Sphere to be so packed with microbes that in every cubic millimetre
millions of millions of these diminutive animalcula are present. Now
conceive these microbes to be all unpacked and so distributed singly
along a straight line that every two microbes are as far distant from
each other as Sirus from us, that is, 1343 million million kilometres.
Conceive the long line thus fixed by all the microbes as the diameter of
a circle, and imagine the circumference of it to be calculated by multi-
plying its diameter with z to 100 decimal places. Then, in the case of a
circle of this enormous magnitude even, the circumference thus calcu-
lated would not vary from the real circumference by a millionth of a
millimetre.

This example will suffice to show that the calculation of z to 100 or
500 decimal places is wholly useless.

Professor Wolff’s curious method.—Before we close this chapter upon
the evaluation of z, we must mention the method, less fruitful than
curious, which Professor Wolff, of Zurich, employed some decades ago
to compute the value of z to 3 places. The floor of a room is divided
up into equal squares, so as to resemble a huge chess-board, and a
needle exactly equal in length to the side of each of these squares is
east haphazard upon the floor. If we calculate now the probabilities of
the needle so falling as to lie wholly within one of the squares, that is,
so that it does not cross any of the parallel lines forming the squares,
the result of the calculation for this probability will be found to be ex-
actly equal to z —3. Consequently a sufficient number of casts of the
needle according to the law of large numbers must give the value of z
approximately. Asa matter of fact, Professor Wolff, after 10,000 trials,
obtained the value of z correctly to 3 decimal places.

IV.—PROOF THAT THE PROBLEM IS INSOLVABLE.

Mathematicians :ow seek to prove the insolvability of the problem.
Fruitful as the calculus of Newton and Leibnitz was for the evalu-
ation of z, the problem of converting a circle into a square having ex-
actly the same area was in no wise advanced thereby. Wallis, Newton,
Leibnitz, and their immediate followers distinctly recognized this. The
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. in

quadrature of the circle could not be solved; but it also could not be
proved that the problem was insolvable with ruler and compasses,
although everybody was convinced of its insolvability.: In mathemat-
ics, however, a conviction is only justified when supported by ineon-
trovertible proof; and in the place of endeavors to solve the quadra.
ture there accordingly now come endeavors to prove the impossibility
of solving the celebrated problem.

Lambert's contribution.—The first step in this direction, small as it
was, was made by the French mathematician Lambert, who proved in
the year 1761 that = was neither a rational number nor even the square
root of a rational number; that is, that neither z nor the square of =
can be exactly represented by a fraction the denominator and nume-
rator of which are whole numbers, however great the numbers be taken.
Lambert’s proof showed, indeed, that the rectification and the quadra-
ture of the circle could not be possibly accomplished in the particular
way in which its impossibility was demonstrated, but it still did not
exclude the possibility of the problem being solvable in some other more
complicated way, and without requiring further aids than ruler and
compasses.

The conditions of the demonstration.—Proceeding slowly but surely it
was next sought to discover the essential distinguishing properties that
separate problems solvable with ruler and compasses, from problems
the construction of which is elementarily impossible, that is, by solely
employing the postulates. Slight reflection showed that a problem ele-
mentarily solvable, must always possess the property of having the
unknown lines in the figure relating to it connected with the known
lines of the figure by an equation for the solution of which equations of
the first and second degree alone are requisite, and which may be so
disposed that the common measures of the known lines will appear only
as integers. The conclusion was to be drawn from this, that if the
quadrature of the circle and consequently its rectification were ele-
mentarily solvable, the number =, which represents the ratio of the
unknown circumference to the known diameter, must be the root of a
certain equation, of a very high degree perhaps, but in which all the
numbers that appear are whole numbers; that is, there would have to
exist an equation, made up entirely of whole numbers, which would be
correct if its unknown quantity were made equal to =.

Final success of Professor Lindemann.—Since the beginning of this
century, consequently, the efforts of a number of mathematicians have
been bent upon proving that z generally is not algebraical, that. is,
that it can not be the root of any equation having whole numbers for
coefficients. But mathematics had to make tremendous strides for-
ward before the means were at hand to accomplish this demonstration.
After the French academician, Professor Hermite, had furnished im-
portant preparatory assistance in his treatise Sur la Fonction Eapo-
nentielle, published in the seventy-seventh volume of the Comptes
120 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

Rendus, Professor Lindemann, at that time of Freiburg, now of Koénigs-
berg, finally succeeded, in June, 1882, in rigorously demonstrating that
the number =z is not algebraical,* thus supplying the first proof that
the problems of the rectification and the squaring of the circle, with
the help only of algebraical instruments like ruler and compasses are
insolvable.° Lindemann’s proot appeared successively in the Reports
of the Berlin Academy (June, 1882), in the Cumptes Rendus of the
French Academy (vol. Cxv, pp. 72-74), ard in the Mathematischen An-
nalen (vol. Xx, pp. 213-225).

The verdict of mathematics.—“It is impossible with ruler and com-
passes to construct a square equal in area to a given circle.” These are
the words of the final determination of a controversy which is as old
as the history of the human mind. but the race of circle-squarers, un-
mindful of the verdict of mathematics, that most infallible of arbiters,
will never die out so long as ignorance and the thirst for glory shall be
united.

* For the benefit of my mathematical readers I shall present here the most impor-
tant steps of Lindemann’s demonstration, M. Hermite in order to prove the transcen-
dental character of

developed relations between certain definite integrals (Comptes Rendus of the Paris
Academy, 1873, vol. Lxxvi1). Proceeding from the relations thus established, Pro-
fessor Lindemann first demonstrates the following proposition: If the coefficients of
an equation of nth degree are all real or complex whole numbers and the n roots of this
equation 2, 2,..., 2, are different from zero and from each other it is impossible for

that also between the functions

PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

By WILLIAM C. WINLOCK.

The following record of astronomy for the years 1889 and 1890 is
presented in essentially the same form as its predecessors. The com-
piler has made free use of reviews, in the various branches of astronomy,
contributed by specialists to the Atheneum, Nature, Journal of the As-
tronomical Society of the Pacific, the Observatory, Bulletin Astronomique,
the Astronomical Journal, and other periodicals.

NEBULZ.

Motions of the planetary nebula in the line of sight.—No. 11 of the Pub-
lications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific contains a very
important paper by Mr. James E. Keeler on the ‘“‘ Motions of the pian-
etary nebule in the line of sight.” The paper is an important one in a
twofold aspect: first, in its bearing on a matter just now under dis-
cussion by the highest authorities, as to the character and position of
the brightest nebular line, and secondly, in the evidence it affords of
nebular movements.

As to the character of the nebular line, Mr. Keeler’s: testimony is
most emphatic, and entirely confirms Dr. Huggins’s observations. ‘The
nebular lines,” he reports, ‘appeared to be perfectly monochromatic
images of the slit, widening when the slit was widened and narrowing
to excessively fine sharp lines when it was closed up.” The chief neb-
ular line “‘ showed no tendency to assume the aspect of a remnant of
fluting under any circumstances of observation.” This observation,
made not on one nebula, but on a number, and with a dispersion often
equivalent to that of 24 prisms of 60°, for the fourth spectrum of a
Rowland’s grating of 14,438 lines to the inch was often used, is by far
the strongest evidence we have yet had on this question of the charac-
ter of the chief nebular line, and it is dead against Mr. Lockyer’s
theory.

The position of the nebular line is also fixed with very considerable
certainty ; and here, again, Dr. Huggins’s observations receive complete
confirmation. It was not, in any one of the nebulie observed, coincident

with the fluting of magnesium, but was always seen some distance to
121

the blue. The importance of this observation, especially when taken
with the report as to the character of the line, is of the highest kind in
its bearing on Mr. Lockyer’s great meteoritic theory. If the chief neb-
ular line is not the remnant of the magnesium fluting the very keystone
is knocked away from the arch and the edifice as such falls to pieces.
No doubt there would be many isolated fragments of considerable value
still left. The structure mighteven be put together again, hereafter, on
a new plan, and with a more lasting result, but the theory as it now
stands—the theory as a whole—would be irretrievably wrecked. On
the other hand, if the identity which Mr. Lockyer asserts were estab-
lished, it would be a victory for him of the first importance.

It is indicative of the progress of practical spectroscopy that the
whole question turns on an almost inappreciable difference of position,
the mean value for the wave-length of the nebular line as found by Mr.
Keeler from ten nebule, being 5,005.68 tenth-meters, whilst that of the
fluting of magnesium is 5,006.36. Inthe brightest nebula examined the
wave-length obtained was 5,006.15 tenth-meters, only 0.23 distant from
the magnesium fluting. As the observations stand they point strongly
to the nebular line being slightly but distinetly more refrangible than
the edge of the magnesium fluting, and therefore not due to it. But
the amount of displacement is not so great as to make it altogether in-
conceivable that it is due to the relative motion of the nebule and the
solar system, for all the ten nebule observed are in that hemisphere
toward which the sun is travelling, and seven of them are within 45° of
the apex of the ‘‘Sun’s Way,” so that a correction must be applied
which would tend to bring the nebular line nearer to the fluting; how
much nearer we cannot, in our ignorance of the speed of the sun’s
motion in space, at present say, but a rate of 86 miles per second would
suffice to make the accord a perfect one. If Mr. Keeler could obtain a
series of comparisons of the F line in these nebule with hydrogen, the
problem would be solved. Or the determination of the place of the
line in a number of nebulz in the hemisphere we are leaving would go
far to settle the matter. In the mean time it is still possible that the
eventual result may favor Mr. Lockyer’s theory. It may be added in
reference to Mr. Lockyer’s paper, appearing in No. 293 of the Proceed-
ings of the Royal Society, that if we accept Mr. Keeler’s measures it is
clear that Mr. Lockyer did not employ sufficient dispersion to decide
the point at issue.

The second point brought out by Mr. Keeler’s measures is the fact
that the nebule have very distinct movements of theirown. As we do
not yet know to what substance the chief nebular line is due, and as
Mr. Keeler could not make any measures of the blue hydrogen line in
the nebul at all comparable in accuracy to those he made of the chief
line, we can not say that the difference in position of the chief line from
any given comparison line is due to the motion of the nebula. All we
can do at present is to observe a number of nebule, adopt the mean
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 123

place they give as the true position of the nebular line, and record the
differences from this mean as due to differences of motion from the
mean motion. The extreme difference observed between any two
nebula amounted to very nearly 70 miles per second.

It is impossible to leave this paper without a word on the accuracy
of the measures. The spectrum of ¥ 6 was examined on nine nights.
The greatest difference of any one night’s observation from the mean
was only 0.11 tenth-metre, or in miles per second 4.2; the mean dif-
ference but 0.04, or in miles per second 1.5. Such accuracy was only
possible by using an enormous dispersion, and it implies very perfect
instrumental and atmospheric conditions. But it also implies an ex-
treme delicacy of eye and hand in the observer; the ‘“‘man behind the
telescope” is in evidence. For it should be remembered that the great
size of the Lick telescope is no special advantage in work of this par-
ticular class, its high proportion of focal length to aperture being a
distinct disadvantage. A much smaller object-glass, with a focal length
of 12 to 1, would give brighter images.—(E. W. MAUNDER. The Ob-
servatory, No. 168.)

Mr. Lockyer having published some results at variance with those
obtained by Dr. and Mrs. Huggins with respect to the principal line
in the spectrum of the great nebula in Orion, they have made careful
re-determinations, decisively confirming their previgus results: (1) that
the principal line is not coincident with, but falls within, the fermina-
tion of the magnesium flame band; (2) that in the nebula in Orion this
line presents no appearance of being a ‘fluting.”

The faint star discovered in the trapezium of the Orion nebula by
Alvan Clark, when the Lick telescope was first mounted, has been
found by Barnard to be double, another star has also been detected in
the trapezium by Barnard, and also one of about the same magni-
tude (sixteenth) as the Clark star just preceding the trapezium.

Within the ring of the well-known ring nebula of Lyra six stars have
been found by Holden and Schaeberle with the 36-inch Lick telescope
where but one was known before, and five new stars have been found
in the nebulosity.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Refraction.—M. Radau has published in volume 19 of the Paris Observ-
atory Annales a very complete memoir on astronomical refraction, which
deals with the theoretical as well as the practical side of the question,
and contains complete tables in a convenient form suitable for actual
computation.

Diurnal nutation.—M. Folie’s work on diurnal nutation has not met
with general acceptance. One of the latest discussions of the subject
is that by Herr Lehman Filhés, published in No, 2975 of the Astronom-
asche Nachrichten.
124 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1900.

Precession.—A useful table of the third term of the precession has
been computed by Herr Kloock and published by the Kiei Observatory.

Harkness’s astronomical, physical, and geodetic constants.—Prof, Win.
Harkness, of the U. S. Naval Observatory, has been at work for some
time upon a homogeneous system of inter-related constants, more
trustworthy values of which are to be attained by the solution of equa-
tions of condition, in which the best values resulting from observation
are introduced and combined with the expression of their mutual re-
lations.

A preliminary communication of results was made to the Astronom-
ical Journal, No. 194, but it seems preferable to quote here the final
values published by Professor Harkness in Appendix III to the Wash-
ington Observations for 1891, though the latter work was not issued
till after the close of the year 1890.

Professor Harkness has collected the various determinations of each
of the constants in question, decided upon the values to be adopted in
the computations, often using the method of least squares for this pur-
pose; and has then employed this method in order to obtain a resultant
homogeneous system.

Among the results obtained are the following:

of the solar parallax is 92,796 950+ 59 715 miles, or 149,340 870+ 96 101
kilometers.

STAR CATALOGUES.

The star catalogue of the Astronomische Gesellschaft—The first parts
of the great catalogue of the Astronomische Gesellschaft appeared in
1890. They are the volumes containing the catalogues of zones ob-
served by Krueger at Helsingfors and Gotha, by Boss, at Albany, and
by Fearnley and Geelmuyden at Christiania. The two first mentioned
volumes contain respectively the positions of 14,680 and of 8,241 stars
for the equinox of 1875.

It may be worth while to recall here the origin of this great under-
taking, now nearing completion. The zones of the Histoire céleste
francaise, published by Lalande comprise about 50,000 stars from
the first to the eighth magnitude, but they were not catalogued till
nearly half a century after theircompletion. Those of Bessel, observed
at Koenigsberg from 1821 to 1833, contain 62,600 stars from the first to
the ninth magnitude between —15° and + 45° declination; the two cata-
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 125

logues of Weisse appeared in 1846 and 1863. From 1841 to 1852 Arge-
lander continued his work at Bonn, and his northern zones (published in
1846) contain 22,000 stars between +45° and +80° and the southern
zones (published in 1852) 17,000 between —15° and —31°, catalogued
by Oeltzen (1851 to 1857). The positions in these different catalogues
depend upon meridian observations.

In 1852, having finished his zones, Argelander conceived the plan of a
work of much greaterextent. It was to fix approximately the positions
of all stars to the ninth magnitude, and perhaps a little below (9.5), visi-
ble in our Jatitudes. To accomplish this the plan was to employ simply a
small telescope, the observer, with his eye always at the telescope, to call
out to a recorder, who sat close by with a chronometer. The preliminary
trials, by J. Schmidt, being successful, the work was begun, and, with
the help of Krueger and Schoenfeld, on whom the greater part of the la-
bor fell, the revision of the northern sky was finished in 1859; and this
is the work that we know as the “ Bonn Durchmusterung.”

The Durchmusterung,published between 1859 and 1862 in volumes 3, 4,
and 5 of the Bonn Observations, contains no less than 324,198 stars, lying
between 2° south declination and the north pole, the zone between +81°
and the pole being a revision of Carrington’s catalogue. Volume 6 of
the “Bonn Beobachtungen,” contains futhermore 34,000 positions, deter-
mined by Argelander with the meridian circle. The stars of the
Durchmusterung are plotted on a series of charts published in 1863.
Since Argelander’s death Schoenfeld has completed a similar piece of
work for oursouthern sky, the “ Siidliche Durchmusterung” (1886), con-
taining more than 133,000 stars, between —2° and—23°, and Gould at
Cordoba has extended the zones to the neighborhood of the south pole.

Upon the organization of the International Astronomische Gesell-
schaft in 1865, the question at once came up of undertaking, by the co-op-
eration of several observatories, the exact determination of the positions
of all these stars provisionally catalogued in the Durchmusterung. A
programme for the work, prepared by a special committee, was finally
decided upon at the meeting in Vienna in 1869. The new revision was
contined to the limits of —2° and +80° declination, the positions of
the circumpolars seeming to be sufficiently well known from the work
of Carrington and that of the astronomers at Hamburg and Kazan, The
zones were at first assigned as follows:

80° to 75° Kazan. 39° to 30° Leipzig.

75 to 70 Dorpat. 30 to 25 Cambridge (England),
70 to 65 Christiania. 25 to 15 Berlin.

65 to 55 Helsingfors. 15 to 10 Leipzig.

55 to 50 ? 10 to 4 Mannheim.

50 to 40 Bonn. 4 to 1 Neufchatel.

40 to 35 Chicago. +1 to—2 Palermo.

Pulkowa undertook the determination of 539 fundamental stars care-
fully selected by Dr. Auwers, which should form points of reference.
In the 20 years that have elapsed since the great catalogue was
126 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

decided upon several changes have been made in the original pro-
gramme, the work being eventually divided up among the following
observatories :

80° to.75° Kazan. 35° to 30° Leyden.

75 to 70 Dorpat. 30 to 25 Cambridge (Eng.)

70 to 65 Christiania. to 15 Berlin.

65 to 55 Helsingfors-Gotha. to 5 Leipzig.

55 to 50 Cambridge (U.S.). > to 1 Albany.

50 to40 Bonn. +1 to—2 Nicolaief.

40 to 35 Lund.

The work of observation is now finished. Some of the zones have
been published (Kazan, Christiania, Helsingfors, Lund), others are in
press, and the catalogues have been begun. Three of the catalogues
(Aibany, Helsingfors-Gotha, and Christiania,) have just appeared.
Meanwhile the zones have been extended to the southern sky, the fol-
lowing being to a greater or less extent under way:

—2° to — 6° Strasburg. —14° to—18° Washington.
-——6 to—10 Vienna. —18 to—23 Algiers.
—10 to— 14 Cambridge (U.S. ).

The positions of the 303 fundamental southern stars are furnished
‘by observations undertaken at the Cape of Good Hope, Madison,
Annapolis, Carlsruhe, Leiden, and Strasburg. Gould’s southern zones
extend from —23° to—80°, and it is to be hoped that before long we
shall have a catalogue embracing the whole sky, the value of which
will be in no wise diminished by the photographic chart which is about
to be begun.

The observations for the Helsingfors-Gotha catalogue were made al-
most entirely by Dr. Krueger with a 0™.15 (5.9 inch) Reichenbach merid-
ian circle. The star positions are for the epoch 1875, and besides the
right ascension and declination, the precession and secular variation,
and wherever possible the proper motion are given. The observations
forthe Albany zone were made by Professor Boss with a 0™. 20 (7.9 inches)
Pistor & Martin’s meridian cirele, the transits being recorded on the
chronograph, while Dr. Krueger used the “eye-and-ear ” method,

Experiments were made with wire-gauze screens by Professor Boss
to determine the effect of difference of magnitude upon the observa-
tions, his result being that a change of one magnitude produced a
change of 08,014 in the personal equation in observing a transit,

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 127

A third installment of the catalogue, that containing the stars from
+649 50’ to +70° 10’, has also appeared. The observations were made
by Professors Fearnley and Geelmuyden with the Ertel meridian
circle of the Christiania Observatory, of 48 lines aperture. The prob-
able error of a single observation is given as + 05.054 in right ascension
(+0'.02 in a great circle) and + 0.54 in declination.

Yarnall’s catalogue-—A. third edition of the catalogue of southern
stars observed with the transit instrument and mural circle at the
U. S. Naval Observatory from 1845 to 1877 has been published, the
work of revision having been conducted by Professor Frisby. Great
pains have been taken to eliminate all errata detected in the previous
editions, both by the careful examination of published lists of correc-
tions and by comparisons with other catalogues. The whole number
of stars in the new edition is 10,964.

Munich catalogue.—Band 1 of the ‘* Neue Annalen der k. Sternwarte
in Bogenhausen bei Miinchen” contains a catalogue of 33,082 stars
down to the tenth magnitude inclusive, between —52° and +424° decli-
nation, reduced to the epoch 1880.0. The observations were made with
a Reichenbach meridian circle of 109" (4.3 inches) aperture and
circle of 0.95™ (37.4 inches) diameter.

Second Melbourne catalogue.—This catalogue contains the results of
observations made with the old transit circle of 5 inches aperture from
the beginning of 1871 to the end of August, 1584; places of 1,211 stars
are given for 1880.

Brussels catalogue.-—The Brussels catalogue contains 10,792 stars for
the epoch 1865, observed with the Brussels transit instrument and
mural circle in the years 1857—1878; the general catalogue is preceded
by the positions of the fundamental stars used in the reductions. A
supplement is to be published giving corrections to the catalogue due
to a number of inaccuracies detected in the reductions.

The Williams College catalogue of north polar stars.—Professor Saf-
ford has published a catalogue of right ascensions of 261 stars, mostly
within 10° of the north pole, and observed by him with the 43-inch
Repsold meridian circle of the Field Memorial Observatory at Williams-
town. The results have been reduced to the epoch 1885.0. Professor
Safford characterizes his catalogue as an ‘attempt to strengthen the
weak point of all our standard catalogues—the right ascensions of
polar stars,” and he draws the following vonclusions from his work.

‘Kirst. Thatit is highly conducive to accuracy, systematic as well as
in detail, to base a catalogue of polar right ascensions upon standard
places in all hours of right ascension, rather than upon double transits
alone.

“ Second. That the introduction of meridian marks according to Struve
(long-focus object glasses, also suggested by Rittenhouse) is a great
advantage to the primary catalogues,
128 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

‘Third. That the eye-and-ear method should be retained as the stand-
ard within a narrow rather than a wide range of polar distance.

‘“ Fourth. That modern meridian instruments are subject to irregular
small changes of position, which are not direct functions of the tem-
perature; so that in all differential work it is better to keep a close
watch upon clock rate and instrumental adjustments rather than to
trust the instrumental zero points for more than 2 hours without rede-
termination of the most essential.

“ Fifth. That the right ascensions here given are reasonably accurate-

‘Sixth. That a thorough comparison of the chronographic and eye-
and-ear method within a wide range, both of magnitude and declina-
tion, is desirable.”

Greenwich 10-year catalogue, 1877 to 1886, published in the volume
of Greenwich Observations for 1887, contains 4,059 stars for the epoch
1880.0.

The catalogue of 303 reference stars for the southern zones of the
Astronomische Gesellschaft has been published by Dr. Auwers, and
although the material accumulated since 1880, when the provisional list
was issued, is not sufficient to give places of a thoroughly satisfactory
degree of accuracy, the final corrections will probably be extremely
small.

A collection of all available meridian observations of stars that wil]
be within 1° of the north pole in 1900 has been prepared, under the
direction of Professor Pickering, by Miss Winlock and published as the
ninth memoir in volume 18 of the Harvard Observatory Annals.

STELLAR PARALLAX. .

Professor Pritcnard intends to examine for parallax, by the aid of
photography, all stars of the second magnitude suitably situated for
observation at Oxford, in the hope of contributing to our knowledge of
what Herschel called the “ construction of the heavens.” With refer-
ence to the differences in the results obtained by different observers,
Professor Pritchard says: *‘ Guided by the suggestions of recent experi-
ence, I now think that such differences of ‘ parallax’ might very reason-
ably have been anticipated and may probably be accepted as matters
of fact without in any degree impugning the accuracy of the observa-
tions. For in process of this work on parallax, and also from the gen-
eral history of similar inquiries, it has been made abundantly evident
that no necessary connection exists between the brightaess of a star
and its position in space, or distance from the sun. Nevertheless it
is this very difference of brightness mainly which guides us in the
selection of comparison stars. The ‘parallax’ is, in fact, and is becom-
ing more and more generally recognized to be, a differential quantity,
fainter stars being in very many instances much nearer to us than
others possessing incomparably greater brightness. In passing I may
here instance « Lyre as compared with 61 Cygui; Centauri as
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 129

compared with « Indi. In fact, the position in space of the faint com-
parison stars in relation to that of the star whose parallax is sought is,
if not a matter of accident, at all events wholly unknown until the ob-
servations and computations are complete.”

Professor Pritchard’s results for stellar parallax, as published in the
third volume of the Oxford Observations, are as follows:

The greater part of this volume is devoted to a discussion of the
parallax of 61 Cygni and the results seem to justify his remark that
“the four comparison stars probably belong to a remote system not
containing 61 Cygnui.” The probable errors deduced are small.

At the annual visitation to the Oxford Observatory on June 12, 1890,
Professor Pritchard announced the results of the determination of
parallaxes of six more stars by the photographic method, as follows:

The subjoined table forms a summary of a paper published in the
Astronomische Nachrichten, Nos. 2915 and 2916, by Dr. Oudemans, in
which he collects the scattered results for stellar parallax obtained in
the past sixty years. Dr. Oudemans coneludes that “stars with proper
motions greater than 0.05 have probably an annual parallax of 0./10
to 0.50.

PROPER MOTIONS.

Professor Boss has published in the Astronomical Journal the proper
motions of 295 stars of the Albany zone (+ 0° 50/ to + 5° 10’).

In the Bulletin Astronomique for March, 1890, is a.most useful cata-
logue, compiled by Bossert, of all stars whose proper motion is known
to exceed 0.50. They are thus distributed :

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS.

Some very elegant and simple formule for determining the true orbit
of a binary star, originally published in Russian, have been brought
out by Professor Glasenapp.

é ScorpiiUerr Schorr has made a study of the motions in this
triple system by methods sim:lar to those employed by Dr. Seeliger on
‘ Caneri. The star is known as ¥ 1998, the magnitudes of its compo-
nents being A =3.9, B=5.2, C= 7.2.

7 Ophiuchi has been divided into two nearly equal components by
Burnham with the 36inch Lick telescope, and he thinks that it will
prove to be a binary of short period. He has also found companions
for Aldebaran, 7 Cassiopeiw, and 6 Cygni, and las been able to sepa-
rate and measure a companion te the principal star in the pair e Hydre,
the existence of which was suspected by previous observers.

Photographs of the spectrum of Spica have put beyond question the
reality of its motion in the direction of the line of sight. Dr. Vogel
has deduced from observations of 1889 and 18990 a period of revolution
of about 4 days.

PHOTOMETRY.

The results of observations made with the meridian photometer of
the Harvard observatory by Prof. E. C. Pickering and Mr. Wendell
during the years 1882-1888, have appeared as volume 24 of the Harvard
Annals. The principal work done with this instrument was “the de-
termination of the magnitudes of a sufficient number of stars con-
tained in the Durchmusterung, and distributed with approximate uni-
formity, to serve for future estimates or measures of magnitude, and
to enable previous estimates to be reduced tothe photometric scale.”
aati adie

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 131

The number of stars of which observations are recorded is 20,125;
so that when the stars enumerated in volume 28 of the Annais are reck-
oned, the total number of stars observed reaches 26,982. Measures
have also been made of 166 variable stars and of several planets and
satellites. In the ‘* Harvard Photometry” the brightest stars were com-
pared solely with Polaris. In the present observations 4 Urs Minoris
was selected as the standard star, but the results are made to depend
upon a series of 100 circumpolar stars, the magnitudes of which were
frequently determined with the smaller instrument.

Photographic photometry.—The readiest and most effective ineans of
determining the magnitudes of stars from an examination of the disks
impressed on a sensitized film is a problem that has received much
attention recently, and contributions to the literature of the subject
have been made from the three observatories of Harvard, Stockholm,
and Potsdam.

Professor Pickering gives in volume 18 of the Harvard Annals three
catalogues of magnitudes, embracing, on the whole, some 2,500 stars,
the first catalogue giving the photographic magnitudes of all the stars
brighter than the fifteenth magnitude within 1° of the pole; the second,
the magnitudes of many of the stars in the Pleiades; and the third the
magnitudes of 1,131 stars generally brighter than the eighth magnitude
near the equator.

The contribution from the Potsdam observatory is confined to the
discussion of the magnitudes of stars in the Pleiades as impressed on
plates taken with a chemically corrected object-glass by Dr. Scheiner,
and with the reflecting telescope of the Herény observatory, supple-
mented by some photographs of the artificial stars in a Zollner photom-
eter. The principal results of the inquiry are twofold: first, that the
increase of the diameter of the star disk varies as the square root of
the time of exposure ; and secondly, that a simple linear relation exists
between the observed diameter and the magnitude.

The third contribution to this subject is from Dr. Charlier, of Stoci-
holm, who deduces a formula which expresses the connection between
the photographic brillianey of a star and its photographed image in such
@ manner as to insure a coincidence as far as possible between the pho-
tographic aud photometric magnitudes.

VARIABLE AND COLORED STARS.

Chandler’s catalogue of variable stars.x—Chandler’s admirable cata-
logue of variable stars has been adopted by Schoenfeld in the ephemer-
ides published in the Vierteljahrsschrift, and it also furnishes the data
for the ephemerides of the Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes and the
Observatory, and is thus formally recognized as the standard authority
ou variables. Mr. Chandler publishes in the Astronomical Journal
(No, 216) three tables supplementary to the catalogue, containing (1) a
list of new variables arranged as in the original catalogue; (2) a list of
132 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

additions and corrections to the elements of the catalogue; and (3) a
list of stars probably variable, but whose variability needs further con-
firmation before definitive letters can be assigned. The attention of
observers is directed to this lst.

Taking his catalogue of 1888 as a basis, Mr. Chandler has made an
investigation of the relation existing between the lengths of the periods
and the number of the variables; their color, range of fluctuation,
forms of light curves, irregularities of periods and of light variations.
Periods under 20 days predominate, while for the long-period stars a
well-marked maximum is indigated about a period of 320 days. With
regard to color, the redder the tint the longer the period; and with
regard to range of fluctuation, while it is probable that there is a de-
pendence of range upon the duration of the period, the relation is not
one of strict proportionality of range to period. It furthermore appears
that the average ratio of increase to decrease for stars with periods less
than 100 days is about 0.65; between 100 and 200 days it is slightly in
excess of unity; it then declines as the periods lengthen ; at first, grad-
ually, but in the neighborhood of a year, with extraordinary sudden-
ness, recovering as quickly until it again exceeds unity in the group of
extremely long periods. In the case of the numerical laws of the per-
turbations of the periods, Mr. Chandler remarks that his researches
are not yet complete, but that, broadly, in the case of long-period vari-
ables, the irregularities are periodic in their nature, and in the case of
those of short period, secular and exceptional.

Algol.—Prof. H. C. Vogel, of Potsdam, has published the results of
some interesting ebservations of the changes in the spectrum of Algol
at the times of the diminution and recovery of its light. These, whilst
fully confirming the view originally suggested by Goodricke, that the
periodic variability of this star is caused by the revolution of a dark
companicn cutting off part of its light in the manner of an eclipse, and
the calculation of Professor Pickering that the diameter of the compan-
ion amounts to about eight-tenths of that of the principal star, have
enabled Professor Vogel to obtain approximate values of the mutual dis-
tance and actual sizes and masses of the two stars, as well as of their
orbital velocities round their common center of gravity. He finds, in
fact, that their diameters are probably about 1,080,000 and 850,000
English miles respectively ; that the distance of their centers from each
other amounts to about 3,290,000 miles, and that the orbital velocity of
Algol is about 27, whilst that ofits companion is about 56 miles. The
mass of the former he determines to be about double that of the latter,
the one being approximately four-ninths and the other two-ninths of the
sun’smass. It is not necessary, he remarks, to suppose that the com-
panion is absolutely opaque, but only that its light is very much feeb-
ler than that of the principal star.

It may be added tinat the Greenwich observations confirm Dr. Vogel’s
conclusion of the motion of the star in a small orbit.
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 133

A remarkable star of the Algol type, having the shortest period
known, was discovered in 1888 by Prof. H. M. Paul, of the U.S. Naval
Observatory. The star is 12 Antliw of Gould’s Uranometria Argentina,
a=9 26™ 508, d= — 28° 4.7 (1875.0). The range of magnitude is 6.7 to
7.3, and according to Chandler it goes through its changes in 3" 20",

From an examination of one of the photographie plates taken by the
Harvard observatory party, at the Chosica station in Peru, Professor
Pickering has announced the discovery of a long-period variable in
Celum of the same class as O Ceti, Ro Hvdrie, and R Leonis. The
spectra show bright hydrogen lines.

A number of other new variables have been detected in the exami-
nation of the photographic plates taken at the observatory, and have
been announced by Professor Pickering in the Astronomische Nach-
richten. Some attention has also been paid to this subject by Dr. J. C.
Kapteyn in measuring the plates taken at the Cape of Good Hope for
the formation of Dr. Gill’s photographic southern Durchmusterung, and
also by Mr. Roberts in the prosecution of his work in astronomical pho-
tography.

A general index to observations of variable stars, prepared under
the direction of Prof. E. C. Pickering, forms No. 8 of Vol. 18 of the Har-
vard Annals. <A large number of unpublished observatious are referred
to, particularly three extensive series of observations by Argelander,
Heis, and Schmidt, to whose manuscripts access was given.

A new edition or rather revision of Birmingham’s Red Star Catalogue
has been printed in No. v of the Cunningham Memoirs of the Royal
Irish Academy. The work of revision was undertaken by Rev. T. E.
Espin in 1886, with the 174-inch equatorial reflector, and in the course
of the work a number of new red stars, new variables, and stars with
bright lines in their spectra were discovered. There is also an addi-
tional list of 629 ‘* ruddy stars.”

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Spectrum of € Urse Majoris.—Protessor Pickering has reported a re-
markably interesting peculiarity in the spectrum of this star. It was
noticed that the K line was double in the photographs taken March 29,
1887, May 17, 1889, and August 27 and 28, 1889, while on many other
dates the line appeared hazy as if the components were slightly sepa-
rated, and at other times the line was well defined and single. It was
concluded that the line was double at intervals of 52 days beginning
March 27, 1887, and it was predicted that the doubling would occur
again on December 9, 1889, and this prediction was confirmed by each
of three photographs on the latter date. Professor Pickering says:

“The only satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon as yet pro-
posed is that the brighter component of this star is itself a double star
having components nearly equal in brightness and too close to have been
separated as yet visually. Also that the time of revolution of the sys-
134 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

tem is 104 days. When one component is approaching the earth all
the lines in its spectrum will be moved toward the blue end, waile all
the lines in the spectrum of the other Component will be moved by an
equal amount in the opposite direction if their masses are equal. Each
line will thus be separated into two. When the motion becomes per-
pendicular to the line of sight, the spectral lines recover their true
wave-length and become single.”

From the amount of separation of the lines Professor Pickering con-
cludes that the relative velocity of the two components must be about
100 miles per second. If the orbit is circular and its plane passes
through the sun, the distance traveled by one component, regarding
the other as fixed, would be 900,000,000 miles, and the distance apart
of the two components would be 143,000,000 miles, or about that of
Mars and the sun. The combined mass would be about forty times
that of the sun to give the required period.

Several other stars have been found from the Harvard photographs
with a similar doubling of the lines, among them / Aurigze and 0 Ophi-
uchi. For # Aurige Professor Pickering deduced a period of 4 days,
and his results have been fully confirmed by observations made with
quite different apparatus by Dr. Vogel at Potsdam.

A doubling of the K line in several photographs of the spectrum of
Vega taken by Mr. A. Fowler, apparently indicating that Vega was a
double star of the ¢ Ursz Majoris type, has not been confirmed by the
photographs of Pickering, Vogel, and Henry.

The Henry Draper Nena? mys third annual report of Proteesar
Pickering announces the practical completion of two branches of the
work undertaken, the photographic survey of the spectra of all stars
north of — 25° declination having been effected on a twofold scale, the
one survey including all stars brighter than the seventh magnitude, the
other including stars two magnitudes fainter. The Bache 8-inch doub-
let employed in this work has been transferred to a station near Chos-
ica in Peru and similar surveys for the stars down to the south pole
have been commenced.

The fourth annual report of the Henry Draper Memorial contains as
a frontis piece an engraving showing the periodical duplication of the
K line in the spectruin of @ Aurige, the study of which, with other
similar cases has been the most important work of the 11-inch equa-
torial at Harvard. The spectroscopic survey of the brighter stars
in the northern hemisphere (to — 25° declination) is nearly printed
and the work on fainter stars is heing satisfactorily pressed. Besides
the spectra, charts of the entire sky are being formed with the same
telescopes. A photographie map of the sky will thus be provided, ap-
proximately on the scale of the Durchmusterung, but including fainter
stars; so far as it has been completed it has proved very convenient
for studying suspected variables and in detecting errors in star cata-
logues.
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 135

Reference should also be made here to the lists of stars with peculiar
spectra detected upon the Harvard Observatory photographic plates
and published from time to time by Professor Pickering in the Astro-
nomische Nachrichten.

A spectroscopic survey of the southern heavens by direct observa-
tion has been undertaken at the Melbourne Observatory. An 8‘inch
refracter and the 4-foot reflector will be used in the work.

MOTIONS OF STARS IN THE LINE OF SIGHT.

Dr. Vogel’s interesting results with regard to Algol and other stars
have been alluded to elsewhere.

Bright lines in stellar spectra.—Mr. Espin has detected bright lines in
the spectra of a number of variables when near their maxima, among
them R Leonis, R Hydrve, 7 Cygni, R Andromede, and S Cassiopcize
all of Seechi’s third type. Similar lines in the spectra of U and V
Cygni, of the fourth type have been suspected by the Lick observers,
and when these stars were far removed from their maxima. Mr. Keeler
also finds that he is able to break up the apparently continuous spectra
of stars of the type of the Wolf-Rayet stars in Cygnus into an extremely
complicated range of absorption bands and faint bright lines.

A remarkable form of spectrum has been discovered by Professor
Pickering in that of the star Pleione, for the F line consists in this case
of a narrow bright line superposed on a broader dark line, the other
hydrogen lines showing some indications of a similar character.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The photographic chart of the heavens.—The permanent committee
appointed by the Astrophotographic Cougress at Paris, in 1887, as noted
in the Review of Astronomy for the years 1887-88, held their first
meeting at the Paris Observatory in September, 1890. The results of
the seven séances are contained in a series of twenty-eight resolutions,
some of the most important of which are mentioned below.

No observatory in the United States appears on this list. A bill was
introduced in Congress making an appropriation to enable the United
States Naval Observatory to undertake a share of the work, but the
bill failed to become a law.

The committee decided that the field of the telescope available for
measurement should be 2° square; that the photographie plates em-
ployed (which are to be of plate glass) should be 160™™ (64 inches)
square and the series of reference lines 130™™ (51 inches) square with
the lines 5™™ apart.

Twelve test objects were selected, all of which are situated near the
equator, at intervals of about two hours of right ascension. In addition
to these, the Pleiades, Priesepe, and a group in Cygnus were selected
for the use of the more northern observatories.

To fix the time of exposure so that the plates shall contain stars to
the eleventh magnitude, it was decided to determine first the time nec-
essary to photograph a star of the 9.0 magnitude of Argelander’s scale,
and thereby multiplying by 6.25 the time of exposure for magnitude
11.0 will be obtained.

Three more numbers (3, 4, and 5) of the Bulletin du Comité Interna-
tional permanent pour VExécution Photographique de la Carte du Ciel
have been published. Among the many papers contributed to these
STRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. La¢

bulletins which have a very important bearing upon astronomical pho-
tography, may be mentioned one by Dr. Bakhuysen on the measure-
ment of the plates by the method of rectangular cobrdinates, in which
he obtains star- places comparing favorably with those from meridian
observations, Dr. Vogel contributes one or two papers on the “ rés-
eaux ” and the measurement of the plates, and Professor Kapteyn sug-
gests the expediency of taking the catalogue plates with three exposures
at intervals of six months, for the purpose of determining the stars’
proper motions and parallaxes. Dr. Scheiner las an important paper
on the application of photography to the determination of stellar mag-
nitudes.

In the fifth number of the Bulletin, Professor Holden has two papers
on the photographic magnitedes of stars, and Mr. Schaeberle one on
the same subject. There is also an abstract of Dr. Lindemann’s photo-
metric determination of the star magnitudes of the Bonn Durchmus-
terung, and a paper by M. Trépied on the necessity of coming to some
understanding as to what is meant by stars of the 9th, 11th, and 14th
magnitudes on the photographie plates.

The question of the reproduction of the plates and of the publication
of the map has been left open, but it is probable that one or more
bureaus will be established for measuring the negatives obtained at
observatories not provided with special apparatus for the purpose, and
photographie copies of all plates will be preserved in selected places in
case of accident to the original negatives.

A meeting of those interested in the various branches of astronomical
photography other than the chart was called by Messrs. Janssen and
Common in September, 1889. The chief matters for discussion being a
complete photographic record of solar phenomena, including solar
spectrum photography; a systematic description of the lunar surface
by photography on a large seale; photographs of pianets and their
satellites, of comets, meteors, and particularly of nebulie, clusters, and
of stellar spectra.

In discussing the theory of the photography of a star projected upon
a bright background, Professor Holden cails attention to the faet that
the most important factor is the ratio of the focal length to the aperture
of the objective; generally speaking it would be an advantage to dia-
phragm the objective during the day. This is also true with regard to
ordinary observations during the day, a point of particular importance
in connection with meridian observations.

Authoritative testimony as to the value of photography for obtaining
accurate measures of star clusters is given by Dr. Elkin, who has com-
pared Dr. Gould’s reductions of Rutherfurd’s photographs of the Plei-
ades taken over 20 years ago, with the heliometer measures made at
Konigsberg and New Haven. The smallness of the probable error Dr.
Elkin regards as proof that in photography we have a means of in-
vestigation for micrometri¢ work at least on a par with any existing
138 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

method, and doubtless far surpassing the present methods in ease of
measurement and output of work.

The Henry Brothers are reported to have made a decided advance
in lunar photography in the plates taken with the equatorial of 0™.32
(12.6 inches) aperture intended for the chart work. The improvement is
attributed especially to the process of enlargement employed, which
makes the diameter of the moon about 1™ (39 inches). This photographic
work is to be continued with the great equatorial coudé, which is soon
to be mounted and provided with a photographic objective.

Mr. Roberts has devised a machine, which he calls a “ pantograver,”
for measuring the magnitudes of the stars depicted upon the photo-
graphic plates and transferring them to metallic plates for printing.

COMETS.

The origin of comets.—Dr. Bredichin, the present director ef the Pul-
kowa Observatory, who has devoted much time to the study of comet-
ary phenomena, has expressed the opinion that periodic comets owe their
origin to the segmentation of ordinary parabolic comets, having been
thrown off from the latter by an eruption such as it is generally sup-
posed we have witnessed in the great comet of 1882, and earlier in
Biela’s comet. Dr. Kreutz’s monograph on this great September comet
of 1882 forms one of the most important of recent contributions to com-
etary literature. The formidable obstacles to an accurate determination
of its orbit presented by the disintegration of the nucleus into several
points of condensation seem to have been most skillfully surmounted
by the computer. His final value for the period of revolution is 772.2
years.

Dr. Holetschek claims that the systematic grouping of cometary peri-
helia in certain directions (270° and 90° of heliocentric longitude) has
no connection with the general motion of the solar system in space,
but is due to the position of the earth at the time that such discoveries
are most readily made.

An important paper on the capture theory of comets will be found
in the Bulletin Astronomique for June, 1889, and in the same journal for
December, 1890, M. Tisserand has a further contribution to the same
subject.

The Observatory for August, 1889, has a useful table of the approxi-
mate positions at the time of discovery of all comets seen since 1869,
with brief notes on the physical appearance of each. Mr. Denning, who
has compiled this table, proposes to supplement it by one with similar
data for the comets from 1840 to 1868.

Brorsen’s comet.—A careful search for Brorsen’s comet, which passed
perihelion in 1890, was made by Brooks and Swift, but without effect.
This comet was discovered in 1846, and was last seen in 1879; it could
not be seen at the return in 1884. Tempel’s second comet, and Bar-
nard’s comet 1884 II, were also expected to return to perihelion in
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 139

1890, but were unfavorably situated for observation and escaped de-
tection.

Comets of 1889 and 1890.—W. R. Brooks reported the discovery, on
the morning of January 15, 1889, of a faint comet in Sagittarius, and to
it the designation Comet a 1889 was given, as the first comet discovered
during the year. <A careful search for the object was made by a num.
ber of observers, especially by Barnard and Swift, but without success.
As the three observations necessary for determining the orbit were not
secured, the comet is not catalogued with those of the year. A comet
announced by Swift on July 15, 1889, is also omitted, as it proved to be
identical with the comet discovered by Brooks on August 7, 1888.
(1888 111).

A phenomenon reported at Grahamstown, South Africa, on the 27th of
October, 1890, should be mentioned in connection with the notes on comets.
It was described as a bright band one-fourth of a degree wide and 30°
longitude, afterwards increasing to 90°. At one end it looked like the
head of a comet, while the other end faded out gradually. Its motion
was extraordinary, as it swept over more than 100° in less than 1" 15",

The comets for the years 1889 and 1890, with their final designations,
in the order of perihelion passage are as follows:

Comet 1889 I: | ‘The first comet of 1889, in the order of perihelion

Lick Observatory with a 4-inch comet-seeker on September 2, 1888, or
the morning of September 3. It was also independently discovered by
Brooks, at Geneva, New York, on the following morning. At the end
of November, and as late as January 4, 1889, it was visible to the naked
eye. Perihelion was passed on January 31, 1889, and by that time,
the comet disappeared in the sun’s rays. The first observations after
conjunction were made about May 24, and it was followed till its light
Was again overpowered by that of the sun, Jate in October, 1889, its
appearance being about the same as before perihelion, small, round,
quite bright, and with a short tail. The orbit seems to be hyperbolic.

Barnard remarked on June 3 that there was an anomalous tail directly
following the comet, about 1° in length and some 2’ or 3’ broad, a phe-
nomenon which, according to Bredichin, was probably an effect of per-
spective.

The comet was observed again at the Lick Observatory by Barnard
August 17, 1890, although its distances from the earth and sun were
then, respectively, 6.0 and 6.5 in terms of the earth’s mean distance.
The later observations confirm the hyperbolic character of the orbit.
Comet 1889 II: | On the evening of March 31, 1889, E. E. Barnard
_ = Comet b1889. | discovered, with the 12-inch equatorial of the Lick
Observatory, a very small and slender comet, with a tail 15’ long. By
the end of April it was lost in the evening twilight, reappearing again,
with extremely slow geocentric motion, about July 25, and remaining
visible to November 21. The great perihelion distance of this comet is

140 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

especially noteworthy, amounting to 24 times the distance of the eartb
from the sun, a distance which seems to have been surpassed in the
catalogue of comets only by comet 1885 IT, with a perihelion of 23, and
the comet of 1729, with perihelion distance 4.

Comet 1889 IIf: | Mr. Barnard discovered another comet at about

stellation Andromeda, At the time of discovery the comet was only
three days past perihelion. It was then very faint and rapidly became
still fainter, being last observed on August 6. The elements computed
by Berberich show cousiderable ellipticity in the orbit, the period of
revolution being 128 years.
Comet 1889 IV: | <A tolerably bright comet was discovered with the
= Comet e 1859. naked eye by Mr. J. Ewen Davidson at Brans-
combe, Mackay, Queensland (latitude — 21° 9’ south), on July 19. It
had a sharp, stellar nucleus, and a tail 30’ long; in a photograph
taken by Barnard at the Lick Observatory on July 30, the tail could be
foilowed still farther, to a distance of almost 1° from the head. A second
tail was reported by Kammermann, of Geneva, on the 17th of August,
and a segmentation of the nucleus by Ricco about a week earlier.
Professor Holden finds that the brightest part of the tail was 73,

“The re was folowed in the northern Teens to about the end
of the year.

The spectrum according to the Lick and Palermo observations in
July and August showed no peculiarity; the carbon bands, and the
continuous spectrum of the nucleus, alone being recorded.

Comet 1889 V: | William R. Brooks, of Geneva, New York, while

_=Comet d 1889. _ | sweeping in the southwestern sky on the morning
of July 6, 1889, detected a suspicious looking nebulous object, the com-
etary character of which he was able to confirm on the following
morning; it was then faint, of about 11th magnitude, a diameter of 1’,
stellar nucleus, and tail 10’ long. The comet attracted no especial
attention from astronomers till August 1, when Barnard discovered
that it had two small and nebulous companions, and on the morning
following it was evident that these two objects were moving with the
parent comet throuen space. Mr. Barnard says:

‘On August 3 they were examined with the 36-inch equatorial, which
showed the whole group very beautifully. Each of the companions had
a very small nucleus and condensation in a very small head and a short
faint tail, presenting a perfect miniature of the larger one, which was
pretty Rene and well developed, with small nucleus and slightly fan-
shaped tail 4° long. There was then absolutely no nebulous connection
with the eae nor has there been at any time since, either in the 12-
inch or in the 36-inch telescope. Nothing whatever has been seen here
of the nebulous envelope spoken of by the Vienna observers as appar-

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 141

ently inclosing the whole group (A. N., 2914). I have from the first -
carefully looked for a nebulous connection. Under unfavorable circum-
stances the tails of B and C might be imagined to be a connecting neb-
ulosity, but the tail of b falls short of A, and that of C does not nearly
reach B. Each comet is in appearance absolutely independent of the
other. The tails of all three have lain in the line of the nucleus of A,
and therefore have not sensibly deviated, from the position-angle 241°.”

“On August 4, two other companions were detected with the great
telescope, one of which was measured, the other being too elusive to
set the wire on. I have numbered these four companions B, C, D, EH,
in theaorder of increasing right ascension, A being the larger comet, D
and IX being the two last discovered. D has been seen several times
since the moon withdrew, but has always been too faint to observe. It
has not sensibly changed its position. E has only been seen onee. Its
position angle referred to © would be the same as that of D, and its
distance twice as great. Four or five other nebulous bodies observed
near the comet, August 2, have net since been seen, and were probably
nebulous.

‘The results of the observations of the two brighter companions are
extremely interesting. Measures of Bb have been made on eighteen, and
of C on seventeen nights. These two have almost exactly the same
position-angles, which have been sensibly constant. Their distances
from the main body have, however, been increasing. At the last ob-
servations, B seems to be stationary, the distance from A remaining
constant, while C continues to recede.”

Mr. Chandler’s investigation of the orbit of this comet has devel-
oped a strong probability that it is identical with a comet discovered
by Messier in 1770, often called Lexell’s lost comet, because that
astronomer calculated that it was moving in an elliptie orbit with a
period of about 54 years, though it was not seen afterwards. Itis now
well known that this was due to the fact that at the return in 1776
its position was such as to render any observation impossible, and
before another return could take place the comet made in 1779 so
close an approach to the planet Jupiter as completely to change
the nature of the orbit. Mr. Chandler finds that Brooks’s comet also
made a near approach to Jupiter, so near, in fact, on May 20, 1886, that
it was only about nine diameters of Jupiter distant, or only a little
outside the orbit of his third satellite. Calculation of the elements of
the comet orbit before this appulse leads to the conclusion that they
present a great similarity to those of Lexell’s comet after its approach
to the planet in 1779, rendering the probability great that the bodies
are identical. Mr. Chandler shows that no similar serious disturbance
willoceuragain until 1921, so that appearances may be looked for in 1896,
1903, 1910, and 1917, at each of which return the condition of visibility
will be favorable, giving opportunities for further investigations into
the motions of this interesting comet, which, it appears, narrowly

escaped being converted into a fifth satellite of Jupiter. Mr. Barnard
succeeded in finding and observing the comet again, on the night of
November 21, 1890, with the 36-inch Lick telescope, eight months after
it had been given up as beyond reach ; and when its distance from the
earth was 3.09, and from the sun 3.55.

Comet 1889 VI: | Swift, at Rochester, discovered a new comet on
=Comet f 1839. | November 16, while searching for new nebule; it

was a faint round nebulous mass, without tail, and it remained ex-
ceedingly faint during its entire period of visibility; being seen in
only the most powerful telescopes about the middle of January. The
orbit proved to be elliptical, and with .the remarkably short period of
8.8 years, according to Searle’s computation.

Comet 1890 I: A faint comet was discovered by Borelly at the
=Comet g 1889. Marseilles Observatory on December 12, 1889, this

being the first comet, after an interval of three years, discovered in

Europe. On January 8, 1890, it appeared in the finder of the Munich

refractor like a faint star of the seventh or eighth magnitude.

peared below the northwest horizon. Parabolic elements represent the
observations quite accurately, though they show some resemblance to
those of the comet of 1580.

Comet 1890 IV: This comet was discovered three months and a

Dr. Spitaler, in looking for the comet discovered by Zona, turned the
27-inch telescope towards the place which it should occupy, according to
the dispatch received by him, and immediately perceived a very faint
comet, but conciuding from the description that Zona’s was brighter, by
turning the telescope a little he found the latter, physical connection
between the two being excluded by the slower motion of his own. The
period appears to be about 6.4 years.

METEORS.

A valuable résumé of meteoric astronomy has been published by Prof.
J, Rh. Wastman in the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washing.
ton. (Vol. x1.) Abstracts of the various theories propounded in ex-
144 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

planation of meteors are given, and extensive catalogues of observed
meteors and meteorites.

Mr. Denning pointed out several years ago that there were a number
of meteor streams in which the meteors seemed to radiate from the same
point in the sky for a period of three months or more. The only expla-
nation of this phenomenon seemed to be that the meteors were moving
with frightful velocity through space, but M. Tisserand, from a mathe-
matical study of the problem, shows that these meteors do not all
come from the same stream; they may perhaps belong to a family pre-
senting certain common characteristics, but they are in reality different
streams accidentally falling together, a not very improbable assumption
considering the great number of meteor streams and the difficulty of
determining the radiant with any degree of precision.

Mr. Denning does not, however, admit that an accidental coincidence
of radiant points of different streams is a sufficient explanation of the
phenomena he has observed.

THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.—Prof. Arthur Searle, who has made a special
study of the zodiacal light, finds that the permanence of the ordinary
western light, subject only to slight variations in the degree of. visi-
bility, isconfirmed by the observations of the last 50 years at the Hanaud
Observatory. The zodiacal bands, which are said to form a prolong-
ation of the ordinary zodiacal light, were not seen, though stellar or
nebulous bands, one extending from Aquila to the Pleiades, and the
second from Prasepe to Coma Berenices have been noticed and perhaps
offer an explanation of the zodiacal bands. The Gegenschein, it is sug-
gested, may be due to a maximum of light reflected from the meteoric
matter scattered in the solar system.

The observations of Prof. C. Michi Smith, carried on at intervals
since 1875 indicate a periodic appearance of the line at wave-length 553
in the zodiacal light spectrum ; a line differing but little in wave-length
from the auroral line (wave-length 556.7).

PLANETS.

A very laborious work is being carried on in the office of the Ameri-
can Kphemeris, under the superintendence of Professor Neweomb—the
re-determination of the elements of all the larger planets. Professor
Newcomb’s plan includes the re-reduction of the older planetary obser-

rations and the discussion of the later ones, with a view of reducing
them all to a uniform system. Another branch of this planetary work
is a determination of the mass of Jupiter from the motions of Poly-
hymnia, and a comparison of Hansen’s tables of the moon with observed
occultations since 1750.

The first volume of this series of memoirs upon the theories of the
major planets has appeared in the ‘‘Astronomical Papers,” of the
American ephemeris, being a new discussion of Jupiter and Saturn by
Hill, He has determined the complete analytical expressious for the
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 145

cobrdinates of these two planets, giving also a provisional comparison of
his theory with observations. The method followed is in general that
of Hansen.

In commenting upon recent determinations of planetary masses from
the motions of comets, Professor Hall says:

“The objection to deducing values of planetary masses from the
motions of comets consists, I think, in the fact that apparently other
forces than that of gravitation act ou these bodies. As a comet ap-
proaches the sun it changes form, disintegrates, and matter is thrown
off to form a tail. Until we know more of the theory of these changes
the computation of masses from the motions of comets and inferences
about the resisting medium in space must be uncertain.”

Mrrcury.—the observations of Schroter early in the present cen-
tury indicated that Mercury had a motion of rotation about its axis of
about 24 hours. Subsequent observers failed, however, to confirm his
observations, and the question of Mercury’s rotation has generally been
regarded as one of the unsettled problems of astronomy. M. Schiapa-
relli, taking advantage of the clear sky of Milan, has observed Mercury
since 1881, obtaining about one hundred and fifty sketches, showing
quite well-marked spots, from which he has deduced a rotation period
of 85 days, the same, in fact, as the period of rotation of the planet
around the sun. Schiaparelli also concludes that the axis of rotation
must be nearly perpendicular to the orbit of the planet, the rotation
being uniform.

Dr. von Heerdtl has obtained the following values for the mass of
Mercury :

I. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,012,842 from Winnecke’s comet.
II. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,514,700 Le Verrier’s equation modified.
Ill. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,648,600 Encke’s comet, 1819-1868.
IV. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,669,700 Encke’s comet, 1271-1885.

VENUS.—Schiaparelli has concluded, from an exhaustive rediscussion
of all the older observations, combined with his own observations of
1877 and 1878, that Veuus rotates upon its axis in 225 days, or the same
time that it rotates about the sun, contrary to the generally received
hypothesis that its rotation period is about 23 hours. Venus, then, as
well as Mercury, would seem to turn always the same face to the sun,
as the moon turns the same face to the earth.

THE EKARTH— Variation of latitude.-—The subject of the change of ter-
restrial latitudes, to which allusion has been made in previous reports,
continues to receive considerable attention from astronomers and
geographers. The following results have been obtained by Dr. Kiist-
ner, in continuation of his former researches, {rom 7 pairs of stars at
three different times of the year:

Epoch. Latitude of Berlin.
1884. 32 +52° 30’ 16/.73—0.82 J A
1834. 70 16.964 0.83 J A
Le85:. SH | 16/.52—0.55 J A
H. Mis, 129 10
146 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890

where 4 A represents the correction to the assumed constant of aber-
ration. The direct inference from these figures is that in 7 months
the latitude of Berlin decreased 0.44. Pulkowa showed about the
same time a similar change:

Epoch. Latitude of Pulkowa
1882. 51 -+59° 46/ 18/.52
1883. 51 18/54
1834, 70 18/’.63
18285, 23 18”.31
1885. 31 18’’.30

a decrease of 0//.33 from 1884.70 to 1885.51.

The general agreement of these resuits certainly calls for farther
investigation ; and to test the matter Mr. Preston has been sent out by
the U.S. Coast Survey, and Dr. Marcuse by the International Geodetic
Commission, to Honolulu, which is at the opposite end of the earth’s
diameter from Berlin, and by simultaneous observations at these two
stations it is hoped the question will be settled.

It is quite possible that the origin of the apparent change at Berlin
in 1884-1885 is meteorological, a view to which Dr. Foerster inclined in
bringing the matter before the Association Géodésique in 1888. The
whole question is, then, whether there are changes in the disposition of
atmospheric strata sufficient to account for the facts observed, or the
axis of rotation and the axis of inertia of the earth are not sensibly
coincident.

A complete résumé of the subject is given by M. Tisserand in the
Bulletin Astronomique for September, 1890.

Mr. Riccd has experimented with a somewhat novel demonstration of
the rotundity of the earth. At the observatory of Palermo, which is
situated at a distance of 14 miles from the Mediterranean and 236 feet
above its level, a great number of photographs of the sun reflected from
the surface of the water have been taken afew minutes after rising or
before setting, and they show that the diameter in the plane of reflec-
tion is less in the reflected image than in the direct. This deformation
is due to the fact that the surface of the water forms a cylindrical
mirror, with axis horizontal and normal to the plane of reflection. The
amount of the observed flattening aceords well with that demanded by
theory.

Standard time.—The introduetion of the system of standard time,
which has been found of such practical usefulness in the United States,
has been quietly agitated in other countries for several years past, and
« well-written article upon the subject by Dr. Robert Schram will be
fonnd in the Observatory for April, 1890. The adoption of a uniform
time system, the time of the fifteenth meridian east of Greenwich, has
been very favorably looked upon in Austria and Germany for railroad
purposes.

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 147

Of the proposed change of the beginning of the astronomical day from
midday to the preceding midnight nothing has been heard since the
original agitation of the subject at the time of the Meridian Conference
at Washington in 1584.

The moows physical libration.—Dr. Julius Franz of the Kénigsberg
observatory has done an excellent piece of work in bringing to hght
and discussing (vol. 38, iXKOnigsberg Beobachtungen) the observations
of the moon made by Schliiter, an assistant of Bessel’s, in 1841-1843,
the work having been undertaken by Schititer under the immediate
supervision of his distinguished chief. The observations were continued
by Wichmann after Schiiiter’s death, but Wichmann was never able to
do more than to reduce his own observations for preliminary results to
be used in a discussion of all the material available.

Dr. Franz recommends the substitution of observations of the spot
Mosting A for those of the limbs, in determining the moon’s place, a
method upon which a report was published by the late Dr. C. H. F.
Peters in the U.S. Coast Survey volume for 1856.

Temperature of the moon.—A memoir on the temperature of the moon
by Mr. 8. P. Langley forms a part of the fourth volume of the publica-
tions of the National Academy of Sciences, and is re-published in a some-
what abbreviated form in the American Journal of Science tor Decem-
ber, 1889. The paper may be regarded as the completion of a piece of
work commenced in 1883, and represented by papers read in 1884 and
1856, as well as the present one. The principal conclusion drawn is
‘that the mean temperature of the sunlit lunar soil is much lower than
has been supposed, and is most probably not greatly above zero centi-
grade.” The principle by which this temperature is estimated is that
the position of the maximum in a curve, representing invisible radiant
heat of different wave-lengths, furnishes a criterion as to the tempera-
ture of the radiating solid body. In the lunar speetrum two distinet
heat maxima are found—one corresponding to radiation reflected from
the soil, the other to that emitted by it (when warmed by sunshine).
The determination of the second inaximum with accuracy would give
an accurate value for the temperature of the sunlit soil; but, unfortu-
nately, the absorption-bands produced by the earth’s atmosphere ob-
secure this maximum, and render the conclusions somewhat uncertain ;
so that Professor Langley is compelled to state his principal conclu-
sion in a guarded manner, as above quoted.

The Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
(vol. 24) contains an account of some measures of lunar radiation made
by Mr. C. C. Hutchins, by means of a new thermograph which he has
devised. This instrument consists of a single thermal junction of nickel
and iron placed in the focus of a small concave mirror, and is found to
be much more sensitive than a thermopile of forty-eight couples. The
measures of lunar radiation were made with an arrangement similar to
that of a Herschel’s telescope with the thermograph in place of an eye
148 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

piece, the conclusion reached being that the heat which the earth re-
ceives from the moon is to that from the sun as Lt is to 184,560. From
observations during the eclipse of January 28, 1888, Mr. Hutchins infers
that all but a minute portion of the rays from the lunar soil and rock
are cut off by our atmosphere, as it seems impossible that a surface
like that of the moon, upon which the sun has been shining for many
days, should suddenly cease to radiate when the sun’s light is with-
drawn.

MARs.—Durin gthe opposition of 1890 Mars again received special
attention from the Lick observers. Experiments were tried with colored
glasses, with diminished apertures, etc., all with small success. Many
photographs were also secured, but none that were pronounced satis-
factory. The mystery of the “canals” is still farther increased by the
fact that while Professor Holden and Mr. Keeler always saw the canals
as dark, broad, somewhat diffused bands, and Mr. Schaeberle saw them
in the same way when the seeing was bai, but under good condi-
tions described them as narrow lines a second of are or so in width.
On April 12 Mr. Schaeberle saw two of the canals doubled, thereby
verifying Professor Schiaparelli’s observations. The positions of most
of the canals have also been verified by some of the Lick astronomers.

JUPITER.— Mr. J. E. Keeler pablishes in the monthly notices for No-
vember a drawing of Jupiter made with the Lick 36-inch on the night of
August 28,1890. The great red spot is described as being of about the
same dimensions as in 1889, with a dark shading at its following end,
but the middle whiter and the arrangement of belts somewhat different.
‘It would seem, on the whole, that the surface features of Jupiter in-
dieate less activity in the internal forces of the planet than was man-
‘ifest a year ago.”

Barnard and Burnham have reported a very curious doubling of the
first satellite as seen with the 12-inch equatorial of the Lick observ-
atory. Of this phenomenon there seems to be but two possible explana-
tions: either there is a white belt on the satellite parallel to the belts of
Jupiter or the satellite is actually double.

M. Belopolsky has brought out from an examination of drawings of
Jupiter a peculiar variation in the time of rotation (first noted by Cas-
sini) with the latitude. A velocity of 9" 51™ was found in the zone 0°
to 5° in both hemispheres, and a time of rotation of 9° 55.5™ for the re-
mainder of the surface, both hemispheres, except between 5° and 10°
of north and south latitude, where the two velocities appear to occur
with equal frequency.

SATURN.—A peculiar white spot on the rings of Saturn attracted con-
siderable attention in the early part of 1889. This spot was first seen
by Dr. Terby, of Louvain, on March 6, 1889, who reported it as adjacent
to the shadow of the ball and similar to the white spots sometimes seen
upon Jupiter; on March 12 it was again seen with an 8 inch Clark tel-
escope, but on the 15th, 20th, 22d, and 23d, and on April 2, if was

;

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 149

invisible. While several observers confirmed Dr. Terby’s discovery,
nothing to correspond sufficiently with his description could be made
out by others, though provided with much more powerful apparatus.
Professor Hall has expressed the opinion that it was an optical effect
of contrast.

The very fine division of the outer ring detected with the 36-inch Liek
refractor early in 1838 was again seen in 1889 at a distance of about
one-sixth of the breadth of ring A from its outer edge. A dark shad-
ing extended inwards from the new division almost to the inner edge of
thering. Professor Holden has noted also an extremely narrow brighter
polar cap about 5 seconds of are wide, in a direction parallel to the
equator, and perpendicular to this about the width of the Cassini divi-
sion at the anse.

An interesting monograph on Saturn, the result of fourteen years
work, is contributed by Prof. Asaph Hall as Appendix 11 to the Wash-
ington Observations, 1885. The characteristic of this memoir is great
caution, and the three drawings of the planet, where a few scanty
markings represent all that Professor Hall can certainly see with a
fine telescope, should re-assure those who have been dissatisfied with
their modest instruments beeause they could not therewith recognize
the elaborate detail described by more imaginative observers. To
quote the author’s own words: ‘The appearance of Saturn in our
26-ineh refractor undergoes great changes from night to night, and
sometimes even from hour to hour during the same night. Probably
these changes are due to variations in our own atmosphere and in the
action of the objective, and they do not therefore indicate real changes
in the planet. Whenever we have a steady and transparent atmos-
phere, the outlines of the planct, the faint belts and markings on the
ball, the shadow of the ball on the ring, the dusky ring, and the Cassini
division are clear and distinet, and the abnormal phenomena sometimes
Seen are not visible. Without exception, my experience is that on
good nights the planet always has this natural appearance. But on
poor nights, when the image is blazing and unsteady, one can see and
imagine many Strange things about this wonderful! object.”

Professor Hall finds for the rotation period of the planet from obser-
vations of the white spot (1876, December 7 to 1877, January 2) 10"
14™ 23°, 8 + 28.3 mean time (see Astron. Nachr. No. 2146). Careful
discussions are also given of the position and dimensions of the ring.

The notch in the outline of the shadow was never seen at Washing-
ton, either by Professor Hall or his assistant. ‘The curvature of the
outline of the shadow presented an anomaly in 1876 when the convexity
appeared to be turned towards the ball, contrary to what we should
expect from geometrical considerations. The notes show that some-
thing of this kind was seen after the re-appearance of the ring in 1878.
After the ring was well opened, the curvature of the outline always
appeared natural or turned away from the ball.” (Observatory.)
150 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

The last determination of the thickness of Saturn’s ring, as Professor
Hall has pointed out, was made in 1848 by W.C. Bond, who found
that it was less than 0.”“01; Duséjour estimated its thickness at 0./72,
and Schroeter at 0.13. At the disappearance of the ring in Septeim-
ber and October, 1891, the conditions of observation are not very
favorable, a better opportunity occurring in 1892.

In connection with the approaching disappearance of the ring, an
account of observations made by M. E. lL. Trouvelot upon the passage
of the sun and earth through the plane of the rings in 1877-78 is of
especial interest.

Saturn’s satellites—Dr. Hermann Struve has published the second
installment of his work on the theory of Saturn’s satellites. In this he
discusses the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus, and their connection with
the other satellites, and he has been able to account satisfactorily for
the large corrections to the computed position of Mimas required
dvring the past few years. In his previous paper Dr. Struve was led
to assume @ Sensible mass for the ring-system of Saturn, but he now
concludes that this hypothesis must be rejected, the mass of the ring
being so small that the terms to which it would independently give
rise in the disturbing function are as yet undetected by observation.

A determination of the orbit of Titan and the mass of Saturn, the
result of several years’ work with the Yale observatory heliometer, is
published by Mr. Asaph HUall, jr., in the Transactions of the Yale
Observatory, 1889. His value for Saturn’s mass is 1:3500.5 + 1.44,
agreeing well with Bessel’s value 1: 3502, and that obtained by Struve
1:3498. :

URANvusS.—Dr. Huggins has found evidence of solar lines in the photo-
graphic spectrum of Uranus, with an exposure of two hours (June 3,
1889). All the principal solar lines were seen, but no others either
bright or dark. Mr. Taylor, on the other hand, has reported bright
flutings seen with a direct vision spectroscope attached to the five foot
reflecter of Common’s observatory, Ealing, and if this observation is
confirmed it will of course prove that the planet is at least in part self-
luminous.

THE MINOR PLANETS.

The discovery of additional members of the zone of asteroids goes
on without the least signs of abatement, and the number has now
reached 301, no fewer than 6 having been found in 1889, and 14 in 1890,
Twice during 1890 (April 25 and September 9) two were discovered on
the same evening by the same observer; and the two discovered by
Palisa on April 25 were independently discovered by Charlois on the
following evening, April 26.

An asteroid discovered by Charlois, November 14, 1890, and supposed
by him to be 298 (discovered September 9), proved to be not identical
with the latter. Consequently it takes the number 302.

SOLAR SYSTEM.

Prof. Lewis Boss has made a new determination of the amount and
direction of the solar motion based upon a list of 253 stellar proper
motions derived from the Albany zone observations. Professor Boss
considers, as the most probable result from these data, that the apex of
the sun’s way isin right ascension 18" 40™ ; declination +40°, or not far
from the star Vega.

Herr Oscar Stumpe, of Borm, has made a new determination of the
direction of the solar motion from the proper motions of 1,054 stars,
which he divides into four groups, according to the magnitudes of their
proper motions in a great circle. He thus obtains four different values
of the apex of the sun’s way, all agreeing in locating that point in the
constellation Lyra, or in the adjacent part of Cygnus.

Prof. J. R. Eastman, in an address as president of the Philosphieal
Society of Washington, has given an analysis of the investigations to
determine the apex of the sun’s motion and its velocity of translation.
He shows that, contrary to the ordinarily accepted belief, faint stars are
nearer us than bright stars; a result also shown by the list of stellar
parailaxes recently published by Oudemaus.
152 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.
SUN.

Rotation of the sun.—Mr. Crew, whose observations of the rotation
of the sun were noted in a previous summary, has made a@ new Sse-
ries of observations for the correction or confirmation of his coneclu-
sion that the angular velocity of rotation increased with an increase
of latitude. He still finds shorter rotation periods for the higher lati-
tudes, the mean value for the period at latitude 45° being 18 hours
shorter than at the equator, though owing to the smallness of this
amount and the uncertainty of theobservations he is of the opinion that
‘‘no certain variation of period with latitude has been detected with
the spectroscope.” Attention is called however to the wide differences
of the equatorial period as obtained by different methods, differences
which may be due to the fact that we are really dealing with different
Strata of the sun, though here also much reliance must not be placed
upon the observations.

Spectroscopie observations made by Dunér for determining the rota-
tion time of the sun, confirm the slowing down of the time of rotation
with an increase of heliocentric latititude, quite contrary to the result
recently obtained by Wilsing. A period of 25.46 days is deduced for
the sidereal rotation at the equator, and 38.54 days for that at latitude
74.8°,

Diameter of the sun.—Dr. Auwers discusses, in the third memoir on the
diameter of the sun, communicated to the Berlin Academy, the observa-
tions at Greenwich by Maskelyne and his assistants from 1765 to 1810.
Curious differences of personal equation between different observers are
brought out. Instead of Maskelyne’s observations giving progressively
smaller values of the sun’s diameter during his whole observing life, as
has hitherto been supposed, Dr. Auwers’s very exhaustive discussion
indicates that after the first two years (which gave a very large value)
the observed diameter remained nearly constant for the period 1767—
1772, then during the years 1772-1790 the diameter was continually
decreasing, lastly from 1790-1816 the observations gave a diameter con-
tinually increasing. The minimum value in 1790 was 31/58’.183—about
1” smaller than the value obtained from modern heliometer measures.

Npoerer’s rescarches on sun spots.— Professor Spoerer, who has devoted
much attention not only to the cuirent state of the solar activity, but
also to the early records of sun spots, published early in 1889 two im-
portant papers on the results of his researches in the latter field. The
two papers are entitled respectively, Ueber die Periodicitdt der Sonnen-
Jlecken seit dem Jahre 1618, communicated to the Royal Leopold-Caro-
line Academy, and Sur les differences que présentent Vhémisphére nord et
Vhémispheére sud du Soleil, appearing in the number of Bulletin Astrono-
mique for February, 1889. The conclusions arrived at in these two
papers may be summarized under the three following heads:

First: These earlier observations afford us many examples of the
operation of the ‘law of zones;” that is to say, a little before a mini-

a
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 153

mum spots are only seen in low latitudes, at about the time of mini-
mum spots near the equator cease to appear, while a fresh series of
spots break out a great distance from it, and thenceforward to the
next minimum the mean heliographic latitude of the spots tends to
decline continuously, until at length spots are again seen only in the
vicinity of the equator. This law held good, Professor Spoerer shows,
for the minima of 1619, 1755, 1775, 1784, 1833, and 1844, and. to some
extent for that of 1645.

Second: Though in general a predominance of spots for a time in
one hemisphere is sooner or later balanced by a corresponding predom-
inance in the other, this is not always the ease, and Professor Spoerer
calls attention to three periods in which the southern hemisphere was
decidedly the more prolific. The first was from 1621 to 1625, there be-
ing no northern spots in 1621 and 1622, and but few in the three fol-
lowing years. Another is the present period, for from 1883 to the pres-
ent time the southern spots have been nearly twice as numerous as the
northern. But the third was the most remarkable, tor from 1672 to
1704 we have no record of any northern spots at all; and Cassini and
Maraldi expressly declared, on the appearance of a northern spot in
1705, that they did not recollect ever to have observed a spot in that
hemisphere before. Northern spots continued to be infrequent until
1714.

Third: For a period of about seventy years, ending in 1716, there
seems to bave been a very remarkable interruption of the ordinary
course of the spot cycle. In several years no spots appear to have
been seen at all, and in 1705 it was recorded as a most remarkable
event that two spots were seen on the sun at the same time, for a sim-
ilar circumstance had scarcely ever been seen during the sixty years
previous. So far as the observations go, the “law of zones” also seems
to have been in abeyance, for no regular drift was apparent, the mea
latitude being ip sbeut S° or 99—during the entire time.

Professor Spoerer is still continuing his researches into ancient sun-
spot records, and hopes to be able to examine the manuscripts of Plant-
ade (1705-1726) and of Flaugergues (1794-1830). (. W. M. Monthly
Notices R. A. S., February, 1890).

Attention should be directed to a paper in the Monthly Notices for
December, 1890, by Rev. A. L. Cortie, S. J., on the sun-spot observa-
tions made at Stonyhurst in the years 1882-89.

A comparison of sun-spot statistics for 1878 with the records of 1889
gives a sun-spot period of exactly 11 years, and it seems probable that
the real minimum occurred about the end of 1889. This probability is
increased by the appearance on March 4, 1890, of a large spot in helio-
graphic latitude +54°, which during its period of visibility in a semi-
rotation of the sun passed within one-sixth of the sun’s diameter from
its northern edge. During the whole of the year 1889 the southern
hemisphere of the sun manifested greater activity than the northern;
154 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

protuberances were seen, according to Tacchini, in both hemispheres at
high latitudes where there were neither spots nor facule; there were
also zones with spots and without. facule.

Mr. Lockyer has presented a second report to the Solar Physics com-
mittee on the observations of sun-spot spectra made at South Kensing-
ton. He finds that the observations (to February, 1888) confirm the
conclusion which he arrived at in 1886, that “as we pass from minimum
to maximum the lines of the chemical elements gradually disappear
from among those most widened, their places being taken by lines of
which we have at present no terrestrial representatives.

SOLAR SPECTRUM.

Thollon’s chart of the solar spectrum.—tIn 1879 Thollon presented to
the Académie des Sciences a map of the solar spectrum, extending from

A to H, made with his great spectroscope. His work was renewed with -

more perfect apparatus, but on account of the great labor of the under-
taking he confined himself to the region from A to b; this was pre-
sented to the Academy in 1885, and gained the Lalande prize. Thollon
continued this work until his death, and it has now been published in
33 maps with a total length of 10™.23 (33.6 feet), and contains about 3,200
lines, between the limits ado pted, A and d, the positions of which were
determined from 252 sharp lines adopted as “ fundamentals.”

Thollon made special efforts to distinguish the telluric ravs from those
entirely due to the sun; and with this end in view he observed the sun
at different altitudes, noting the hygrometric conditions of the air. Of
these 3,200 lines mapped, 2,090 were of solar origin, 866 telluric, and
246 mixed, that is to say resulting from the superposition of telluric and
solar lines. The breadth and intensity of each line is given upon an
arbitrary scale.

M. Bigourdan, in a review of Thollon’s work, published in the May
number of the Bulletin Astronomique, says that for the part of the spec-
trum studied no work is comparable with that of Thollon except the
magnificent photographs of Rowland, and he finds upon a critical cem-
parison of different regions of considerable extent that Rowland’s pho-
tographs contain no lines not upon Thollon’s chart, though the faintest
lines given upon the chart are frequently lacking in the photographs.
Between wave-lengths 5,262 and 5,337, for example, in Rowland’s pho-
tograph, there are not half the number of lines that there are upon
Thollon’s chart, though it is probable that the original negatives would
not show so large a difference.

Rowland’s determination of elements in the sun.—Professor Rowland’s
examination by photography of the spectra of 58 elements and their com-
parison with the spectrum of the sun shows the existence in the sun of
35 different elements; the existence of 8 more in the sun is doubtful,
while of 10 he finds no trace. The element represented by the greatest
number of lines isiron, there being 2,000 or more lines in the spectrum

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 155

of iron found also in the solarspectrum. Lron is followed by nickel, titan-
ium, manganese, chromium, cobalt, carbon, with decreasing frequency of
coincidences, ending with lead and potassium, for which but one line is
found in common with the sun.

The full list of elements in the sun, arranged according to the inten-
sity and the number of lines in the solar spectrum, is as follows:

Professor Rowland says: ‘“ With the bigh dispersion here used

the ‘basic lines’ of Lockyer are widely broken up and cease to exist.
Indeed it would be difficult to prove anything except accidental coinei-
dences among the lines of the different elements. Accurate investiga-
tion generally reveals sone slight difference of wave length or a com-
mon impurity. furthermore, the strength of the lines in the solar
156 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

spectrum is generally very nearly the same as that in the electric are,
with only a few exceptions, as, for instance, calcium. The cases men-
tioned by Lockyer are generally those where he mistakes groups of
lines for single lines or even mistakes the character of the line entirely.
Altogether there seems to be very little evidence of the breaking up
of the elements in the sun, as far as my experiments go.”

M. Janssen, in August, 1890, repeated the observations that he made
in 1888, upon Mont Blane, this time ascending to the summit. He
confirmed completely his former result that the lines of the spectrum
due to the action of oxygen in our atmosphere diminish with the alti-
tude, indicating that at the limit of the atmosphere these rays would
disappear entirely and in consequence that oxygen is not actually present
in the sun’s atmosphere. This conclusion had already received confir-
mation from a series of observations of the spectrum of an electric
light placed on the Hiffel Tower, as viewed from the observatory at
Meudon. .

ECLIPSES.

Eclipses of 1889, and 1890.—During the year 1889, there were five
eclipses, three of the sun and two of the moon; and during 1890, three
eclipses, two of the sun and one of the moon. ‘Two of the solar eclipses
of 1889 were total, and one of 1890 was total over a portion of the
central line.

The Almanac records also a lunar appulse on June 2, 1890, the near-
ness of the approach and the uncertainty as to the effect of the earth’s
atmosphere rendering it doubtful whether the moon would actually
enter the earth’s shadow. Of the eclipses of the moon nothing of
aspecial interest has been reported. A brief summary of the observa-
tions of the solar eclipses is given below:

Total eclipse of the sun January 1, 1889.—The event of chief astro-
nomical interest in the year 1889, was the eclipse of the sun on New
Yeav’s day, the last total solar eclipse visible in the United States in this
century. The line of central eclipse crossed California, Nevada, Idaho,
Wyoming, Montana, and Dakota, the width of the belt of totality being
about 96 miles in California; the partial phases of the eclipse were
visible over the greater part of North America, first contact being
observed at Washington a few minutes before sunset. Ample prepa-
rations were made for utilizing the less than two minutes of totality,
and printed circulars suggesting to amateur observers the most efficient
inanner of employing the means at their command were widely cireu-
lated. The most thoroughly equipped party in the field was that from
the Harvard observatory under the charge of Prof. W. H. Pickering,
at Willows, California. This party alone secured between 50 and 60
photographs taken with 14 telescopes or cameras and 8 spectroscopes,
one of the telescopes being of 13 inches aperture, the largest ever used
in observing a total solar eclipse. A party from the Lick observatory

Se ee eee
“ASTRONOMY FOR. 1889, 1890. 157

under Mr. Keeler was at Bartlett Springs; one from Washington Uni-
versity observatory, St. Louis, under Prof. H. 8S. Pritchett at Norman;
one from Carleton College observatory under Professor Payne at Chico;
and many other available points were occupied by individual astron-
omers or photographers. At Cloverdale the Pacific Coast Amateur
Photographic Association was represented by 30 cameras.

Professor Holden has published a full report of the Lick observatory
party and its codperators—the frontispiece being an admirable photo-
graph of the corona by Barnard, taken with a telescope of 34 inches
aperture stopped down to 1? inches. Professor’s Holden’s “conclusions”
in which he summarizes the observations are as follows:

J. That the characteristic coronal forms seem to vary periodically as
the sun spots (and auroras) vary in frequency, and that the coronas of
1867, 1878, and 1889 are of the same strongly marked type, which cor-
responds, therefore, to an epoch of minimum solar activity.

II. That so-called “polar” rays exist at all latitudes on the sun’s
surface, and are better seen at the poles of the sun, simply because
they are there projected against the dark background of the sky and
not against the equatorial extensions of the outer corona. There ap-
pears to be also a second kind of rays or beams that are connected with
the ring-like extensions. These are parts of the “ groups of synelinal
structure” of Mr. Ranyard.

Ill. The outer corona of 1889 terminated in branching forms. These
branching forms of the outer corona suggest the presence of streams of
meteorites near the sun, which, by their reflected light and by their
native brilliancy, due to the collisions of their individual members,
may account for the phenomena of the outer corona.

IV. The disposition of the extensions of the outer corona along and
very near the plane of the ecliptic might seem to show that, if the
Streams of meteorites above referred to really exist, they have long
been integral parts of the solar system.

V. The photographs of the corona which were taken just before con-
tact II and just after contact III prove the corona to be a solar append-
age,and are fatal to the theory that any large part of the coronal
forms are produced by diffraction. - - -

VI. The spectroscopic observations of Mr. Keeler show conclusively
that the length of a coronal line is not always an indication of the
depth of the gaseous coronal atmosphere of the sun at that point, and
hence to indicate the important conclusion that the true atmosphere of
the sun may be comparatively shallow.

VII. Mr. Keeler draws the further conclusion in his report - -  -
that the “ polar” rays are due to beams of light from brighter areas of
the sun illuminating the suspended particles of the sun’s gaseous envel-

Notr.—The conclusions ITI and IV appear to be contradictory to that expressed in
J. The electrical theory announced by Dr. Hygius in the Bakerian lecture for 1885
seems to reconcile the conclusions I, Ili, and LY,
158 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

opes. In order that the conclusion may stand it is necessary to show
that all these *‘ polar” beams are composed of rectilinear rays. - - -
An important conclusion from [the photographic and photometric]
measures seems to be that it is impracticable to photograph the corona
in full sunshine with our present plates, and that a photographic search
for Vulcan is hopeless.

The Smithsonian Institution has published a series of photographs
of the corona of this eclipse made by different observers and reduced
' for convenience to a uniform scale, and has also published a suggestive
paper by Pref. I’. H. Bigelow tracing a close agreement between mag-
netic lines of force computed for the sun and the curves of the polar
filaments shown upon the Pickering photograph.

Eclipse of the sun 1889, June 27.—An annular eclipse visible in the
southern part of Africa. Dr. Auwers and Dr. Gill obtained a number
_ of measures of the cusps with the Cape heliometer.

Helipse of the sun 1889, December 21-22.—Three principal points were
available as observing stations: the southwest corner of the island of
Trinidad totality lasting 1™ 46’; Cayenne on the coast of French
Guiana, totality 2 3°; and Cape Lado a point on the western coast of
Africa just south of St. Paul de Loanda, totality 3™ 12%. Two expedi-
tions went out to Africa, one sent by the United States Government
under Prof. D. P. Todd, and provided with most elaborate apparatus,
and the other from the Royal Astronomical Society of England under
the direction of Mr. A. Taylor. Cloudy weather prevented both of these
parties from securing observations. Another party from the Royal
Astronomical Society under Father Perry, at the Salut Islands, was par-
tially successful as far as observations go, but resulted most disastrously
in the death of Father Perry from dysentery within a few days after
the eclipse. M. dela Baume Pluavinel was also at the Salut Islands
and secured a number of photographs. The Lick observatory party at
Cayenne, Messrs. Burnham, Schaeberle and Rockwell, were successful ;
securing good photographs.

Eelipse of the sun 1890, June 17.—The annular eclipse of June 17,
1890, was central over portions of Northern Africa and Southern Asia,
and was visible as a partial eclipse over the whole of Europe. In the
southern part of Italy three-fourths of the sun’s disk was covered by
the moon. Observations partially successful were obtained by Profes-
sor Ricco at Palermo. At Canea, M. de la Baume Pluvinel secured
several photographs of the partial and annular phases, and also of the
spectrum of the annulus, the latter proving to be the same as the ordi-
nary solar spectrum.

Eclipse of the sun 1890, December 11.—A total eclipse of the sun
occurred on December 11, 1890, the ceutral line being confined to the
ocean south of Australia. In consequence of the earth’s globular
surface, the eclipse was annular at the beginning and end, and total
between 13" 55™.3 and 16" 20.5 Greenwich wean time, In portions of

BAe 5 Be tne he

A ee:
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. f5g

Australia, and in Tasmania, and in New Zealand, it was visible as a par-
tial eclipse. No observation of special interest was reported.

Mr. J. M. Schaeberle has published in the Monthly Notices a theory
of the solar corona, in which he concludes that the corona is due to
the light emitted and reflected by the filaments of matter thrown out
by the sun, the corresponding forces being variable and with a period
about the same as the sun-spot period. The rays of double curvature
are explained by the rotation of the sun, and the apparent changes in
the general form of the corona by the position of the observer with
reference to the plane of the sun’s equator.

The Smithsonian Institution published in 1889 a series of re-produc:
tions of a number of photographs of the eclipse of January 1, 1889, sent
from various stations on the Pacifie coast. The photographs are for
convenience of comparison reduced to a uniform scale of about 1 inch
diameter. [Explanatory notes and remarks suggested by astudy of the
photographs are added by Prof. David P. Todd.

Mr. H. H. Turner in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. 180, p. 385-
393) discusses the observations of the eclipse of August 29, 1886, made
at the island of Grenada.

SOLAR PARALLAX AND THE TRANSITS OF VENUS.

Transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769.—A thorough, and probably the
final, re-reduction of the observations of the transits of Venus in
1761 and 1769 has been made by Professor Newcomb in volume 2, part
5, of the astronomical papers of the American Ephemeris, a primary ob-
ject being the determination of the position of the node of Venus. The
value obtained for the solar parallax is 8.79 with a probable error of
+ 0/034.

Professor Harkness of the U. 8. Naval Observatory has devoted sev-
eral years of work to an elaborate discussion of the solar parallax and
its related constants. His principal results are elsewhere referred to,
the definitive value for the solar parallax being 8/’.80905 + 0.00567.

The French photographs of the transit of Venus give for the solar
parallax the value 8.80 + 0/06.

OBSERVATORIES.

Information in regard to the work going on at astronomical observa-
tories has been derived from the reports contained in the Vierteljahrs-
schrift, in the Monthly Notices, and in Loewy’s Observatoires astro-
nomiques de Provence, and also trom the separate reports published
by a few observatories. The compiler is indebted in some instances to
directors of observatories who have communicated to him directly data

in relation to the institutions under their charge. When it has seemed
necessary to make a distinction, the year has been added to the note.

ALLEGHENY: Langley.—Work upon radiant energy has been con-
tinued, and the time seryice has been maintained as in previous years,

equatorial of 0™.12 (4.7 inches) have been added to the equipment. Ob-
servations have been made upon a catalogue of 10,000 stars in the zone
— 18° to — 23°. It is expected that the photographic equatorial will
soon be installed. (1889.)

authorities have voted to spend about $11,000 on its installation near
the present observatory, and to appoint an observer, at $1,200 per
annum, to devote himself to research in stellar physics. It is under-
stood that the work with this instrument will be under the charge of
Mr. H. F. Newall.

Volume 22 of the publications has been issued and deals with the
observations from 1866 to 1869.

CAMDEN.—The amateur astronomical society at Camden, New Jer-
sey, has a small observatory, with 54-inch equatorial, transit instru-
ment, chronograph, clock, ete.

JAPE OF Goop Hope: Gill.—With the meridian circle regular ob-
servations have been made of the sun, Mercury, Venus, comparison
stars, stars oceulted by the moon, ete. The heliometer has been con-
stantly in use and much attention has been given to astronomical pho-
tography. Prof. J.C. Kapteyn has measured definitively 389 negatives
of the plates of the southern photographie Durchmusterung, covering
8.769 square degrees of the sky. This work represents 489,490 obser-
vations of about 193.000 stars, or about 63 per cent, of the whole work.

ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 161

Dr. Gill, the astronomer royal for the Cape, and Dr. Auwers, of Berlin,
by taking aiternate watches of observation (June 10 to August 26,
1889) secured an admirable series of observations of Victoria, which
was in an exceptionally favorable position for determining the solar
parallax. <A large part of Dr. Gill’s report for 1889 is devoted to the
geodetic work which is under his direction.

CARLETON COLLEGE: Payne.—The first volume of publications con-
sists of a catalogue of 644 comparison stars observed with the Repsold
meridian circle, by Dr. Wilson.

CATANIA: Riccd.—The observatory recently founded at Catania will
be chiefly devoted to astrophysics, photography, meteorology, and seis-
mology. It contains a Merz refractor of 0.35 (13.8 inches) aperture,
one by Cooke of 0™.15 (5.9 inches), and a photographie telescope, by
Steinheil, which will be used for photographing the zone +12° to +69,
(1890.)

CHAMBERLIN: H. A. Howe.—The disks for the 20-inch refractor are
being worked by Clark, and the mounting is well advanced at the shop of
Fauth & Co., Washington. The initial publication of the new observa-_
tory is a report upon observations of the eclipse of January 1, 1889,

DEARBORN: Hough.—An illustrated description of the new observa-
tory at Evanston will be found in the Sidereal Messenger for October,
1889.

DENVER.—In addition to the working observatory founded by Mr.
Chamberlin, an observatory for students is in course of erection. A
6-inch equatorial and a 3-inch transit have been ordered.

DENVER. (See, also, Chamberlin.)

DRESDEN: von Engelhardt.—Observations of nebulie star-clusters and
comets. Baron von Engelhardt has recently published a second part
of his ‘“‘ Observations Astronomiques,” containing principally measures
of double stars, star charts, nebulew, and comets. (1889).

Dunsink: Ball.—A new reflecting telescope of 15 inches aperture
has been presented to the observatory by Mr. Isaac Roberts for photo-
graphic researches on stellar parallax.

DUSSELDORF: Luther.—Observatious of small planets, and compu-
tation of their ephemerides. Since 1847, 1,474 observations of 172
asteroids have been made. (1889).

EDINBURGH: Copeland.—The site for a new observatory building two
minutes of are south of the present observatory was selected in 1889,
The plans have been completed and it is hoped that the work of con-
struction will soon be begun. It,is interesting to note that though the
new site is within 500 yards of the suburban railway, the porphyrite
rock of which the hill consists does not appear to transmit any percep-
tible vibration from the railway even when the heaviest trains are
passing. Dr. Becker has continued his determinations of the positions
of nebule and work in stellar and solar spectroscopy.

162 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

GEORGETOWN: Hagen.—Observations of variable stars have been
made systematically, and experiments in photographic observations of
star transits by Father Hagen and his assistant, Father Fargis.

GENEVA: Gautier.—Chiefly engaged in testing chronometers and
watches. Observations of the sun and of comets have been made with
the equatorial. Dr. Raoul Gautier has been appointed professor of
astronomy and director of the observatory, Col. K. Gautier retaining
the title of honorary director.

GLASGOW (England): Grant. Transit-cirele observations.

GOTTINGEN: Schur.—Heliometer used in measuring Presepe, Ple-
iades, and double stars. (1889.)

GREENWICH: Christie—In the report for 1889 it is noted that the
observations with the transit cirele by reflexion have been much facili-
tated and improved by using an amaigamated copper-bottom mercury
trough for the artificial horizon. Two photographic objectives have
been tried, one of 6 inches aperture to be used as a pilot for the 13-inch
star-charting telescope stars, and the other of 4 inches in connection
with the 28-inch refractor.

The annual visitation in 1890 took place on June 7. The collection
of historical instruments and the new photographie equatorial espe-
cially attracted the attention of some 300 visitors ‘present. It is pro-
posed to put up a large new building with four wings to reiieve the
overcrowded condition of the older buildings. It is expected that the
new £8-inch refractor will be installed at an early day. The 13-inch
photographic equatorial was received from Grubb on March 17, 1890,
and was mounted and made ready for use. The astronomer royal re-
ported that the work of the observatory had proceeded without essen-
tial modification.

“The observations for the longitude of Paris made in 1888 have now
been completely reduced and the definitive results found by the French
and English observers are respectively, 9" 21%.04 and 9™ 20%.84, In
view of this unsatisfactory discordance - - - it seems desirable
that the determination should be repeated with interchange of instru-
ments as well as of observers.”

The 1887 volume of Greenwich observations contains among its ap-
pendices the ten-year catalogue deduced from observations made from
1877 to 1886. The total number of stars is 4,059, the positions being
given for 1880. 0

HARVARD COLLEGE: Pickering.—Miss C. W. Bruce, of New York,
has wade a gift of $50,000 to the Harvard observatory to be applied to
- the construction and maintenance of a photographic telescope having
an objective of about 24 inches aperture and a focal length of 11 feet.
The figuring of the lens has been intrusted to Alvan Clark, who has
experienced some difficulty in securing proper glass. The Bache 8-inch
telescope of similar construction has been in constant use in Cambridge
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890, 163

for four years, and is now in Peru photographing the southern sky ;
with it stars too faint to be seen with the 15-inch refractor have been
photographed, and a corresponding advantage is anticipated from the
increase of the aperture to 24 inches.

Volume 17 of the Annals is now completed and consists of the follow-
ing papers, which have been separately printed and distributed during
the last few years: I. Magnitudes of stars employed in various nautical
almanacs; IL. Discussion of the Uranometria Oxoniensis; III. Photo-
metric observations of asteroids ; IV. Total eclipse of the moon, 1888,
January 28; V. Total eclipse of the sun, 1886, August 29; VI. Detection
of new nebule by photography; VII. A photographic determination of
the brightness of the stars; VIII. Index to observations of variable
stars; IX. Meridian-circle observations of close north polar stars; X.

planets, and stars of Lalande’s catalogue; the Gambey transit for ob-
servation of fundamental stars in groups of 24 to 48 hours; the
Gambey circle for experiments on flexure and the determination of
latitude; comets and nebule# have been observed with the west equa-
torial, and the equatorial coudé has been used in determining the con-
stants of refraction and aberration. The work for which the Paris ob-
servatory has been especially known of late years, astronomical pho-
tography, has been actively pursued by the Henrys. The frontispiece
of Admiral Mouchez’s report for 1889 is a representation of the great
equatorial coudé of 18 metres focal length and 0.6 metre (23.62 inches)
aperture. Attention has been given to photographing of stellar spectra
by placing prisms of 22° or 45° in front of the objective of the tele-
scope, and Admiral Mouchez has announced that spectroscopic obser-
vations will form a reguiar part of the observatory work in future.

PorspAmM: Vogel.—Astrophysical work, determination of the motion

tations. Time service. (1889.)

PULKOWA: Bredichin.—Prof. Otto Struve retired from the direet-
orship of the observatory, which he has held for over 25 years, and has
been succeeded by Dr. Bredichin, formerly director of the observatory
at Moscow. Three volumes were issued in 1889: Volume 8 containing
the catalogue of Bradley’s stars, a volume containing an investigation
by Lindemann of the photometric scale of the Bonn Durchmusterung,
and the third volume, the ‘ Jubilee” volume, with an historical account

ately after observing the total eclipse of the sun on December 21, 22,
1889, has been elsewhere referred to, has been succeeded in the direct-
orship of the observatory by Father Walter Sidgreaves. (1889.)

STRASSBURG: H. Becker.—Observations of comets and heliometer
measures of the sun’s diameter; also transit-circle observations of the
sun and major planets.

SYDNEY: Hussell.—Transit-circle observations, and with the 114-inch
equatorial observations of comets and of double stars. The photo-
graphic telescope for chart work has been mounted upon an elevated
site 620 feet above the seaand 11 miles inland from the present observ-
atory. Kach instrument has its own group of accumulators, conven-
iently charged by the help of a gas engine.

SMITHSONIAN ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY: Langley.— An astro-
physical observatory has been established as a department of the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington, occupying at present a tem-
166 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

porary building in the Smithsonian grounds, erected in 1889~90. The
principal instruments are a very large siderostat by Grubb, a large
spectro-bolometer, special galvanometer, and resistance box. Ke-
searches in telluric and astro-physies will be carried on.

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE: Miss S. J. Cunningham.—The observatory
building contains four rooms: A transit room, in which is a 3-inch
Warner and Swasey transit and mean-time clock ; a pier room at pres-
ent utilized as asidereal clock room; a work room containing the chro-
nograph, chronometer, and a small reference library ; and the dome, in
which is a 6-inch Warner and Swasey equatorial. Connected with the
observatory is the signal service station of the state weather service,
fully provided with the necessary meteorological and other apparatus.
(1890.)

TACUBAYA: Anguiano.—The construction of the new observatory
has progressed favorably, the photographic department being entirely
finished and the instruments mounted. The photographic equatorial is
by Grubb, of the pattern adopted by the astrophotographie congress in
1889 and furnished for most of the observatories taking part in the
international chart. Among the minor apparatus added to the equip-
ment of the observatory may be mentioned a complete portable photo-
graphic outfit ; a Merz polariscope for the 15-inch equatorial ; a Pritch-
ard’s wedge photometer by Hilger; a mercury artificial horizon by
Gauthier for the meridian circle; a complete meteorological outfit; a
petroleum motor and electric light installation.

In August, 1889, two additions were made to the observatory staff,
Messrs. Camilo A. Gonzalez and Guillermo Puga, who have been as-
signed to duty on the meridian circle. They have been engaged in
studying the instrumental constants and have undertaken the observa-
tion of certain stars to the tenth magnitude, conveniently situated for
reference stars for the zone of the photographic map assigned to the
Tacubaya observatory. Sr. Felipe Valle has been engaged with the
equatorial in observations of comets, asteroids, and nebule.

A series of daily observations of sun spots and facule has been made.
Photographs of the sun have been taken with the photoheliograph.
Two parties were sent out to observe the total solar eclipse of October
22, 1889, one to Yucatan and one to San Luis Potosi. (1890.)

TANANARIVO: Colin.—An observatory has been established on a
hill about 4,400 feet high a short distance to the east of Tananarivo on
the island of Madagascar. It has an equatorial, meridian instrument,
and photographic telescope for solar work. (1889.)

Toxyo: Terao.—A large number of observations of comet e, 1888,
made by Professor Teara and Mr. J. Midzuhara have been published as
the second fasciculus of volume 1 of the Annals. (1889.)

TouLousE: Baillaud.—The photographic telescope has been mounted.
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 167

UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY: McNair.—The reports of
the superintendents of the Naval Observatory show no material change
in the character of the work from the years immediately preceding.
On June 28, 1890, Capt. F. V. MeNair sueceeded Capt. R. L. Phythian
as Superintendent, Capt. MeNair’s report covering the fiscal year June
30,1890. The walls of the main building for the new observatory were
practically completed by the end of 189V ; also the great equatorial and
clock and observer’s rooms. The iron work for the three transit-circle
rooms is ready. The buildings will scarcely be ready for occupancy
before the sammer of 1892.

UpsALaA: Dunér.—From an extensive series of spectroscopic obser-
vations to determine the rotation period of the sun, it appears that the
period varies from 25.5 days to 38.6 days, increasing with the helio-
graphic latitude.

VIENNA (von Kuffner’s observatory) : Herz.—The latitude from obser-
vations with the Repsold meridian circle, 1889-90, is +48° 12! 46.67,

WASHINGTON (Catholic University of America): Searle—A small
observatory has been built at the Catholic University in the suburbs
of Washington (D. C.), and is under the direction of Rev. G. M. Searle.
The position is latitude + 38° 56/15”; longitude 55 8™ 08.0 west of
Greenwich. The telescope, which will be mounted in 1891 is 9 inches
aperture, 9 feet focus, giass and tube by Clacey, mounting by Saeg-
muller (Fauth & Co.). The cells and center piece of tube are made of
aluminum. <A small meridian circle, and photographic and spectro-
scopic apparatus will also be provided. <A 5-inch telescope is now in
use. (1890.)

WASHINGTON. (See, also, Georgetown; alsuv, Smithsonian astro-
physical observatory; also, U. 8S. Naval Observatory.)

WASHBURN: Comstock.—The sixth volume of publications contains
the meridian observations of 1887 and observations of double stars.

YALE: Newton.—The heliometer triangulation of the region near the
north pole has been completed, and some observations of Lris, Victoria
and Sappho have been obtained in codperation with the observatories
at the Cape of Good Hope and Leipsic, for the determination of the
solar parallax.

ZuRIcH: Wolf.—Physical observations of the sun.
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

In the fourth part of the Bulletin of the Astro-photographie con-
gress, Dr. H. C. Vogel describes the photographic refractor constructed
tor the observatory at Potsdam by the Repsolds. This instrument has
two objectives; eye-piece and plate-holder are in the same tube, con-
forming to the resolutions of the congress in 1887, but the peculiarity
is in the form of mounting, which is quite different from both the Eng-
168 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

lish and the French forms. The pillar that supports the polar axis is
not upright, but L-shaped, the lower part being inclined nearly in the
plane of the equator, the upper almost at right angles to this, extend-
ing toward the north pole and inclosing the polar axis. The support
possesses very great stability, and its form permits an uninterrupted
motion of the telescope in al! positions.

In Engineering for December 19, 1890, will be found a description of
the Melbourne photographic telescope made by Sir Howard Grubb.

An instrument for comparing and measuring celestial photographs,
somewhat similar to that designed by Mr. Roberts, has been devised by
Mr. Common.

An apparatus for eliminating personal equation in the observation of
sudden phenomena, such as the disappearance of a star when occulted
by the moon has been devised by Mr. 8. P. Langley, and is described
in the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington, vol. Xt.
The principle of the method consists in associating a motion, real or
apparent, of the object, with intervals of time so that the apparent posi-
tion of the object at the instant of the occurrence of any phenomenon
being noted the time of the occurrence will be known. Experiments
made with artificial stars show that it is quite possible for a compar-
atively inexperienced person to observe an occultation with a probable
error of only one-fortieth of a second.

The great Lick refractor of 36 inches diameter is to be surpassed by
one still larger, ordered for the University of Southern California, at
Los Angeles. This lens is to be 40 inches in diameter, and the crown
glass disk for the achromatic combination is now in the hands of the
Clarks, who pronounce it a remarkably fine piece of glass.

It may perhaps be mentioned here that a bill was introduced in the
United States Congress making an appropriation of $1,000,000 for a
refractor of 5‘feet aperture for the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the
plan never received support from the Government astronomers.

Mr. Brashear has under way at his shop in Allegheny a 16-inch
objective for Carleton College Observatory, one of 12 inches for Brown
University, and a second of 12 inches for Mr. G. E. Hale, of Chicago.
He is also making a large spectroscope and spectrograph for Professor
Young, at Princeton, which is expected to be the finest in the United
States; a very complete spectroscope with Jena glass objectives and
prism is being made for Carleton College, and a new star spectroscope
tor Lick Observatory. For the Willard photographic telescope of the
Lick Observatory, he is making an equatorial mounting with controlled
clock.

MISCELLANEOUS,
Personal equation.—The attention of astronomers interested in the

subject of personal equation should be directed to a paper prepared
by a physiologist, Dr. E. C. Sanford, of the Johns Hopkins University,
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 169

and published in volume 2 of the American Journal of Psychology. An
important contribution to the astronomical side of the subject is an
investigation by Dr. Wislicenus, of the Strasburg Observatory, who has
investigated the personal equation in transit observations, not only for
a horizontal position of the telescope, but for all inclinations. By plac-
ing a small convex lens behind the ocular an artificial star is obtained
which is easily moved in the plane of the reticule with a velocity corre-
sponding to any declination. Dr. Wislicenus concludes from his experi-
ments that the inclination of the telescope has a considerable effect
upon the observer’s personal equation.

One of the essays contributed to the celebration of the Pulkowa
Jubilee was a discussion of absolute personal equation by H. G. van de
Sande Bakhuyzen. The artificial star observed was the meridian mark
of the transit circle, to which an apparent motion was given by inter-
posing a prism fixed excentrically to a circular rotating plate. Very
satisfactory results were obtained. The personality depending upon
direction of apparent motion seemed to be generally small for seven
observers who tried the apparatus.

ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETIES.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific—Under the leadership of Pro-
fessor Holden and the astronomers at the Lick Observatory the Astro-
nomical Society of the Pacific was founded February 7, 1889, as a result
of the cordial codperation of amateur and professional astronomers in
successfully observing the total solar eclipse of the preceding New
Year’s day. Any person interested in astronomy is invited to join its
membership. Three meetings each year are held in San Francisco and
three meetings at Mount Hamilton. An excellent series of publi-
cations, in octavo form, issued at irregular intervals, has reached the
second volume. These ‘* publications ” contain papers read before the
society, and also notices from the Lick Observatory prepared by members
of the observatory staff. A fund has been established known as the
“Donohoe fund for the maintenance of the comet medal of the Astronom-
ical Society of the Pacific,” the principal conditions of the gift, a medal of
bronze, being the discovery of a new comet or the first precise deter-
mination of position of a periodic comet at any one of its expected
returns. The discoverer is to make his discovery known in the usual
way, and also to communicate it immediately to the director of the Lick
Observatory. No application for the bestowal of the medal is required.

The British Astronomical Association.—A new astronomical society,
to be called the British Astronomical Association, has been formed in
England to meet the wishes and needs of those who find the subscrip-
tion of the Royal Astronomical Society too high, or its papers too ad-
vanced, or who are, as in the case of ladies, practically excluded from
becoming fellows; it is also to afford a means of direction and or-
ganization in ‘the work of observation to amateur astronomers. The
170 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

new society is thus to be regarded as supplementary to the older one,
and not its rival. The first general meeting was held on October 24,
1890, in the hall of the Society of Arts, Adelphi, London, and the offi-
cers nominated by a provisional committe» were elected, Capt. W.
Noble being made president. The sections under which the work of ob-
servation is organized are: Meteoric, solar, lunar, spectroscepic, and
photographic, colored stars, variable stars, double stars, and Jupiter,
each section being presided over by an amateur astronomer who has
devoted special attention to the subject named. The first number of
the Journal appeared in October, 1890, under the able editorship of
Mr. E. W. Maunder.

Gesellschaft Urania.—The building forming the headquarters of the
Gesellschaft Urania was completed in July, 1889, and is described at
some length by Dr. M. W. Meyer in the February and March numbers
of Himmel und Erde. The Gesellschaft is for the purpose of popular-
izing science. The chief astronomical instrument is a 12-inch refractor
by Bamberg, the glass for which was made by Schott & Co., of Jena.
There are also a 6-inch and a 4-inch refractor, a 6-inch reflector, a 24-
inch transit, and a 5-inch comet-seeker. These instruments are for the
use of visitors, and for cloudy nights a collection of 700 lantern slides is
provided.

The thirteenth meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft was held at
Brussels, Septembr 10 to 12, 1889. The next meeting is at Munich in
1891.

Astronomical prizes.—The Lalande prize of the French Academy of
Sciences was awarded for 1889 to M. Gonnessiat of the Lyons observa-
tory, the Valz prize to Charlois, and the Janssen prize to Lockyer.

In 1890 the Lalande prize was awarded to Schiaparelli for his obser-
vations determining the rotation of Mercury and Venus, the Valz prize
to Glasenapp for his determination of the orbits of double stars, and
the Janssen prize to Young. The Damoiseau prize, for which but one
memoir was presented, was continued for another year with the same
subject: To perfect the theory of the inequalities of long period caused
by the planets in the motion of the moon.

The Copley medal of the Royal Society was awarded on November
20, 1890, to Professor Simon Newcomb for his contributions to gravita-
tional astronomy.

The first award of the Donohoe medal was made to Mr. W. R. Brooks
for the discovery of a comet on March 19, 1890; the second to Mr. W.
F. Denning for his comet of July 23, 1890, and the third to Monsieur
Jéréme Coggia, astronomer of the observatory of Marseilles, for his
discovery of a comet on Juiy 18, 1890, this being the eighth comet
discovered by M. Coggia.

A generous gift has been made in aid of astronomical research by Miss
C. W. Bruce, of New York, who placed in the hands of Professor Picker-
ing, director of the Harvard Observatory, $6,000. In answer toa circular
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. hel

issued by Professor Pickering, numerous requests were received fcr aid
from this fund, and various sums were awarded by Professor Pickering
so as to aid as wide a range of astronomical subjects as possible, and to
aid investigators in all parts of the world.

Among new works of general interest to astronomers may be men-
tioned Miss Clerke’s “The System of the Stars;” a new edition of
Chambers’ Astronomy in three volumes. ‘The first two volumes of an
able ‘ Traité de mécanique céleste,” the first containing the general
theory of perturbations, and the second on the figures of rotation of
celestial bodies ; these are to be followed by a third volume on the lunar
theory, theory of Jupiter’s satellites, Hansen’s method for the calcu-
lation of perturbations, and other methods of recent date. Another
work which has been found useful as a text-book is Dziobek’s Die
mathematischen Theorten der Planeton—Bewegungen.

Dr. Scheiner has published a treatise on spectrum analysis which is
intended to form the first volume of complete work on astrophysics.

The first volume of the national edition of the works of Galileo has
appeared under the patronage of the King of Italy.

Dr. Dreyer has published a biography of Tycho Brahe upon which
he has been at work for several years past.

A very interesting paper on Bowditch, who translated Laplace’s
““ Mécanique Céleste,” has been contributed by Prof. Joseph Lovering
to the Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences.

An index to the literature of spectroscopy, compiled by Mr. Alfred
Tuckerman, has been published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Col-
lections. It contains a bibliography of the history of the subjects ; of
books; of apparatus; of spectrum analysis in general; of qualitative
analysis; of quantitative analysis; of absorption spectra; of alkalies
and alkaloids; of astronomical spectroscopy ; of carbon compounds, and
of the spectra of metals; there is also alist of 799 authors. The numn-
ber of titles is 3,829.

Another useful contribution to astronomical bibliography is the cata-
Jogue of the Crawford Library at the Royal Observatory at Edinburgh,
presented to the observatory by the Karl of Crawford, and formerly
constituting the library of the Dun Echt Observatory. The catalogue
was compiled by the present astronomer royal for Scotland, Mr. Cope-
land, and contains a number of rare works.

Reference should also be made to a new edition of M. Lancaster’s use-
ful little Liste générale des observatoires, appearing in 1890 with many
additions and corrections.

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1889.

A brief bibliography of astronomy for the year 1890 having been con-
tributed to the Sidereal Messenger for 1891, it seems unnecessary to
cover more than the year 1889 in the present review. The titles given
below include the most important books and journal articles of 1889, that

THE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES OF THE EARTH.*

The name of this section, which by your courtesy it is my duty to ad-
dress to-day, implies a community of interest amongst astronomers and
mathematicians. This community of interest is not difficult to explain.
We can of course imagine a considerable body of astronomical facts
quite independent of mathematics. We can also imagine a much larger
body of mathematical facts quite independent of and isolated from
astronomy. But we never think of astronomy in the large sense with-
out recognizing its dependence on mathematics, and we never think of
mathematics as a whole without considering its capital applications in
astronomy.

Of all the subjects and objects of common interest to us, the Earth will
easily rank first. The earth furnishes us with a stable foundation for
instrumental work and a fixed line of reference, whereby it is possible
to make out the orderly arrangement and procession of our solar system
and to gain some inkling of other systems which lie within telescopic
range. The earth furnishes us with a most attractive store of real prob-
‘lems; its shape, its size, its mass, its precession and nutation, its internal
heat, its earthquakes, and volcanoes, and its origin and destiny, are to
be classed with the leading questions for astronomical and mathematical
research. We must of course recognize the claims of our friends the
geologists to that indefinable something called the earth’s crust, but con-
sidered in its entirety and in its relations to similar bodies of the uni-
verse, the Earth has long been the special province of astronomers and
mathematicians. Since thetimes of Galileo and Kepler and Copernicus
it has supplied a perennial stimulus to observation and investigation,
and it promises to tax the resources of the ablest observers and anal-
ysts for some centuries to come. The mere mention of the names of
Newton, Bradley, d’Alembert, Laplace, Fourier, Gauss, and Bessel, calls
to mind not only a long list of inventions and discoveries, but the most

important parts of mathematical literature. In its dynamical and phys-
ical aspects the Earth was to them the principal object of research, and
the thoroughness and completeness of their contributions toward an ex-
planation of the “ system of the world ” are still a source of wonder and
admiration to all who take the trouble to examine their works.

A detailed discussion of the known properties of the earth, and of
the hypotheses concerning the unknown properties, is no fit task for a
summer afternoon; the intricacies and delicacies of the subject are suit-
able only for another season and a special audience. But it has seemed
that a somewhat popular review of the state of our mathematical knowl-
edge of the Earth might not be without interest to those already famil-
iar with the complex details, and might also help to increase that gen-
eral interest in science, the promotion of which is one of the most
important functions of this association.

As we look back through the light of modern analysis, it seems
strange that the successors of Newton, who took up the problem of the
shape of the Karth, should have divided into hostile camps over the
question whether our planet is elongated or flattened atthe poles. They
agreed in the opinion that the Earth is a spheroid, but they debated,
investigated, and observed for nearly half a century before deciding
that the spheroid is oblate rather than oblong. This was a critical
question, and its decision marks perhaps the most important epoch in
the history of the figure of the Earth. The Newtonian view of the oblate
form found its ablest supporters in Huygens, Maupertuis, and Clair-
aut, while the erroneous view was maintained with great vigor by the
justly distinguished Cassinian school of astronomers. Unfortunately
for the Cassinians, defective measures of a meridional are in France
gave color to the false theory and furnished one of the most con-
spicuous instances of the deterring effect of an incorrect observa-
tion. As you well know, the point was definitely settled by Mauper-
tuis’s measurement of the Lapland are. For this achievement his name
has become famous in literature as well as in science, for his friend
Voltaire congratulated him on having “ flattened the poles and the
Cassinis ;” and Carlyle has honored him with the title of ‘ Karth-flat-
tener; *

Since the settlement of the question of the form—progress toward
a knowledge of the size of the Earth has been consistent and steady,
until now it may be said that there are few objects with which we have
to deal whose dimensions are so well known as the dimensions of the
Earth. But this is a popular statement, and like most such, needs to
be explained in order not to be misunderstood. Both the size and
shape of the Marth are defined by the lengths of its equatorial and polar
axes; and, knowing the fact of the oblate spheroidal form, the lengths
of ‘he axes may be found within narrow limits from simple measure-

ments conducted on the surface quite indenvendently of any knowledge
of the interior constitution of the earth. It is evident in facet, without
recourse to mathematical details, that the length of any are, as a degree
of latitude or longitude on the earth’s surface, must depend on the
lengths of those axes. Conversely, it is plain that the measurement of
such an are and the determination of its geographical position consti-
tute an indirect measurement of the axes. Hence it has happened
that scientific as distinguished from practical geodesy has been con-
cerned chiefly with such linear and astronomical measurements, and
the zeal with which the work has been pursued is attested by triangu-
lations on every continent. Passing over the earlier determinations as
of historical interest only, all of the really trustworthy approximations
to the lengths of the axes have been made within the half century just
passed. The first to appear of these approximations were the well-
founded values of Airy,* published in 1530. These, however, were
almost wholly overshadowed and supplanted eleven years later by the
values of Bessel,t whose spheroid came to occupy a most conspicuous
place in geodesy for more than a quarter of a century. Knowing as
we now do that Bessel’s values were considerably in error, it seems not
a little remarkable that they should have been so long accepted with-
out serious question. One obvious reason is found in the fact that a
considerable lapse of time was essential for the accumulation of new
data, but two other possible reasons of a different character are
worthy of notice because they are interesting and instructive, whether
specially applicable to this particular case or not. It seems not im-
probable that the close agreement of the values of Airy and Bessel,
computed independently and by different methods—the greatest dis-
‘erepanecy being about 150 feet—may have been ineautiously inter-
preted as a confirmation of Bessel’s dimensions, and hence led to their
too ready adoption. It seems also not improbable that the weight of
Bessel’s great name may have been too closely associated in the minds
of his followers with the weights of his observations and results. The
sanction of eminent authority, especially if there is added to it the
stamp of an official seal, is sometimes a serious obstacle to real prog.
ress. We can. not do less than accord to Bessel the first place amongst
the astronomers and geodesists of his day, but this is no adequate jus-
tification for the exaggerated estimate jong entertained of the precision
of the elements of his spheroid.

The next step in the approximation was the important one of Clarket
in 1866. His new values showed an increase over Bessel’s of about
half a mile in the equatorial semi-axis and about three-tenths of a mile

jn the polar semi-axis. Since 1866, General Clarke has kept pace with
the accumulating data and given us so many different elements for our
spheroid that it is necessary to affix a date to any of his values we may
use. The later values, however, differ but slightly from the earlier
ones, so that the spheroid of 1866, which has come to be pretty gener-
ally adopted, seems likely to enjoy a justly greater celebrity than that
of its immediate predecessor. The probable error of the axes of this
spheroid is not much greater than the hundred thousandth part,* and
it is not likely that new data will change their lengths by more than a
few hundred feet.

In the present state of science, therefore, it may be said that the first
order of approximation to the form and dimensions of the Earth has
been successfully attained. The question which follows naturally and
immediately is, how much further can the approximation be carried ?
The answer to this question is not yet written, and the indications are
not favorable for its speedy announcement. The first approximation,
as we have seen, requires no knowledge of the interior density and ar-
rangement of the earth’s mass; it proceeds on the simple assumption
that the sea surface is closely spheroidal. The second approximation,
if it be more than a mere interpolation formula, requires a knowiedge
of both the density and arrangement of the constituents of the earth’s
mass, and especially of that part called the crust. ‘ All astronomy,”
says Laplace, ‘rests on the stability of the earth’s axis of rotation.” t
In a similar sense we may say all geodesy rests on the direction of the
plumb line. The simple hypothesis of a spheroidal form assumes
that the plumb line is everywhere coincident with the normal to the
spheroid, or that the surface of the spheroid coincides with the level
of the sea, But this is not quite correct. The plumb line is not in
general coincident with the normal, and the actual sea level or geoid
must be imagined to be an irregular surface lying partly above and
partly below the ideal spheroidal surface. The deviations, it is true,
are relatively small, but they are in general much greater than the
unavoidable errors of observation and they are the exact numerical
expression of our ignorance in this branch of geodesy. It is well
known, of course, that deflections of the plumb line can sometimes be
accounted for by visible masses, but on the whole it must be admitted
that we possess only the vaguest notions of their cause and a spe in-
adequate knowledge of their distribution and extent.

What is true of plumb-line deflections is about equally true of the de-
viations of the intensity of gravity from what may be called the sphe-
roidial type. Given a closely spheroidal form of the sea level and it
follows from the law of gravitation, as a first approximations. without

any knowledge of the distribution of the earth’s mass, that the increase
of gravity varies as the square of the sine of the latitude in passing
from the equator to the poles. This is the remarkable theorem of
Stokes,* and it enables us to determine the form or ellipticity of the
Karth by means of pendulum observations alone. It must be admitted,
however, that the values of the ellipticity recently obtained in this way
by the highest authorities, Clarket and Helmert,t are far from satis-
factory, whether we regard them in the light of their discrepaney or
in the light of the different methods of computing them. In general
terms we may say that the difficulty in the way of the use of pendulum
observations still hinges on the treatment of local anomalies and on tiie
question of reduction to sea level. At present, the case is one concern-
ing which the doctors agree neither in their diagnosis nor in their
remedies.

Turning attention now from the surface towards the interior, what
can be said of the earth’s mass as a whole, of its laws of distribution,
and of the pressures that exist at great depths? Two facts, namely,
the mean density and the surface density, are roughly known; a third
fact, namely, the precession constant, or the ratio of the difference of
the two principal moments of inertia to the greater of them, is known
with something like precision. These facts lie within the domain of
observation and require only the law of gravitation for their verification.
Certain inferences, also, from these facts and others, have long been and
still are held to be hardly less cogent and trustworthy, but before stat-
ing them it will be well to recall briefly the progress of opinion con-
cerning this general subject during the past century and a half.

The conception of the earth as having been primitively fluid was the
prevailing one among mathematicians before Clairaut published his
Théorie de la Figure de la Terre in 1743. By the aid of this conception
Clairaut proved the celebrated theorem which bears his name, and
probably no idea in the mechanies of the earth has been more suggest-
ive and fruitful. It was the central idea in the elaborate investigations
of Laplace and received at his hands a development which his succes-
sors have found it about equally difficult to displace or to improve
From the idea of fluidity spring naturally the hydrostatical notions of
pressure and level surfaces, or the arrangement of fluid masses in strata
of uniform density. Hence follows, also, the notion of continuity of in-
crease in density from the surface toward the center of the Earth. All
of the principal mechanical properties and effects of the earth’s mass,
viz, the ellipticity, the surface density, the mean density, the preces-
sion constant, and the lunar inequalities, were correlated by Laplace §

in a single hypothesis, involving only one assumption in addition to
that of original fluidity and the law of gravitation. This assumption
relates to the compressibility of matter and asserts that the ratio of the
increment of pressure to the increment of density is proportional to the
density. Many interesting and striking conclusions follow readily from
this hypothesis, but the most interesting and important are those rela-
tive to density and pressure, especially the latter, whose dominance as
a factor in the mechanics of celestial masses seems destined to survive
whether the hypothesis stands or falls. The hypothesis requires that,
while the density increases slowly from something less than 3 at the
surface to about 11 at the center of the Earth, the pressure within the
mass increases rapidly below the surface, reaching a value surpassing
the crushing strength of steel at the depth of a few miles and amount-
ing at the center to no less than 3,000,000 atmospheres. The infer-
ences, then, as distinguished from facts, are that the mass of the Earth
is very nearly symmetrically disposed about its center of gravity, that
pressure and density except near the surface are mutually dependent,
and that the earth in reaching this stage has passed through the fluid
or quasi-fluid state.

Later writers have suggested other hypotheses for a continuous dis-
tribution of the earth’s mass, but none of them can be said to rival the
hypothesis of Laplace. Their defects lie either in not postulating a di-
rect connection between density and pressure or in postulating a con-
nection which implies extreme or impossible values for these and other
mechanical properties of the mass.

It is clear, from the positiveness of his language in frequent allusions
to this conception of the earth, that Laplace was deeply impressed with
its essential correctness. ‘ Observations,” he says, ‘‘ prove incontesta-
bly that the densities of the strata (couches) of the terrestrial spheroid
increase from the surface to the center,” * and “the regularity with
which the observed variation in length of a second’s pendulum follows
the law of squares of the sines of the latitudes proves that the strata
are arranged symmetrically about the center of gravity of the earth.” f
The more recent investigations of Stokes, to which allusion has already
been made, forbid our entertaining anything like so confident an opin-
ion of the earth’s primitive fluidity or of a symmetrical and continuous
arrangement of its strata. But, though it must be said that the suffi-
ciency of Laplace’s arguments has been seriously impugned, we can
hardly think the probability of the correctness of his conclusions has
been proportionately diminished.

Suppose, however, that we reject the idea of original fluidity,
Would not a rotating mass of the size of the earth assume finally the
same aspects and properties presented by our planet? Would not
pressure and centrifugal force suffice to bring about a central condensa-
tion and a symmetrical arrangement of strata similar at least to that
required by the Laplacian hypothesis ? Categorical answers to these
questions can not be given at present. But, whatever may have been
the antecedent condition of the earth’s mass, the conclusion seems una.
voidable that at no great depth the pressure is sufficient to break down
the structural characteristics of all known substances, and hence to
produce viscous flow whenever and wherever the stress difference ex-
ceeds a certain limit, which can not be large in comparison with the
pressure. Purely observational evidence, also, of a highly affirmative
kind in support of this conciusion, is afforded by the remarkable results
of Tresca’s experiments on the flow of solids and by the abundant proofs
in geology of the plastic movements and viscous flow of rocks. With
such views and facts in mind the fluid stage, considered indispensable
by Laplace, does not appear necessary to the evolution of a planet, even
ifit reach the extreme refinement of a close fulfillment of some such
mathematical law as that of his hypothesis. If, as is here assumed,
pressure be the dominant factor in such large masses, the attainment
of a stable distribution would be simply a question of time. The fluid
mass might take on its normal form in a few days or a few months,
whereas the viscous mass might require a few thousand or a few million
years.

Some physicists and mathematicians, on the other hand, reject both
the idea of existence of great pressures within the eartl’s mass, and
the notion of an approach to continuity in the distribution of density.
As representing this side of the question the views of the late M. Roche,
who wrote much on the constitution of the earth, are worthy of consid-
eration. He tells us that the very magnitude of the central pressure
computed on the hypothesis of fluidity is itself a peremptory objection
to that hypothesis.* According to his conception, the strata of the
earth from the center outwards are substantially self-supporting and
unyielding. It does not appear, however, that he had submitted this
conception to the test of numbers, for a simple calculation will show
that no materials of which we have any knowledge would sustain the
stress in such shells or domes. If the crust of the earth were self-sup-
porting, its crushing strength would have to be about thirty times that
of the best cast steel, or five hundred to one thousand times that of
granite. The views of Roche on the distribution of the terrestrial
densities appear equally extreme.t He prefers to consider the mass as

made up of two distinct parts, an outer shell or crust whose thickness
is about one-sixth of the earth’s radius, and a solid nucleus having little
or no central condensation. The nucleus is conceived to be purely
metallic, and to have about the same density as iron. To account for
-geological phenomena, he postulates a zone of fusion separating the
crust from the nucleus. The whole hypothesis is consistently worked
out in conformity with the requirements of the ellipticity, the superficial
density, the mean density, and precession; so that to one who cai
divest his mind of the notion that pressure and continuity are impor-
tant factors in the mechanics of such masses, the picture which Roche
draws of the constitution of our planet will present nothing incongru-
ous.

In a field so little explored and so inaccessible, though hedged about
as we have seen by certain sharply limiting conditions, there is room
for a wide range of opinion and for great freedom in the play of hypoth-
esis; and although the preponderance of evidence appears to be in favor
of a terrestrial massin which the reign of pressure is well-nigh absolute,
we should not be surprised a few decades or centuries hence to find
many of our notions on this subject radically defective.

If the problem of the constitution and distribution of the earth’s mass
is yet an obscure and difficult one after two centuries of observation
and investigation, can we report any greater degree of success in the
treatment of that still older problem of the earth’s internal heat; of its
origin and effects? Concerning phenomena always so impressive and
often so terribly destructive as those intimately connected with the
terrestrial store of heat, it is natural that there should be a considera-
ble variety of opinion. The consensus of such opinion, however, has
long been in favor of the hypothesis that heat is the active cause of
many and a potent factor in most of the grander phenomena which geol-
ogists assign to the earth’s crust; and the prevailing interpretation
of these phenomena is based on the assumption that our planet is a
cooling sphere whose outer shell or crust is constantly cracked and
crumpled in adjusting itself to the shrinking nucleus.

The conception that the earth was originally an intensely heated and
molten mass appears to have first taken something like definite form
in the minds of Leibnitz and Descartes.* But neither of these philos-
ophers was armed with the necessary mathematical equipment to sub-
ject this conception to the test of numerical calculation. Indeed, it was,
not fashionable in their day, any more than it is with some philosophers,
in ours, to undertake the drudgery of applying the machinery of analy-.
sis to the details of an hypothesis. Nearly a century elapsed before an.
order of intellects capable of dealing with this class of questions ap-
peared. it was reserved for Joseph Fourier to Jay the foundation and

build a great part of the super-structure of our modern theory of heat
diffusion, his avowed desire being to solve the great problem of terres-
trial heat. ‘The question of terrestrial temperatures,” he says, ‘has
always appeared to us one of the grandest objects of cosmological
studies, and we have had it principally in view in establishing the
mathematical theory of heat.”* This ambition however was only
partly realized. Probably Fourier under-estimated the diteulties of
his problem, for his most ingenious and industrious successors in the
same field have made little progress beyond the limits he attained.
But the work he left is a perennial index to his genius. Though quite
inadequately appreciated by his contemporaries, the Analytical Theory
of Heat, which appeared in 1820, is now conceded to be one of the epoch-
making books. Indeed, to one who has caught the spirit of the extraor-
dinary analysis which Fourier developed and illustrated by numerous
applications in this treatise, it is evident that he opened a field whose
resources are Still far from being exhausted. A little later Poisson took
up the same class of questions and published another great work on the
mathematical theory of heat.t Poisson narrowly missed being the fore-
most mathematician of his day. In originality, in wealth of mathe-
matical resources, and in breadth of grasp of physical principles he was
the peer of the ablest of his contemporaries. In lucidity of exposition
it would be enough to say that he was a Frenchman, but he seems to
have excelled in this peculiarly national trait. His contributions to the
theory of heat have been somewhat overshadowed in recent times by
the earlier and perhaps more brilliant researches of Fourier, but no
student can afford to take up that enticing, though difficult, theory with-
out the aid of Poisson as well as Fourier.

It is natural, therefore, that we should inquire what opinions these
great masters in the mathematics of heat diffusion held concerning the
earth’s store of heat. I say opinions, for, unhappily, this whole subject
is still so largely a matter of opinion that, in discussing it, one may not
inappropriately adopt the famous caution of Marcus Aurelius, ‘“ Re-
member that all is opinion.” It does not appear that Fourier reached
any definite conclusion on this question, though he seems to have favored
the view that the Earth in cooling from an earlier state of incandescence
reached finally through convection a condition in which there was a
uniform distribution of heat throughout its mass. This is the consisten-
tior status of Leibnitz, and it begins with the formation of the earth’s
crust, if not with the consolidation of the entire mass. It thus affords
an initial distribution of heat and an epoch from which analysis may
start, and the problem for the mathematician is to assign the subse-

quent distribution of heat and the resulting mechanical effects. But no
great amount of reflection is necessary to convince one that the analysis
can not proceed without making a few more assumpticns. The assump-
tions which involve the least difficulty, and which for this reason, partly,
have met with most favor, are that the conductivity and thermal capacity
of the entire mass remain constant, and that the heat conducted to the
surface of the earth passes off by the combined process of radiation,
convection, and conduction, without producing any sensible effect on
surrounding space. These or similar assumptions must be made before
the application of theory can begin. In addition, two data are essen-
tial to numerical calculations, namely, the diffusivity, or ratio of the
conductivity of the mass to its thermal capacity, and the initial uniform
temperature. The first of these can be observed, approximately, at
least; the second can only be estimated at present. With respect to
these important points which must be considered after the adoption of
the consistentior status, the writings of Fourier afford little light. He
was content perhaps to invent and develop the exquisite analysis requi-
site to the treatment of such problems.

Poisson wrote much on the whole subject of terrestrial temperatures
and carefully considered most of the troublesome details which lay be-
tween his theory and its application. While he admitted the nebular
hypothesis and an initial fluid state of the Earth, he rejected the notion
that the observed increase of underground temperature is due toa prim-
itive store of heat. If the Earth was originally fluid by reason of its
heat, a supposition which Poisson regarded quite gratuitous, he con-
ceived that it must cooi and consolidate from the center outwards ; * so
that according to this view the crust of our planet arrived at a condi-
tion of stability only after the supply of heat had been exhausted. But
Poisson was not at a loss to account for the observed temperature gra-
dient in the earth’s crust. Always fertile in hypotheses, he advanced
the idea that there exists by reason of interstellar radiations, great
variations in the temperature of space, some vast regions being com-
paratively cool and others intensely hot, and that the present store of
terrestrial heat was acquired by a journey of the solar system through
one of the hotter regions. ‘Such is,” he says, ‘‘in my opinion, the true
cause of the augmentation of temperature which occurs as we descend
below the surface of the globe.”+ This hypotheisis was the result of |
Poisson’s mature reflection, and as such is well worthy of attention.
The notion that there exist hot foci in space was advanced also in an-
other form in 1852 by Rankine, in his interesting speculation on the
re-concentration of energy. But whatever we may think of the hypoth-
esis aS a whole it dces not appear to be adequate to the case of the

Earth unless we suppose the epoch of transit through the hot region
exceedingly remote and the temperature of that region exceedingly
high. The continuity of geological and paleontological phenomena is
much better satisfied by the Leibnitzian view of an earth long subject
to comparatively constant surface conditions but still active with the
energy of its primitive heat.

Notwithstanding the indefatigable and admirable labors of Fourier
and Poisson in this field, it must be admitted that they accomplished
little more than the preparation of the machinery with which their sue-
cessors have sought and are still seeking to reap the harvest. The dif-
ficulties which lay in their way were not mathematical but physical.
Had they been able to make out the true conditions of the earth’s store
of heat, they would undoubtedly have reached a high grade of perfec-
tion in the treatment of the problem. The theory as they left it was
much in advance of observation, and the labors of their successors have
therefore necessarily been directed largely towards the determination
of the thermal properties of the earth’s crust and mass.

Of those who in the present generation have contributed to our
knowledge and stimulated the investigation of this subject, it is hardly
necessary to say that we owe most to Sir William Thomson. He has made
the question of terrestrial temperatures highly attractive and instructive
to astronomers and mathematicians, and not less warmly interesting to
geologists and paleontologists. Whether we are prepared to accept his
conclusions or not, we must all acknowledge our indebtedness to the
contributions of his master hand in this field as well as in most other
fields of terrestrial physics. The contribution of special interest to us
in this connection is his remarkable memoir on the secular cooling of
the Earth.* In this memoir he adopts the simple hypothesis of a solid
sphere whose thermal properties remain invariable while it cools by con-
duction from an initial state of uniform temperature, and draws there-
from certain striking limitations on geologic time. Many geologists
were startled by these limitations, and geologic thought aud opinion
have since been widely influenced by them. It will be of interest there-
fore to state a little more fully and clearly the grounds from which his
arguments proceed. Conceive a sphere having a uniform temperature
initially, to cool in a medium which instantly dissipates all heat brought
by conduction to its surface, thus keeping the surface at a constant
temperature. Suppose we have given the initial excess of the sphere’s
temperature over that of the medium. Suppose also that the capacity
of the mass of the sphere for the diffusion of heat is known, and known
to remain invariable during the process of cooling. This capacity is
called diffusivity, and is a constant which can be observed. Then from
these data the distribution of temperature at any future time can be
assigned, and hence also the rate of temperature increase, or the tem-

perature gradient, from the surface towards the center of the sphere
can be computed. It is tolerably certain that the heat conducted from
the interior to the surface of the Earth does not set up any re-action
which in any sensible degree retards the process of cooling. It escapes
so freely that, for practical purposes, we may say it is instantly dis-
sipated. Hence, if we can assume that the Earth had a specified uni-
form temperature at the initial epoch, and can assume its diffusivity to
remain constant, the whole history of cooling is known so soon as we
determine the diffusivity and the temperature gradient at any point.
Now, Sir William Thomson determined a value for the diffusivity from
measurements of the seasonal variations of under-ground temperatures,
and numerous observations of the increase of temperature with depth
below the earth’s surface gave an average value for the temperature
gradient. From these elements, and from an assumed initial tempera-
ture of 7000° Fahr., he infers that geologic time is limited to something
between twenty million and four hundred million years. He says:
‘¢We mustallow very wide limits in such an estimate as I have attempted
to make; but I think we may with much probability say that the con-
solidation can not have taken place less than 20 million years ago, or
we should have more underground heat than we actually have, nor more
than 400 million years ago, or we should not have so much as the least
observed underground increment of temperature. Thatis tosay, I con-
clude that Leibnitz’s epoch of emergence of the consistentior status was
probably between those dates.” These conclusions were announced
twenty-seven years ago and were re-published without modification in
1883. Recently, also, Professor Tait, reasoning from the same basis,
has insisted with equal confidence on cutting down the upper limit of
geologic time to some such figures as ten million or fifteen million years.*
As mathematicians and astronomers, we must all confess to a deep inter-
est in these conclusions and the hypothesis from which they flow. They
are very important if true. But what are the probabilities? Having
been at some pains to look into this matter, I feel bound to state that,
although the hypothesis appears to be the best which can be formulated
at present, the odds are against its correctness. Its weak links are the
unverified assumptions of an initial uniform temperature and a constant
diffusivity. Very likely these are approximations, but of what order
we can not decide. Futhermore, if we accept the hypothesis, the odds
appear to be against the present attainment of trustworthy numerical
results, since the data for calculation, obtained mostly from observa-
tions on continental areas, are far too meagre to give satisfactory aver-
age values for the entire mass of the earth. In short, this phase of the
case seems to stand about where it did twenty years ago, when Huxley
warned us that the perfection of our mathematical mill is no guaranty
of the quality of the grist, adding that, ‘as the grandest mill will not

extract wheat flour from peascods, so pages of formule will not get a
definite result out of loose data.”*

When we pass from the restricted domain of quantitative results
concerning geologic time to the freer domain of qualitative results of a
general character, the contractional theory of the earth may be said
still to lead all others, though it seems destined to require more or less
modification if not to be relegated to a place of secondary importance.
Old, however, as is the notion that the great surface irregularities of
the earth are but the outward evidence ofa crumpling crust, it is only
recently that this notion has been subjected to mathematical analysis
on anything like a rational basis. About three years ago Mr. T. Mel-
lard Readet announced the doctrire that the earth’s crust from the
joint effect of its heat and gravitation should behave in a way somewhat
analogous to a bent beam, and should possess at a certain depth a
‘level of no strain” corresponding to the neutral surface in a beam.
Above the level of no strain, according to this doctrine, the strata will
be subjected to compression and will undergo erumpling, while below
that level the tendency of the strata to crack and part is overcome by
pressure which produces what Reade calls ‘compressive extension,”
thus keeping the nucleus compact and continuous. A little later the
same idea was worked out independently by Mr. Charles Davison,i and
it has since received elaborate mathematical treatment at the hands of
Darwin,§ Fisher,|| and others. The doctrine requires for its application
a competent theory of cooling, and hence can not be depended on at
present to give anything better than a general idea of the mechanies of
crumpling and a rough estimate of the magnitudes of the resulting
effects. Using Thomson’s hypothesis, it appears that the stratum of no
strain moves downward from the surface of the earth at a nearly con-
stant rate during the earlier stages of cooling, but more slowly during
later stages; its depth is independent of the initial temperature of the
earth; and if we adopt Thomson’s value of the diffusivity, it will be
about two and a third miles below the surface in a hundeed million years
from the beginning of cooling, and a little more than fourteen miles
below the surface in seven hundred million years. The most important
inference from this theory is that the geological effects of secular cooling
will be confined for a very long time toa comparatively thin crust. Thus,
if the earth is a hundred willion years old, crumpling should not extend
much deeper than two miles. <A test to which the theory has been sub-

jected, and one which some* consider crucial against it, is the volumetric
amount of crumpling shown by the Earth at the present time. This is
a difficult quantity to estimate, but it appears to be much greater than
the theory can account for.

The opponents of the contractional theory of the Earth, believing it
quantitatively insufficient, have recently revived and elaborated an
idea first suggested by Babbaget and Herschel in explanation of the
greater folds and movements of the crust. This idea figures the crust
as being in a state bordering on hydrostatie equilibrium, which can not
be greatly disturbed without a re-adjustment and consequent movement
of the masses involved. According to this view the transfer of any
considerable load from one area to another is followed sooner or later
by a depression over the loaded area and « corresponding elevation
over the unloaded one, and in a general way it is inferred that the ele-
vation of continental areas tends to keep pace with erosion. The proc-
ess by which this balance is maintained has been called isostasy,i and
the crust is said to be in an isostatic state. The dynamics of the super-
ficial strata with the attendant phenomena of folding and faulting are
thus referred to gravitation alone, or to gravitation and whatever op-
posing force the rigidity of the strata may offer. In a mathematical
sense, however, the theory of isostasy is in a less satisfactory state than
the theory of contraction. As yet we can see only that isostasy is an
efficient cause if once set in action, but how it is started and to what ex-
tent it is adequate remain to be determined. Moreover, isostasy does
not seem to meet the requirements of geological continuity, for it tends
rapidly towards stable equilibrium, and the crust ought therefore to _
reach a state of repose early in geologic time. But there is no evidence
that such a state has been attained, and but little if any evidence of
diminished activity in crustal movements during recent geologic time.
Hence we infer that isostasy is competent only on the supposition that
itis keptin action by some other cause tending constantly to disturb
the equilibrium which would otherwise result. Such a cause is found
in secular contraction, and it is not improbable that these two seem-
ingly divergent theories are really supplementary.

Closely related to the questions of secular contraction and the me-
chanies of crust movements are those vexed questions of earthquakes,
voleanism, the liquidity or solidity of the interior, and the rigidity of
the earth’s mass as a whole ;—all questions of the greatest interest, but
still lingering on the battle-fields of scientific opinion. Many of the
“thrice slain” combatants in these contests would fain risk being slain
again; and whether our foundation be liquid or solid, or, to speak more

precisely, whether the Earth may not be at once highly plastic under
the action of long-continued forces and highly rigid under the action
of periodic forces of short period, it is pretty certain that some years
must elapse before the arguments will be convincing to all concerned.
The difficulties appear to be due principally to our profound ignorance
of the properties of matter subject to the joint action of great pressure
and great heat. The conditions which exist a few miles beneath the
surface of the earth are quite beyond the reach of laboratory tests as
hitherto developed, but it is not clear how our kuowledge is to be im-
proved without resort to experiments of a scale in some degree com-
parable with the facts to be explained. In the mean time, therefore, we
may expect to go on theorizing, adding to the long list of dead theories
which mark the progress of scientific thought with the hope of attain-
ing the truth not so much by direct discovery as by the laborious process
of eiizninating error. .

When we take a more comprehensive view of the problems presented
by the Earth, and look for light on their solution in theories of cosmog-
ony, the difficulties which beset us are no less numerous and formidable
than those encountered along special lines of attack. Much progress
has recently been made, however, in the elaboration of such theories.
Roche,* Darwin.t and others have done much to remove the nebulosity
of Laplace’s nebular hypothesis. Poincaré ¢ and Darwin§ have gone far
towards bridging the gaps which have long rendered the theory of ro-
tating fluid masses incomplete. Poincaré has, in fact, shown us how a
homogeneous rotating mass might, through loss of heat and consequent
contraction, pass from the spheroidal form to the Jacobian ellipsoidal
form, and thence, by reason of its increasing speed of rotation, separate
into two unequal masses. Darwin, starting with a swarm of meteorites
and gravitation as a basis, has reached many interesting and instructive
results in the endeavor to trace out the laws of evolution of a planetary
system.|| But notwithstanding the splendid researches of these and
other investigators in this field, it must be said that the real case of
the solar system, or of the earth and moon, still defies analysis; and
that the mechanics of the segregation of a planet from the sum, or of a

mechanies of the evolutien of a solar system from a swarm of meteor-
ites, arc still far from being clearly made out.

Time does not permit me to make anything but the briefest allusion
to the comparatively new science of mathematical meteorology with
its already considerable list of well-defined theories pressing for accept-
ance or rejection. Nor need I say more with reference to those older
mathematical questions of the tides and terrestial magnetism than that
they are still unsettled. These and many other questions, old and new,
might serve equally well to illustrate the principal fact that this address
has been designed to emphasize, namely, that the mathematical theories
of the earth already advanced and elaborated are by no means com-
plete, and that no mathematical Alexander need yet pine for other
worlds to conquer.

Speculations concerning the course and progress of science are
usually untrustworthy if not altogether fallacicus. But, being dele-
gated for the hour to speak to and for mathematicians and astronomers,
it may be permissible to offer, in closing, a single suggestion, which will
perhaps help us to orient ourselves aright in our various fields of re-
search, If the curve of scientific progress in any domain of thought
could be drawn, there is every reason to believe that it would exhibit
considerable irregularities. There would be marked maxima aud min-
ima in its general tendency towards the limit of perfect knowledge; and
it seems not improbable that the curve would show throughout some
portions of its length a more or less definitely periodic succession of
maxima and minima. Races and communities as well as individuals,
the armies in pursuit of truth as well as those in pursuit of plunder,
have their periods of cuiminating activity and their periods of placid
repose. It is a curious fact that the history of the mathematical theories
of the earth presets some such periodicity. We have the marked max-
imum of the epoch of Newton near the end of the seventeenth century,
with the equally marked maximum of the epoch of Laplace near the end
of the eighteenth century; and, judging from the recent revival of geo-
desy and astronomy in Europe, and from the well-nigh general activity
in mathematical and geological research, we may hope, if not expect, that
the end of the present century will signalize a similar epoch of productive
activity. The minima periods which followed the epochs of Newton and
Laplace are less definitely marked buat not less noteworthy and instruct-
ive. They were not periods of placid repose; to find such one must go
back into the night of the middle ages; but they were periods of greatly
diminished energy, periods during which those who kept alive the
spirit of investigation were almost as conspicuous for their isolation as
for their distinguished abilities. Many causes, of course, contributed to
produce these minima periods, and it would he an interesting study in
philosophic history to trace out the tendency and effect of each cause.
It is desired here, however, to call attention to only one cause which
contributed to the somewhat general apathy of the periods mentioned,

and which always threatens to dampen the ardor of research imme-
diately after the attainment of any marked success or advance. Trefer
to the impression of contentment with and acquiescence in the results
of science, which seems to find easy access to trained as well as un-
trained minds before an investigation is half completed or even fairly
begun. That some such tacit persuasion of the completeness of the
knowledge of the earth has at times pervaded scientific thought, there
can be no doubt. This was notably the case during the period which
followed the remarkable epoch of Laplace. The profound impression
of the sufficiency of the brilliant discoveries and advances of that epoch
is aptly described by Carlyle in the half humorous, half sarcastic lan-
guage of Sartor Resartus. ‘Our theory of gravitation,” he says, ‘is
as good as perfect: Lagrange, it is well known, has proved that the
planetary system, on this scheme, will endure forever; Laplace, still
more cunningly, even guesses that it could not have been made on any
other scheme. Whereby, at least, our nautical logbooks can be better
kept; and water transport of all kinds has grown more commodious,
Of geology and geognosy we know enough; what with the labors of
our Werners and Huttons, what with the ardent genius of their disci-
ples, it has come about that now, to many a royal society, the creation
of a world is little more mysterious than the cooking of a dumpling;
concerning which last, indeed, there have been minds to whom the
question— Hove the apples were got in—presented difficulties.” This was
written nearly sixty years ago, about the time the sage of Ecclefechan
abandoned his mathematies and astronomy for literature to become the
seer of Chelsea; but the foree of its irony is still applicable, for we
have yet to learn, essentially, ‘*‘ How the apples were got in” and what
kind they are.

As to the fature, we can only guess, less or more vaguely, from our
experience in the past and from our knowledge of present.needs.
Though the dawn of that future is certainly not heralded by rosy tints
of overconfidence amongst those acquainted with the difficulties to be
overcome, the prospect, on the whole, has never been more promising.
The converging lights of many lines of investigation are now brought
to bear on the problems presented by our planet. There is ample
reason to suppose that our day will witness a fair average of those
happy accidents in science which lead to the discovery of new princi-
ples and new methods. We have much to expect from the elaborate
macbinery and perfected methods of the older and more exact sciences
of measuring and weighing—astronomy, geodesy, physics, and chem-
istry. Wehave more to expect, perhaps, from geclogy and meteorology,
with their vast accumulation of facts not. yet fully correlated. Much,

secrets of the earth’s origin and history in nebulous masses or in swarms
of meteorites. We have the encouraging stimulus of a very general

that we may easily gain the advantage of a concentration of energy
without centralization of personal interests. To those, therefore, who
can bring the pre-requisites of endless patience and unflagging industry,
who can bear alike the remorseless discipline of repeated failure and
the prosperity of partial success, the field is as wide and as inviting as
it ever was to a Newton or a Laplace.
ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.*

By HENRY HENNEssy, F. R. 8.

The structure of the Earth, as a mechanical and physical question, is
closely connected with the origin and formation of its satellite, and of
the planets and satellites belonging to the saine solar system. The
brilliant results obtained during the present and preceding century by
the aid of mathematical analysis, whereby the motions of those bodies
‘have been brought within the grasp of dynamical laws may have led
to the notion that by similar methods many obscure problems relating
to the planet we inhabit might be accurately solved. But although
the general configuration of the Earth and planets has been treated
mathematically, with results which leave little to be desired, when
applications of analytical methods are attempted to questions of de-
tail in terrestrial structure, the complication of the conditions is so
great as to impose the necessity on some investigators of so altering
these conditions as to make their results perfectly inapplicable to the
real state of the Earth. Physical geology presents problems the solu-
tion of which undoubtedly calls for mechanical and physical cousidera-
tions; but these may in general, under the complex nature of the
phenomena, be often better reasoned out without the employment of
the symbolical nethods of analysis. In most cases the conditions are
totally unlike those above alluded to, which admit of precise numerical
computations. The heterogeneous character of the rocks composing
the Earth’s crust, and the probably varied nature of the matter compos.
ing its interior, render mathematical applications rarely possible, and
sometimes misleading Such views seem to be gradually gaining
strength among geologists who pay attention to questions of a general
nature, and no one has beeter expressed them in recent times than

The principle upon which I have ventured to found all my researches
on terrestrial physics is this: to reason on the matter composing the
globe from our knowledge of the physical and mechanical properties

of its materials which come under our notice. Of these properties the
most important are density, compressibility, and contraction or dilation
from changes of temperature. Newton and other philosophers have
already adopted the same principle to a limited extent, when assaming
for the mass of fluid composing the Earth in its primitive condition
those specific properties which have been assigned to all kinds of fluids
observed at the surface. It is impossible to frame any statement more
erroneous and misleading than that I have endeavored to render the
question more hypothetical than it was. On the contrary, I have dis-
carded the invariable assumption of mathematicians who treated the
question, namely, the hypothesis of the invariability of positions of the
particles composing the solidifying earth. . The speculations of all
rational inquirers upon the Earth’s internal structure must necessarily
start from the same general principle as above. Some investigators
have disregarded that principle and made the problem thereby a purely
mathematical exercise.

In order to reason upon the Earth’s figure, we must assume that the
laws of fluid equilibrium apply to the inner portions of the fluid as well
as the outer. There is nothing hypothetical in reasonings as to the
formation of the solid shell and the law of increase of ellipticity of its
inner surface as a result of the transition of the formerly fluid matter to
the state of solidity. On the contrary, the assumptions of Mr. Hopkins
and other mathematicians, that this transition created no change in the
law of density of the matter composing the Earth and in the ellipticity
of the strata of equal pressure, are not merely hypothetical; they are
directly opposed to well-established physical and mechanical laws.

On the other hand, those who have concluded that nothing can be
known of the form of the fluid nucleus seem to deny that the recognized
laws of matter apply to the internal condition of the Earth. The shape
of the nucleus and the figures of its striata of equal density follow from
physical and mechanical laws, just as the ferms of the isothermal sur-
faces within the spheroid follow from the known laws of conduction of
heat. Some of the mechanical reasonings regarding the strata of the
nucleus and the structure of the solid shell can be presented without
employing mathematical symbols, and in what follows I have, as far as
possible, avoided the use of such symbols.

This course, moreover, possesses the advantage of making many
parts of reasonings more clear to geologists and observers of the strati-
graphical featurcs of the Earth, who are in reality the ultimate judges
of the matter, and not mathematicians. The necessity under which
the latter are constrained when dealing with problems, of throwing the
preliminary propositions into simple, well-defined shapes, admitting of
definite deductions, obliges them to overlook the most essential condi-
tions of the very questions at issue, and they thus arrive at results
which may be precise, but which are totally inconclusive with reference
to the Earth’s structure.
ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. 203

THE MECHANICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MATTER
COMPOSING THE EARTH.

(1) @he materials of the Earth must manifestly influence its general
structure, and no inquiries with this structure can be usefully made if
the physical properties of these materials are not kept in view. If the
interior of the Earth is in a fluid state it is reasonable to believe that
the fluid is not the ideal substance called by mathematicians a perfect
liquid, namely, a substance not only endowed with perfect mobility
among its particles, but also absolutely incompressible. It is more rea-
sonable to believe that the fluid in question resembles the liquid out-
pourings of volcanoes, or at least some real and tangible liquid whose
properties have been experimentally studied. I have already shown
that by overlooking this simple principle certain untenable conclusions,
which assert the exelusively solid character of the Earth, have been
deduced. Here I propose to develop some additional arguments rela-
tive to one of the properties of liquids which has an essential bearing
upon the internal structure of the Earth.

(2) Ina former paper, on the limits of hypotheses regarding the
properties of matter composing the Karth’s interior,* I find that hav-
ing referred to published statements where the facts were not clearly
put forward, I underrated the compressibility of liquids as compared
with solids. The influence of the imperfect experiments of the Aca-
demia del Cimento has long injuriously operated in defining liquid and
solid matter, and has produced a remarkable conflict of opinions.

On taking the results of the best experimental investigations it
appears that, although liquids are but slightly compressible as com-
pared with gases, they are highly compressible as compared with
solids. In many treatises on physics and mechanics which have a high
reputation, matter is divided into solids, elastic fluids or gases, and
incompressible fluids or liquids. Hence the erroneous inference seems
to have arisen that liquids are incompressibie, not only in comparison
with gases, but also in comparison with solid bodies. I was surprised
to find this remarkably misleading proposition formally stated, long
after the decisive experiments of Oersted, Colladon, and Sturm, Reg-
nault, Wertheim, and Grassi, in such a work as Pouillet’s Hléments de
Physique, and also in the German translation by Miiller. The great
compressibility of liquids as compared with solids is seldom affirmed as
a distinct general proposition in books on physics. It occurs, however,
in Deschanel’s treatise, both in the original and in the English edition.
Daguin states, in vol. 1 of his Traité de Physique, 2d edition, p. 40, that
the compressibility of liquids was long considered doubtful, but never-
theless they are more compressible than solids.

Lamé also pointed out the great compressibility of liquids as com-

pared with solids. I have before now referred to the statement of the
same proposition in the comprehensive work of the late Prof. C. F.
Naumann, the Lehrbuch der Geognosie, vol. 1, p. 269, 2d edition. *

Although in many physical questions the compressibility of liquids
may be neglected as well as the compressibility of solids, we are not
entitled to assume at any time that the latter are relatively more com-
pressible than the former. In questions where the pressure of columns
of liquid of great magnitude comes under consideration we can no
longer treat the liquid as incompressible. In the preblem of oceanic
tides the incompressibility of the water has been assumed, but if a
planet were covered with water to a depth of 100 miles it would be
scarcely correct to make such an assumption. The compressibility is
negligible in a small mass of water, but if can not be neglected in a
large mass. Such an assumption is equally unwarrantable with regard
to properties of matter which, though negligible in some problems, are
not in others. Thus in the common hydraulic questions liquids are
assumed to be incompressible ; it would be more correct to say the com-
pressibility is neglected. In small problems connected with limited
portions of the atmosphere the compressibility of air may be also neg-
lected, but we could not neglect it for a high column of the atmesphere.
If, as before remarked, the Earth were surrounded with an ocean 100
miles deep, the compressibility of the water could not be well over-
looked in tidal questions; then, @ fortiori, compressibility can not be
neglected in such a problem as the tides of a liquid spheroid having a
radius nearly equal to that of the earth. This is immediately made
manifest by expressing the ecompressibilities of liquids, not in terms of
the amount due to a single atmosphere of pressure, as is done in most
tabulated groups of results, but by some very much greater standard,
such as one or two thousand atmospheres. In the experiments of Per-
kinst the highest pressure employed was 2,000 atmospheres, and with
this he reduced a column of water by nearly one-twelfth of its volume.
The results of experiments with great pressures suchas this arehighly -
illustrative of the force by which a fluid may be compressed in the
Earth’s interior. The actual coefficients of cubical compressibility, on
which calculations could be based, may be partly obtained from the
more exact researches of Regnault, Grassi, and other recent experi-
ments, or from special investigations ou fluid matter conducted with
precautions such as these observers have employed. By then compar-
ing the moduli of compressibilities calculated from pressures of 1,000
or 10,000 atmospheres there could be no possibility of overlooking the
consequences as to the relations of liquids and solid bodies in any ease
where they could be subjected to pressures of abnormal magnitude.

(3) The propagation of sound in liquids and solids gives further proof
of the greater compressibility of liquids.

The rate v of transmission of sound in solids and liquids is a fune-
tion of their compressibilities. In solids,

where # is the modulus of elasticity and p the density. In liquids,

where jis the coefficient of cubic compressibility, H the pressure of
the atmosphere, and a the deusity of mercury. But as in solids the
modulus of elasticity is inversely as the compressibility k, we have
C= yeas
1 kpHa

Both in solids and liquids the velocity of sound is inversely as the
square roots of the densities and compressibilities. Although such
solids as metals and rocks are denser than most liquids, the limits of
their elastic compressibility are so much less that sound is propagated
far more quickly through such solids than through liquids. In steel
and metals generally this has been long since established. In rocks
the velocity of sound has been computed from direct experiment by
Mallet, and has been found to be greater in continuous homogeneous
rock than the velocities observed in liquids.*

(4) If we had not the results of direct experiment on the compressi-
bilities of liquids and solids to assure us that these properties in liquids
are in excess of those obtained for solids we might fairly infer this
conclusion from the relative dilatability of such substances under dif-
ferences of temperature.t The construction of our common thermome-
ters is based on the greatly superior dilatability of the liquids inclosed
in the thermometer-tube over the material of the tube itself. The
dynamical theory of heat clearly establishes that the expansion of
solids and liquids is a mechanical action as much as their compression
under the action of force, and the substances which contract least by

cooling are precisely those which contract least under pressure. Gases
which contract most by pressure are also the most dilatable by heat.
Liquids occupy an intermediate place between solids and gases in rela-
tion both to the dynamical effect of pressure and the action of loss of
heat. If, instead of the experiment of the Academia del Cimento with
globes of porous metal, an experiment with equally strong but impervi-
ous vessels had been made, the deformation of each globe would have
been unaccompanied by the exudation of the liquid, and the totally
false statement that solids are more compressible than liquids would
not have so long injuriously influenced physical science.

THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH CONSIDERED AS PARTLY FLUID AND
PARTLY SOLID.

(1) The problem of the precessional motion of the Earth considered
as a solid shell filled with liquid devoid of viscidity and friction has
been elaborately investigated by Mr. Hopkins, in his “ Researches ot
Physical Geology,” in the Philosophical Transactions for 1839, 1840, and
1842, and the result obtained by him has been often quoted as extremely
remarkable. Before treating the same question, it may be necessary
to state that on the continent of Europe the application made by Mr,
Hopkins of his result to geology is not generally admitted, and views
such as I have always firmly upheld seem to be more generally adopted; -
but some confusion appears to exist as to Mr. Hopkins’s results and
those to which I have been led. Thusinarecent treatise on systematic
geology the author says, with reference to the thickness of the solid
crust of the earth, there are plainly only four possibilities to be thought
of:

1. The Earth is through and through solid.

2. The Earth is through and through fluid, with a solid crust.

3. The Earth has a solid nucleus and a solid crust, with fluid stratum
lying between.

4. The Earth is solid, but furnished with cavities which are filled
with fluid.

The first and last of these possibilities are not admissible, according
to astronomical observations. According to the investigatiors of
Hopkins the action exercised by the sun and moon on the positiv of
the Earth’s axis in space, by which precession and nutation are pro-
duced, would be different according to the structure we attribute to the
earth. Thevalues established by observation compel us to regard the earth
as for the most part in a fluid state, in order that the results may har-
monize with calculation (Pfaff, Grundriss der Geologie). This is the
reverse of what Hopkins has concluded, and is precisely what I have
long since enunciated, which I have always continued to maintain, and
which forms the cumulative result of the investigations in the text of
this paper. In a report to the Royal Irish Academy on ‘“ Experiments
on the Influence of the Molecular Influence of Fluids on their Motion
ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. 204

when in Rotation,” p. 57,* I referred toa proof obtained by me of the
result alluded to, and I now may be allowed to submit this proof to
those interested in the question.

(2) Let us suppose the earth to consist of a solid spheroidal shell
composed of nearly similar spheroidal strata of equal density, and
having the ellipticities of the inner and outer surfaces small and
nearly equal. The sheil is supposed to be full of liquid and to rotate
around its polar axis. Under these conditions the attraction of an
exterior body would tend to produce pressure between the fluid
nucleus and the inner surface of the shell. Whatever may be the
direction of this pressure, it can be resolved into a force normal to the
shell’s surface and into forces in its tangent plane. The normal force
might be effective in causing a deformation of the shell, or, if the latter
were rigid, it would be destroyed by the shell’s resistance.

If friction existed between the materials of the shell and the fluid of
the nucleus, the resolved forces in the tangent plane would tend to
change the motion of the shell from the motion it would have if empty.
But if no friction and no adhesion existed between the particles of the
liquid and the shell’s nearly spherical surface, and if the particles of the
liquid are free from viscidity and internal friction among themselves,
this purely tangential component could exercise no influence on the
motions of the shell. If the solid envelope containing fluid was bounded
by planes such as a prismatic vessel or box, it is manifest that unequal
normal pressures on the faces of such prism would tend to produce
couples, and thus possible rotations. Such a case has been considered
by Professor Stokes, and he has shown that a rectangular prism filled
with fluid will have the same motion as if the fluid was replaced by a
solid having the same mass, center of gravity, and principal axis, but
with much smaller moments of inertia corresponding to these axes.
But in a continuously curved and nearly spherical vessel the normal
pressure arising from the disturbance of the liquid could not produce
the same results. The tangential components of the forces acting at
the surface of the liquid could, in this case, be alone effective, and if no
friction or viscidity existed at this surface such tangential action would
totally disappear. The conclusion of Mr. Hopkins’s first memoir is,
that if the ellipticity of the inner and outer surfaces of the solid shell
were the same, precession would be unaffected by the fluid, and any
small inequality of nutation would be totally inappreciable to observa-
tion (p. 423, Phil. Trans., 1839). This may be rendered more manifest
by recalling the general equations for the surface of a fluid obtained
by Poisson, Navier, Meyer, and other mathematicians when the internal
friction of the fluid is taken into account. If a, 6, vy, be the angles
made by the normal to the curved surface of the fiuid, X, Y, 7 the com-
ponents parallel to the rectangular axes of x, y, and 2, it appears that
we shall have at the fluid surface, when nearly spherical,

Now, as X, Y, and Zare the effective components with which the nearly
spherical mass of fluid acts at its surface when each of them is separ-
ately equal to zero, it follows that the fluid can do no work at the sur-
face, and the motions of the shell would take place quite independently
of the contained mass of fluid when the latter is totally devoid of fric-
tion and viscidity. .

(3) It has long since been clearly shown that the motion of the axis
of the Earth, considered as a solid body, may be determined by the
differential equations

V is the potential of the rotating solid, Cits maximum moment of in-
ertia, 7 and # direction angles of the axis of rotation. In the case of
the Earth, @ has a particular value when it becomes the obliquity of
the ecliptic, and 7 the longitude of the first point of Aries. It follows
that the determination of 7 and @ at any time depends upon C and JV.

By analytical transformations, which are fully given by Poisson in

importance.

(4) Mathematicians, during the past two centuries, have devoted
much attention to the question of the figure of a rotating mass of fluid,
with especial reference to the explanation of the spheroidal figures of
the earth and her sister planets. Solutions of this problem have been
presented, especially by Clairaut, Legendre, Laplace, Gauss, Ivory,
Jacobi, and Airy; and it is not a little remarkable that in applying
these solutions to the case of the Earth every one of these investi-
gators has not only supposed the Harth to have been originally in a
fluid state, but that the particles of the mass retained the same posi-
tions after solidification had taken place. This tacit or openly expressed
assumption of the unchangeable position of the particles of the origi-
nal fluid mass on their passage to a complete or partial state of solidity
lies at the root of the whole question of the Earth’s structure. For the
first time in the treatment of the physico-mathematical problem, I dis-
tinctly discarded this assumption and I affirmed that the position of
the particles of matter, on passing from the state of fluidity to solid-
ity, must assume positions in conformity with mechanical and physical
laws. In this way the hypothesis of the Earth’s primitive fluidity be-
came more siinple and much more rational ; for it was as manifestly
absurd to assume that the particles of the fluid mass, on passing into
a Solid state of consistence, retained their original positions, as it would
be to assume that if the whole Earth became liquefied the positions of
its particles would be unchanged. The corrected and simplified
hypothesis is also fruitful in important results; butit is singular that,
as far as | am aware, no mathemetician seems to have understood or
appreciated its bearing on the physical structure of the Harth, except
M. Plana, by a remark in a memoir published by him towards the close
of his career.

(5) Before presenting my conclusions on the shape of the inner surface
of the solidified shell and Plana’s remark relative to the same subject,
it is necessary to recall some results established by Clairaut and fre-
quently pat forward by mathematical investigators of the Earth’s figure.
It seems to be universally admitted that if a mass of heterogeneous fluid
composed of strata of equal density, each increasing in density from the
surface of the mass to its center, is set in rotation, the several strata
will be spheroidal, but their ellipticities will not be equal. The elliptici-
ties will decrease from the outer surface toward the center. This law
of decrease of ellipticity toward the center is not a hypothetical result,
but a necessary deduction from the properties of fluids. As all known
fluids are compressible, such an arrangement of strata of equal density
as that referred to must follow from the supposition of the existence of
any mnass of fluid of such magnitude as the whole Earth. The increase

H, Mis. 129——14
210 ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.

of the Earth’s density from its surface to its center is, moreover, a fact
clearly revealed by the mean density of the Earth being double that of
the materials composing the outside of its solid shell.

If the increase of density in going from the surface to the center of
a large mass of fluid is dne to compression exercised by the outer upon
the inner strata, it follows that the greater the total quantity of fluid
the greater will be the difference between the density at its surface and
its center, and the less the quantity of fluid the less will be this differ-
ence. With a small spheroid of compressible fluid the variation of
density might be neglected and the mass regarded as homogeneous.
Suppose such a small mass of fluid to be set in rotation, its surface will
become spheroidal, and it will have the well-known ellipticity } m, where
m is the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity at the equator of the
spheroid. If now this original spheroid be supposed to be overlaid
with masses of the fluid, one after another, the inner portions will be
sensibly compressed, and the whole mass will begin to vary in density
in going from center to surface. The outer surface will now present an
ellipticity less that  m. If fresh layers of fluid are continually applied
to the outer surface, the variation of density will continue, and the differ-
ence between the density at the center and surface will increase. The
ellipticity of the outer stratum of fluid will at the same time diminish
to a value corresponding to the law of density. Let us now reverse this
operation and suppose a great mass of liquid in rotation; its outer
stratum will be less dense than those beneath, and its greatest density
must be at the center. Let the outer strata of equal density be sue-
cessively removed, so as to leave a succession of free fluid surfaces, until
a spheroid is reached in which the difference of density is insensible. It
is manifest that with each successive removal of the upper stratum of
liquid the compression in the remaining strata becomes reduced, and
also the variation in density from surface to center, until this variation
’ becomes altogether extinguished. With the same velocity of rotation,
the ellipticities of the surfaces of liquid thus successively exposed would
increase up to the limiting value, 4} m.

If at any time of the Earth’s solidification we suppose a nucleus of
fluid to be inclosed within the solid shell, the successive increasing of
thickness of the shell, from the congelation of the fluid matter of the
nucleus, must be accompanied by the removal of successive outer strata
from the nucleus. From what has been seen already, the nucleus will
tend to acquire an increase of ellipticity, and therefore to mould the
semifluid pasty matter about to pass into a solid state into a shape dif-
ferent from what it would have if no change whatever in the position of
the particles had taken place. As the nucleus is supposed to be in a
state of fusion from heat, the suecessive additions to the inner surface
of the shell from the matter of the nucleus must proceed at a very slow
rate. The congelation of the surface stratum of the nucleus must be a
process of the same order of slowness as the flow of heat through the
shell; and the mathematical theory ef conduction established by Fourier
ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. rn iy

shows that this can not proceed otherwise than slowly. The changes
in shape of the surface of the nuclens would be correspondingly slow
and gradual. When once a comparatively rigid outer crust had been
formed, the process of molding additional strata of solidified matter
against the inner surface of the crust from the nucleus would proceed
in a slow and gradual order, so that the resulting solid strata would
couform to the shape impressed upon them by the molding forces. A
remarkable illustration of the way in which fused matter ejected from
the Earth’s interior may, while turning on its center and at the same
time cooling, mold itself against a solid crust formed upon it has been
adduced by Charles Darwin, and has already been quoted by me on a
former occasion. From these considerations I have been led to conclude,
that the ellipticity of the shell’s inner surface may exceed but can not be less
than the ellipticity of its outer surface ;* and referring to the same ques-
tion, Plana used the words, ** La loi des ellipticités a subi dans le passage
de Vétat liquide a l’état solide une alteration sensible par laquelle toutes
les couches se sont constitueés de maniére a avoir un méme applatisse-
ment et plus grand que le précédent.” M. Plana has further stated his
views in the same volume of the Astronomische Nachrichten for 1852,
thus: ‘Il est permis de penser que ces couches (de la fluide intérieuse)
en se consolidant, ont subi des modifications a la verité fort petites, mais
assez grandes pour nous empécher de pouvoir dériver, avec tout V’exacti-
tude que lon pourrait scuhaiter, ’état de la Terre solid de son état
antérieure de fluidité.”

This paragraph gives a distinct adhesion to the improved form of the
hypothesis of the original fluidity of the Earth; and this concurrence
on the part of M. Plana is the more important, as it is possible that he
had formed his conclusions independently. He refers to a letter written
by him on the subject to Humboldt; and it is remarkable that, in the
fifth and last volume of ‘*Cosmos,” published not long before the author’s
death, some adjacent notes allude to Plana’s views, and contain refer-
ences to the investigations of Mr. Hopkins and to my early researches.

At this period Humboldt could scarcely have had time to examine
the mechanical and physical reasonings, and he merely quoted the
papers in the Philosophical Transactions as if he had seen them for
the first time. I am not aware of any evidence as to whether Plana bad
known their contents; and it is possible that his conclusions as to the
forms of the strata of the shell and nucleus had been formed independ-
ently, though published a short time after my investigations.

The annexed figure may assist in making clear the results of the pre-
ceding paragraph. The outer ellipse represents the outline of the exte-
rior surface of the Earth’s crust, which is shaded and bounded inwardly
by a surface slightly more elliptical. The fluid nucleus included within
212 ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.

center. This arrangement is necessarily followed by a mass of fluid
under such conditions as the nucleus, or under the conditions of the
entirely fluid Karth. If the matter com-
posing the Earth underwent no change
in passing from the fluid to the solid
state, instead of the arrangement here
represented, the inner surface of the
shell would have a smaller ellipticity
than its outer surface, and the strata
of the shell, as well as those of the nu-
cleus, would be less oblate in going
from the outer surface.

(6) It is important to distinctly bear
in mind that the constitution of the
shell and nucleus indicated by the foregoing reasonings is not based
on any hypothesis of a specific law of density of the interior strata
of the Earth. It is a deduction from the established properties of
fluids quite as vigorous as the conclusions regarding the spheroidal
shape of a mass of rotating liquid. On the other hand, the supposition
tacitly or openly made by Mr. Hopkins and his followers, that the ellip-
ticity of the inner stratum of the solid shell is precisely the same as that
which this stratum had when fluid, is not merely a hypothesis—it is an
assumption which is directly contradicted by the recognized physical
properties of all known liquids, and even contradicted by the funda-
mental principles of hydrodynamics. Upon this assumption was based
the calculation of the ratios of the inner and outer ellipticities of the
shell which would correspond to the observed value of the precession
of the Earth’s axis, and hence the limiting value of the thickness of the
shell. But when the fundamental assumption on which this ratio is ©
calculated is shown to be in contradiction to physical and mechanical
laws, the whole of the conclusions drawn from such a calculation must
fall to the ground.

In the Mecanique Céleste, Laplace, following Clairaut, proved that if the
density in a fluid spheroid decreases from the center to the surface, the
ellipticity of the strata of equal density must decrease from the surface
towards the center. This result forms the groundwork of some of
the arguments employed in the present inquiry. Legendre and La-
place also deduced a law of density from the properties of compres-
sible fluids, and from this law the latter unfolded a law of ellipticity
of the strata of equal density. The results arrived at in my pres-
ent inquiry are manifestly totally independent of the law of density

——— deduced by Legendre and Laplace. In order to

apply this law to the strata of the solidified shell, the assumption
must necessarily be made that the particles of the fluid underwent
no change in position on passing to the solid state. This was assumed
ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. 21o

by Mr. Hopkins and Archdeacon Pratt; and, as we have seen, such an
assumption is not only unwarranted, but is absolutely contradicted
by the established laws of hydrodynamies. My conclusions are not
only in harmony with those laws, but necessarily require them to be
kept constantly in view throughout the whole investigation.

(7) The result obtained in section (3) allows of an immediate and
easy application to the inquiry before us, if we admit that the strata of
equal density in the shell have all equal ellipticities—an admission
which has been already shown to be a particular case of a rigorous and
exact deduction from hydrodynamical principles. In this case let us
consider the ratio of the difference of the moments of inertia of any
spheroidal stratum to its greatest moments of inertia. It will readily
appear that the difference of the greatest and least moments of inertia,
of all the strata, divided by the sum of the greatest moments of inertia,
will be the same as that fora homogeneous shell whose inner and outer
elipticities are equal.

Consequently the precessional motion of such a shell would be the same
as that of a homegeneous spheroid of the same ellipticity. Ife = ,3,,
it appears that the value of precession for such a spheroid would be
57”, while its observed value is 50/"1.* Now, as it is impossible to
adinit such a difference where the result of observation is so well estab-
lished, we must conclude that the solid shell of the Earth, composed of
nearly equi-elliptic strata, can not extend to its center —in other words,
that the Earth can not be altogether a solid from its surface to its center.
On the other hand, the fluid nucleus contained within the shell ean not
be devoid of friction and viscidity, but must possess these properties
in common with all fluids that have ever been observed on the Earth’s
surface. These properties of the liquid may, as [ have long since an-
nounced, cause the shell and liquid nucleus to rotate together as one
solid mass. The same conclusion was afterward put forward by M. De-
launey; and experiments made under his direction, and afterward,
at the instance of the Royal Irish Academy, by me, show that in rota-
ting glass vessels filled with water the amount of friction and viscidity
is such as to render any difference of slow motion between the liquid
and its containing vessel insensible. With liquids so viscid that water
is in comparison limpid, such as piteh, honey, and especially voleanic
lava in a fused state, the results would be absolutely decisive. To
this class of liquids the fluid matter of the Earth’s interior, so far as
it has come under observation, undoubtedly belongs; and hence the
overwhelming certainty of our general conclusions as to the connection
between the Karth’s structure and its rotation.

(8) If the tendency of the solid crust is to become more elliptical at
its inner surface as it increases in thickness, some interesting conse-
quences appear to follow. If the shell were unaccompanied by the
nucleus, or if no friction existed at their surfaces, the changes in the
relations of the principal moments of inertia of the shell might be sup-
posed to cause its rotation to become unstable, so as to bring about
conditions which might result in a change of the axis of rotation. It
is easy to show on the most favorable suppositions that this could not
occur. Theincreasing ellipticity of the inner surface of the shell would
be due to the increasing oblateness of the surface of the fluid nucleus,
and this would be at its maximum if the neucleus approached a state
of homogeneity; but the fluid can not approach this state unless the
radius of the nucleus is so small that the variation in density due to
pressure becomes insensible, whence all its strata would possess the
same density. This condition with a certain thickness of the solid shell

*A revision of the numerical data from recent astronomical results leads me to con-
‘clude that the precession for the solid spheroid would be a little less, and about 55/7
instead of 57’’.. This I propose to prove in a short paper, entitled ‘‘ Note on the an-
nual precession calculated on the hypothesis of the earth’s solidity.” This note
[appended to this article] leaves the general conclusions of the present paper un-
altered.
216 ' ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.

may bring about equality in the two principal moments of inertia of the
shell. The most favorable case would be for a homogeneous shell.
Hence we have only to solve the very simple problem: Given the thick-
ness of a homogeneous spheroidal shell at its pole, required its thick-
ness at the equator, so as to make its principal moments of inertia
equal. We have from the expressions for C, and <A, in (7),

for its maximum inner ellipticity, we can easily find the values of ©

inertia the thickness of the shell should be .047 of its equatorial semi-
axis, and the mean radius of the nucleus would thus be reduced from
the original value when the whole mass was fluid by a fraction less
than one-twentieth. Under these conditions the ellipticity of 54,5, cor-
responding to homogeneity, could not exist; and hence it may be con-
cluded that, whether the shell is thin or whether the Earth has become
almost altogether solid, the moment of the inertia of the shell with
respect to its polar axis must be always greater than the moment of
inertia for its equatorial axis.

The tendency of the fluid nucleus to increase in ellipticity might
produce a result worthy of examination by volcanologists, namely, a
possible increase in the development of voleanic phenomena in equa-
torial as compared to polar regions with the progressive solidification
of the Karth up to a certain point. Until the thickness of the shell
has become very great, recent periods should exhibit a greater devel-
opment of volcanic energy towards the equator than toward the poles
as compared to remote epochs.

solid spheroid would be 57’. This was the result of Mr. Hopkins’s eal-
culations; and the difference, amounting to between six and seven sec-
onds between it and the observed value, formed the basis of all his
conclusions relative to the Earth’s internal condition. Hitherto I have
not seen any reason for doubting the above numerical result; but on
looking more closely into the question it appears probable that we
must reduce the precession for the hypothetical solid spheroid to about
50’, If the Earth were a spheroid perfectly rigid, the amount of pre-
cession can be calculated from formule given in Airy’s Tracts, Pratt’s
Mechanical Philosophy, Pontecoulant’s Théorie Analytique du Systeme du
Monde, or Resal’s Traité de Mécanique Celeste. In the two latter works
Poisson’s memoir on the rotation of the Earth about its center of grav-
ity is very closely followed, and the formule are those which I have

generally employed. From these writings we have

In all these formule, or in any others by which the precession can

Mr. Hopkins made his calculation more than forty years ago, he appears
to have taken the value of the Moon’s mass and all his other numerical
data from the early editions of Airy’s Tracts. He uses 366.26 for
the Earth’s period, 27.32 for ee Moon’s. He makes [=23° 28’, i=50
8’ 50’, and the Moon’s mass ~5 of the Earth’s mass. All of these values
require revision, and it may be poetsed that Sir George Airy has
more recently expressed the opinion that 3 may be taken as the value
of the Moon’s mass.* On this question if ey be permitted to remark

* Monthly Nene of the Royal Aetrotomical ‘Baciciy, Mesemnber 1878, p. 140.
218 ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.

that there are three different phenomena from which the Moon’s mass
has been determined: (1) The perturbations of the Earth’s motion in
its orbit around the Sun by the action of the moon; (2) the tides; and
(3) the nutation of the Karth’s axis. The largest mass, or +5 nearly, has
been obtained from the first, and the smallest from nutation. But
the values obtained from nutation are not very accordant, and more-
over the close connection between nutation and precession makes it a
doubtfel matter to calculate the amount of one from a quantity depend-
ing on the other. The moon’s mass obtained from the tides is that
which has been employed by Laplace, Poisson, and other mathemati-
cians as the most probable. It appears that a recent discussion of the
tides in the United States, made by Mr. Ferrel, has given the same
value as that found by Laplace. This circumstance, as well as the fact
that the value so obtained lies between the values found by the other
methods, gives us reason to place much contidence in the result. If we
call P; the precession for a homogeneous spheroid whose ellipticity is
Ej, then from (1)

If we take the value of the Moon’s mass given by the tides, or rather
the ratio of the Moon’s action to that of the Sun thus given, we shall
use the value of y employed by Poisson, Pontécoulant, and Resal ;
if we also employ for # the value which Colonel Clarke shows good
ground for deeming the most probable,* that is 55s;; instead of 54, or
even smaller fractions hitherto accepted, [ find that P, becomes 56’’-05.
By Pratt’s formula and the numerical values he employs, except for
FR, I find
P,=54""'-879.

If we take ,5 for the Moon’s mass in Poisson’s formula, y becomes
2-2062, and
P)=53'"574.

If we change y to 80 in Pratt’s formula with
K= Soa te) P,=52!"-95.

The value for the observed precession now generally admitted is
50-37. It is therefore manifest that the difference between this and
the precession of a homogeneous equi-elliptic spheroid can not be
admitted to be as great as Mr. Hopkins has declared it to be. From
the values of P; which I have caleulated we should have

P,—P=5''-68 and 4/507, with the Moon’s mass=7;;

* See Colonel Clarke’s paper in the Philosophical Magazine for August, 1878, where
he maintains that recent geodetical results tend to increase the value of the Earth’s
ellipticity and to make the measured value approach to that obtained from pen-
dulum observations.

Consequently instead of admitting Mr. Hopkins’s result of 7” for the
difference between the precession of a homogeneous spheroid with the
Earth’s ellipticity and the precession actually observed, we may affirm
that this difference is probably not more than 4” or 5’,

With the best values for the numerical elements the difference is,
however, too well ascertained to be overlooked, and it leads to the con-
clusion that the Earth can not consist of an entirely solid mass composed
of equi-elliptic strata, and that it is therefore partly composed of a solid
shell bounded by surfaces such as I have elsewhere indicated, with an
interior mass of viscid liquid, such as is seen flowing from the volcanic
openings of the shell, arranged in strata conforming to the laws of
hydrostatics, or in other words, with strata of equal density decreasing
in ellipticity toward the Earth’s center.
GLACIAL GEOLOGY.*

By Prof. JAMES GEIKIE, F. R. S.

The results obtained by geologists, who have been studying the pe-
ripheral areas of the drift-covered regions of our continent, are such as
to satisfy us that the drifts of those regions are not iceberg-droppings,
as we used to suppose, but true morainic matter and fluvio-glacial de-
tritus. Geologists have not jumped to this conclusion; they have only
accepted it after laborious investigations of the evidence. Since Dr.
()tto Torell, in 1875, first stated his belief that the “ diluvium” of north
Germany was ot per origin a great literature on the subject has
sprung up, a perusal of which will show that with our German friends
glacial geology has passed through much the same succession of phases
as with us. At first icebergs are appealed to as explaining everything—
next we meet with sundry ingenious attempts at a compromise between
floating ice and a continuous ice-sheet. As observations multiply, how-
ever, the element of floating ice is gradually eliminated, and all the
phenomena are explained by means of land ice and ‘“schmelz-wasser”
alone. It is a remarkable fact that the iceberg hypothesis has always
been most strenuously upheld by geologists whose labors have been
largely confined to the peripheral areas of drift-covered countries. In
the upland and mountainous tracts, on the other hand, that hypothesis
has never been able to survive a moderate amount of accurate observa-
tion, - - -

The notion of a general ice-sheet having covered a large part of
Europe, which a few years ago was looked upon as a wild dream, has
been amply justified by the labors of those who are so assiduously investi-
gating the peripheral area of the “ great northern drift.” And perhaps
I may be allowed to express my own belief that the drifts of middle and
southern England, which exhibit the same complexity as the “lower
diluvium” of the continent, will eventually be generally acknowledged to
have had a similar origin.

I now pass on to review some of the general results obtained by con-

Carontdential nddiees before the Geslonical Sec fo of fie British Aaoes ition Ge
Sci. at Newcastle, September, 1889. (Report of the British Association, 1889, vol. LUX,
pp. 552-564.)

tinental geologists as to the extent of area occupied by inland ice dur-
ing the last great extension of glacier ice in Europe. It is well known
that this latest ice-sheet did not overflow nearly so wide a region as
that underneath which the lowest bowlder clay was accumulated.
Gerard de Geer has given a summary* of the general results obtained
by himself and his fellow-workers in Sweden and Norway; and these
have been supplemented by the labors of Berendt, Geinitz, Hunchecone,
Klockmann, Keilhack, Schréder, Wahnschaffe, and others in Germany,
and by Sederholm in Finland. From them we learn that the end-
moraines of the ice-circle round the southern coasts of Norway, from
whence they sweep southeast by east across the province of Gottland
in Sweden, passing through the lower ends of Lakes Wener and Wet-
ter, while similar moraines mark out for us the terminal front of the
inland ice in Finland at least two parallel frontal moraines passing
inland from Hango head on the Gulf of Finland through the southern
part of that province to the north of Lake Ladoga. Further northeast
than this they have not been traced; but, from some observations by
Helmersen, Sederholm thinks it probable that the terminal ice front
extended northeast by the north of Lake Onega to the eastern shores
of the White Sea. Between Sweden and Finland lies the basin of the
Baltic, which at the period in question was filled with ice, forming a
great Baltic glacier which overflowed the Aland Islands, Gottland and
Oland, and which, fanning out as it passed toward the southwest,
invaded, on the south side, the Baltic provinces of Germany, while, on
the north, it crossed the southern part of Scania in Sweden and the
Danish islands to enter upon Jutland. - - -

The general conclusion arrived at by those who are at present inves-
tigating the glacial accumulations of northern Europe may be sum-
marized as follows :

(1) Before the invasion of northern Germany by the inland ice the
low grounds bordering on the Baltic were overdowed by a sea which
contained a boreal and arctic fauna. These marine conditions are in-
dicated by the presence, under the lower bowlder clay of more or less
well-bedded fossiliferous deposits. On the same horizon occur also beds
of sand, containing fresh-water shells, and now and again mammalian
remains, some of which imply cold and other temperate climatic condi-
tions. Obviously all these deposits may pertain to one and the same
period, or more properly to different stages of the same period—some
dating back to a time when the climate was still temperate, while
others clearly indicate the prevalence of cold conditions, and are there-
fore probably somewhat younger.

(2) The next geological horizon in ascending order is that which is
marked by the “ Lower Diluvium”—the glacial and fluvioglacial de-
tritus of the great ice-sheet which flowed south to the foot of the Harz

GLACIAL GEOLOGY. 223

marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial organic remains, derived undoubt-
edly from the so-called preglacial beds already referred to. These latter,
it would appear, were plowed up and largely incorporated with the old
ground moraine.

(3) The interglacial beds which next succeed contain remains of a
well-marked temperate fauna and flora, which point to something more
than a mere partial or local retreat of the inland ice. The geographi-
cal distribution of the beds and the presence in these of such forms as
Hlephas antiquus, Cervus elephas, C. megaceros, and a flora comparable
to that now existing in northern Germany, justify geologists in con-
cluding that the inter-glacial epoch was one of long duration, and
characterized in Germany by climatic conditions apparently not less
temperate than those that now obtain. One of the phases of that
inter-glacial epoch, as we have seen, was the overflowing of the Baltic
provinces by the waters of the North Sea.

(4) To this well-marked inter-glacial epoch succeeded another epoch
of arctic conditions, when the Scandinavian inland ice once more
invaded Germany, plowing through the inter-glacial deposits, and
working these up in its ground moraine. So far as I can learn, the
prevalent belief among geologists in north Germany is that there was
only one inter-glacial epoch; but, as already stated, doubt has been
expressed whether all the facts can be thus accounted for. There must
always be great difficulty in the correlation of widely separated inter-
glacial deposits, and the time does not seem to me to have yet come
when we can definitely assert that all these inter-glacial beds belong to
the same geological horizon.

Ihave dwelt upon the recent work of geologists in the peripheral
areas of the drift-covered regions of northern Hurope, because I think
the results obtained are of great interest to glacialists in this country.
And for the same reason I wish next to call attention to what has been
done of late years in elucidating the glacial geology of the Alpine lands
of central Hurope, and more particularly of the low grounds that
stretch out from the foot of the mountains. Any observations that
tend to throw light upon the history of the complex drifts of our own
peripheral areas can not but be of service. The only question concern-
ing the ground moraines that has recently given rise to much discussion
is the origin of the materials themselves. It is obvious that there are
only three possible modes in which those materials could have been
introduced to the ground moraine; either they consist of superficial
morainic débris which has found its way down to the bottom of the old
glaciers by crevasses; or they may be made up of the rock rubbish,
shingle, gravel, etc., which doubtless strewed the valleys before these
were occupied by ice; or, lastly, they may have been derived in chief
measure from the underlying rocks themselves by the action of the ice
that overflowed them. The investigations of Penck, Blaas, Bohm, and
Briickner appear to me to have demonstrated that the ground moraines
224 GLACIAL GEOLOGY.

are composed mostly of materials which bave been detached from the
underlying rocks by the erosive action of: the glaciers themselves.
Their observations show that the regions studied by them in great
detail were almost completely buried under ice, so that the accumula-
tion of superficial moraines was, for the most part, impossible; and
they advance a number of facts which prove positively that the ground
moraines were formed and accumulated under the ice. These geolo-
gists do not deny that some of the material may occasionally have come
from above, nor do they doubt that preéxisting masses of rock rubbish
and alluvial accumulations may have been incorporated with the ground
moraines; but the enormous extent of the latter and the direction of
transport and distribution of the erratics which they contain can not
be thus accounted for, while all the facts are readily explained by the
action of the ice itself, which used its subglacial débris as tools with
which to carry on the work of erosion.

Professor Heim and others have frequently asserted that glaciers
have little or no eroding power, since at the lower ends of existing
glaciers we find no evidence of such erosion being in operation. But
the chief work of a glacier cannot be carried on at its lower end, where
motion is reduced to a minimum, and where the ice is perforated by
sub-glacial tunnels and arches, underneath which no glacial erosion
can possibly take place; and yet it is upon observations made in just
such places that the principal arguments against the erosive action of
glaciers have been based. - - - If we wish to learn what glacier-ice
can accomplish, we must study in detail some wide region from which
the ice has completely disappeared. Following this plan, Dr. Blaas has
been led by his observations on the glacial formation of the Inn Valley
to recant his former views, and to become a formidable advocate of the
very theory which he formerly opposed. ‘To his work and the memoirs
by Penck, Briickner, and Bohm, already cited, and especially to the
admirable chapter on glacier erosion by the last-named author, I would
refer those who may be anxious to know the last word on this much-
debated question.

The evidence of inter-glacial conditions within the Alpine lands con-
tinues to increase. These are represented by alluvial deposits of silt,
sand, gravel, conglomerate, breccia, and lignites. Penck, Bohm, and
Briickner find evidence of two interglacial epochs, and maintain that
there have been three distinct and separate epochs of glaciation in the
Alps. No mere temporary retreat and re-advance of the glaciers, ac-
cording to them, will account for the phenomena presented by the in.
ter-glacial deposits and associated morainie accumulations. During
interglacial times the glaciers disappeared from the lower valleys of the
Alps; the climate was temperate and probably the snow-fields and
glaciers approximated in extent to those of the present day. All the
evidence conspires to show that an interglacial epoch was of prolonged
duration. Dr. Briickner has observed that the moraines of the last
GLACIAL GEOLOGY. 225

glacial epoch rest here and there upon loess, and he confirms Penck’s
observations in South Bavaria that this remarkable formation never
overlies the morainic accumulations of the latest glacial epoch. Ac-
cording to Penck and Briickner therefore the loess is of interglacial age.
There can be littie doubt, however, that loess does not belong to any one
particular horizon. Wahnschaffe* and others have shown that through-
out wide areas in north Germany it is the equivalent in age of the
‘“ Upper Diluvium,” while Schumacher} points out that in the Rhine
valley it occurs on two separate and distinet horizons. Professor
Andree has likewise shown that there is an upper and lower léss in
Alsace, each characterized by its own special fauna.

There is still considerable difference of opinion as to the mode of
formation of this remarkable accumulation. By many it is considered
to be an aqueous deposit; others, following Richthofen, are of opinion
that it is a wind-blown accumulation, while some incline to the belief
that it is partly the one and partly the other. Nor do the upholders
of these various hypotheses agree amongst themselves as to the pre-
cise manner in which water or wind has worked to produce the ob-
served results. Thus, amongst the supporters of the aqueous origin of
the loess, we find this attributed to the action of heavy rains washing
over and re-arranging the material of the bowlder clays.§ Many, again,
have held it probable that loess is simply the tinest loam distributed over
the low grounds by the flood waters that escaped from the northern
inland ice and the mers de glace of the Alpine lands of central Europe.
Another suggestion is that much of the material of the loess may have
been derived from the denudation of the bowlder clays by flood water
during the closing stages of the lastcold period. It is pointed out that
in some regions at least the loess is underlaid by a layer of erratics, which
are believed to be the residue of the denuded bowlder clay. We are re-
minded by Klockmann|| and Wahnschaffef that the inland ice must have
acted as a great dam, and that the wide areas in Germany, ete., would
be flooded, partly by water derived from the melting inland ice and
partly by waters flowing north from the hilly tracts of middle Germany.
In the great basins thus formed there would be a commingling of fine
silt material derived from north and south, which would necessarily
come to form a deposit having much the same character throughout.

From what I have myself seen of the loess in various parts of Ger-
many, and from all that I have gathered from reading and in conver-
sation with those who have worked over loess-covered regions I incline

to the opinion that loess is for the most part of aqueous origin. In
many cases this can be demonstrated, as by the occurrence of bedding
and the intercalation of layers of stones, sand, gravel, etc., in the de-
posit; again, by the not infrequent appearance of fresh-water shells;
but perhaps chiefly by the remarkable uniformity of character which
the loess displays. It seemed to me reasonable also to believe that the
flood waters of glacial times must needs have been charged with finely
divided sediment, and that such sediment would be spread over wide
regions in the low grounds—in the slack waters of the great rivers and
in the innumerable temporary lakes which occupied or partly occupied
many of the valleys and depressions of the land. There are different
kinds of loess or loess-like deposits, however, and all need not have been
formed in the same way. Probably some may have been derived, as
Wahuschaffe has suggested, from the denudation of bowlder clay. Pos-
sibly, also, some loess may owe its origin to the action of rain upon the
stony clays, producing what we in this country would call “ rain-wash.”
There are other accumulations, however, which no aqueous theory will
satisfactorily explain. Under this category comes much of the so-
called Bergléss, with its abundant land shells and its generally unstrat-
ified character. It seems likely that such loess is simply the result of
sub-aerial action, and owes its origin to rain, frost, and wind acting
upon the superficial formations and re-arranging their finer-grained con-
stituents. And it is quite possible that the upper portion of much of
the loess of the lower grounds may have been re-worked in the same way.
But I confess I can not yet find in the facts adduced by German geo-
logists any evidence of a dry-as-dust epoch having obtained in Europe
during any stage of the Pleistocene period. It is obvious, however,
that after the flood waters had disappeared from the low grounds of
the continent sub-aérial action would come into play over the wide
regions covered by glacial and fluvio-glacial deposits. Thus, in the
course of time these deposits would become modified, just as similar
accumulations in these islands have been top-dressed,as it were, and to
some extent even re-arranged.

I am strengthened in these views by the conclusion arrived at by M.
Falsan, the eminent French glacialist. Covering the plateaux of the
Dombs, and widely spread throughout the valleys of the Khone, the Ain,
the Isére, ete., in France, there is a deposit of loess, he says, which has
been derived from the washing of the ancient moraines. At the foot of
the Alps, where black schists are largely developed, the loess is dark
gray; but west of the secondary chain the same deposit is yellowish and
composed almost entirely of siligious materials, with only a very little
carbonate of lime. This limon, or loess, however, is very generally modi-
fied towards the top by the chemical action of rain, the yellow loess
acquiring a red color. Sometimes it is crowded with calcareous con-
cretions; at other times it has been deprived of its calcareous element
and converted into a kind of pulverulent silica or quartz. This, the true
GLACIAL GEOLOGY. 220

loess, is distinguished from another, lehm, which Falsan recognizes as
the product of atmospheric action, formed, in fact, in place from the
disintegration and decomposition of the subjacent rocks. Even this
lehm has been modified by running water, dispersed or accumulated
locally, as the case may be.*

All that we know of the loess and its fossils compels us to include this
accumulation as a product of the Pleistocene period. It is not of post-
glacial age, even much of what one may call the ‘‘remodified loess”
being of Late Glacial or Pleistocene age. IL can not attempt to give
here a summary of what has been learned within recent years as to the
fauna of the loess. The researches of Nehring and Liebe have familiar-
ized us with the fact that at some particular stage in the Pleistocene
period a fauna like that of the alpine steppe lands of western Asia was
indigenous to middle Europe, and the recent investigations of Woldrich
have increased our knowledge of this fauna. At what horizon, then,
does this steppe fauna make its appearance? At Thiede Dr. Nehring
discovered in so-called loess three successive horizons, each characterized
by a special fauna. The lowest of these faunas was decidedly arctic in
type; above that came a steppe fauna, which last was succeeded by a
fauna comprising such forms as mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, Bos,
Cervus, horse, hyzena, and lion. Now, if we compare this last fauna
with theforms which have been obtained from true postglacial deposits,
those deposits, namely, which overlie the younger bowlder clays and
flood accumulations of the latest glacial epoch, we find little in common.
The lion, the mammoth, and the rhinoceros are conspicuous by their
absence from the postglacial beds of Europe. In place of them we
meet with a more or less arctic fauna, and a high alpine and arctic
flora, which, as we all know, eventually gave place to the flora
and fauna with which Neolithic man was contemporaneous. As this
is the case throughout northwestern and central Europe, we feel justi-
- fied in assigning the Thiede beds to the Pleistocene period, and to that
interglacial stage which preceded and gradually merged into the last
glacial epoch. - - -

If the student of the Pleistocene fauna has certain advantages in the
fact that he has to deal with forms many of which are still living, he
labors at the same time under disadvantages which are unknown to
his colleagues who are engaged in the study of the life of far older
periods. The Pleistocene period was distinguished above all things
by its great oscillations of climate, the successive changes being
repeated and producing correlative migrations of floras and faunas.
We know that arctic and temperate faunas and floras flourished
during interglacial times, and a like succession of life forms followed
the final disappearance of glacial conditions. A study of the organic
remains met with in any particular deposit will not necessarily, there-
fore, enable us to assign these to their proper horizon. The geograph-

228 GLACIAL GEOLOGY.

ical position of the deposit and its relation to Pleistocene accumulations
elsewhere must clearly be taken into account. Already, however,
much has been done in this direction, and it is probable that ere long
we shall be able to arrive at a fair knowledge of the various modifi-
cations which the Pleistocene floras and faunas experienced during
the protracted period of climatic changes of which I have been
speaking. We shall even possibly learn how often the arctic, steppe,
prairie, and forest faunas, as they have been defined by Woldrich,
replaced each other. Even now some approximation to this better
knowledge has been made. Dr. Pohlig,* for example, has compared the
remains of the Pleistocene faunas obtained at many different places in
Europe, and has presented us with a classification which, although
confessedly incomplete, yet serves to show the direction in which we
must look for further advances in this department of inquiry.

During the last twenty years the evidence of interglacial conditions
both in Europe and America has so increased that geologists generally
no longer doubt that the Pleistocene period was characterized by great
changes of climate. The occurrence at many different localities on the
continent of beds of lignite and fresh-water alluvia, containing remains
of Pleistocene mammalia, intercalated between separate and Cistinct
bowlder clays, has left us no alternative. The interglacial beds of the
Alpine lands of Central Europe are paralleled by similar deposits in
Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, and France. But opinions differ as to
the number of glacial and interglacial epochs, many holding that we
have evidence of only two cold stages and one general interglacial
stage. This, as I have said, is the view entertained by moss geologists
who are at work on the glaciai accumulations of Scandinavia and North
Germany. On the other hand, Dr. Penck and others, from a study of
the drifts of the German alpine lands, believe that they have met with
evidence of three distinct epochs of glaciation and two epochs of inter-
glacial conditions. In France, while some observers are of opinion
that there have been only two epochs of general glaciation, others, as
for example, M. Tardy, find what they consider to be evidence of
several such epochs. Others again, as M. Falsan, do not believe in the
existence of any interglacial stages, although they readily admit that
there were great advances and retreats of the ice during the glacial
period. M. Falsan, in short, believes in oscillations, but he is of the
opinion that these were not so extensive as others maintained. It is,
therefore, simplya question of degree, and whether we speak of oscilla-
tions or of epochs we must needs admit the fact that through all the
glaciated tracts of Europe fossiliferous deposits occur intercalated
among glacial accumulations. The successive advance and retreat of

the ice, therefore, was not a local phenomenon, but characterized all
the glaciated areas. And the evidence shows that the oscillations
referred to were on a gigantic scale.

The relation borne to the glacial accumulations by the old river
alluvia which contain relics of paleolithic man early attracted atten-
tion. From the fact that these alluvia in some places overlie glacial
deposits the general opinion (still held by some) was that paleolithic
man must needs be of postglacial age. But since we have learned
that all bowlder clay does not belong to one and the same geological
horizon—that, in short, there have been at least two, and probably
more, epochs of glaciation—it is obvious that the mere occurrence of
glacial deposits underneath paleolithic gravel does not prove these
latter to be postglacial. All that we are entitled in such a case to say
is simply that the implement-bearing beds are younger than the glacial
accumulations upon which they rest. Their horizon must be deter-
mined by first ascertaining the relative position in the glacial series of
the underlying deposits. Now, it is a remarkable fact that the bowl-
der clays which underlie such old alluvia belong, without exception, to
the earlier stages of the glacial period. This has been proved again
and again, not only for this country but for Europe generally. 1am
sorry to reflect that some twenty years have now elapsed since I was
led to suspect that the paleolithic gravels and cave deposits were not
of post-glacial but of glacial and inter-glacial age. In 1871—’72 I pub-
lished a series of papers in the Geological Magazine, in which I set
forth the views I had come to form upon this interesting question. In
these papers it was maintained that the alluviaand cave deposits could
not be of post-glacial age, but must be assigned to pre-glacial and inter-
glacial times, and in chief measure to the latter. Evidence was adduced
to show that the latest great development of glacier ice in Europe
took place after the southern pachyderms and paleolithic man had
vacated England; that during this last stage of the glacial period, man
lived contemporaneously with a northern and alpine fauna in such
regions as southern France; and, lastly, that paleolithic man and the
southern mammalia never re-visited northwestern Kurope after extreme
glacial conditions had disappeared. These conclusions were arrived
at after a somewhat detailed examination of all the evidence then
available, the remarkable distribution of the paleolithic and ossiferous
alluvia having, as I have said, particularly impressed me. I colored
a map to show at once the areas covered by the glacial and fluvio-
glacial deposits of the last glacial epoch, and the regions in which the
implement-bearing and ossiferous alluvia had been met with, when it
became apparent that the latter never oceurred at the surface within
the regions occupied by the former. If ossiferous alluvia did here and
there appear within the recently glaciated areas, it was always either
in caves or as infra- or inter-glacial deposits. Since the date of these
researches our knowledge of the geographical distribution of Pleisto-
230 GLACIAL GEOLOGY.

cene deposits has greatly increased, and implements and other relics
of paleolithic man have been recorded from many new localities
throughout Europe. But none of this fresh evidence contradicts the
conclusions I had previously arrived at; on the contrary, it has greatly
strengthened my general argument. - - -

Thus as years advance the picture of Pleistocene times becomes more
and more clearly developed. The conditions under which our old
paleolithic predecessors lived—the climatic and geographical changes
of which they were the witnesses—are gradually being revealed with
a precision that only a few years ago might well have seemed impossi-
ble. This of itself is extremely interesting, but I feel sure that I
speak the conviction of many workers in this field of labor when I say
that the clearing up of the history of Pleistocene times is not the only
end which they have in view. One can hardly doubt that when the
conditions of that period and the causes which gave rise to these have
been more fully and definitely ascertained we shall have advanced
some way towards the better understanding of the climatic conditions
of still earlier periods. - - - It would almost seem as if all one had
to do to ascertain the climatie condition of any particular period was to
prepare a map depicting with some approach to accuracy the former
relative position of land and sea. With such a map could our meteor-
ologists infer what the climatic cenditions must have been? Yes, pro-
vided we could assure them that in other respects the physical condi-
tions did not differ from the present. Now, there is no period in
the past history of our globe the geological conditions of which are
better known than the Pleistocene. And yet when we have indicated
these upon a map we find that they do not give the results which we
might have expected. The climatic conditions which they seem to
imply are not such as we know did actually obtain. It is obvious,
therefore, that some additional and perhaps exceptional factor was at
work to produce the recognized results. What was this disturbing
element, and have we any evidence of its interference with the opera.
tion of the normal agents of climatic changes in earlier periods of the
world’s history? We all know that various answers have been given
to such questions. Whether amongst these the correct solution of the
enigma is to be found time will show. Meanwhile, as all hypothesis
and theory must starve without facts to feed ov, it behooves us as
working geologists to do our best to add to the supply. The success
with which other problems have been attacked by geologists forbids
us to doubt that ere long we shall have done much to dispel some of
the mystery which still envelopes the question of geological climates.
THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.*

By G. K. GiLBERT.

The Niagara River flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The
shore of Erie is more than 300 feet higher than the shore of Ontario;
but if you pass from the higher shore to the lower, you do not descend
at a uniform rate. Starting from Lake Erie and going northward, you
travel upon a plain—not level, but with only gentle undulations—until
you approach the shore of Lake Ontario, and then suddenly you find
yourself on the brink of a high bluff or cliff overlooking the lower lake,
and separated from it only by a narrow strip of sloping plain. The
bird’s-eye view in Plate Lis constructed to show the relations of these
various features, the two lakes, the broad plateau lying a little higher
than the shore of Lake Erie, the cliff, which geologists call the Niagara
Escarpment, and the narrow plain at its foot.

Where the Niagara River leaves Lake Erie at Buffalo and enters the
plain, a low ridge of rock erosses its path, and in traversing this its
water is troubled; but it soon becomes smooth, spreads out broadly,
and indolently loiters on the plain. For three-fourths of the distance it
can not be said to have a valley, it rests upon the surface of the plateau;
but then its habit suddenly changes. By the short rapid at Goat
Island and by the cataract itself the water of the river is dropped 200
feet down into the plain, and thence to the cliff at Lewiston it races
headlong through a deep and narrow gorge. From Lewiston to Lake
Ontario there are no rapids. The river is again broad, and its channel
is scored so deeply in the littoral plain that the current is relatively
slow, and the level of its water surface varies but slightly from that of
the lake.

The narrow gorge that contains the river from the Falls to Lewiston
is a most peculiar and noteworthy feature. Its width rarely equals the
fourth of a mile, and its depth to the bottom of the river ranges from
200 to 500 feet. Its walls are so steep that opportunities for climbing
up and down them are rare, and in these walls one may see the

geologic structure of the plateau. They are constituted of bedded
rocks—limestone, shale, and sandstone—lying nearly horizontal, and
a little examination shows that the same strata occur in the same order
on both sides. So evenly are they matched, and so uniform is the
general width of the gorge, that one might suspect, after a hasty exam-
ination, the two sides had been cleft asunder by some Plutonic agency.
But those who have made a study of the subject have reached a dif-
ferent and better conclusion—the conclusion that the trench was exca-
vated by running water, so that the strata of the two sides are alike
because they are parts of continuous sheets, from each of which a
narrow strip has here been cut.

The contour of the cataract is subject to change. From time to
time blocks of rock break away, faliing into the pool below, and new
shapes are then given to the brink over which the water leaps Many
such falls of rock have taken place since the white man occupied the
banks of the river, and the breaking away of a very large section is
still a recent event. By such observation we are assured that the
extent of the gorge is increasing at its end, that it is growing longer,
and that the cataract is the cause of its extension.

This determination is the first element in the bistory of the river.
A change is in progress before our eyes. The river’s history, like
human history, is being enacted, and from that which occurs we can
draw inferences concerning what has occurred, and what will occur.
We can look forward to the time when the gorge now traversing the
fourth part of the width of the plateau will completely divide it, so
that the Niagara will drain Lake Erie to the bottom. We can look
back to the time when there was no gorge, but when the water flowed
on the top of the plain to its edge, and the Falls of Niagara were at
Lewiston.

We may think of the river as laboring at a task—the task of sawing
in two the plateau. The task is partly accomplished. When itis done
the river will assume some other task. Before it was begun what did
the river do?

How can we answer this question? The surplus water discharge
from Lake Erie can not have flowed by this course to Lake Ontario
without sawing at the plateau. Before it began the cutting of the
gorge it did not flow along this line. It may have flowed somewhere
else, but if so it did not constitute the Niagara River. The commence.
ment of the cutting of the Niagara gorge is the beginning of the his-
tory of the Niagara River. We have accomplished somewhat of our
purpose if we have discovered that our river had a beginning.

We are so accustomed to think of streams, and especially large
streams, as permanent, as flowing on forever, that the discovery of a
definite beginning to the life of a great river like the Niagara is im-
portant and impressive. But that discovery does not stand alone.
Indeed, it is but one of a large class of similar facts familiar to students
234 THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.

of geology. Let us consider for a moment the tendency of stream his-
tories and the tendency of lake histories. Wherever streams fall over
rocky ledges in rapids or in cataracts, t)ieir power of erosion is greatly
increased by the rapid descent, and they deepen their channels. If
this process continues long enough, the result must be that each stream
will degrade its channel through the hard ledges until the descent is no
more rapid there than in other parts of its course. It follows that a
stream with cascades and water-falls and numerous rapids is laboring
at an unfinished task. It is either a young stream, or else nature has
recently put obstructions in its path.

Again, consider what occurs where a lake interrupts the course of a
stream. The lower part of the stream, the outflowing part, by deepen-
ing its channel continually tends to drain the lake. The upper course,
the inflowing stream, brings mud and sand with it and deposits them
in the still water of the lake, thus tending to fill its basin. Thus, by a
double process, the streams are laboring to extinguish the lakes that
lie in their way, and given sufficient time, they will accomplish this.

Now, if you will study a large map of North America, you will find
that the region of the Great Lakes is likewise a region of small lakes.
A multitude of lakes, lakelets, ponds, and swamps where ponds once
were, characterize the surface from the Great Lakes northward to the
Arctic Ocean, and for a distance southward into the United States. In
the same region waterfalls abound, and many streams consist of mere
alternations of rapids and pools. Further south, in the region beyond
the Ohio River, lakes and cataracts are rare. The majority of the
streams flow from source to mouth with regulated course, their waters
descending at first somewhat steeply, and gradually becoming more
nearly level as they proceed, At the south the whole drainage system
is mature; at the north it is immature. At the south it is old; at the
north, young.

The explanation of this lies in a great geologic event of somewhat
recent date—the event known as the age of ice. Previous to the ice
age our streams may have been as tame and orderly as those of the
Southern States, and we have no evidence that there were lakes in this
region. During the ice age the region of the Great Lakes was some-
what in the condition of Greenland. It was covered by an immense
sheet of ice and the ice was in motion. In general it moved from north
to south. It carried with it whatever lay loose upon the surface. It
did more than this, for just as the soft water of a stream, by dragging
sand and pebbles over the bottom, wears its channel deeper, so the
plastic ice, holding grains of sand and even large stones in its under
surface, dragged these across the underlying rock, and in this way not
only scoured and scratched it, but even wore it away.

In yet other ways the moving ice mass was analogous toa river. Its
motion was perpetual, and its form changed little, but that which
moved was continually renewed. As a river is supplied by rain, so the
THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER 235

glacier was supplied by snow falling upon regions far to the north. To
a certain extent the glacier discharged to the ocean like a river, break-
ing up into icebergs and floating away; but its chief discharge was
upon the land, through melting. The climate at its southern margin
was relatively warm, and into this warm climate the sheet of ice steadily
pushed and was as steadily dissolved.

Whatever stones and earth were picked up or torn up by the ice
moved with it to its southern margin and fell to the ground as the ice
melted. If the position of the ice margin had been pertectly uniform
its continuously deposited load might have built a single high wall;
but as the seasons were cold or warm, wet or dry, the ice margin
advanced and retreated with endless variation, and this led to the
deposition of irregular congeries of hills, constituting what is known
as the ‘drift deposit.”.. Eventually the warm climate of the south pre-
vailed over the invader born of a cold climate, compelling it to retreat.
The motion of the ice current was not reversed, but the front of the
glacier was melted more rapidly than it could be renewed, and thus its
area was gradually restricted. During the whole period of retre: ch-
ment the deposition of drift proceeded at the margin of the ice, so
that the entire area that it formerly occupied is now diversified by
irregular sheets and heapings of earth and stone.

The ancient configuration of the country was more or less modified
by the erosive action of the ice, and it was further moditied by the
deposits of drift. The destructive and constructive agencies together
gave to the land an entirely new system of hills and valleys. When
the ice was gone the rain that fell on the land could no longer follow
the old lines of drainage. Some of the old valleys had perhaps been
obliterated; others had been changed so that their descent was ina
different direction, and all were obstructed here and there by the heaps
of drifts. The waters were held upon the surface in innumerable lakes,
each overflowing at the lowest side of its basin, and thus giving birth
to a streain that descended to some other lake. Otten the new lines
of descent—the new water courses—crossed regions that before had had
no streams, and then they were compelled to dig their own channels.
Thus it was that the whole water system of a vast region was refash-
ioned, and thus it has come to pass that the streams of this region are
young.

Like every other stream of the district of the Great Lakes. the
Niagara was born during the melting of the ice, and so we may begin
our chronicle with the very beginning of the river.

If you will again call to mind the features of a general map of the
United States and Canada, and consider the direction in which the
streams flow, you will perceive that there is a continuous upland, a sort
of main divide, separating the basin of the Great Lakes from the basin
of the Mississippi.* It is not a mountain range. In great part it is a

236 THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.

region of hills. In places it is only the highest part of the plain; but it
is nevertheless a continuous upland, else the waters would not be parted
along its course. When the ice had its greatest extent it passed over
this upland, so that the waters produced by its melting fell into the
Ohio and other tributaries of the Mississippi, as well as into streams
that discharged to Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Afterward, when
the glacier gradually fell back, there came atime when the ice front lay
in the main to the north of the great water parting, but had not yet re-
ceded from the Adirondack Mountains, so that the water that flowed
from the melting glacier could not escape by way of the St. Lawrence
River, but gathered as a lake between the upland divide and the ice
front. In fact, it formed not one but many lakes, each discharging
across the divide by some low pass, and as the great retreat progressed
these lakes were varied in number and extent, so that their full history
is exceeding complex.

The surfaces of these lakes were stirred by the winds, and waves beat
upon their shores. In places they washed out the soft drift and carved
clifts; elsewhere they fashioned spits and bars. These cliffs and spits
and other monuments of wave work survive to the present time, and
have made it possible to trace out and map certain of the ancient lakes.
The work of surveying them is barely begun, but from what is known
we may add a chapter to the history of our river.

There was a time when one of these lakes occupied the western por-
tion of the basin of Lake Erie, and discharged across the divide at the
point where the city of Fort Wayne now stands, running into the
Wabash River and thence into the Ohio. The channel of this discharge
is so well preserved that its meaning can not be mistaken, and the
associated shore lines have been traced for many miles eastward into
Ohio and northward into Michigan. Afterward this lake found some
other point of discharge, and a new shore line was made 25 feet
lower. Twice again the point of discharge was shifted and other
shore lines were formed. The last and lowest of the series has been
traced eastward across the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania and into
western New York, where it fades away in the vicinity of the town of
Careyville. At each of the stages represented by these four shore lines
the site of the Niagara was either buried beneath the ice or else sub-
merged under the lake bordering the ice. There was no river.

The next change in the history of the lakes was a great one. The
ice, which had previously occupied nearly the whole of the Ontario
basin, so far withdrew as to enable the accumulated water to flow out
by way of the Mohawk Valley. The level of discharge was thus sud-
denly lowered 550 feet, and a large district previously submerged be-
came dry land. Then for the first time Lake Erie and Lake Ontario
were separated, and then for the first time the Niagara River carried
the surplus water of Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.

The waves of the new-born Lake Ontario at once began to carve

about its margin a record of its existence. That record is wonderfully
clear, and the special training of the geologist has not been necessary
to the recognition of its import. The earliest books of travel in west-
ern New York describe the Ridge road, and tell us that the ridge of
sand and gravel which it follows was even then recognized by all resi-
dents as an ancient beach of the lake.* In the Province of Ontario,
the beach was examined and described by the great English geologist,
Charles Lyell, during his celebrated journey in America,t and it after-
ward received more careful study by Mr. Sandford Fleming,t and by
the geologists of the Canadian Survey.§- In western New York it was
traced out by the great American geologist, James Hall, during his survey
of the geology of the fourth district of the State.|| Within afew years more
attention has been given to detail. Prof. J. W. Spencer has traced the
line continuously from the head of the lake at Hamilton, past Toronto,
Windsor, and Grafton, in the vicinity of Belleville,{{ beyond which
point it is hard to follow. South of the lake, I myself have traced it
from Hamilton to Queenstown and Lewiston, thence to Rochester, and
all about the eastern end of the basin to Watertown, beyond which
point it is again difficult to trace. Southeast of the present margin of
Lake Ontario there was a great bay, extending as far south as Cayuga
Lake, and including the basin of Oneida Lake, and it was from this
bay that the discharge took place, the precise point of overflow being
the present site of the city of Rome. For this predecessor of Lake On-
tario Professor Spencer has proposed the name of Iroquois.

Putting together the results of his survey and of my own, I have
been able to prepare a map (Pl. 11) exhibiting with a fair amount of
detail the outline of the old lake. It will be observed that the north-
eastern portion of the shore is not traced out. In fact it is not trace-
able. The water was contained on that side by the margin of the
glacier, and with the final melting of the ice all record of its shore
vanished.

The form and extent of Lake Iroquois, and the form and extent of
each other lake that bordered the ice front, were determined partly by
the position of the pass over which the discharge took place, and by the
contour of the land; but they were also determined to a great extent
by the peculiar attitude of the land.

THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER. Zoo

Perhaps a word of general explanation is necessary in speaking of
the attitude of the land. Geologists are prone to talk of elevation and
subsidence—of the uprising of the earth’s crust at one place or at one
time, and of its down-sinking at another place or another time. Their
language usually seems to imply the rise or fall of an area all together,
without any relative displacement of its parts; but you will readily see
that, unless a rising or sinking tract is torn asunder from its surround.
ings, there must be ali about it a belt in which the surface assumes an
inciined position, or, in other words, where the attitude ot the land is
changed. If the district whose attitude changes is a lake basin, the
change of attitude will cause a change in the position of the line marked
about the slopes of the basin by the water margin, and it may even
cause the overflow of the basin to take a new direction.

The Ontario basin has been subjected to a very notable change of
attitude, and the effect of this change has been to throw the ancient
shore line out of level. When the shore line was wrought by the waves,
all parts of it must have lain in the same horizontal plane, and had
there been no change in the attitude of the basin, every point of the
shore line would now be found at the level of the old oatlet at Rome.
Instead of this, we find that the old gravel spit near Toronto—the
Davenport ridge—is 40 feet higher than the contemporaneous gravel
spit on which Lewiston is built; at Belleville, Ontario, the old shore is
200 feet higher than at Rochester, New York; at Watertown 300 feet
higher than at Syracuse; and the lowest point, in Hamilton, at the
head of the lake, is 325 feet lower than the highest point near Water-
town. From these and other measurements we learn that the Ontario
basin with its new attitude inclines more to the south and west than
with the oid attitude.

The point of discharge remained at Rome as long as the ice was
crowded high against the northern side of the Adirondack Mountains,
but eventually there came a time when the water escaped eastward
between the ice and the mountain slope. The line of the St. Lawrence
was not at once opened, so that the subsidence was only partial. The
water was held for short times at various intermediate levels, recorded
at the east in aseries of faint shore lines. Owing to the attitude of the
land, these shores are not traceable all about the basin, but pass be-
neath the present water level at various points.

Finally the ice blockade was raised in the St. Lawrence Valley, and
the present outlet was established. During the period of final retreat
the attitude of the land had slowly changed, so that it was not then so
greatly depressed at the north as before; but it had not yet acquired
its present position, and for a time Lake Ontario was smaller than now,
its western margin lying lower down on the slope of the basin.

An attempt has been made in Pl. 111 to exhibit diagramatically the
relations of ice dams and basin attitudes to one another and to the river.
The various elements are projected, with exaggeration of heights, on a

vertical plane running a little west of south, or parallel to the direction
of greatest inclination of old water-planes. At N is represented the
Niagara escarpment and the associated slope of the lake basin; at A
the Adirondack Mountains. R and T are the passes at Rome and at
the Thousand Islands. Successive positions of the ice front are marked
at I', ?, and F. The straight line numbered 1 represents the level of
lake water previous to the origin of the Niagara River; 2 gives the first
position of the water level after the establishment of the Kome outlet ;
and the level gradually shifted to 3; 4 is the first of the series of tem-
porary water levels when the water escaped between the mountain
slope and the ice front; 5 represents the first position of the water level
after the occupation of the Thousand Island outlet; and 6, the present
level of Lake Ontario.

It should be added parenthetically that the shore of Lake Iroquois
as mapped in PI. 11 is not quite synchronous. Between 2 and 3 of PI.
Ill there was a continuous series of water levels, but it was not easy to
map any one except the highest. The northern part of the map delin-
eates the margin of water level 2 and the southern part the margin of
water level 3.

It is easy to see that these various changes contribute to modify the
history of the Niagara River. In the beginning, when the cataract
was at Lewiston, the margin of Lake Ontario, instead of being 7 miles
away, as now, was only 1 or 2 miles distant, and the level of its water
was about 75 feet higher than at present. The outlet of the lake was
at Rome, and while it there continued there was a progressive change
in the attitude of the land, causing the lake to rise at the mouth of tne
Niagara until it was 125 feet higher than now. It fairly washed the
foot of the cliff at Queenston and Lewiston. ‘Then came a time when
the lake fell suddenly through a vertical distance of 250 feet, and its
shore retreated to a position now submerged. Numerous minor oscil-
lations were caused by successive shiftings of the point of discharge,
and by progressive changes in the attitude of the land, until finally the
present outlet was acquired, at which time the Niagara River had its
greatest length. It then encroached 5 miles on the modern domain of
Lake Ontario, and began a delta where now the lead-line runs out 30
fathoms.

While the level of discharge was lower than now, the river had dif-
ferent powers as an eroding agent. The rocks underlying the low
plain along the margin of the lake are very soft, and where a river
flows across yielding rocks the depth to which it erodes is limited
chiefly by the level of its point of discharge. So when the point of
discharge of the Niagara River—the surface of the lake to which it
flowed—was from 100 to 200 feet lower than now, the river carved a
channel far deeper than it could now carve. When afterward the rise
of land in the vicinity of the outlet carried the water gradually up to its
present position in the basin this channel was partly filled by sand and

other débris brought by the current; but it was not completely filled,
and its remarkable present depth is one of the surviving witnesses of
the shifting drama of the Ontario. Near Fort Niagara 12 fathoms of
water are shown on the charts.

Mr. Warren Upham has made a similar discovery in the basin of the
Red River of the North. That basin held a large lake, draining south-
ward to the Mississippi—a lake whose association with the great glacier
Upham appropriately signalized by naming it after the apos:le of ‘ the
glacial theory,” Louis Agassiz. The height of the old Agassiz shore
has been carefully measured by Mr. Upham, through long distances,
and it is found to rise continuously, though not quite uniformly, toward
the north. Similar discoveries have been made in the basins of Erie,
Huron, and Michigan, and the phenomena all belong approximately to
the same epoch. So, while the details remain to be worked out, the
general fact is already established that during the epoch of the ice
retreat the great plain constituting the Laurentian basin was more
inclined to the northward than at present.

It was shown, first in the case of Lake Agassiz, and afterward, as
already stated, in the case of Lake Ontario, that the change from the
old attitude of the land to the present attitude was in progress during
the epoch of the ice retreat. The land was gradually rising to the
north or northeast. In each lake basin the water either retreated from
its northern margin, so as to lay bare more land, or encroached on its
southern margin, or else both these changes occurred together ; and in
some cases we have reason to believe that the changes were so exten-
sive that the outlets of lakes were shifted from northerly passes to more
southerly passes. :

To illustrate the effect of the earlier system of land slopes upon the
distribution of water in the region of the Great Lakes I have con-
structed the map in Pl. tv. It does not postulate the system of levels
most divergent from the present system, but a system such as may
have existed at the point of time when the last glacial ice was melted
from the region. The modern system of drainage is drawn in broken
lines; the hypothetic system in full lines, with shading for the lake
areas; and a heavier broken line toward the bottom of the map marks
the position of the present water-parting at the southern edge of the
Laurentian basin. :

In the ancient system of drainage, Georgian Bay, instead of being a
dependency of Lake Huron, is itself the principal lake, and receives
the overflow from Huron. It expands toward the northeast so as to
include the basin of Lake Nipissing, and its discharge is across a some-
what low pass at the east end of Lake Nipissing, and thence down the
Ottawa River to the St. Lawrence. Lake Michigan, instead of vom-
municating with Lake Huron by a strait, forms a tributary lake, dis-
charging its surplus through a river. Lake Superior has the same
relations as now, but its overtlow traverses a greater distance before

reaching Lake Huron. Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Georgia con-
stitute a lake system by themselves, independent of Erie and Ontario,
and the channel of the Detroit River isdry. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario,
both greatly reduced in size, constitute another chain, but their con-
necting link, the Niagara River, is a comparatively small stream, for
the diversion of the upper lakes robs the river of seven-eighths of its
tributary area.

Whether this hypothetic state of drainage ever existed, whether the
ice retreated from the Nipissing pass while still the changimg attitude
of the land was such as to turn the Georgian outlet in that direction,
are questions not yet answered. But such data as I have at present
incline me to the belief that for a time the upper lakes did discharge
across the Nipissing pass.

Professor Spencer has decribed a channel by which Georgian Bay
once drained across a more southerly pass to the valley of the Trent
River, and thence to Lake Ontario.* He states that there is an ancient
shore line about Georgian Bay associated with this outlet, and that he
has traced this line westward and southward until it comes down to
the shore of Lake Huron, demonstrating that during the existence of
that outlet also, the Detroit River ran dry. The Trent pass is much
higher than the Nipissing pass, so that it appears necessary to assume
that during the history of the Trent outlet for the upper lakes the
great glacier still occupied the region of Lake Nipissing, preventing
the escape of the water in that direction.

The map in PI. Vv represents the systeia of lakes and outlets at that
time. It is largely theoretic, but at the same time I believe its general
features consistent with our present knowledge of the facts.

Unless [ have misunderstood Professor Spencer, Lake Ontario was
at high stage in the first part of the epoch of the Trent Valley outlet,
and was afterwards at low stage. I have selected as the date of my
map the epoch of the high stage, with the outlet of Ontario at Rome,
and have indicated an ice sheet so extensive as to block the way not
only at Lake Nipissing but at the pass of the Thousand Islands. The
date of this map is earlier than the other; it belongs toa time when
the northward depression of the land was greater. Lake Erie is repre.
sented as less in extent, for its basin in that position would hold less
water. Huron and Ontario would likewise be smaller were their
waters free to escape over the lowest passes; but the ice blocks the
way, and so their waters are raised to the level of higher passes. Of
the contemporaneous relations of the upper lakes we know nothing at
present. They are drawn as though communicating with Lake Huron,
but it is equally possible that they fell into some other drainage
system. Here again the Detroit channel was not in use, and the
Magers River was outlet only for the waters of the Erie basin.

246 THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER

Graphie methods are ill adapted to the communication of qualified or
indefinite statements. By the aid of a map one can indicate definitely
the relation of Albany to other places and things, but he cannot say
indefinitely that Albany is somewhere in eastern New York, nor can
he say, with qualification, that it is probably on the Mohawk River.
For this reason I have decided to publish these two maps only after
hesitation, because I should greatly regret to produce the impression
that the particular configuration of lakes and outlets here delineated
has been actually demonstrated. The facts now at command are sug-
gestive rather than conclusive, and when the subject shall have been
fully investigated it is to be expected that the maps representing these
epochs will exhibit material differences from those I have drawn. The
sole point that I wish to develop at this time is the probability that dur-
ing a portion of the history of the Niagara River its drainage district—
that area from which its water was supplied—was far less than it is at
the present time. There is reason to beligve that during an epoch
which may have been short or long—we can only vaguely conjecture—
the Niagara was a comparatively small river.

The characters of the gorge are in general remarkably uniform from
end toend. Its width does not vary greatly; its course is flexed but
slightly ; its walls exhibit the same alternation of soft and hard rocks.
But there is one exceptional point. Midway, its course is abruptly
bent at right angles. On the outside of the angle there is an enlarge-
ment of the gorge, and this enlargement contains a deep pool, called
the Whirlpool. At this point, and on this side only, the material of
the wall has an exceptional character. At every other point there is
an alternation of shales, sandstones, and limestones, capped above by
an unequal deposit of drift. At this point limestones, sandstones, and
shales disappear, and the whole wall is made of drift. Here is a place
where the strata that floor the plateau are discontinuous, and must
have been discontinuous before the last occupation of the region of the
glacier, for the gap is filled by glacial drift.

Another physiographic feature was joined to this by Lyell and Hall.
They observed that the cliff limiting the plateau has, in general, a very
straight course, with few indentations. But at the town of St. David’s,
a few miles west of Queenston. a wide flaring gap occurs. This gap
is partly filled by drift, and although the glacial nature of the drift
was not then understood, it was clearly perceived hy those geologists
that the drift-filled break marked the position of a line of erosion
established before the period of the drift. Putting together the two
anomalies, they said that the drift-filled gap at the Whirlpool belonged
to the same line of ancient erosion with the drift-filled gap at St.
David’s.* Their conclusion has been generally accepted by subsequent
investigators, but the interpretation of the phenomena was carried °

little further until the subject was studied by Dr. Julius Pohlman.*
He pointed out that the upper course of the ancient gorge could not
have lain outside the modern gorge. If the course of one gorge lay
athwart the course of the other, we should have two breaks in the con-
tinuity of the strata, instead of the single one at the Whirlpool. The
upper part of the ancient gorge necessarily coincides with a part of the
modern gorge; and so when the cataract, in the progressive excava-
tion of the canon, reached a point at the Whirlpool where it had no
firm rock to erode, it had only to clear out the incoherent earth and
bowlders of glacial drift. To whatever distance the gorge of the
earlier stream extended, the modern river found its laborious task per-
formed in advance.

Let us put together what we have learned of the Niagara history.
The river began its existence during the final retreat of the great ice
sheet, or, in other words, during the series of events that closed the age
of the ice in North America. If we consider as a geologic period the
entire time that has elapsed since the beginning of the age of ice, then
the history of the Niagara River covers only a portion of that period.
In the judgment of most students of glacial geology, and, I may add,
in my own judgment, it covers only a small portion of that period.

During the course of its history the length of the river has suffered
some variation by reason of the sucessive fall and rise of the level of
Lake Ontario. It was at first a few miles shorter than now; then it
became suddenly a few miles longer, and its present length was gradu-
ally acquired.

With the change in the position of its mouth there went a change in
the height of its mouth; and the rate at which it eroded its channel
was affected thereby. The influence on the rate of erosion was felt
chiefly along the lower course of the river, between Lewiston and Fort
Niagara.

The volume of the river has likewise been inconstant. In early days,
when the lakes levied a large tribute on the melting glacier, the
Niagara may have been a larger river than now; but there was a time
when the discharge from the upper lakes avoided the route by Lake
Erie, and then the Niagara was a relatively small streain. .

The great life work of the river has been the digging of the gorge
through which it runs from the cataract to Lewiston. The beginning
of its life was the beginning of that task. The length of the gorge isin
some sense a measure of the river’s age. In the main the material dug
has been hard limestone and sandstone, interbedded with a coherent
though softer shale; but for a part of the distance the material was
incoherent drift. ,

The geologic age of the earth—the time during which its surface has
been somewhat as now, divided into land and ocean, subject to endless
waste on the land and to endless accumulation of sediment in the

ocean, green with verdure and nourishing the varied forms of animal
life—this time is of immense duration. Even the units into which
geologists divide it, the periods and epochs of their chronology are
themselves of vast duration. Human history is relatively so short,
and its units of centuries and years are so exceedingly brief, that the
two orders of time are hardly commensurate. Over and over again
the attempt has been made to link together the two chronologies, to
obtain for the geologic units some satisfactory expression in the units
of human history. It can not in fairness be said that all these attempts
have failed, for some of them are novel and untested; but, however
successful or unsuccessful they may have been, the interest in the
subject remains, and no discussion of the history of the Niagara River
would be complete without some allusion to its value as a geologic
chronometer. It is true we know but little of the ratio the river epoch
bears to the extent of the glacial period, or to any longer geologic unit;
but yet were we able to determine, even approximately, the time con-
sumed by the river in cutting its gorge, we should render less hazy and
vague our conception of the order of magnitude of the units of the
earth’s geologic history. The problem has been attacked by numerous
writers, and the resulting estimates have ranged from three or four
thousand years to three or four million years.

- The method of reaching a time estimate has been, first, to estimate
the present rate of recession—the rate at which the cataract is increas-
ing the length of the gorge; second, to compute, with the aid of this
estimate and the known length of the gorge, the time necessary for the
entire excavation; and, third, some writers have moditied their result
by giving consideration to various conditions affecting the rate of
erosion during earlier stages of the excavation. The enormous range
of the resulting estimates of time has depended chiefly upon the im-
perfection of data with reference to the present rate of recession of the
falls. It is but a few years since measnrement of the rate of recession
was substituted for bald guessing.

- This measurement consists in making surveys and maps of the falls
at different times, so that the amount of change in the interval between
surveys can be ascertained by comparison of the maps. In 1842 Pro-
fessor Hall made a survey of the outlines of the falls, and he published,
for the use of future investigators, not only the map resulting from the
survey, but also the bearings taken with the surveying instrument in
determining the principal points of the map.* He likewise left upon
the ground a number of well-marked monuments to which future sur-
veys could be referred. Thirty-three years later a second survey was
made by the United States Army Engineers, and they added still
further to the series of bench marks available for future reference.
Three years ago my colleage, Mr. R. 8S. Woodward, executed a third
survey.t

250 THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.

Plate vit exhibits the outline of the crest of the falls, together with

the brink of the cliff in the vicinity of the falls, as determined by Mr.
Woodward in 1886, and also shows a part of the same outline as deter-
mined by Professor Hall 44 years earlier.* If both were precise, the
area included between the two lines would exactly represent the reces-
sion of the Horseshoe and American falls in 44 years, and the retreat
of the cliff face at Goat Island in the same time. I regret to say that
there is internal evidence pointing to some defect in one or both sur-
veys, for there are some points at which the Woodward outline projects
farther towards the gorge than the Hall outline, and yet we can not
believe that any additions have been made to the face of the cliff.
- Nevertheless, a critical study, not merely of these bare lines on the
chart, but also of the fuller data in the surveyors’ notes, leads to the
belief that the rate of recession in the central part of the Horseshoe
Fall is approximately determined, and that it is somewhere between 4
and 6 feet per annum. The amount fallen away at the sides of the
Horseshoe is not well determined, but this is of less importance, for
such falling away affects the width of the gorge rather than its length,
and it is the length with which we are concerned.

The surveys likewise fail to afford any valuable estimate of the rate
of retreat of the American Fall, merely telling us that its rate is far less
than that ot the Horseshoe—a result that might be reached independ-
ently by going back in imagination to the time when the two falls were
together at the foot of Goat Island, and considering how much greater
is the distance through which the Horseshoe Fall has since retreated.
The rate of retreat of the central portion of the Horseshoe is the rate
at which the gorge grows longer.

Now if we were to divide the entire length of the gorge by the space
through which the Horseshoe Fall retreats in a year, we might regard
the resulting quotient as expressing the number of years that the falls
have been occupied with their work. This is precisely the procedure
by which the majority of time estimates have been deduced, but in my
judgment it is not defensible. It implies that the rate of retrogression
has been uniform, or, more precisely, that the present rate of retrogres-
sion does not differ from the average rate, and this implication is open
to serious question. I conceive that future progress in the discussion
of the time problem will consist chiefly in determining in what ways
the conditions or circumstances that affect the rate of retrogression
have varied in past time. In order to discuss intelligently these condi-
tions, it is necessary to understand just what is the process by which
the river increases the length of its gorge.

There can be no question that the cataract is the efficient engine,
but what kind of an engine is it? What is the principle on which it
works ?

PAS po THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.

It has already been stated that the rocks at the falls lie in level
layers. The order of succession of the layers has much to do with the
nature of the cataract’s work. Above all is a loose sheet of drift, but
this yields so readily to the wash of the water that we need pay no
attention to it at present. Under that is a bed of strong limestone.
This is called the Niagara limestone, and in thickness is 80 feet.
Beneath it is a shale, called the Niagara shale, with a thickness of 50
feet; and then for 35 feet there is an alternation of limestone, shale,
and sandstone, known collectively as the Clinton group. This reaches
down very nearly to the water’s edge. Beneath it and extending down-
ward for several hundred feet is a great bed of soft, sandy shale, inter-
rupted, so far as we know, by a single hard layer, a sandstone ledge,
varying in thickness from 10 to 20 feet. These are the Medina shales
and the Medina sandstone. The profile in the figure indicates that the
hard layers project as shelves or steps, and that the softer layers are
eaten back. I have been led so to draw them by considerations of anal-
ogy only, for underneath the center of the great cataract no observations
have been made. We only know that the river leaps from the upper
surface of the Niagara limestone and strikes upon the water of the pool.
The indicated depth of the pool, too, isa mere surmise, for in that com-
motion of waters direct observation is out of the question. But where
the United States Engineers were able to lower their plummet, a halfa
mile away, a depth was discovered of nearly 200 feet, and I have
assumed that the cataract is scouring as deeply now as it scoured at
the time when that part of the gorge was dug.

It is a matter of direct observation that from time to time large
blocks of the upper limestone fall away into the pool, and there seems
no escape from the inference that this occurs because the erosion of the
shale beneath deprives the limestone of its support. Just how the shale
is eroded and what is the part played by the harder layers beneath
are questions in regard to which we are much in doubt. In the Cave
of the Winds, where one can pass beneath and behind one of the thin-
ner segments of the divided fall, the air is filled with spray and heavier
masses of water that perpetually dash against the shale, and though
their force in that place does not seem to be violent, it is possible that
their continual beating is the action that removes the shaly rock. The
shale is of the variety known as caleareous, and as its calcareous ele-
ment is soluble, it may be that solution plays its part in the work of
undermining. What goes on beneath the water of the pool must be
essentially different. The Niagara River carries no sediment, and there-
fore can not scour its channel in the manner of most rivers, but the
fragments of the limestone bed that fall into the pool must be moved
by the plunging water, else they would accumulate and impede its
work, and being moved, we can understand that they become power-
ful agents of excavation. Water plunging into a pool acquires a gyra-
tory motion, and, carrying detritus about with it, sometimes bores deep

holes, even in rocks that are hard. These holes are called technically
‘‘pot-holes,” and there is much to commend the suggestion that the
excavation within the pool is essentially pot-hole work.*

The process which I have described is that which takes place in the
central part of the Horseshoe Fall, where the greatest body of water
is precipitated. At the margin of the Horseshoe, and also at the
American Fall, in which places the body of falling water is much less,
the process is different. There is there no pot-hole action and no pool.
The fallen blocks of limestone form a low talus at the foot of the cliff,
and upon them the force of the descending water is broken and spent.
Such of you as have made the excursion through the Cave of the Winds
will recall that though for a few steps you traveled upon an undisturbed
rock stratum, one of the layers of the Clinton group, the greater part
of the journey lay across large fallen blocks of limestone, irregularly
heaped. Where, then, the volume of falling water is relatively small,
the great bed of shale below the Clinton ledges plays no part, and the
rate at which the limestone breaks away is determined purely by the
rate of erosion of the shale bed lying just beneath it.

The difference between the two processes is of great importance in
the present connection, because the two rates of erosion are very
different.

I am fully aware that this sketch of the cataract’s work is not a satis-
factory explanation of the mode of recession, but it yet serves a present
purpose, for it renders it possible to point out that the rate of recession
is affected by certain factors which may have varied during the early
history of the river. We see that the process of recession is concerned
with a heavy bed of hard rock above, with beds of softer rock beneath,
with the force of falling water, and possibly, also, with the solvent
power of the water.

Concerning each of these factors a number of pertinent questions may
be asked, questions that should certainly be considered, whether they
are answered or not, before any solution of the time problem is regarded
as satisfactory. To illustrate their pertinence, a few will be propounded.

Question 1, Does the limestone vary in constitution in different parts
of the gorge? If its texture or its system of cracks and joints varies,
the process of recession may vary in consequence.

Question 2. How does the limestone bed vary in thickness in differ-
ent parts of the gorge? This question is easily answered, for at all
points it is well exposed for measurement.

Question 3. How is the thickness of the limestone related to the rate
of recession? ‘This is more difficult. The débris froma very thick bed
of limestone would oppose great resistance to the cataract and check
its work. The débris from a very thin bed would afford small and in-
efficient pestles for pot-hole action, and might lead to a slow rate of

*T am indebted for this suggestion to Mr, WJ McGee,
THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER. 255

recession. If the thickness now seen at the cataract were slightly
increased or slightly diminished, it is not at once apparent how the rate
of recession would be affected, and yet there might be an important dif-
erence.

We have seen that the pre-glacial stream whose channel is betrayed
at the Whirlpool removed the Niagara limestone through a portion of
the gorge, and

Question 4 asks: Through what portion of the gorge was the Niagara
limestone absent when the Niagara River began its work ?

Question 5. Does the rock section beneath the limestone—the shale
series with its imbedded harder layers—does this vary in different parts
of the gorge?

Question 6. Through what distance were the several members of the
underlying rock series removed by the action of the pre-glacial stream ?

Coming now to consider the force of the falling water, a little con-
sideration serves to show that the force depends on at least three things:
The height through which the water falls, the degree of concentration
of the stream, and the volume of the river.

The height of the fall is the vertical distance from its crest to the sur-
face of the pool below.

Question 7 asks: How has the height of the crest of the fall varied
during the history of recession ?

Question 8. How has the height of the base of the fall varied? And
this involves a subsidiary question—to what extent has the excavated
gorge, as left by the retreating cataract, been re-filled, either by the
falling in of fragments from the cliffs or by contributions of débris
brought by the current ?

Question 9. What has been the form of the channel at the crest of
the fall from point to point during the recession? Wherever the chan-
has been broad, and the water of uniform depth from side to side, the
force of the falling water has been applied disadvantageously ; wher-
ever the channel has been narrow, or has been much deeper in some
parts than in others, the force of the water has been applied advanta-
geously.

There are many ways in which it is possible that the volume of the
river was made to differ at early dates from its present volume. Dur-
ing the presence of the ice there was a different climate, and there
were different drainage systems.

Question 10. During the early history of the river was the annual
rainfall on which its water supply depended greater or less than now ?

(Question 11. Was the evaporation from the basin at that time greater
or less than now ? It is believed that at the present time the Niagara
River receives less than half the water that falls upon its basin in rain
and snow, the remainder being returned to the air by evaporation from
the lakes, from the surface of the land, and from vegetation.

Question 12. Was the water supply increased by ablation? There
256 THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER.

may have been times when the overlapping edge of the glacier dis-
charged to the Laurentian Basin large bodies of water furnished by the
melting of ice that had congealed from the clouds of regions far away.

Question 13. Was the drainage area of the river at any time increased
through the agency of ice barriers? Just as the Winnipeg basin was
made to sendits water to the Mississippi, So we can imagine that regions
north of the Great Lakes and now tributary to Hudson’s Bay had their
discharge temporarily turned to Lake Superior and Lake Huron.

On the other hand, we have seen that the discharge of the whole dis-
trict of the upper lakes was for a time turned away from the Niagara
River. Therefore we ask:

Question 14. To what extent and for what periods was the volume
of the river diminished through the diversion of the discharge of the
upper lakes ?

Assuming all these questions to be answered one by one, and the
variations of different sorts determined, it is still necessary to learn the
relations of those variations to each other, and so we ask:

Question 15. How have the variations of rock section, the variations
of cataract height, the variations of form of channel, and the variations
of volume been related to one another in point of time? What have
been their actual combinations ?

Question 16. How have the various temporary combinations of factors
affected the process of retreat and the rate of recession ?

The tale of questions is not exhausted, but no more are needed if
only it has been shown that the subject is not in reality simple, as
many have assumed, but highly complex. Some of the questions are,
indeed, easily answered. It may be possible to show that others are
of small moment. It may even be that careful study of the local features
will enable the investigator to infer the process of cataract work at
each point from the existing condition of the gorge, and thus relieve
him from the necessity of considering such remote questions as the
nature of glacial climate and the history of glacial retreat. But after
all paring and pruning, what remains of the problem will be no baga-
telle. It is not to be solved by a few figures on a slate, nor yet by the
writing of many essays. It is not to be solved by the cunning discussion
of our scant, yet too puzzling, knowledge—smoothing away inconvenient
doubts with convenient assumptions and cancelling out, as though
compensatory, terms of unknown value that happen to stand on oppo-
site sides of the equation. It is a problem of nature, and, like other
natural problems, demands the patient gathering of many facts, of
facts of many kinds, of categories of facts suggested by the tentative
theories of to-day, and of new categories of facts to be suggested by
new theories.

I have said our problem is but the stepping stone to another problem,
the discovery of common units tor earth history and human history.
The Niagara bridges the chasm in another way, or, more strictly, in
THE HISTORY OF THE NIAGARA RIVER. 258

another sense, for the term of its life belongs to both histories. The
river sprang from a great geologic revolution, the banishment of the
dynasty of cold, and so its lifetime is a geologic epoch; but from first
to last man has been the witness of its toil, aud so its history is inter-
woven with the history of man. The human comrade of the river’s
youth was not, alas, a reporter with a notebook, else our present labor
would be light. He has even told us little of himself. We only know
that on a gravelly beach of Lake Iroquois, now the Ridge road, he
rudely gathered stones to make a hearth, and built a fire; and the next
storm breakers, forcing back the beach, buried and thus preserved, to
gratify yet whet our curiosity, hearth, ashes, and charred sticks.*

In these Darwinian days we can not deem primeval the man pos-
sessed of the Promethean art of fire, and so his presence on the scene
adds zest to the pursuit of the Niagara problem. Whatever the an-
tiquity of the great cataract may be found to be, the antiquity of man
is greater.

THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL *

By Sir R. LAMBERT PLAYFAIR.

When the unexpected honor was proposed to me of presiding over
your deliberations, I felt some embarrassment as to the subject of my
address. Geography as a science, and the necessity of encouraging a
more systematic study of it, had been treated in an exhaustive manner
during previous meetings. - - - In my perplexity I applied for the
advice of one of the most experienced geographers of our Society,
whose reply brought comfort to my mind. He reminded me that it was
generally the custom for presidents of sections to select subjects with
which they were best acquainted, and added: ‘ What more instructive
and captivating subject could be wished than the Mediterranean, physi-
cal and historical ?”

For nearly a quarter of a century I have held an official position in
Algeria, and it has been my constant delight to make myself acquainted
with the islands and shores of the Mediterranean, in the hope of being
able to facilitate the travels of my countrymen in that beautiful part
of the world.

Ican not pretend to throw much new light on the subject, and I have
written so often about it already that what I have to say may strike
you as a twice-told tale; nevertheless, if you will permit me to descend
from the elevated platform occupied by more learned predecessors, I
should like to speak to you in a familiar manner of this ‘¢ great sea,” as
it is called in sacred Scripture, the Mare internum of the ancients, ‘our
sea,” Mare nostrum of Pomponius Mela.

Its shores include about 3,000,000 square miles of the richest country
on the earth’s surface, enjoying a climate where the extremes of tem-
perature are unknown, and with every variety of scenery, but chiefly
consisting of mountains and elevated plateaux. It is a well-defined
region of many parts, all intimately connected with each other by their
geographical character, their geological formation, their flora, fauna,
and the physiognomy of the people who inhabit them. ‘To this general

statement there are two exceptions ;—namely, Palestine, which belongs
rather to the tropical countries lying to the east of it, and so may be
dismissed from our subject; and the Sahara, which stretches to the
south of the Atlantic region—or region of the Atlas—but approaches
the sea at the Syrtis, and again to the eastward of the Cyrenaica, and
in which Egypt is merely a long oasis on either side of the Nile.

The Mediterranean region is the emblem of fertility and the cradle
of civilization, while the Sahara—Heypt, of course, excepted—is the
traditional panther’s skin of sand, dotted here and there with oases,
but always representing sterility and barbarism. The sea is in no
sense, save a political one, the limit between them; it is a mere gulf,
which, now bridged by steam, rather unites than separates the two
shores. Civilization never could have existed if this inland sea had
not formed the junction between the three surrounding continents,
rendering the coasts of each easily accessible, whilst modifying the
climate of its shores.

The Atlas range is a mere continuation of the south of Europe. It
is a long strip of mountain land, about 200 miles broad, covered with
splendid forests, fertile valleys, and in some places arid steppes, stretch-
ing eastward from the ocean to which it bas given its name. The
highest point is Morocco, forming a pendant to the Sierra Nevada of
Spain; thence it runs, gradually decreasing in height, through Algeria
and Tunisia, it becomes interrupted in Tripoli, and it ends in the beauti-
ful green hills of the Cyrenaica, which must not be confounded with
the oases of the Sahara, but is an island detached from the eastern
spurs of the Atlas, in the ocean of the desert.

In the eastern part the flora and fauna do not essentially differ
from those of Italy; in the west they resemble those of Spain; one of
the noblest of the Atlantic conifers, the Abies pinsapo, is found also in
the Iberian peninsula and nowhere else in the world, and the valuable
alfa grass or esparto (Stipa tenacissima), from which a great part of our
paper is made, forms one of the principal articles of export from Spain,
Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli. On both sides of the
sea the former plant is found on the highest and most inaccessible
mountains, amongst snows which last during the greater part of the
year, and the latter from the sea level to an altitude of 5,000 feet, but
in places where the heat and drought would kill any other plant, and
in undulating land where water can not lodge.

Of the three thousand plants found in Algeria, by far the greater
number are natives of southern EKurope, and less than one hundred are
peculiar to the Sahara. The macchie or maquis of Algeria in no way
differs from that of Corsica, Sardinia, and other places; it consists of
lentisk, arbutus, myrtle. cistus, tree-heath, and other Mediterranean
shrubs. If we take the commonest plant found on the southern shores
of the Mediterranean, the dwarf palm (Chamerops humilis), we see at
once how intimately connected is the whole Mediterranean region, with

THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 261

the exception of the localities I have before indicated This palm still
grows spontaneously in the south of Spain, and in some parts of Prov-
ence, in Corsica, Sardinia, and the Tuscan Archipelago, in Calabria
and the lonian Islands, on the continent of Greece, and in several of
the islands in the Levant, and it has only disappeared from other
countries as the land has been brought under regular cultivation. On
the other hand, it occurs neither in Palestine, Egypt, nor in the Sahara.

The presence of European birds may not prove much, but there are
mammalia, reptiles, fish, and insects common to both sides of the
Mediterranean. Some of the larger animals, such as the lion, panther,
jackal, ete., have disappeared before the march of civilization in the
one continent, but have lingered, owing to Mohammedan barbarism, in
the other. There is abundant evidence of the former existence of these
and of the other large mammals which now characterize tropical Africa
in France, Germany, and Greece. Itis probable that they only migrated
to their present babitat after the upheaval of the great sea which, in
Hocene times, stretched from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, making
southern Africa an island continent like Australia. The original fauna
of Africa, of which the lemur is the distinctive type, is still preserved
in Madagascar, which then formed part of it.

The fish fauna is naturally the most conclusive evidence as to the
true line of separation between Europe and Africa. We find the trout
in the Atlantic region and in all the snow-fed rivers falling into the
Mediterranean; in Spain, Italy, Dalmatia; it occurs in Mount Olym-
pus, in rivers of Asia Minor, and even in the Lebanon, but nowhere in
Palestine south of that range, in Egypt, or in the Sahara. This fresh-
water salmonoid is not exactly the same in all these localities, but is
subject to considerable variation, sometimes amounting to specifie dis-
tinction. Nevertheless it is a European type found in the Atlas, and
it is not till we advance into the Sahara, at Tuggurt, that we come to
a purely African form in the Chromide, which have a wide geographical
distribution, being found everywhere between that place, the Nile, and
Mozambique.

The presence of newts, tailed batrachians, in every country around
the Mediterranean, except again in Palestine, Egypt, and the Sahara,
is another example of the continuity of the Mediterranean fauna, even
though the species are not the same throughout.

The Sahara is an immense zone of desert which commences on the
Shores of the Atlantic Ocean, between the Canaries and Cape de
Verde, and traverses the whole of north Africa, Arabia, and Persia, as
far as Central Asia. The Mediterranean portion of it may be said
roughly to extend between the fifteenth and thirtieth degrees of north
latitude.

This was popularly supposed to have been a vast inland sea in very
recent times, but the theory was supported by geological facts wrongly
262 §$THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

interpreted. It has been abundantly proved by the researches of travel-
lers and geologists that such a sea was neither the cause nor the ori-
gin of the Libyan Desert.

’  Rainless and sterile regions of this nature are not peculiar to north
Africa, but occur in two belts which go round the world in either hem-
isphere at about similar distances north and south of the equater.
These correspond in locality to the great inland drainage areas from
which no water can be discharged into the ocean, and which occupy
about one-fifth of the total land surface of the globe.

The African Sahara is by no means a uniform plain, but forms sev-
eral distinct basins containing a considerable extent of what may
almost be called mountain land. The Hoggar Mountains, in the center
of the Sahara, are 7,000 feet high, and are covered during three months
with snow. The general average may be taken at 1,500. The physi-
cal character of the region is very varied; in some places, such as at
Tiout, Moghrar, Touat, and other oases in or bordering on Morocco,
there are well watered valleys, with fine scenery and almost European
vegetation, where the fruits of the north flourish side by side with the
palm tree. In others there are rivers like the Oued Guir, an affluent of
the Niger, which the French soldiers, who saw it in 1870, compare to
the Loire. Again, as in the bed of the Oued Rir, there is a subterra-
nean river, which gives a sufficient supply of water to make a chain of
rich and well-peopled oases equal in fertility to some of the finest por-
tions of Algeria. The greater part of the Sahara, however, is hard and
undulating, cut up by dry water courses, such as the Igharghar, which
descends to the Chott Melghigh, and almost entirely without animal or
vegetable life.

About one-sixth of its extent consists of dunes of moving sand, a
rast accumulation of detritus washed down from more northern and
southern regions—perhaps during the glacial epoch—but with no indi-
cation of marine formation. These are difficult and even dangerous to
traverse; but they are not entirely destitute of vegetation. Water is
found at rare but well-known intervals, and there is an abundance of
salsolaceous plants which serve as food for the camel. This sand is
largely produced by wind action on the underlying rocks, and is not
sterile in itself; it is only the want of water which makes it so.
Wherever water does exist or artesian wells are sunk oases of great
fertility never fail to follow.

Some parts of the Sahara are below the level of the sea, and here are
formed what are called chotts or sebkhas, open depressions without out-
lets, inundated by torrents from the southern slopes of the Atlas in
winter, and covered with a saline efflorescence in summer. This salt by
no means proves the former existence of an inland sea; it is produced
by the concentration of the natural salts, which exist in every variety
of soil, washed down by winter rains, with which the unevaporated res-
idue of water becomes saturated.
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 263

Sometimes the drainage, instead of flooding open spaces and forming
chotts, finds its way through the permeable sand till it meets imper-
meable strata below it, thus forming vast subterranean reservoirs where
the artesian sound daily works as great miracles as did Moses’s rod of
yore at Meribah. I have seen a column of water thrown up into the
air equal to 1,300 cubic meters per diem, a quantity sufficient to redeem
1,800 acres of land from sterility and to irrigate 60,000 palm trees.
This seems to be the true solution of the problem of an inland sea, a
sea of verdure and fertility caused by the multiplication of artesian
wells, which never fail to bring riches and prosperity in their train.

The climate of the Sahara is quite different from that of what I have
called the Mediterranean region, where periodical rains divide the year
into two seasons. Here, in many places, years elapse without a single
shower; there is no refreshing dew at night, and the winds are robbed
of their moisture by the immense continental extents over which they
blow. There can be no doubt that it is to these meteorological and
not to geological causes that the Sahara owes its existence. Reclus
divides the Mediterranean into two basins, which, in memory of their
history, he calls the Pheenician and the Carthaginian, or the Greek and
Roman Seas, more generally known to us as the Eastern and Western
Basins, separated by the island of Sicily.

If we examine the submarine map of the Mediterranean we see that
it must at one time have consisted of two inclosed or inland basins,
like the Dead Sea. The western one is separated from the Atlantic by
the Straits of Gibraltar, a shallow ridge, the deepest part of which is
at its eastern extremity, averaging about 300 fathoms, while on the
west, bounded by a line from Cape Spartel to Trafalgar, it varies from
50 to 200 fathoms. Fifty miles to the west of the straits the bottom
suddenly sinks down to the depths of the Atlantic, while to the east
it descends to the general level of the Mediterranean, from 1,000 to
2,000 fathoms.

The Western is separated from the Eastern Basin by the isthmus
which extends between Cape Bon, in Tunisia, and Sicily, known as the
“Adventure Bank,” on which there is not more than from 30 to 250
fathoms. The depth between Italy and Sicily is insignificant, and
Malta is a continuation of the latter, being only separated from it by a
shallow patch of from 50 to 100 fathoms, while to the east and west of
this bank the depth of the sea is very great. These shallows cut off
the two basins from all but superficial communication.

The configuration of the bottom shows that the whole of this strait
was at one time continuous land, affording free communication for land
animals between Africa and Europe. The paleontological evidence of
this is quite conclusive. In the caves and fissures of Malta, amongst
river detritus, are found three species of fossil elephants, a hippopota-
mus, a gigantic dormouse, and other animais which could never have
lived in so small an island. In Sicily, remains of the existing elephant
264 THE MEDITERRANEAN. PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

have been found, as well as the Hlephas antiquus, and two species of
hippopotamus, while nearly all these and many other animals of African
type have been found in the Pliocene deposits and caverns of the
Atlantic region.

The rapidity with which such a transformation might have occurred
can be judged by the well-known instance of Graham’s Shoal, between
Sicily and the island of Pantellaria; this, owing to volcanic agency,
actually rose above the water in 1832, and for a few weeks had an area
of 3,240 feet in circumference and a Neleine of 107 feet.

The submersion of this isthmus no doubt occurred when the waters
of the Atlantic were introduced through the Straits of Gibraitar. The
rainfall over the entire area of the Mediterranean is certainly not more
than 30 inches, while the evaporation is at least twice as great; there-
fore, were the straits to be once more closed and were there no other
agency for making good this deficiency, the level of the Mediterranean
would sink again till its basin became restricted to an area no larger
than might be necessary to equalize the amount of evaporation and
precipitation. Thus not only would the strait between Sicily and Africa
be again laid dry, but the Adriatic and gean Seas also, and a great
part of the Eastern Basin.

The entire area of the Mediterranean and Black Seas has been esti-
mated at upwards of a million square miles, and the volume of the
rivers which are discharged into them at 226 cubic miles. All this and
much more is evaporated annually. There are two constant currents
passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, super-imposed on each other;
the upper and most copious one flows in from the Atlantic at a rate of
nearly 3 miles an hour, or 140,000 cubie metres per second, and supplies
the difference between the rainfall and evaporation, while the under
current of warmer water, which has undergone concentration by evapora-
tion, is continually flowing out at about half the above rate of move-
ment, getting rid of the excess of salinity; even thus, however, leaving
the Mediterranean salter than any other part of the ocean except the
Red Sea.

A similar phenomenon occurs at the eastern end, where the fresher
water of the Black Sea flows as a surface current through the Darda-
nelles, and the salter water of the Mediterranean pours in below it.

The general temperature of the Mediterranean from a depth of 50
fathoms down to the bottom is almost constantly 56° F., whatever may
be its surface rise of temperature. This is a great contrast to that of
the Atlantic, which at a similar depth is at least 3° colder, and which
at 1,000 fathoms sinks to 40° F.

This fact was of the greatest utility to Dr. Carpenter in connection
with his investigations regarding currents through the straits, enabling
him to distinguish with precision between Atlantic and Mediterranean
water.

For all practical purposes the Mediterranean may be accepted as being,
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 265

what it is popularly supposed to be, a tideless sea; but it is not so in
reality. In many places there is a distinct rise and fall, though this is
more frequently due to winds and currents than to lunar attraction. At
Venice there is a rise of from 1 to 2 feet in spring tides, according to the
prevalence of winds up or down the Adriatic; but in that sea itself the
tides are so weak that they can hardly be recognized, except during the
prevalence of the Bora, our old friend Boreas, which generally raises a
surcharge along the coast of Italy. In many straits and narrow aruis of
the sea there is a periodical flux and reflux; but the only place where
tidal influence, properly so called, is unmistakably observed is in the
Lesser Syrtis, or Gulf of Gabes. There the tide runs at the rate of 2
or 3 knots an hour, and the rise and fall varies from 3 to 8 feet. It is
most marked and regular at Djerba, the Homeric island of the Lotophagi.
One must be careful in landing there in a boat, so as not to be left high
and dry a mile or two from the shore. Perhaps the companions of
Ulysses were caught by the receding tide, and it was not only a banquet
of dates, the “‘ honey-sweet fruit of the Lotus,” or the potent wine which
is made from it, which made them “forgetful of their homeward way.”

The Gulf of Gabes naturally calls to mind the proposals which were
made a few years ago for inundating the Sahara, and so restoring to the
Atlantic region the insular condition which it is alleged to have had in
pre-historic times. I will not allude to the English project for introduc-
ing the waters of the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. That does
not belong to my subject. The French scheme advocated by Com-
mandant Roudaire, and supported by M. de Lesseps, was quite as vis-
ionary and impracticable.

To the south of Algeria and Tunis there exists a great depression,
stretching westward from the Gulf of Gabes to a distance of about 235
miles, in which are several chotts or salt lakes, sometimes only marshes,
and in many places covered with a saline crust strong enough to bear the
passage of camels. Commandant Roudaire proposed to cut through the
isthmuses which separated the various chotts, and so prepare their basins
to receive the waters of the Mediterranean. This done, he intended to
introduce the sea by a canal, which should have a depth of 1 metre
below low-water level.

This scheme was based on the assumption that the basin of the chotts
has been an inland sea within historic times; that, little by little, owing
to the difference between the quantity of water which entered and the
amount of evaporation and absorption, this interior sea had disappeared,
leaving the chotts as an evidence of the former condition of things; that,
in fact, this was none other than the celebrated Lake Triton, the posi-
tion of which has always been a puzzle to geographers.

This theory however is untenable. The isthmus of Gabes is not a
mere sand bank. There is a band of rock between the sea and the basin
of the chotts, through which the former never could have penetrated in
modern times. It is much more probable that Lake Triton was the
266 THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

large bight between the island of Djerba and the mainland, on the shores
of which are the ruins of the ancient city of Meninx, which, to judge by
the abundance of Greek marble found there, must have carried on an
important commerce with the Levant.

The scheme has now been entirely abandoned. Nothing but the mania
for cutting through isthmuses all over the world which followed the
brilliant success achieved at Suez can explain its having been started
at all. Of course, no mere mechanical operation is impossible in these
days; but the mind refuses to rea‘ize the possibility of vessels cireulat-
ing in a region which produces nothing, or that so small a sheet of water
in the immensity of the Sahara could have any appreciable effect in
modifying the climate of its shores.

The eastern basin is much more indented and cut up into separate
seas than the westernone. It was therefore better adapted for the com-
mencement of commerce and navigation. Its high mountains were land-
marks for the unpracticed sailor, and its numerous islands and harbors
afforded shelter for his frail bark, and so facilitated communication be-
tween one point and another.

The advance of civilization naturally took place along the axis of
this sea, Phoenicia, Greece, and Italy being successively the great nur-
series of human knowledge and progress. Phoenicia had the glory of
opening out the path of ancient commerce, for its position in the Levant
gave it a natural command of the Mediterranean, and its people sought
the profits of trade from every nation which had a seaboard on the
three continents washed by this sea. Phoenicia was already a nation
before the Jews entered the Promised Land; and when they did so, they
carried on inland traffic as middlemen to the Phoenicians. Many of
the commercial centers on the shores of the Mediterranean were founded
before Greece and Rome acquired importance in history. Homer refers
to them as daring traders nearly a thousand years before the Christian
era.

For many centuries the commerce of the world was limited to the
Mediterranean, and when it extended in the direction of the East it
was the merchants of the Adriatic, of Genoa, and of Pisa who brought
the merchandise of India, at an enormous cost, to the Mediterranean
by land, and who monopolized the carrying trade by sea. It was thus
that the elephant trade of India, the caravan traffie through Babylon
and Palmyra, as well as the Arab kajilehs, became united with the
Occidental commerce of the Mediterranean.

As civilization and commerce extended westward, mariners began to
overcome their dread of the vast solitudes of the ocean beyond the Pil-
lars of Hercules, and the discovery of America by Columbus and the
circum-navigation of Africa by the Portuguese changed entirely the cur-
rent of trade as well as increased its magnitude, and so relegated the
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 267

Mediterranean, which had hitherto been the central sea of human inter-
course, to a position of secondary importance.

Time will not permit me to enter into further details regarding the
physical geography of this region, and its history is a subject so vast
that a few episodes of it are all that I can possibly attempt. It is in-
timately connected with that of every other country in the world, and
here were successively evolved all the great dramas of the past and
some of the most important events of less distant date.

As I have already said, long before the rise of Greece and Rome its
shores and islands were the seat of an advanced civilization. Phoenicia
had sent out her pacific colonies to the remotest parts, and not iusig-
nificant vestiges of their handicraft still exist to excite our wonder and
admiration. We have the megalithic temples of Malta, sacred to the
worship of Baal, the generative god, and Ashtoreth, the conceptive
goddess, of the universe. The three thousand nurhagi of Sardinia,
round towers of admirable masonry, intended probably for defense in
case of sudden attack, and the so-called giant graves, were as great a
mystery to classical authors as they are to us at the present day.
Minorea has its talayots, tumuli somewhat analogous to but of ruder
construction than the nurhagi, more than 200 groups of which exist in
various parts of the island. With these are associated subordinate con-
structions intended for worship, altars composed of two immense
monoliths erected in the form of a T, sacred inclosures and megalithic
habitations. One type of talayot is especially remarkable, of better
masonry than the others, and exactly resembling inverted boats. One
is tempted to believe that the Phenicians had in view the grass hab-
itations or mapalia of the Numidians described by Sallust, and had
endeavored to reproduce them in stone: Oblonga, incurvis lateribus
tecta, quasi navium carine sunt.

For a long time the Pheenicians had no rivals in navigation, but
subsequently the Greeks—especially the Phocians—established colonies
in the western Mediterranean, in Spain, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, and
the south of France, through the means of which they propagated not
only their commerce but their arts, literature, and ideas. They iutro-
duced many valuable plants, such as the olive, thereby modifying pro-
foundly the agriculture of the countries in which they settled. They
have even left traces of their blood, and it is no doubt to this that the
women of Provence owe the classical beauty of their features.

But they were eclipsed by their successors. The empire of Alexander
opened out a road to India, in which, indeed, the Phoenicians had pre-
ceded him, and introduced the produce of the Kast into the Mediter-
ranean; while the Tyrian colony of Carthage became the capital of
another vast empire, which, from its situation midway between the
Levant and the Atlantic Ocean, enabled it to command the Mediter-
ranean traffic.

The Carthaginians at one time ruled over territory extending along
268 THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

the coast from Cyrene to Numidia, besides having a considerable influ-
ence over the interior of the continent, so that the name of Africa,
given to their own dominions, was gradually applied to a whole quarter
of the globe. The ruling passion with the Carthaginians was love of
gain, not patriotism, and their wars were largely fought with mercena-
ries. It was the excellence of her civil constitution which, according
to Aristotle, kept in cohesion for centuries her straggling possessions.
A country feebly patriotic, which intrusts her defense to foreigners,
has the seeds of inevitable decay, which ripened in her struggle with
Rome, despite the warlike genius of Hamilear and the devotion of the
magnanimous Hannibal. The gloomy and cruel religion of Carthage,
with its human sacrifices to Moloch and its worship of Baal under the
name of Melkarth, led to a eriminal code of Draconic severity and
alienated it from surrounding nations. When the struggle with Rome
began, Carthage had no friends. The first Punic war was a contest for
the possession of Sicily, whose prosperity is even now attested by the
splendor of its Hellenic monuments. When Sicily was lost by the
Carthaginians, so also was the dominion of the sea, which hitherto
had been uncontested. The second Punic war resulted in the utter
prostration of Carthage and the loss of all her possessions out of
Africa, and in 201 B. C., when this war was ended, 552 years after
the foundation of the city, Rome was mistress of the world.

The destruction of Carthage after the third Punic war was a heavy
blow to Mediterranean commerce. It was easy for Cato to utter his
stern Delenda est Carthago. Destruction is easy, but construction is
vastly more difficult. Although Augustus in his might built a new
Carthage near the site of the old city, he could never attract again the
trade of the Mediterranean, which had been diverted into other chan-
nels. Roman supremacy was unfavorable to the growth of commerce,
because, though she allowed unrestricted trade throughout her vast
empire and greatly improved internal communications in the subju-
gated countries, Rome itself absorbed the greater part of the weaith
and did not produce any commodities in return for its immense con-
sumption, therefore Mediterranean commerce did not thrive under the
Roman rule. The conquest of Carthage, Greece, Egypt, and the Hast
poured in riches to Rome, and dispensed for a time with the needs of
productive industry, but formed no enduring basis of prosperity.

It is only in relation to the Mediterranean that I can refer to Roman
history; but | must allude to the interesting episode in the life of
Diocletian, who, after an anxious reign of 21 years in the eastern
division of the empire, abdicated at Nicomedia, and retired to his
native province of Hlyria. He spent the rest of his life in rural pleas-
ures and horticulture at Salona, near which he built that splendid pal-
ace within the walls of which subsequently arose the modern city of
Spalato. Nothing more interesting exists on the shores of the Medi-
terranean than this extraordinary edifice, perhaps the largest that
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 269

ever arose at the bidding of a single man; not only vast and beautiful,
but marking one of the most important epochs in the history of archi-
tecture.

Though now obstructed with a mass of narrow, tortuous streets, its
salient features are distinctly visible. The great temple, probably the
mausoleam of the founder, has become the cathedral, and after the
Pantheon at Rome there is no finer specimen of a heathen temple
turned into a Christian church. Strange it is that the tomb of him
whose reign was marked by such unrelenting persecution of the Chris-
tiaus should have been accepted as the model of those baptisteries so
commonly constructed in the following centuries.

Of Diocletian’s Salona, one of the chief cities of the Roman world,
but little now remains save traces of the long, irregular walls. Recent
excavations have brought to light much that is interesting, but all of
the Christian epoch, such as a large basilica which had been used as
a necropolis, and a baptistery, one of those copied from the temple of
Spalato, on the mosaic pavement of which can still be read the text,
Sicut cervus desiderat fontem aquarum ita anima mea ad te Deus.

The final partition of the Roman Empire took place in 365; 40 years
later the barbarians of the North began to invade Italy and the south
of Europe; and in 429, Genseric, at the head of his Vandal hordes,
crossed over into Africa from Andalusia, a province which still bears
their name, devastating the country as far as the Cyrenaica. He sub-
sequently annexed the Balearic Islands, Corsica, and Sardinia; he
ravaged the coasts of Italy and Sicily, and even of Greece and Illyria;
but the most memorable of his exploits was the unresisted sack of
Rome, whence he returned to Africa laden with treasure and bearing
the Empress Kudoxia a captive in his train,

The degenerate emperors of the West were powerless to avenge this
insult; but Byzantium, though at this time sinking to decay, did
make a futile attempt to attack the Vandal monarch in his African
stronghold. It was not, however, till 533, in the reign of Justinian,
when the successors of Genseric had fallen into luxurious habits and
had lost the rough valor of their ancestors, that Belisarius was able to
break their power and take their last king a prisoner to Constantinople.
The Vandal domination in Africa was destroyed, but that of the
Byzantines was never thoroughly consolidated ; it rested not on its
own strength, but on the weakness of its enemies; and it was quite
unable to cope with the next great wave of invasion which swept over
the land, perhaps the most extraordinary event in the world’s history,
save only the introduction of Christianity.

In 647, 27 years after the Hedjira of Mohammed, Abdulla ibn Saad
started from Egypt for the conquest of Africa with an army of 40,000
men.

The expedition had two determining causes—the hope of plunder
and the desire to promulgate the religion of El Islam, The sands and
270 THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL,

scorching heat of the desert, which had nearly proved fatal to the
army of Cato, were no bar to the bardy Arabians and their enduring
camels. The march to Tripoli was a fatiguing one, but it was success-
fully accomplished; the invaders did not exhaust their force in a vain
effort to reduce its fortifications, but swept on over the Syrtic desert
and north to the province of Africa, where, near the splendid city of
Suffetula, a great battle was fought between them and the army of the
Exarch Gregorius, in which the Christians were signally defeated,
their leader killed, and his daughter allotted to Ibn-ez-Zobair, who had
slain her father.

Not only did the victorious Moslems overrun north Africa, but soon
they had powerful fleets at sea, which dominated the entire Mediter- .
ranean, and the emperors of the East had enough to do to protect their
own capital.

Egypt, Syria, Spain, Provence, and the islands of the Mediterranean
successively fell to their arms, and until they were checked at the
Pyrenees by Charles Martel it seemed at one time as if the whole of
southern Europe would have been compelled to submit to the disciples
of the new religion. Violent, implacable, and irresistible at the moment
of conquest, the Arabs were not unjust or hard masters in countries
which submitted to their conditions. Every endeavor was, of course,
made to proselytize, but Christians were allowed to preserve their re-
ligion on payment of a tax,and even Popes were in the habit of entering
into friendly relations with the invaders, The Church of St. Cyprian
and St. Augustine, with its 500 sees, was indeed expunged, but five cen-
turies after the passage of the Mohammedan army from Egypt to the
Atlantic a remnant of it still existed. It was not till the twelfth cen-
tury that the religion and language of Rome became utterly extin-
guished.

The Arabs introduced a high state of civilization into the countries
where they settled; their architecture is the wonder and admiration of
the world at the present day; their irrigational works in Spain have
never been improved upon; they fostered literature and the arts of
peace, and introduced a system of agriculture far superior to what
existed before their arrival.

Commerce, discouraged by the Romans, was highly honored by the
Arabs, and during their rule the Mediterranean recovered the trade
which it possessed in the time of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians ;
it penetrated into the Indian Archipelago and China; it travelled west-
ward to the Niger, and to the east as far as Madagascar, and the great
trade route of the Mediterranean was once more developed.

The powerand prosperity of the Arabs culminated in the ninth century,
when Sicily fell to their arms; it was not, however, very long before
their empire began to be undermined by dissensions ; the temporal and
spiritual authority of the Ommiade Khalifs, which extended from Sind
to Spain and from the Oxus to Yemen, was overthrown by the Abba-
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. 271

sides in the year 132 of the Hedjira, A. D. 750. Seven years later
Spain detached itself from the Abbaside empire; a new caliphate was
established at Cordova, and hereditary monarchies began to spring up
in other Mohammedan countries.

The Carlovingian empire gave an impulse to the maritime power of
the south of Europe, and in the Adriatic the fleets of Venice and Ragusa
monopolized the traffic of the Levant. The merchants of the latter
noble little republic penetrated even to our own shores, and Shake-
speare has made the Argosy or Ragusie a household word in our Jan-
guage.

During the eleventh century the Christian powers were no longer
coutent to resist the Mohammedans; they began to turn their arms
against them. If the latter ravaged some of the fairest parts of Europe,
the Christians began to take brilliant revenge.

The Mohammedans were driven out of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and
the Balearic Islands, but it was not till 1492 that they had finally to
abandon Hurope, after the conquest of Granada by Ferdinand and
Isabella.

Abont the middle of the eleventh century an event took place which
profoundly modified the condition of the Mohammedan world. The
Caliph Mostansir let loose a horde of nomad Arabs, who, starting from
Egypt, spread over the whole of north Africa, carrying destruction and
blood wherever they passed, thus laying the foundation for the subse-
quent state of anarchy which rendered possible the interference of the
Turks.

English commercial intercourse with the Mediterranean was not
unknown even from the time of the Crusades, but it does not appear
to have been carried on by means of our own vessels till the beginning
of the sixteenth century. In 1522 it was so great that Henry VIII
appointed a Cretan merchant, Censio de Balthazari, to be “ master, gov-
ernor, protector, and consul of all and singlar the mercbants and others,
his lieges and subjects, within the port, island, and country of Crete
or Candia.” This is the very first English consul known to history,
but the first of English birth was my own predecessor in office, Master
John Tipton, who, after having acted at Algiers during several years
in an unofficial character, probably elected by the merchants them-
selves to protect their interests, was duly appointed consul by Sir
William Harebone, ambassador at Constantinople, in 1585, and received
just such an exequatur from the Porte as has been issued to every
consul since by the Government of the country in which he resides.

Piracy has always been the scourge of the Mediterranean, but we are
too apt to associate its horrors entirely with the Moors and Turks.
The evil had existed from the earliest ages; even before the Roman
conquest of Dalmatia the Lllyrians were the generai enemies of the
Adriatic. Africa, under the Vandal reign, was a nest of the fiercest
pirates. The Venetian chronicles are full of complaints of the ravages
212 THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

of the Corsairs of Ancona, and there is no other name but piracy for
such acts of the Genoese as the unprovoked pillage of Tripoli by Andrea
Doria in 1535. To forma just idea of the Corsairs of the past, it is
well to remember that commerce and piracy were often synonymous
terms, even among the English, up to the reign of Elizabeth. Listen
to the description given by the pious Cavendish of his commercial cir-
cumnavigation of the globe: ‘It has pleased Almighty God to suffer
me to circumpass the whole globe of the world. - - - I navigated
along the coast of Chile, Peru, and New Spain, where I made great
spoils. All the villages and towns that ever I landed at, I burned and
spoiled, and had I not been discovered upon the coast, I had taken a
great quantity of treasure,” and so he concludes, ‘‘ The Lord be praised
for all his mercies!”

Sir William Monson, when called upon by James I to propose a
scheme for an attack on Algiers, recommended that all the maritime
powers of Europe should contribute towards the expense and partici-
pate in the gains by the sale of Moors and Turks as slaves.

After the discovery of America and the expulsion of the Moors from
Spain, piracy developed to an extraordinary extent. The audacity of
the Barbary Corsairs seems incredible at the present day; they landed
on the shores and islands of the Mediterranean, and even extended
their ravages to Great Britain, carrying off all the inhabitants whom
they could seize into the most wretched slavery. The most formidable
of these piratical states was Algiers, a military oligarchy, consisting
of a body of janissaries, recruited by adventurers from the Levent, the
outcasts of the Mohammedan world, criminals and renegades from
every nation in Europe. They elected their own ruler or Dey, who
exercised despotic sway, tempered by frequent assassination; they
oppressed without mercy the natives of the country, accumulated vast
riches, had immense numbers of Christian slaves, and kept all Europe
in a state bordering on subjection by the terror which they inspired.
Nothing is sadder or more inexplicable than the shameful manner in
which this state of things was accepted by civilized nations. Many
futile attempts were made during successive centuries to humble their
arrogance, but it only increased by every manifestation of the power-
lessness of Europe to restrain it. It was reserved for our own country-
man, Lord Exmouth, by his brilliant victory in 1816, forever to put an
end to piracy and Christian slavery in the Mediterranean. His work,
however, was left incomplete, for though he destroyed the navy of the
Algerines and so rendered them powerless for evil on the seas, they
were far trom being humbled; they continued to slight their treaties
and to subject even the agents of powerful nations to contumely and
injustice. The French took the only means possible to destroy this
nest of ruffians by the almost unresisted occupation of Algiers and
the deportation of its Turkish aristocracy.

They found the whole country in the possession of a hostile people,
THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL. Pad (a

some of whom had never been subdued since the fall of the Roman
Empire, and the world owes France no small debt of gratitude for hav-
ing transformed what was a savage and almost uncultivated country
into one of the richest as well as the most beautiful in the basin of the
Mediterranean.

What has been accomplished in Algeria is being effected in Tunisia,
The treaty of the Kasr-es-Saeed, which established a French protecto-
rate there and military occupation of the regency, were about as
high-handed and unjustifiable acts as are recorded in history; but
there can be no possible doubt regarding the important work of civil-
ization and improvement that has resulted from them. European
courts of justice have been established all over the country, the
exports and imports have increased from twenty-three to fifty-one
millions of frances, the revenue from six to nineteen millions, without
the imposition of a single new tax, and nearly half a million per annum
is being spent on education.

Sooner or later the same thing must happen in the rest of north
Africa, though at present international jealousies retard this desirable
consummation. It seems hard to condemn such fair countries to con-
tinued barbarism in the interest of tyrants who mis-govern and oppress
their people. The day can not be far off when the whole southern
shores of the Mediterranean will enjoy the same prosperity and civil.
ization as the northern coast, and when the deserts which are the
result of mis-government and neglect will assume the fertility arising
from security and industry, and will again blossom as the rose.

It cannot be said that any part of the Mediterranean basin is still
unknown, if we except the Empire of Morocco. But even that country
has been traversed in almost every direction during the past 20
years, and its geography and natural history have been illustrated by
men of the greatest eminence, such as Gerhard Rohlfs, Monsieur Tissot,
Sir Joseph Hooker, the Vicomte de Foucauld, Joseph Thomson, and
numerous other travellers. The least known portion, at least on the
Mediterranean coast, is the Riff country, the inhospitality of whose
inhabitants has given the word “ruffian” to the English language.
Even that has been penetrated by De Foucauld disguised as a Jew,
and the record of his exploration is one of the most brilliant con-
tributious to the geography of the country which has hitherto been
made.

Although, therefore, but littie remains to be done in the way of
actual exploration, there are many by-ways of travel comparatively
little known to that class of the community with which I have so much
sympathy,—the ordinary british tourist. These flock every year in
hundreds to Algeria and Tunis, but few of them visit the splendid
Roman remains in the interior of those countries. The Cyrenaica is
not so easily accessible, and I doubt whether any Englishmen have
travelled in it since the exploration of Smith and Porcher in 1861.

H. Mis. 129——18
274 THE MEDITERRANEAN, PHYSICAL AND HISTORICAL.

Cyrene almost rivalled Carthage in commercial importance. The
Hellenic ruins still existing bear witness to the splendor of its five great
cities. It was the birth-place of many distinguished people, and amongst
its hills and fountains were located some of the most interesting scenes
in mythology,such as the Gardens of the Hesperides,and the ‘silent,
dull, forgetful waters of Lethe.”

This peninsula is only separated by a narrow strait from Greece,
whence it was originally colonized. There, and indeed all over the
eastern basin of the Mediterranean, are many little-trodden routes, but
the subject is too extensive; I am reluctantly compelled to restrict my
remarks to the western half.

The south of Italy is more frequently traversed, and less travelled in,
than any part of that country. Of the thousands who yearly embark
or dis-embark at Brindisi few ever visit the land of Manfred. Otranto
is only known to them from the fanciful descriptions in Horace Wal-
pole’s romance. The general public in this country is quite ignorant of
what is going on at Taranto, and of the great arsenal and dockyard
which Italy is constructing in the Mare Piccolo, an inland sea contain-
ing more than 1,000 acres of anchorage for the largest ironclads afloat,
yet with an entrance so narrow that it is spanned by a revolving bridge.
Even the Adriatic, though traversed daily by steamers of the Austrian
Lloyd’s Company, is not a highway of travel, yet where is it possible to
find so many places of interest within the short space of a week’s voy-
age, between Corfu and Trieste, as along the Dalmatian and Istrian
shores, and among the islands that fringe the former where it is diffi-
cult to realize that one is at sea at all, and not on some great inland
lake?

There is the Bocche di Cattaro, a vast rent made by the Adriatic
among the mountains, where the sea flows round their spurs in a series
of canals, bays, and lakes of surpassing beauty. The city of Cattaro
itself, the gateway of Montenegro, with its picturesque Venetian fort-
ress, nestling at the foot of the black mountain, Ragusa, the Roman
successor of the Hellenic Epidaurus, queen of the southern Adriatic,
battling with the waves on her rock-bound peninsula, the one spot in
all that sea which never submitted either to Venice or the Turk, and
for centuries resisting the barbarians on every side, absolutely unique
as a medieval fortified town, and worthy to have given her name to the
argosies she sent forth; Spalato, the grandest of Roman monuments ;
Lissa, colonized by Dionysius of Syracuse, and memorable to us as hav-
ing been a British naval station from 1812 to 1814, while the French
held Dalmatia; Zara, the capital, famous for its siege by the Crusaders,
interesting from an ecclesiological point of view, and venerated as the
last resting place of St. Simeon, the prophet of the Nune dimittis ;
Parenza, with its great basilica; Pola, with its noble harbor, whence
Belisarius sailed forth, now the chief naval port of the Austrian Em-
pire, with its Roman amphitheater and graceful triumphal arches, be-

sides many other places of almost equal interest. Still farther west are
Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands, all easily accessible from
the coasts of France, Italy, and Spain. Their ports are constantly vis-
ited by mail steamers and private yachts, yet they are but little ex-
plored in the interior. - - -

I have endeavored to sketch, necessarily in a very imperfect manner,
the physical character and history of the Mediterranean, to show how
the commerce of the world originated in a small maritime state at its
eastern extremity; how it graduaily advanced westward till it burst
through the Straits of Gibraltar and extended over seas and continents
until then undreampt of, an event which deprived the Mediterranean ot
that commercial prosperity and greatness which for centuries had been
limited to its narrow basin.

Once more this historic sea has become the highway of nations; the
persistent energy and genius of two men have revolutionized naviga-
tion, opened out new and boundless fields for commerce, and it is hardly
too much to say that if the Mediterranean is to be restored to its old
position of importance, if the struggle for Africa is to result in its re-
generation, as happened in the New World, if the dark places still re-
maining in the farther Kast are to be civilized, it will be in a great
measure due to Wagborn and Ferdinand de Lesseps, who developed
the overland route and created the Suez Canal.

But the Mediterranean can only hope to retain its regenerated posi-
tion in time of peace. Nothing is more certainly shown by past history
than that war and conquest have changed the route of commerce in
spite of favored geographical positions. Babylon was conquered by
Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, and Romans, and though for a time
her position on the Euphrates caused her to rise like a Phenix from
her ashes, successive conquests combined with the luxury and _ effemi-
nacy of her rulers, caused her to perish. Tyre, conquered by Nebuchad-
nezzar and Alexander, fell as completely as Babylon had done, and her
trade passed to Alexandria. Ruined sites of commercial cities rarely
again become emporia of commerce; Alexandria is an exception de-
pendent on very exceptional circumstances.

The old route to the Hast was principally used by sailing vessels, and
was abandoned for the shorter and more economical one by the Suez
Canal, which now enables a round voyage to be made in 60 days, which
formerly required from 6 to 8 months. This, however, can only remain
open in time of peace. It is quite possible that in the event of war the
old route by the Cape may be again used to the detriment of traffic by
the Mediterranean. Modern invention has greatly economized the use
of coal, and steamers, by the use of duplex and triplex engines, can run
with a comparatively small consumption of fuel, thus leaving a larger
space for cargo. England, the great carrying power of the world, may
find it more advantageous to trust to her own strength and the secur-

ity of the open seas than to run the gauntlet of the numerous strateg-
ical positions of the Mediterranean, such as Port Mahon, Bizerta, and
Taranto, each of which is capable of affording impregnable shelter to a
hostile fleet, and though the ultimate key to the Indian Ocean is in our
own hands, our passage to it may be beset by a thousand dangers.
There is no act of my career on which I look back with so much satis-
faction as on the share I had in the occupation of Perim, one of the
most important links in that chain of coaling stations which extends
through the Mediterranean to the farther East, and which is so neces-
sary for the maintenance of our naval supremacy. Itis a mere islet, it
is true, a barren rock, but one surrounding a noble harbor, and so em-
inently in its right place that we can not contemplate with equanimity
the possibility of its being in any other hands than our own.

It is by no means certain whether exaggerated armaments are best
suited for preserving peace or hastening a destructive war; the golden
age of disarmament and international arbitration may not be near at
hand, but it is even now talked of as a possibility.

Should the poet’s prophecy or the patriot’s dream be realized and a
universal peace indeed bless the world, then this sea of so many vic-
tories may long remain the harvest field of a commerce nobler than
conquest.
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA.*

By J. SCOT? Kei trE,

It is 19 years since Stanley first crossed the threshold of central
Africa. He entered it as a newspaper correspondent to find and
succor Livingstone, and came out burning with the fever of African
exploration. While with Livingstone at Ujiji, he tried his ’prentice
hand at a little exploring work, and between them they did something
to settle the geography of the north end of Lake Tanganyika. Some
three years and a half later he was once more on his way to Zanzibar,
this time with the deliberate intention of doing something to fill up the
great blank that still occupied the center of the continent. A glance
at the first of the maps which accompany this paper will afford some
idea of what Central Africa was like when Stanley entered it a second
time. The ultimate sources of the Nile had yet to be settled. The
contour and extent of Victoria Nyanza were of the most uncertain
character. Indeed, so little was known of it beyond what Speke told
us, that there was some danger of its being swept off the map alto-
gether, not a few geographers believing it to be not one lake, but
several. There was much to do in the region lying to the west of the
lake, even though it had been traversed by Speke and Grant. Between
a line drawn from the north end of Lake Tanganyika to some distance
beyond the Albert Nyanza on one side, and the west coast region on
the other, the map was almost white, with here and there the conjee-
tural course of a river or two. Livingstone’s latest work, it should be
remembered, was then almost unknown, and Cameron had not yet
returned. Beyond the Yellala Rapids there was no Congo, and Living-
stone believed that the Lualaba swept northwards to the Nile. He
had often gazed longingly at the broad river during his weary sojourn
at Nyangwé, and yearned to follow it, but felt himself too old and
exhausted for the task. Stanley was fired with the same ambition as
his dead master, and was young and vigorous cnough to indulge if.

What, then, did Stanley do to map out the features of this great
blank during the 2 years and 9 months which he spent in crossing

the outline of the Victoria Nyanza; he found it to be one of the great
lakes of the world, 21,500 square miles in extent, with an altitude of
over 4,000 feet and border soundings of from 330 to 580 feet. Into the
south shore of the lake a river flowed, which he traced for some 300
miles, and which he set down as the most southerly feeder of the Nile.
With his stay at the court of the clever and cunning Mtesa of Uganda
we need not concern ourselves; it has had momentous results. West-
wards he came upon what he coneeived to be a part of the Albert
Nyanza, which he named Beatrice Gulf, but of which more anon.
Coming southwards to Ujiji, Stanley filled in many features in the
region he traversed, and saw ata distance a great mountain, which
he named Gordon Bennett, of which also more anon. A little lake to
the south he named the Alexandra Nyanza; thence he conjectured
issued the southwest source of the Nile, but on this point, within
the last few months, he has seen cause to change his mind. Lake
Tanganyika he circumuavigated, and gave greater accuracy to its out-
line; while through the Lukuga he found it sent its waters by the
Lualaba to the Atlantic. Crossing to Nyangwé, where with longing
eyes Livingstone beheld the mile-wide Lualaba flowing ‘‘ north, north,
north,” Stanley saw his opportunity, and embraced it. Tippu Tip
failed him then, as he did later; but the mystery of that great river he
had made up his mind to solve, and solve it he did. The epic of that
first recorded journey of a white man down this majestic river, which
for ages had been sweeping itS unknown way through the center of
Africa, he and his dusky companions running the gauntlet through a
thousand miles of hostile savages, is one of the most memorable things
in the literature of travel. Leaving Nyangwé on November 5, 1876, in
9 months he traced the many-islanded Congo to the Atlantic, and
placed on the map of Africa one of its most striking features; for the
Congo ranks among the greatest rivers of the world. From the remote
Chambeze, that enters Lake Bangweolo to the sea, it is 3,000 miles. It
has many tributaries, themselves affording hundreds of miles of navi-
gable drains, waters a basin of a million square miles, and pours into
the Atlantic a volume estimated at 1,800,000 cubic feet per second.
Thus, then, were the first broad lines drawn towards filling up the
great blank. But, as we know, Stanley two years later was once more
on his way to the Congo, and shortly after, within the compass of its
great basin, he helped to found the Congo Free State. During the
years he was officially connected with the river, either directly or
through those who served under him, he went on filling up the blank
by the exploration of other rivers, north and south, which poured their
voluminous tribute into the main stream; and the impulse he gave
has continued. The blank has become a network of dark lines, the
interspaces cevered with the names of tribes and rivers and lakes.
Such, then, briefly, is what Stanley did for the map of Africa during
his great and ever-memorable journey across the continent. Once more
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA. 281

Mr. Stanley has crossed the continent, in the opposite direction, and
taken just about the same time in which to do so. Discovery was not
his main object this time, and therefore the results in this direction have
not been so plentiful. Indeed, they could not be; he had left so com-
paratively little to be done. But the additions that he has made to our
knowledge of the great blank are considerable, and of high importance
in their bearing on the hydrography, the physical geography, the
climate, and the people of central Africa.

Let us rapidly run over the incidents of this, in some respects, the
most remarkable expedition that ever entered Africa. Its first purpose,
as we know, was to relieve, and if necessary bring away, Emin Pasha,
the governor of the abandoned equatorial province of the Egyptian
Sudan, which spread on each side of the Bahr-el-Jebel, the branch of
the Nile that issues from the Albert Nyanza. Here it was supposed
that he and his Egyptian officers and troops, and their wives and
children, were beleagured by the Madhist hordes, and that they were
at the end of their supplies. HKmin Pasha, who as Eduard Schnitzer
was born in Prussian Silesia, and educated at Breslau and Berlin as a
physician, spent 12 years (1864-1876) in the Turkish service, during
which he traveled over much of the Asiatic dominions of Turkey,
indulging his strong tastes for natural history. In 1876he entered the
service of Egypt, and was sent up to the Sudan as surgeon on the staff
of Gordon Pasha, who at that time governed the equatorial provinee.
In 1878, two years after Gordon had been appointed governor-general
of the whole Sadan, Emin Effendi (he had Moslemized himself) was
appointed governor of the equatorial province, which he found com-
pletely disorganized and demoralized, the happy hunting-ground of
the slave-raider. Within afew months Emin had restored order, swept
out the slavers, got rid of the Egyptian scum who pretended to be
soldiers, improved the revenue, so that instead of a large deficit there
was a considerable surplus, and established industry and legitimate
trade. Meantime the Mahdi had appeared, and the movement of con-
quest was gathering strength. It was not, however, till 1884 that Emin
began to fear danger. It was in January of that year that Gordon went
out to hold Khartoum; just a year later both he and the city fell before
the Madhist host. Emin withdrew with his officers and dependents,
numbering about 1,500, to Wadelai, in the south of the province, within
easy reach of Albert Nyanza.

Rumors of the events in the Sudan after the fall of Khartoum reached
this country, but no one outside of scientific circles seemed to take
much interest in Emin till 1886. Rapidly, however, Kurepe became
aware what a noble stand this simple savant, who had been foisted into
the position of governor of a half-savage province, was making against
the forces of the Mahdi, and how he refused to desert his post and his
people. Towards the autumn of 1886 public feeling on the subject rose
to such a height that the British Government, which was held to blame
282 STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA.

for the position in the Sudan, was compelled to take action. Our
representative at Zanzibar, as early as August of that year, instituted
inquiries as to the possibility of a relief expedition, but in the end, in
dread of international complications, it was decided that a government
expedition was impracticable. In this dilemma, Sir (then Mr.) William
Mackinnon, chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Company,
whose connection with east Africa is of old standing, came forward
and offered to undertake the responsibility of getting up an expe-
dition. The Emin Pasha relief committee was formed in December,
1886, and Government did all it could to aid, short of taking the
actual responsibility. Mr. H. M. Stanley generously offered his services
as leader, without fee or reward, giving up many lucrative engage-
ments for the purpose. No time was lost. The sum of £20,000 had
been subscribed, including £10,000 from the Egyptian Government.
Mr. Stanley returned from America to England in the end of Decem-
ber; by the end of January he had made all his preparations, selecting
9 men as his staff, including 3 English officers and 2 surgeons, and
was on his way to Zanzibar, which was reached on February 21.
On the 25th the expedition was on board the Madura, bound for the
mouth of the Congo, by way of the Cape; 9 European officers, 61
Sudanese, 13 Somalis, 3 interpreters, 620 Zanzibaris, the famous Arab
slaver and merchant, Tippu Tip, and 407 of his people. The mouth of
the Congo was reached on March 18; there the expedition was trans-
shipped into small vessels and landed at Matadi, the limit of naviga-
tion on the lower river. From Matadi there was a march of 200 miles,
past the cataracts, to Stanley Pool, where the navigation was resumed.
The troubles of the expedition began on the Congo itself. The ques-
tion of routes was much discussed at the time of organizing the
expedition, the two that found most favor being that from the east coast
through Masai land and round by the north of Uganda, and that by
the Congo. Into the comparative merits of these two routes we shall
not enter here. For reasons which were satisfactory to himself—and
no one knows Africa better—Mr. Stanley selected the Congo route,
though had he foreseen all that he and his men would have to undergo
he might have hesitated. As it was, the expedition, which it was
thought would be back in England by Christmas, 1887, only reached
the coast in November, 1889. But the difficulties no one could have
foreseen, the region traversed being completely unknown, and the
obstacles encountered unprecedented even in Africa. Nor when the
goal was reached was it expected that months would be wasted in per-
suading Kmin and his people to quit their exile. Not the keenest-eyed
of African explorers could have foreseen all this.

Want of sufficient boat accommodation and a seareity of food almost
amounting to famine hampered the expedition terribly on its way up
the Congo. The mouth of the Aruwimi, the real starting point of the
expedition, some 1,500 miles from the mouth of the Congo, was not
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA. 283

reached by Mr. Stanley and the first contingent, till the beginning of
June, 1887. The distance from here in a straight line to the nearest
point of the Albert Nyanza is about 450 miles; thence it was believed
communication with Emin would be easy, for he had two steamers
available. But it was possible that a detour would have to be made
towards the north so as to reach Wadelia direct, for no one knew the
conditions which prevailed in the country between the Aruwimi mouth
and the Albert Nyanza. As it was Mr. Stanley took the course to the
lake direct, but with many a circuit and many an obstruction and at a
terrible sacrifice of life. An intrenched camp was established on a
bluff at Yambuya, about 50 miles up the left bank of the Aruwimi.
Major Barttelot was left in charge of this, and with him Dr. Bonny,
Mr. Jameson, Mr. Rose Troup, Mr. Ward, and 257 men; the rear column
was to follow as soon as Tippu Tip provided the contingent of 500
natives which he had solemnly promised. Although the whole of the
men had not come up, yet everything seemed in satisfactory order ;
explicit instructions were issued to the officers of the rear column, and
on June 28, 1887, Mr. Stanley, with a contingent consisting of 389 offi-
cers and men, set out toreach Emin Pasha. The officers with him were
Captain Nelson, Lieutenant Stairs, Dr. Parke, and Mr. Jephson.

Five miles after leaving camp the difficulties began. The expedition
was face to face with a dense forest of iinmense extent, choked with
bushy undergrowth and obstructed by a network of creepers through
which a way had often to be cleaved with the axes. Hostile natives
harassed them day after day; the paths were studded with concealed
spikes of wood; the arrows were poisoned; the natives burned their
villages rather than have dealings with the intruders. Happily the
river when it was again struck afforded relief, and the steel boat
proved of service, though the weakened men found the portages past
the cataracts a great trial. It was fondly hoped that here at least the
Arab slaver had not penetrated; but on September 16, 200 miles from
Yambuaya, making 340 miles of actual travel, the slave camp of Uga-
rowwa was reached, and here the treatment was even worse than when
fighting the savages of the forest. The brutalities practiced on Stan-
ley’s men cost many of them their lives. A month later the camp of
another Arab slaver was reached, Kilinga Longa, and there the treat-
ment was no better.. These so-called Arabs, whose caravans consist
mainly of the merciless Manyuema, from the country between Tagan-
yika and Nyangwé, had laid waste a great area of the region to be
traversed by the expedition, so that between August 31 and November
12 every man was famished; and when at last the land of devastation
was left behind, and the native village of Ibwiri entered, officers and
men were reduced to skeletons. Out of the 3889 who started only 174
entered [bwiri, the rest dead, or missing, or left behind, unable to
move, at Ugarowwa’s. So weak was everybody that 70 tons of goods
284 STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA.

and the boat had to be left at Kilinga Longa’s with Captain Nelson
and Surgeon Parke.

A halt of 13 days at Ibwiri, with its plenty of fowls, bananas, corn,
yams, beans, restored everybody ; and 173 sleek and robust men set
out for the Albert Nyanza on November 24. A week later the gloomy
and dreaded forest suddenly ended; the open country was reached ;
the light of day was unobstructed; it was an emergence from darkness
to light. But the difficulties were not over; some little fighting with
the natives on the populous plateau was necessary before the lake could
be reached. On the 12th, the edge of the long slope from the Congo to
Lake Albert was attained, and suddenly the eyes of all were gladdened
by the sight of the lake lying some 3,000 feet almost sheer below. ‘The
expedition itself stood at an altitude of 5,200 feet above the sea. But
the end was not yet. Down the expedition marched to the southwest
corner of the lake, where the Kakongo natives were unfriendly. No
Emin Pasha had been heard of; there was no sign even that he knew
of Stanley’s coming or that the messenger from Zanzibar had reached
him. The only boat of the expedition was at Kilinga Longa’s, 190
miles away. Of the men 94 were behind sick at Ugarowwa’s and Ki-
linga Longa’s; only 173 were with Stanley ; 74 of the original 341 were
dead or missing; and, moreover, there was anxiety about the rear
column.

Stanley’s resolution was soon taken. Moving to the village of
Kavalli, some distance up the steep slope from the lake, the party
began a night march on December 15, and by January 7, they were
back at Ibwiri. Here Fort Bodo, famous in the records of the expedi-
tion, was built. The men were brought up from the rear, and on April
7, Stanley, with Jephson and Parke, once more led the expedition to
Lake Albert, this time with the boat and fresh stores. Meantime
Stanley himself was on the sick list fora month. This time all the
natives along the route were friendly and even generous, and on April
22, the expedition reached the chief Kavalli, who delivered to Stanley a
letter wrapped in American cloth. The note was from Emin and stated
that he had heard rumors of Stanley’s presence in the district; it
begged Stanley to wait until Emin could communicate with him. The
boat was launched and Jephson set off to find Emin. On the 29th,
the Khedive steamer came down the lake with Emin, the Italian Casati,
and Jephson on board. The great object of the expedition seemed at
last to be all but fulfilled.

But the end was not yet. There was the party at Fort Bodo ; there
were the sick further back, with whom Lieutenant Stairs had not re-
turned when Stanley left the fort ; and, above all, there was the rear
column left at Yambuya with Major Barttelot. It would take some
time for Emin to bring down all his people from Wadelai and other
stations. So after spending over 3 weeks with the vacillating Emin,
Stanley, on May 25, was once more on the march back to Fort Bodo
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA. 285

to bring up allhands. He left Jephson, 3 Sudanese, and 2 Zanzibaris
with Emin, who gave him 102 natives as porters, and 3 irregulars to
accompany him back. Fort Bodo was reached on June 8, and was
found in a flourishing state, surrounded by acres of cultivated fields.
But of the 56 men left at Ugarowwa’s only 16 were alive for Licut-
enant Stairs to bring to Fort Bodo. As there was no sign of the
rear column nor of the 20 messengers sent off in March with letters for
Major Barttelot, Stanley felt bound to retrace his steps through the
terrible forest. This time he was better provisioned, and his people
(212) escaped the horrors of the wilderness.

Fort Bodo was left on June 16, Stanley letting all his white com-
panions remain behind. Ugarowwa’s camp was deserted, and he him-
self, with a flotilla of fifty-seven canoes, was overtaken far down the
river on August 10, and with him, 17 of the carriers sent off to Major
Barttelot in March; 3 of their number had been killed. On the 17th
the rear column was met with at Bonalya, 80 miles above Yambuya,
and then for the first time Stanley learned of the terrible disaster that
had befallen it—Barttelot shot by the Manyuema; Jameson gone
down the Congo (only to die); Wardaway: and Troupinvalided home,
No one but Dr. Bonny ; of the 257 men only 72 remaining, and of these
only 52 fit for service. No wonder Mr. Stanley felt too sick to write
the details; and until we have the whole of the evidence it would be
unfair to pronounce judgment. One thing we may say: we know, from
Mr. Werner’s recently published “ River Life on the Congo,” that
before Major Barttelot left Yambuya to follow Stanley it was known
to Mr. Werner, to more than one Belgian officer, to several natives,
and to the Manyuema people with Barttelot, that instructions had been
given by Tippu Tip to these last to shoot Major Barttelot if he did not
treat them well. Yet no one cared to warn the Major and he was
allowed to depart to his almost certain fate. The thing is too sicken-
ing to dwell upon. It was at this stage that Stanley sent home his
first letters, which reached England on April 1, 1889, 20 months after
hestarted from the Aruwimi, and over 2 years after heleft England. The
relief was intense; all sorts of sinister rumors had been floated, and
most people had given up the expedition for lost.

Once more back through the weary forest, with the expedition re-
organized. A new route was taken to the north of the river through a
region devasted by the Arab slavers; and here the expedition came
near to starvation, but once more Fort Bodo was reached, on Decem-
ber 20. Here things were practically as Stanley had left them; there
was no sign of Emin, though he had promised to come to the fort.
The combined expedition marched onwards, and Mr. Stanley, pushing
on with a contingent, reached the lake for the third time, on January
18, only to learn that Emin and Jephson had been made prisoners by
Emin’s own men; the Mahdists had attacked the station and created
a panic, and all was disorganization and vacillation. At last, however,
286 STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA.

the chief actors in this strange drama were together again; and Mr.
Stanley’s account of Emin’s unstable purpose, the long arguments
with the Pasha to persuade him to come to a decision; the ingratitude
and treachery of the Egyptians, the gathering of the people and their
burdensome goods and chattels preparatory to quitting the lake — these
and many other details are fresh in our memories from Stanley’s own
letters. But the main purpose of the expedition was accomplished, at
however terrible a cost, and however disappointing it was to find that
after all Emin was reluctant to be ‘ rescued.” When the start was
made from Kavalli’s on April 10 last, 1,500 people in all were mustered:
An almost mortal illness laid Stanley low for a month shortly after the
start, and it was May 8 before the huge caravan was fairly under way.
Some fighting had to be done with raiders from Unyoro, but on the
whole the homeward march was comparatively free from trouble, and
full of interest; and on December 6 Mr. Stanley once more entered
Zanzibar, which he had left 2 years and 10 months before. Such briefly
are some of the incidents of the rescue expedition; let us now as briefly
sum up the geographical results.

When Stanley left for Africa, in January, 1887, there remained one
of the great problems of African hydrography still unsolved—what is
known as the problem of the Wellé. Schweinfurth and Junker had
come upon a river at some points which seemed to rise in the neighbor-
hood of the Albert Nyanza, and appeared to flow in a northwest direc-
tion. The favorite theory at the time was that the river Wellé was
really the upper course of the Shari, which runs into Lake Chad far
away to the northwest. But as the Congo and its great feeders on the
north, and the lie of the land in that direction, became known, it began
to be conjectured that after all the Wellé might send its waters to swell
the mighty volume of the great river. Stanley, I know, hoped that,
among other geographical work, he might be able to throw some light
on the course of this puzzling river. But, as we see now, the cares and
troubles that fell upon him prevented him going much out of the way to
do geographical work. While, however, Stanley was cleaving his way
through the tangled forest, Lieutenant Van Géle, one of the Free State
officers, proved conclusively that the Wellé was really the upper course
of the Mobangi, one of the largest northern tributaries of the Congo.
But another kindred problem Stanley was able to solve. Before his
journey the mouth of the river Aruwimi was known; the great naval
battle which he fought there on his first descent of the river is one of
the most striking of the many striking pictures in the narrative of that
famous journey. But beyond Yambuya its course was a blank. The
river, under various names, “ Ituri” being the best known, led him
almost to the brink of the Albert Nyanza. One of its upper contribu-
tories is only 10 minutes’ walk from the brink of the escarpment that
looks down upon the lake. With many rapids, it is for a great part of
its course over 500 yards wide, with groups of islands here and there.
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA. 287

For a considerable stretch it is navigable, and its entire length, taking
all its windings into account, from its source to the Congo, is 800 miles.
One of its tributaries turns out to be another river which Junker met
further north, and whose destination was a puzzle.—The Nepoko.

Thus this expedition has enabled us to form clearer notions of the
hydrography of this remarkable region of rivers. We see that the
sources of the Congo and the Nile lie almost within a few yards of each
other. Indeed, so difficult is it to determine to which river the various
waters in this region send their tribute that Mr. Stanley himself, in his
first letter, was confident that the southern Lake Albert belonged to the
Congo and not to the Nile system. It was only actual inspection that
convinced him he was mistaken. How it is that the Ituri or the
Aruwimi and other rivers in the same region are attracted to the Congo
and not to the Nile is easily seen from Mr, Stanley’s graphic deserip-
tion of the lay of the country between the Congo and the Albert Nyanza.
It is, he says, hke the glacis of a fort, some 350 miles long, sloping
gradually up from the margin of the Congo (itself at the Aruwimi
mouth 1,400 feet above the sea), until! ten miles beyond one of the
Ituri feeders it reaches a height of 5,200 feet to descend almost per-
pendicularly 2,900 feet to the surface of the lake, which forms the great
western reservoir of the Nile.

But when the term “ glacis” is used, it must not be inferred that the
ascent from the Congo to Lake Albert is smooth and unobstructed.
The fact is that Mr. Stanley found himself involved in the northern
section of what is probably the most extensive and densest forest region
in Africa, Livingstone spent many a weary day trudging its gloomy,
recesses away south at Nyangwé on the Lualaba. It stretches for many
miles north to the Monbuttu country. Stanley entered it at Yambuya,
and tunnelled his way through it to within 50 miles of the Albert
Nyanza, when it all of a sudden ceased and gave way to grassy plains
and the unobstructed light of day. How far west it may extend be-
yond the Aruwimi he can not say; but it was probably another section
of this same forest region that Mr. Paul du Chaillu struck some 30
years ago, when gorilla hunting in the Gaboon. Mr. Stanley estimates
the area of this great forest region at about 500,000 square miles, which
is more likely to be under than over the mark. The typical African
forest, as Mr. Drummond shows in his charming book on “Tropical
Africa,” is not of the kind found on the Aruwimi, which is much more
South American than African. Not even in the “great sponge,” from
which the Zambesi and the Congo draw their remote supplies, do we
meet with such impenetrable density. Trees scattered about as in an
English park in small open clumps form, as a rule, the type of ‘‘ forest”
common in Africa. The physical causes which led to the dense packing
of trees over the immense area between the Congo and the Nile Lakes
will form an interesting investigation. Mr. Stanley’s description of the
great forest region, in his letter to Mr. Bruce, is well worth quoting:
288 STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA.

“Take a thick Scottish copse, dripping with rain. Imagine this copse
to be a mere undergrowth, nourished under the impenetrable shade of
ancient trees, ranging trom 100 to 180 feet high; briars and thorns
abundant; lazy creeks, meandering through the depths of the jungle,
and sometimes a deep affluent of a great river. imagine this forest
and jungle in all stages of decay and growth—old trees falling, leaning
perilously over, fallen prostrate; ants and insects of all kinds, sizes,
and colors murmuring around; monkeys and chimpanzees above, queer
noises of birds and animals, crashes in the jungle as troops of elephants
rush away; dwarfs with poisoned arrows securely hidden behind some
buttress or in some dark recess; strong brown-bodied aborigines with
terribly sharp spears standing poised, still as dead stumps; rain pat-
tering down on you every other day in the year; an impure atmosphere
with its dread consequences, fever and dysentery; gloom throughout
the day, and darkness almost palpable throughout the night, and then
if you will imagine such a forest extending the entire distance from
Plymouth to Peterhead, you will have a fair idea of some of the incon-
venience endured by us from June 28 to December 5, 1887, and from
June 1, 1888, to the present date, to continue again from the present
date till about December 10, 1888, when I hope to say a last farewell
to the Congo forest.”

Mr. Stanley tries to account for this great forest region by the abund-
ance of moisture carried over the continent from tle wide Atlantic by
the winds which blow landward through a great part of the year; but
itis to be feared the remarkable phenomenon is not to be accounted for
in so easy away. Investigation may prove that the rain of the rainiest
region in Africa comes not from the Atlantic, but the Indian Ocean,
with its moisture laden monsoons; and so we should have here a case
analogous to that which oceurs 1n South America, the forests of which
resemble in many features those of the region through which Mr. Stanley
has passed.

But the forest itself is not more interesting than its human denizens.
The banks of the river in many places are studded with large villages,
some, at least, of the native tribes being cannibals. Weare here onthe
northern border of the true negro peoples, so that when the subject is
investigated the Aruwimi savages may be found to be much mixed.
But unless Europe promptly intervenes, there will shortly be few people
left in these forests to investigate. Mr. Stanley came upon two slave-
hunting parties, both of them manned by the merciless people of Man-
yuema. Already great tracts have been turned into a wilderness, and
thousands of the natives driven from their homes. Irom the ethnolo-
gist’s point of view the most interesting inhabitants of the Aruwimi for-
ests are the hostile and cunning dwarfs, or rather pigmies, who caused
the expidition so much trouble. No doubt they are the same as the
Monbuttu pigmies found farther north, and essentialy similar to the
pigmy population found scattered all over Africa, from the Zambesi to
STANLEY AND THE MAP OF AFRICA. 289

the Nile, and from the Gaboon to the east coast. Mr. Du Chaillu found
them in the forests of the west30 years ago, and away south on the great
Sankuru tributary of the Congo Major Wissman and his fellow explo-
rers met them within the past few years. They seem to be the rem-
nants of a primitive population rather than the stunted examples of the
normal negro. Around the villages in the forest wherever clearings
had been made the ground was of the richest character, growing crops
of all kinds. Mr. Stanley has always maintained that in the high lands
around the great lakes will be found the most favorable region for Eu-
ropean enterprise; and ifin time much of the forest is cleared away,
the country between the Congo and Lake Albert might become the
granary of Africa.

To the geographer, however, the second half of the expedition’s work
is fuller of interest than the first. Some curious problems had to be
solved in the lake region, problems that had given rise to much discus-
sion. When in 1864 Sir Samuel Baker stood on the lofty escarpment
that looks down on the east shore of the Albert Nyanza, at Vacovia,
the lake seemed to him to stretch illimitably to the south, so that for
long it appeared on our maps as extending beyond 1 degree south lat-
itude. When Stanley, many years later, on his first great expedition,
after crossing from Uganda, came upon a great bay of water, he
was naturally inclined to think thatit was a part of Baker’s lake, and
called it Beatrice Gulf. But Gessi and Mason, members of Gordon
Pasha’s staff, circumnavigated the lake later on and found that it ended
more than a degree north of the equator. So when Stanley published
his narrative he made his “ Beatrice Gulf” a separate lake lying to the
south of the Albert Nyanza. Mr. Stanley saw only a small portion of
the southern lake, Muta Nzigé, but in time it expanded and expanded on
our maps until there seemed some danger of its being joined on to Lake
Tanganyika. Emin himself, during his 12 years’ stay in the Sudan, did
something towards exploring the Albert Nyanza, and found that its
southern shore was fast advancing northward, partly owing to sediment
brought down by ariver, and partly due to the wearing away of the rocky
bed otf the Upper Nile, by which much water escaped and the level of
the lake subsided. Thus, when Baker stood on the shore of the lake
in 1864, it may well have extended many miles farther south than it
does now. But where did the river come from that Mason and Emin
saw running into the lake from the south? As was pointed out above,
Stanley at first thought it could not come from his own lake to the
south, which he believed must send its waters to the Congo. But all
controversy has now been ended. During the famous exodus of the
1,500 from Kavilli to the coast, the intensely interesting country lying
between the northern lake, Albert, and the southern lake, now named
Albert Edward, was traversed. Great white, grassy plains stretch away
south from the shores of Lake Albert, which under the glitter of a trop-
ical sun might well be mistaken for water; evidently they had been

under water at quite a recent period. But soon the country begins to
rise, and round the base of a great mountain boss the river Semliki
winds its way through its valley, receiving through the picturesque
glens many streams of water from the snows that clothe the moun-
tain tops. Here we have a splendid country, unfortunately harassed
by the raids of the Wanyoro, in dread of whom the simple natives of
the mountain side often creep up to near the limit of snow. Up the
mountain, which Lieutenant Stairs ascended for over 10,000 feet,
blackberries, bilberries, violets, heaths, lichens, and trees that might
have reminded him of England flourish abundantly. Here evidently we
have a region that might well harbor a European population. The
mountain itself, Ruwenzori, a great boss with numerous spurs, is quite
evidently an extinct voleano, rising to something like 19,000 feet, and
reminding one of Kilimanjaro, farther to the east. Itis not yet clear
whether it is the same mountain as the Gordon Bennett seen by Stan-
ley in his former expedition, though the probability is that, if distinct,
they belong to the same group or mass. Apart from the mountain the
country gradually ascends as the Semliki is traced up to its origin in
Lake Albert Edward. Mr. Stanley found that, after ail, the southern
Nyanza belongs to the great Nile system, giving origin to the farthest
southwest source of Egypt’s wonderful river, which we know receives a
tribute from the snows of the equator.

The southern lake itself is of comparatively small dimensions, prob-
ably not more than 45 miles long, and is 900 feet above the northern
Lake Albert. Mr. Stanley only skirted its west, north, and east shores,
so that probably he has net been able to obtain complete data as to
size and shape. But he has solved one of the few remaining great
problems in African geography. The two lakes lie in a trough, the
sides of which rise steeply in places 3,000 feet, to the great plateaus
that extend away east and west. This trough, from the north end of
Lake Albert to the south end of Lake Albert Edward, is some .260
statute miles in length. About 100 miles of this is occupied by the
former lake, 45 by the latter, and the rest by the country between,
where the trough, if we may indulge in an Irishism, becomes partly a
plain, and partly a great mountain mass. But this trough, or fissure,
a glance at a good map will show, is continued more or less south and
southeast in Lakes Tanganyika and Nayassa, which are essentially of
the same character as Lakes Albert and Albert Edward, and totally
different from such lakes as Victoria Nyanza and Bangweolo. Here
we have a feature of the greatest geographical interest, which still has
to be worked out as to its origin.

There is little more to say as to the geographical results of the Emin
Pasha relief expedition. There are many minute details of great
interest, which the reader may see for himself in Mr. Stanley’s letters,
or in his forthcoming detailed narrative. In his own characteristic way
he tells of the tribes and peoples around the Jakes, and between the

lakes and the coast; and it was left for him on his way home to dis-
cover a great southwest extension of Victoria Nyanza, which brings
that lake within 150 miles of Lake Tanganyika. The results which
have been achieved have been achieved at a great sacrifice of life and
of suffering to all concerned; but no one, I am sure, will wish that the
work had been left undone. The few great geographical problems in
Africa that Livingstone had to leave untouched, Stanley has solved.
Little remains for himself and others in the future beyond the filling in
of details; but these are all-important, and will keep the great army
of explorers busy for many years, if not for generations.
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.*

My experience during the four years which have elapsed since this
vroject was first mooted in Melbourne is that any reference to the sub-
ject is sure to be met with the query Cui bono? What good can it do?
What benefit can come from it?) What is the object to be served by
such an expedition?

In setting myself to the task of answering these questions let me
observe that it would indeed be strange if an unexplored region
S,000,000 square miles in area—twice the size of Europe—and grouped
around the axis of rotation and the magnetic pole could fail to yield
to investigators some novel and valuable information. But when we
notice that the circle is engirdled without by peculiar physical condi-
tions which must be correlated to special physical conditions within,
speculation is exchanged for a confident belief that an adequate reward
must await the skilled explorer. The expected additions to the geog-
raphy of the region are, of all the knowledge that is to be sought for
there, the least valuable. Where so many of the physical features of
the country—the hills, the valleys, and the drainage lines—have been
buried beneath the snow of ages, a naked outline, a bare skeleton of a
map, is the utmost that can be delineated. Still, even such knowledge
as this has a distinet value, and as it can be acquired by the explorers
as they proceed about their more important researches, its relatively
small value ought not to be admitted as a complete objection to any
enterprise which has other objects of importance. Our present acquaint-
ance with the geography of the region is excessively limited. Ross
just viewed the coasts of Victoria Land between 163° E. and 160° W.
longitude; he trod its barren strand twice, but on each occasion for a
few minutes only. From the adjacent gulf he measured the heights of
its volcanoes, and from its offing he sketched the walls of its icy barrier.
Wilkes traced on our map ashore line from 97° E. to 167° KE. longitude,
and he backed it up with a range of mountains, but he landed nowhere.
Subsequently Ross sailed over the site assigned to part of this land,

* An address on ‘The Objects of Antarctic Exploration,” delivered at the annual
meeting of the Bankers’ Institute of Australia, at Melbourne, on Wednesday, August
27. (From Nature, October 16, 1890, vol. xLi1, pp. 601-604. )

293

and hove his lead 600 fathoms deep where Wilkes had drawn a moun-
tain. He tells us that the weather was so very clear that had high
land been within 70 miles of that position he must have seen it (‘* Ross’s
Voyage,” 1278). More recently Nares, in the Challenger, tested another
part of Wilkes’s coast line, and with a like result; and these circum-
stances throw doubts upon the value of his reported discoveries.
D’Urville subsequently followed a bold shore for a distance of about
300 miles from 136° EK. to 142° EK. longitude; whilst in 67° S. latitude,
and between 45° E. and 60° E. longitude, are Enderby’s and Kemp’s
lands. Again, there is land to the south of the Horn which trends
from 45° to 75° 8S. latitude. These few discontinuous coast lines com-
prise all our scanty kuowledge of the Antarctic land. It will be seen
from these facts that the principal geographical problem awaiting solu-
tion in these regions is the interconnection of these scattered shores.
The question is, do they constitute parts of a continent, or are they,
like the coasts of Greenland, portions of an archipelago, smothered under
an overload of frozen snow, which conceals their insularity? Ross
inclined to the latter view, and he believed that a wide channel leading
towards the Pole existed between North Cape and the Balleny Islands
(“Ross’s Voyage,” 1221). This view was also held by the late Sir
Wyville Thomson. A series of careful observations upon the local cur-
rents might throw some light upon these questions. Ross notes several
such in his log. Off Possession {sland a current, running southward,
took the ships to windward (ibid., 1195). Off Coulman Island another
drifted them in the same direction at the rate of 18 miles a day (<bid.,
1204). A three-quarter knot northerly current was felt off the barrier,
and may have issued from beneath some part of it. Such isolated
observations are of littie value, but they were multiplied, and were the
currents correlated with the winds experienced the information thus
obtained might enable us to detect the existence of straits, even where
the channels themselves are masked by ice barriers.

Finally, it is calculated that the center of the polar ice-cap must be 3
miles, and may be 12 miles deep, and that the material of this ice
mountain being viscous, its base must spread out under the crushing
pressure of the weight of its center. The extrusive movement thus
set up is supposed to thrust the ice cliffs off the land at the rate of a
quarter of a mile per annum. These are some of the geographical
questions which await settlement.

In the geology of this region we have another subject replete with
interest. The lofty voleanoes of Victoria Land must present peculiar
features. Nowhere else do fire and frost divide the sway so com-
pletely. Ross saw Erebus belching out lava and ashes over the snow
and ice which coated its flanks. This circumstance leads us to specu-
late on the strata that would result from the alternate fall of snow and
ashes during long periods and under a low temperature. Volcanoes
are built up, as contra-distinguished from other mountains, which result
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 295

from elevation or erosion. They consist of débris piled round a vent.
Lava and ashes surround the crater in alternate layers. But in this
polar region the snow-fall must be taken into account as well as the
ash deposit and the lava flow. It may be thought that any volcanic
ejecta would speedily melt the snow upon which they fell, but this does
not by any means necessarily follow. Volcanic ash, the most wide-spread
and most abundant material ejected, falls comparatively cold, cakes, and
then forms one of the most effective nonconductors known. When
such a layer a few inches thick is spread over snow even molten lava
may flow over it without melting the snow beneath. This may seem
to be incredible, but it has been observed to occur. In 1828 Lyell saw
on the flanks of Etna a glacier sealed up under a crust of lava. Now,
the Antarctic is the region of thick-ribbed ice. All exposed surfaces
are quickly covered with snow. Snow-falls, fish-falls, and lava-flows
must have been heaping themselves up around the craters during
unknown ages. What has been the result? Has the viscosity of the
ice been modified by the intercalation of beds of rigid lava and of
hard-set ash? Does the growing mass tend to pile up or to settle
down and spread out? Is the ice wasted by evaporation, or does the
ash layer preserve it against this mode of dissipation? These inter-
esting questions can be studied round the South Pole, and perhaps
nowhere else so well.

Another question of interest, as bearing upon the location of the
great Antarctic continent, which it is now certain existed in the Sec-
ondary period of geologists, is the nature of the rocks upon which the
lowest of these lava beds rest. If they can be discovered, and if they
then be found to be sedimentary rocks—such as slates and sandstones,
or plutonic rocks—such as granite, they will at once afford us some
data to go upon, for the surface exposure of granite signifies that the
locality has been part of a continental land sufficiently long for the
weathering and removal of the many thousands of feet of sedimentary
rocks which of necessity overlie crystalline rocks during their genesis ;
whilst the presence of sedimentary rocks implies the sometime prox-
imity of a continent from the surfaces of which alone these sediments,
as rain-wash, could have been derived.

As ancient slate rocks have already been discovered in the ice-clad
South Georgias, and as the drag-nets of the Hrebus and the Challenger
have brought up from the beds of these icy seas fragments of sand-
stones, slates, and granite, as well as the typical blue mud which
invariably fringes continental land, there is every reason to expect
that such strata will be found.

Wherever the state of the snow will permit, the polar mountains
should be searched for basaltic dikes, in the hope that masses of spec-
ular iron and nickel might be found, similar to those discovered by
Nordenskiéld, at Ovifak, in north Greenland. The interest taken in
these metallic masses arises from the fact that they alone, of all the
296 ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION,

rocks of the earth, resemble those masses of extra-terrestial origin
which we know as meteorites. Such bodies of unoxidized metal are
unknown elsewhere in the mass, and why they are peculiar to the
Arctic it is hard to say. Should similar masses be found within the
Antarctic, afresh stimulus would be given to speculation. Geologists
would have to consider whether the oxidized strata of the earth’s crust
thin out at the poles; whether in such a case the thinning is due to
severe local erosion, or to the protection against oxygen afforded to the
surface of the polar regions by their ice caps, or to what other cause.
Such discoveries would add something to our knowledge of the
materials of the interior of our globe and their relation to those of
meteorites.

Still looking tor fresh knowledge in the same direction, a series of
pendulum observations should be taken at points as near as possible
to the pole. Within the Arctic circle the pendulum makes about 240
more vibrations per day than it does at the equator. The vibrations
increase in number there because the force of gravity at the earth’s
surface is more intense in that area, and this again is believed to be
due to the oblateness of that part of the earth’s figure, but it might
be caused by the bodily approach to the surface at the poles of the
masses of dense ultra-basic rocks just referred to. Thus, pendulum
experiments may reveal to us the earth’s figure, and a series of such
observations, recorded from such a vast and untried area, must yield
important data for the physicist to work up. We should probably
learn from such investigations whether the earth’s figure is as much
flattened at the Antarctic as it is known to be at the Arctic.

We now know that in the past the North Polar regions have enjoyed
a temperate climate more than once. Abundant seams of Paleozoic
coal, large deposits of fossiliferous Jurassic rocks, and extensive Eocene
beds, containing the remains of evergreen aud deciduous trees and
flowering plants, occur far within the Arctie circle. This circumstance
leads us to wonder whether the corresponding southern latitudes have
ever experienced similar climatic vicissitudes. Conclusive evidence on
this point it is difficult to get, but competent biologists who have ex-
amined the floras and faunas of South Africa and Australia, of New
Zealand, South America, and the isolated islets of the Southern Ocean,
find features which absolutely involve the existence of an extensive
Antarctic land—a land which must have been clothed with a varied
vegetation, and have been alive with beasts, birds, and insects. As it
also had had its fresh-water fishes, it must have had its rivers flowing
and not frost-bound, and in those circumstances we again see indica-
tions of a modified Antarctic climate. Let us briefly consider some of
the ovidence for the existence of this continent. We are told by Pro-
fessor Hutton, of Christchurch, that 44 per cent. of the New Zealand
flora is of Antarctic origin. The Auckland, Campbell, and Macquarie
Islands all support Antarctic plants, some of which appear never to
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 297

have reached New Zealand. New Zealand and South America have
three flowering plants in common, also two fresh-water fishes, five sea-
weeds, three marine crustaceans, one marine mollusk, and one marine
fish. Similarly New Zealand and Africa have certain common forms,
and the floras and faunas of the Kerguelen, the Crozets, and the Marion
Islands are almost identical, although in each case the islands are very
small, and very isolated from each other and from the rest of the world.
Tristan d’Acunha has fifty-eight species of marine Mollusca, of which
number thirteen are also found in South America, six or seven in New
Zealand, and four in South Africa (Hutton’s Origin of New Zealand
Flora and Fauna). Temperate South America has seventy-four genera
of plants in common with New Zealand, and eleven of its species are
identical (Wallace’s Zsland Life). Penguins of the genus Eudyptes
are common to South America and Australia (Wallace, Dist. of
Animals, 1399). Three groups of fresh-water fishes are entirely con-
fined to these two regions. Apbhritis, a fresh-water genus, has one
species in Tasmania and two in Patagonia. Another small group of
fishes known as the Haplochitonidie inhabit Tierra del Fuego, the
Falklands, and South Australia, and are not found elsewhere, while
the genus Galaxias is confined to South Temperate Ameriva, New Zea-
land, and Australia. Yet the lands which have these plants and
animals in common are so widely separated from each other that they
could not now possibly interchange their inhabitants. Certainly
towards the equator they approach each other rather more, but even
this tact fails to account for the present distribution, for, as Wallace
has pointed out, “the heat-loving Reptilia afford hardly any indica-
tions of close affinity between the two regions” of South America and
Australia, “ whilst the cold-enduring Amphibia and fresh-water fishes
offer them in abundance” (Wallace, Dist. of Animals, 1400). Thus
we see that to the north interchange is prohibited by tropical heat,
while it is barred to the south by a nearly shoreless circumpolar sea.
Yet there must have been some means of intercommunication in the
past, and it appears certain that it took the shape of a common father-
land for the various common forms from which they spread to the
northern hemisphere. As this father-land must have been accessible
from all these scattered southern lands, its size and its disposition must
have been such as would serve the emigrants either as a bridge or as
a series of stepping-stones. It must have been either a continent or
an archipelago.

But a further and a peculiar interest attaches to this lost continent.
Those who have any acquaintance with geology know that the placental
Mamimalia—that is, animals which are classed with such higher forms
of life as apes, cats, dogs, bears, horses, and oxen—appear very abruptly
with the incoming of the Tertiary period. Now, judging by analogy,
it is not likely that these creatures can have been developed out of
Mesozoic forms with anything like the suddenness of their apparent
298 ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.

entrance upon the scene. For such changes they must have required
along time, and an extensive region of the earth, and it is probable
that each of them had alengthy series of progenitors, which ultimately
linked it back to lower forms.

Why, then, it is constantly asked, if this was the sequence of crea-
tion, do these missing links never turn up? In reply to this query, it
was suggested by Huxley that they may have been developed in some
lost continent, the boundaries of which were gradually shifted by the
slow elevation of the sea margin on one side and its simultaneous slow
depression upon the other, so that there has always been in existence
a large dry area with its live stock. This dry spot, with its fauna and
flora, like a great raft or Noah’s Ark, moved with great slowness in
whatever direction the great earth-undulation travelled. But to-day
this area, with its fossil evidences, is a sea-bottom; and Huxley sup-
poses that the continent, which once occupied a part of the Pacific
Ocean, is now represented by Asia.

This movement of land-surface translation eastwards eventually
created a connection between this land and Africa and Europe, and if
when this happened the mammalia spread rapidly over these countries,
this circumstance would account for the abruptness of their appear-
ance there.

Now, Mr. Blanford, the president of the Geological Society of London,
in his annual address, recently delivered, advances matters a stage
further, for he tells us that a growing acquaintance with the biology of
the world leads naturalists to a belief that the placental mammalia and
other of the higher forms of terrestrial life originated during the Meso-
zoic period still further to the southwards—that is to say, in the lost
Auntaretie continent, for the traces of which we desire to seek,

But it almost necessarily follows that wherever the mammalia were
developed there also man had his birth-place, and if these speculations
should prove to have been well founded we may have to shift the loca-
tion of the Garden of Eden from the northern to the southern hemis-
phere.

I need hardly suggest to you that possibilities such as these must
add greatly to our interest in the recovery of any traces of this myste-
rious region. This land appears to have sunk beneath the seas after
the close of the Mesozoic. Now, the submergence of any mass of land
will disturb the climatie equilibrium of that region, and the disappear-
ance of an Autarctie continent would prove extremely potent in vary-
ing the climate of this hemisphere. For to-day the sun’s rays fall on
the South Polar regions to small purpose. The unstable sea absorbs
the heat, and in wide and comparatively warm streams it carries off
the caloric to the northern hemisphere to raise its temperature at the
expense of ours. But when extensive land received those same heat
rays, its rigid surfaces, so to speak, tethered their caloric in this hem1-
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 299

sphere, and thus when there was no mobile current to steal northwards
with it, warmth could accumulate and modify the climate.

Under the influences of such changes the icy mantle would be slowly
rolled back towards the South Pole, and thus many plants and animals
were able to live and multiply in latitudes that to day are barren.
What has undoubtedly occurred in the extreme north is equally possi-
ble in the extreme south. Butif it did ocecur—if South Polar lands,
now ice bound, were then as prolific of life as Disco and Spitzbergen
once were—then, like Spitzbergen and Disco, the unsubmerged rem-
nants of this continent may still retain organic evidences of the fact in
the shape of fossil-bearing beds, and the discovery of such deposits
would confirm or confute such speculations as these. The key to the
geological problem lies within the Antaretie Circle, and to find it would
be to recover some of the past history of the southern hemisphere.
There is no reason to despair of discovering such evidence, as Dr.
McCormack, in his account of Ross’s voyage, records that portions of
Victoria Land were free from snow, and therefore available for inves-
tigation; besides which their surface may still sapport some living
forms, for they can not be colder or bleaker than the peaks which rise
out of the continental ice of North Greenland, and these, long held to
be sterile, have recently disclosed the existence upon them of a rich
though humble flora.

We have now to consider some important meteorological questions.
If we look at the distribution of the atmosphere around the globe we
shall see that it is spread unequally. It forms a stratum which is
deeper within the tropics than about the poles and over the northern
than over the southern hemisphere, so that the barometer normals fall
more as we approach the Antarctic than they do when we near the
Arctic. Maury, taking the known isobars as his guide, has calculated
that the mean pressure at the North Pole is 29.1, but that it is only 28
at the South (Maury’s Meteorology, 259). In other words, the Aunt-
arctic Circle is permanently much barer of atmosphere than any other
part of the globe. Again, if we consuit a wind chart we shall see that
both poles are marked as calm areas. Each is the dead center of a
perpetual wind vortex, but the South, Polar indraught is the stronger.
Polarward winds blow across the forty-fifth degree of north latitude for
189 days in the vear, but across the forty-fifth degree of south latitude
for 209 days. And while they are drawn in to the North Pole from
over a disk-shaped area 5,500 miles in diameter, the South Polar in-
draught is felt throughout an area of 7,000 miles across. Lastly, the
winds which circulate about the South Pole are more heavily charged
with moisture than are the winds of corresponding parts of the other
hemisphere. Now, the extreme degree in which these three conditions,
of a perpetual grand cyclone, a moist atmosphere, and a low barom-
eter, co-operate without the Antarctic ought to produce within it an
exceptional meteorological state, and the point to be determined is
300 ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.

what that condition may be. Maury maintained that the conjunction
will make the climate of the South Polar area milder than that of the
north. His theory is that the saturated winds being drawn up to great
heights within the Antarctic must then be eased of their moisture, and
that simultaneously they must disengage vast quantities of latent heat;
and it is because more heat must be liberated in this manner in the
South Polar regions than in the north that he infers a less severe cli-
mate for the Antarctic. He estimates that the resultant relative differ-
ences between the two polar climates will be greater than that between
a Canadian and an English winter (Maury’s Meteorology, p. 466).
Ross reports that the South Polar summer is rather colder than that
of the north, but still the southern winter may be less extreme, and so
the mean temperature may be higher. If we examine the weather
reports logged by Antarctic voyagers, instead of the temperature
merely, the advantage still seems to rest with the south. In the first
place, when the voyager enters the Antarctic he sails out of a tem-
pestuous zone into one of calms. To demonstrate the truth of this
statement I have made an abstract of Ross’s log for the two months
of January and February, 1841, which he spent within the Antarctic
Circle. To enable everyone to understand it, it may be well to explain
that the wind force is registered in figures from 0, which stands for a
dead calm, up to 12, which represents a hurricane. I find that during
these 60 days it never once blew with the force 8—that is, a fresh gale;
only twice did it blow force 7, and then only for half a day each time.
Force 5 to 6—fresh to strong breezes—is logged on 21 days. Force 1
to 3—that is, gentle breezes—prevailed on 34 days. The mean wind
force registered under the entire 60 days was 3.43—that is, only a 4 to
5 knot breeze. On 38 days blue sky was logged. They never hada
single fog, and on 11 days only was it even misty. On the other hand,
snow fell almost every second day. We find such entries as these:
‘‘ Beautifully clear weather,” and ‘Atmosphere so extraordinarily clear
that Mount Herschel, distant 90 miles, looked only 30 miles distant.”
And again, ‘Land seen 120 miles distant; sky beautifully clear.” Nor
was this season exceptional, so far as we can tell, for Dr. McCormack,
of the Hrebus, in the third year of the voyage, and after they had left
the Antaretic for the third and last time, enters in his diary the fol-
lowing remark. He says: “It is a curious thing that we have always
met with the finest weather within the Antarctic circle; clear, cloudless
sky, bright sun, light wind, and a long swell” (McCormack’s Antarctic
Voyage, vol. 1, p- 345). It would seem as if the stormy westerlies, so
familiar to all Australian visitors, had given to the whole southern
hemisphere a name for bad weather, which, as yet at least, has not been
earned by the South Polar regions. It is probable, too, that the almost
continuous gloom and fog of the Arctic (Scoresby’s Arctic Regions,
pp. 97 and 137) July and August have prejudiced seamen against the
Antaretic summer. The true character of the climate of this region is
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 301

one of the problems awaiting solution. Whatever its nature may be,
the area is so large and so near to us that its meteorology must have a
dominant influence on the climate of Australia, and on this fact the
value of a knowledge of the weather of these parts must rest.

To turn to another branch of science, there are several questions re-
lating to the earth’s magnetism which require for their solution long-
maintained and continuous observations within the Antarctic circle.
The mean or permanent distribution of the world’s magnetism is be-
lieved to depend upon causes acting in the interior of the earth, while
the periodic variations of the needle probably arise from the superficial
and subordinate currents produced by the daily and yearly variations in
the temperature of the earth’s surface. Other variations occur at irregu-
lar intervals, and these are supposed to be due to atmospheric electricity.
All these different currents are excessively frequent and powerful about
the poles, and asufficient series of observations might enable physicists
to differentiate the various kinds of currents, and to trace them to their
several sources, whether internal, superiicial, or meteoric. To do this
properly at least one land observatory should be established for a period,
In it, the variation, dip, and intensity of the magnetic currents, as well
as the momentary fluctuations, of these elements would all be recorded.
Fixed term days would be agreed on with the observatories of Australia,
of the Cape, America, and Europe, and during these terms a concerted
continuous watch would be kept up all round the globe to determine
which vibrations were local and which general.

The present exact position of the principal south magnetic pole has
also to be fixed, ané data to be obtained from which to calculate the
rate of changes in the future, and the same may be said of the foci of
magnetic intensity and their movements. In relation to this part of the
subject, Captain Creak recently reported to the British Association his
conclusions in the following terms. He says: ‘‘ Great advantage to the
science of terrestrial magnetism would be derived from a new magnetic
survey of the southern hemisphere extending from the parallel of 409°
south, as far towards the geographical pole as possible.”

Intimately connected with terrestrial magnetism are the phenomena
of auroras. Their nature is very obscure, but quite recently a distinct
advance has been made towards discovering some of the laws which
regulate them. Thanks to the labors of Dr. Sophus Tromkolt, who
has spent a year within the Arctic circle studying them, we now know
that their movements are not as eccentric as they have hitherto ap-
peared to be. He telis us that the Aurora Borealis, with its crown of
many lights, encircles the pole obliquely, and that it has its lower edge
suspended above the earth at a height of from 50 to 100 miles, the mean
of 18 trigonometrical measurements, taken with a base line of 50 miles,
being 75 miles. Theaurora forms a ring round the pole which changes
its latitude four times a year. At the equinoxes it attains its greatest
distance from the pole, and at midsummer and midwinter it approaches
302 ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.

it most closely, and it has a zone of maximum intensity which is placed
obliquely between the parallels of 60° and 70° N. The length of its
meridional exeursion varies from year to year, decreasing and increasing
through tolerably regular periods, and reaching a maximum about every
11 years, when, also, its appearance simultaneously attains to its great-
est brilliancy. Again, it has its regular yearly and daily movements or
periods. At the winter solstice it reaches its maximum annual intensity,
and it has its daily maximum at from 8 P. M. and 2 A. M., according to the
latitude. Thus at Prague, in latitude 50° N., the lights appear at about
8.45 Pp. M.; at Upsala, latitude 60° N., at 9.30 P. M.; at Bossekop, 70° N.,
at 1.30 A. M. Now, while these data may be true for the northern
hemisphere, it remains to be proved how far they apply to the southern.
Indeed, seeing that the atmosphere of the latter region is moister and
shallower than that of the former, it is probable that the phenomena
would be modified. A systematic observation of the Aurora Australis
at a number of stations in high latitudes is therefore desirable.

Whether or not there is any connection between auroral exhibitions
and the weather is a disputed point. Tromholt believes that such a re-
lationship is probable (Under the Rays, 1283). He says that, ‘“how-
ever clear the sky, it always became overcast immediately after a vivid
exhibition, and it generally cleared again as quickly” (Under the Rays,
1235). Payer declares that brilliant auroras were generally succeeded by
bad weather (Voyage of Tegethoff, 1324), but that those which had a
low altitude and little mobility appeared to precede calms. Ross re-
marks of a particular display ‘that it was followed by a fall of snow,
as usual” (Ross’s Voyage, 1312). Scoresby appears to have formed
the opinion that there is a relationship indicated by his experience. It
is, therefore, allowable to regard the ultimate establishment of some con-
nection betwecn these two phenomena as a possible contingency. If,
then, we look at the eleven-year cycle of auroral intensity from the
meteorological point of view, it assumes a new interest, for these periods
may coincide with the eyeles of wet and dry seasons which some
meteorologists have deduced from the records of our Australian climate,
and the culmination of the one might be related to some equivalent
change in the other. For if a solitary auroral display be followed by a
lowered sky, surely a period of continuous auroras might give rise to a
period of continuous cloudy weather, with rain and snow. Fritz -con-
siders that he has established this eleven-year cycle upon the strength
of auroral records extending from 1583 to 1874, and his deductions have
been verified by others.

In January, 1886, we had a wide-spread and heavy rain-fall, and also
an auroral display seen only at Hobart, but which was sufficiently pow-
erful to totally suspend communication over all the telegraph lines situ-
ated between Tasmania and the China eoast. This sensitiveness upon
the part of the electric currents to aureral excitation is not novel, for

long experience on the telegraph wires of Scandinavia has shown that
*
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 303

there is such a delicate sympathy between them that the electric wires
there manifest the same daily and yearly periods of activity as those
that mark the auroras. The current that reveals itself in fire in the
higher regions of the atmosphere is precisely the same current that
plagnes the operator in his office. Therefore, in the records of these
troublesome earth currents, now being accumulated at the observatory
by Mr. Ellery, we are collecting valuable data, which may possibly
enable the physicist to count the unseen auroras of the Antarctic, to
calenlate their periods of activity and lethargy, and, again, to check
these with our seasons. But it need hardly be said that the observa-
tions which may be made in the higher latitudes and directly under
the rays of the Aurora Australis will have the greater value, because
itis only near the zone of maximum auroral intensity that the phenomena
are manifested in all their aspects. In this periodicity of the southern
aurora I have named the last scientific problem to which I had to direct
your attention, and I would point out that if its determination should
give to us any clew to the changes in the Australian seasons which
would enable us to forecast their mutations in any degree, it would give
to us, in conducting those great interests of the country which depend
for their success upon the annual rain-fall, an advantage which would
be worth many times over all the cost of the expeditions necessary to
establish it.

Finally, there is a commercial object to be served by Antarctic ex-
ploration, and it is to be found in the establishment of a whaling trade
between this region and Australia. The price of whalebone has now
risen to the large sum of £2,000 a ton, which adds greatly to the possi-
bilities of securing to the whalers a profitable return. Sir James Ross aud
his officers have left it on record that the whale cf commerce was seen
by them in these seas, beyond the possibility of a mistake. They have
stated that the animals were large, and very tame, and that they could
have been caught in large numbers. Within the last few years whales
have been getting very scarce in the Arctic, and in consequence of this
two of the most successful of the whaling masters of the present day,
Capts. David and John Gray, of Peterhead, Scotland, have devoted
some labor to collecting all the data relating to this question, and they
have consulted such survivors of Ross’s expedition as are still available.
They have published the results of their investigations in a pamphlet,
in which they urge the establishment of the fishery strongly, and they
state their conclusions in the following words. They say: **We think
it is established beyond doubt that whales of a species similar to the
right or Greenland whale, found in high northern latitudes, exist in
great numbers in the Antarctic seas, and that the establishment of a
whale fishery within that area would be attended with successful and
profitable results.” It is not necessary for me to add anything to the
opinion of such experts in the business. All I desire to say is that if
such a fishery were created, with its headquarters in Melbourne, it

would probably be a material addition to our prosperity, and it would
soon increase our population by causing the families of the hardy seamen
who would man the fleet to remove from their homes in Shetland and
Orkney and the Scotch coasts and settle here.

In conclusion, I venture to submit that I have been able to point to
good and substantial objects, both scientific and commercial, to justify
a renewal of Antarctic research, and | feel assured that nothing could
bring to us greater distinction in the eyes of the whole civilized world
than such an expedition, judiciously planned and skillfully carried out.
HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA.

By Col. B. Wirskowsk1, of the General Staff,
and Prof. J. HowArRD Gore, B.S., Ph. D.

From the time of the unification of the several Moscovite states there
has been felt the need of descriptions of the separate parts. Butit was
not until the middle of the sixteenth century that the inexact and un-
satisfactory “Great Plan” made any attempt towards filling this need.
Systematic geodetic operations, however, did not receive any attention
until the time of Peter the Great, who sent out foreigners, especially
invited for this purpose, together with such Russians as had been under
their instruction, to make surveys of different parts of the empire.
These disconnected surveys were made without any definite correlation
of the separate parts, and in a very crude manner—using cords for
measuring lines, astrolabes for angle determinations, and large quad-
rants for latitude observations.

When Delisle arrived in St. Petersburg in 1726, in response to an
invitation from the emperor, an impetus was given to the exact sciences.
In connection with the Academy of Sciences, founded likewise in 1726,
he organized special astronomic expeditions for determining, in addi-
tion to other work, the geographical position of points to check the
geography of the Great Plan, and to make such revisions as might be
necessary. In these operations longitudes were determined by the
eclipse of Jupiter’s satellites. The result of these expeditions was the
Russian Atlas, edited by the Academy in 1745, consisting of one gen-
eral and nineteen special maps, constructed on a seale of 34 versts* to
the inch. Notwithstanding its imperfections, this atlas was far superior
to any of its period, and ante-dated all general maps except those of
France and Italy.

Delisle awakened great interest in astronomy at Russia’s capital, and
secured the necessary permission and aid to observe every important
astronomic event that was visible from any part of her domain. This
created a need for assistants, and called forth a number of astronomers
whose names are known to us, as Krassilnikow, a member of Bering’s
expedition; Krashennikow, who made the first description of Kam-

chatka, and Roumovsky, explorer of northern European Russia. In
1789 the last named published a table of the geographical positions of
sixty-two stations in Russia. It may be remarked, in this connection,
that at that time no country of western Europe possessed such a
number of well-determined places.

In the eighteenth century the measurement of an are of the meridian
was even planned, but why it was not carried out is not known at the
present time. Delisle thought it possible to measure in the meridian of
St. Petersburg an are of 22° or 23°, and in the year 1737 a base line
was measured on the ice between St. Petersburg and Cronstadt and
several stations were selected.

In 1796, by order of the Emperor Paul, the Depot of Maps was insti-
tuted, which laid a solid foundation for a separate department specially
occupied with all the geodetic and cartographic work in the state.
Soon after Schubert gave special instruction in astronomy and geodesy,
looking to the better qualification of men for this work. But owing to
the troublesome times at the beginning of the present century, a stop
was put to the progress of all geodetic operations. However, carto-
graphic work was making rapid progress, not only in the interior of the
state, but in such neighboring states as the fortunes of war introduced
Russian troops, as for instance in 1816~18, while the army wasin France,
more than 10,000 square versts were mapped. Inthis survey mountains
were for the first time drawn by cross hatchings, according to Lehman’s
system.

After the close of the war with Napoleon geodetic operations in
Russia began to develop very rapidly, and lying at the foundation of
accurate maps, the practical value was so apparent that no obstacle to
their progress was encountered. The great extent of the country pre-
cluded the plan which naturally suggested itself of covering the entire
state with a network of triangulation before beginning the mapping.
Consequently independent nets were started which later could be
united and brought into a harmonious whole. Vilna was the first prov-
ince which was covered bya triangulation. It was prosecuted in 1816-
1821, under the direction of General Tenner, and is of interest to us be-
cause its principal triangle entered into the great meridional are.

This work rested on three bases measured with an apparatus con-
structed on the Borda principle under the supervision of Professor
Reisig. Tenner discovered that the behavior of the metal components
under varying temperatures was wholly unreliable and at once proposed
an apparatus consisting of only one metal, in the shape of a bar of iron
14 feet long, with a slide projecting beyond the end of one of the bars
to measure the interval between two bars when they are brought into
approximate contact. This device has been employed in a variety of
forms and is now known as the contact-siide. The temperature of the
bars during the measuring was ascertained from two thermometers on
each bar, the bulbs of which were inserted into the body of the bar,

)
HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA. 307

The anglesin this net were measured with repeating circles, employing
for each angle from twenty to fifty repetitions. For the probable error
of angle determinations 0/.62 was found to be anaverage. Astronomic
observations were made at only one point with the longitudes referred
to the observatory of Vilna.

Almost simultaneously with the above-named operations in Vilna, a
young enthusiastic astronomer of the Dorpat University, W. Struve,
acting in response to a request from the Livonian Economical Society,
covered Livonia with a trigonometrical net. In this work the angles
were measured with a sextant and the bases with wooden rods, so that
but little confidence can be placed in the results, still it was while en-
gaged upon this work that Struve formed a liking for geodesy and con-
ceived the plan of making a great are measurement for the purpose of
determining the lengths of degrees in different latitudes.

His great interest in the work attracted the attention of the univer-
sity authorities, and in answer to his request they furnished him with
the necessary means and instruments. The base apparatus was of his
own invention, and still bears his name. The salient feature intro-
duced in its construction was the contact lever, which indicated on a
graduated are over which one end of the lever swept the exact measur-
ing length each time the bar was put in place. Inclination was deter-
mined by means of a special level.

A large theodolite, provided with four verniers, served as the angle-
reading instrument. In this work Struve was the first to abandon the
seductive, unreliable method of repetition, using in its place the method
of directions. It was so apparent to many that an angle measured say
twenty times, with only one reading of the circle, would be affected by
an error only one-twentieth as large as if the single reading corre-
sponded to only one pointing. Struve clearly saw that this method
introduced other errors more pernicious than those of reading, but so
firmly was the borda repeating circle fixed in the confidence of its
users that had not Gauss embraced the new plan in his monumental
work it is likely that the method of repetition would have continued
to impair geodetic determinations. However much we are indebted to
Gauss for assisting in the change, we owe the inception to Struve.

The results of this first degree measurement, which extended from the
isle of Hohland, in the Finnish Gulf, to the town Jacobstadt, on the river
Dvina, are given in Struve’s Breitengradmessung in den Ostseeprovinzen
Russlands, Dorpat, 1831.

On finishing this work, Struve, seeing no natural obstacles in the
way, hoped to extend an are along the meridian of Dorpat. He was
soon in a position to take up this undertaking, since as director of the
observatory at Pulkova he was virtually at the head of all astronomic
and geodetic operations in Russia. Fortunately he received the appro-
bation of Emperor Nicholas, and under his patronage this branch of
scientific work prospered. The great are, which received well-nigh
uninterrupted attention for more than 40 years, had as its central fea-

ture the Baltic arc; to this was successively joined Feuner’s meridional
chains in the provinces of Vilna, Lithonia, Volynia, and Podolsky. In
the years 1830-1844, triangles were added until the chain reached from
the isle of Hohland to Tornea, in the north, and in the following years
Tenner carried the southern end through Bessarabia, terminating at
Staraja-Nekrasovka, at the mouth of the Danube. For the continua-
tion of the are northward from Tornea the co-operation of the Swedish
Government was necessary, as the best disposition of the triangles
threw the stations alternately in Russia and in Sweden, finally cross-
ing the north of Norway. Struve went to Stockholm to lay the matter
before King Oscar, who at once entered into the spirit of the under-
taking, and not only gave his consent but contributed aid in carrying
iton. In 1845, this part of the work was begun, and with the assist-
ance of Selander, on the part of Sweden, and Hansteen, for Norway,
the field work was completed in 1852.

This entire are comprises 25° 20’, in which there are 258 principal
triangles resting on ten base lines, and fixed in position on the earth’s
surface by astronomic observations at thirteen stations. As a supple-

ment to this work may be mentioned the chronometrical expedition |

between Pulkova and Dorpat, made in 1854. In this operation thirty-
one chronometers were transported ten times. The details of this are
measurement are given quite fully in “Are du Méridien,” which was
published in French and Russian in 1860. This are has entered into
all of the more recent determinations of the figure of the earth, and in
the computations of General Bonsdorff it alone gives for the ellipticity
sotss) Which agrees quite well with the best values.

Ares of parallel have also received some attention. In 1826, the
French Government announced that there was already in existence an
are of parallel approximately in latitude 47° N. from Brest, on the west,
to Tchernowizt, on the east, and that if the Russians would continue
this are eastward valuable geodetic data would result. The plan was
received with favor, but different obstacles intervened, so that it was
not until 1848 that it could be carried out. By this time the triangu-
lation had reached the so-called New Russia, and in the general pur-
pose to cover this entire section with a network of triangles General
Wrochenko, the chief, received instructions to so perform his work
that amongst his triangles there should be an uninterrupted chain
along this parallel of such strength and accuracy that they could form
an integral part of this are.

The field operations continued without serious interruption up to
their completion in 1856, extending over an are of about 20° ampli-
tude from Bologan to Astrakhan, at the mouth of the Volga. For this
work three bases have been measured in addition to the cheeks which
came down from the northern work. As the determination of the am-
plitude depends upon differences of longitudes this part of the work
was delayed awaiting the construction of telegraph lines. At the
HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA. 309

present time jongitudes of five stations are known, and the final results
will soon be published.

In 1860, it was decided to carry an are along the fifty-second parallel,
which, when completed, would have, between Haversfordwest, in Eng-
land, and Orsk, on the river Ural, an amplitude of 63° 31’. To Russia’s
share fell 29° 24’, while the other countries had their work finished. In
addition to this, Russia at this time had only a few triangles suitably
situated that were sufficiently accurate to form a part of this arc;
therefore it was necessary to revise some of the former work and to add
to it much that was wholly new. In the prosecution of this work
many obstacles were met with, especially while traversing the
marshes of Minsk, where, on account of the heavy timber and the flat
character of the ground, it was necessary to build high signals, in
some cases as much as 150 feet in height.

The field operations were completed in 1872. One can form an idea
of the magnitude of this triangulation when it is said that in Russia
there are 521 triangles, of which 199 are taken from Tenner’s nets in
Poland and along the Volga, while 122 were measured by Generai
Zilinsky especially for this are. They rest on seven base lines, two in
Tenner’s chain and five in the eastern part. Fifteen astronomical
stations have been occupied for longitude determinations, chiefly by
Russian officers, although six points were in other countries; these
were: Breslau, Leipzig, Bonn, Newport, Greenwich, and Haversford-
west. Time observations were made with portable transit instruments,
and latitudes were ascertained from observations made with the ver-
tical circles of Re psold. For the transmission of time, telegraphic
signals consisting of the turning aside of the needle of a galvanoscope
were employed. Between two complete determinations of time four
groups of twelve signals each were sent at irregular intervals of time,
varying from 13 to 17 seconds. Six repetitions of such a set consti-
tuted a longitude determination.

At the present time the computations are in press, forming parts of
volumes 46 and 47 of the Memoirs of the Topographic Section of the
General Staff. We are fortunately able to give the final results, as

310 HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA.

In 1816, was begun the general triangulation of Russia which was to
serve as the basis of accurate maps. At first the operations in differ-
ent sections were isolated, and when connections were made discrep-
ancies were discovered. This suggested to General Schubert, at the
time chief of triangulation in the province of St. Peterburgh, that a
central department having charge of all astronomic, geodetic, topo-
graphic, and cartographic work should be established. His proposal
was favorably received by the authorities, and in 1822, the Military
Topographic Corps was founded with Schubert at its head. At the
same time was organized the Topographic School, where young men
could prepare themselves for service in the corps. That the founder
showed great wisdom in forming his plan of organization is apparent
from the fact that but few changes have taken place up to the present
time.

This institution is charged with all operations looking towards the
complete mapping of all Russian possessions. These in a great part lie
in inhospitable climes, and many are the abode of deadly fevers or sav- .
age hordes, so that the work is of surpassing difficulty. All this, how-
ever, has delayed but not deterred the determined observers, so that at
the present time nearly all Russia is provided with a secondary trian-
gulation suitable for cartographic operations. In this work the only
important feature introduced was in the measurement of base lines by
means of wires. This method, known in Europe as the Jaderin appa-
ratus, consists of a pair of tapes of different metals, usually one brass
and one steel, each 25 metres long. In measuring both are used side
by side and are stretched under the action of a constant tension. Two
sliding scales attached to the top of a tripod are adjusted so that the
zero mark on one coincides with the end of the brass wire and the zero
of the other coincides with the end of the steel wire. Then the wires
are carried forward and the rear end of the brass wire is brought into
coincidence with the zero of the scale which had been adjusted to its
front end, and the same adjustment is made for the steel wire. If the
two wires should remain equal in length there would be no disagree-
ment in the zero marks, but as the rates of expansion of these two
metals are widely different the distance between the zeros at the first
laying of the wires is due to their unequal expansion, and each time
the wires are put in place this distance is augmented or diminished
according as the temperature is continually increasing or decreasing.
From this it can be seen that the entire base line can be regarded as
measured by a single length of an apparatus constructed on the Borda
principle and at a temperature equal to the mean temperature experi-
enced in measuring. With these wires great speed can be attained,
reaching as much as 8 kilometres a day, and judging from the Molos-
kowizy base, where the discrepancy between two measures was only
1 centimeter in a base 9,822 metres, sufficient accuracy is readily secured.

Not only for the purpose of determining the amplitude of ares of par-
HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA. roa

allel, but also for locating or correcting the location of points distant
from fixed observatories, was it early necessary to ascertain differences
of longitude. The first step in this direction was made in 1833, when
fifty-six chronometers were transported in the steamer Hercules to
points along the shores of the Baltic Sea. This was followed by several
large or primary expeditions, fixing points from which smaller or sec-
ondary expeditions radiated as from centers. The most important of
these is the well-known expedition carried on under the direction of
Struve, for determining the difference of longitude between Greenwich
and Pulkova. The next was between Pulkova and Moscow, with forty
chronometers. During these exchanges a great number of box chro-
nometers were transported in carriages, and it was found that in a good
spring vehicle, even over bad roads, the rate of the chronometers were
as constant as when they were carried by water. In the frequent ex-
peditions following these, when no less than eighty chronometers
were employed, observations and comparisons were made not only at
the terminal points, but also at several intermediate stations. The
great number of chronometers in use made it necessary to find some
weans of lessening the time necessary for their comparison. When, as
was at first the case, siderial and mean-time chronemeters were com-
pared, 4 minutes were lost while waiting for a coincidence. As the out-
come of this necessity Struve invented the thirteen striker, that is, a
chronometer making thirteen beats or strokes in 6 seconds. This
gives, whether comparing with a star or mean chronometer, a coinci-
dence every 6 seconds withina range of 0.02, which is sufficiently aceu-
rate. An uncompensated chronometer always formed a part of the
equipment, serving as a means for finding the temperature coefficients
of the compensated chronometers more satisfactorily than if tempera-
tures were taken from accompanying thermometers. As one would
expect, the Russians have made very elaborate investigations regarding
the rates of chronometers and their disturbing causes.

As soon as Russia was covered with a telegraphic net the new method
of determining difference of longitudes was tried and at once adopted
The first application of this scheme was in Finland, between the sta-
tions Cronstadt and Uleaborg. This was in 1860, and since that time
each year has witnessed at least one new determination. In 1868 ob-
servations were made for finding the longitudes of Wiborg, Lovisa, Hel-
singfors, and Albo with reference to Pulkova. In these operations
there was used for the first time the method of finding time by a tran-
sit instrument set in the vertical of Polaris. This method had been
known for along time, but had not been used because of the complicated
computations involved. But W. Diillen, of Pulkova, gave formule and
tables which made it possible to compute the correction of the clock
almost as quickly as if the observations were made in the meridian.

The greatest undertaking in the way of telegraphic longitudes are
the labors of Shamgorst and Kulberg, who, in 1873-76, gave a series of
oe HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA.

points from Moscow to Vladivostak, covering Siberia and embracing
ares having a total amplitude of more than 100°. This huge undertak-
ing had two objects in view: to give the exact position of a number of
stations which were to serve as the bases of numerous smaller opera-
tions, especially chronometric expeditions, and to determine in the
most accurate maner the longitude of stations where observations of
the transit of Venus were to be made in 1874. The observations were
made with portable transit instruments specially adapted for quick ani
convenient shifting in azimuth, making it possible to readily place the
instrument in the vertical of Polaris. For latitudes these same instru-
ments were used, being placed in the prime vertical. The account of
this expedition takes up nearly the whole of the thirty-eighth volume
of the Memoirs of the Topographical Section of the General Staff.
Upon examination it is found that the latitudes were affected with a
probable error of 0.1, while the probable error of a longitude deter-
mination is 0.043. From the successive transmission of time back-
wards and forwards the velocity of the galvanic current was found to be
93,548 kilometres per second.

While the triangulation was in progress, zenith-distances were ob-
served from which the heights of stations were completed, but these
operations have not been consistently followed out, so that there are
in many parts of Russia a lack of well-determined altitudes. General
Tenner gave due attention to this special werk, and in his chain he
united the Baltic and the Black Seas. His results showed that the
former is 0.53 fathom higher, but as the probable error is 1.5 fathoms
but little confidence was placed in the theory that there was any differ-
ence in the level of these two seas. But with the Caspian Sea a dif-
ferent state of affairs was supposed to exist. It had been suspected
that this sea was lower than either of the two just named, so in 1836~37,
a large expedition was organized, in which Fuss, Sawitch, and Sabler
were participants. They began at Kagalnik near the Asov Sea, crossed
the northern portion of the Caucasian deserts to the Tschornoi Rynok
on the Caspian. For greater accuracy the zenith distances were meas-
ured at very short distances, approximately 3.5 versts. These distances
were ascertained by computation from short lines measured by placing’
bars end to end on a rope stretched tight. The results, published in
1849, showed that the Caspian Sea is 85.45 feet lower than the Black
Sea. Subsequently almost the same value was obtained, but still later
a value 4 feet greater was found, suggesting that the level of the Cas-
pian is decreasing. This fact has had further demonstration. The
academician Lenz made a mark on arock near the town of Baku ex-
actly on a level with the sea; this mark in 1861 was 3.93 feet higher
than the water, and more recent comparisons show that the difference
is increasing.

The other Russian interior sea, the Aral, is, on the contrary, higher
than the level of the ocean. The special levelling party sent out for
HISTORY OF GEODETIC OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA. 313

this purpose in 1874, came to the conclusion that the Aral Sea is higher
than the Caspian by 243 feet.

In 1871, systematic spirit leveling was begun, and in its prosecution
many interesting facts have been brought to light. One of these is the
different levels of the water in the Baltic Sea. Taking 0 for the level
of water at Cronstadt, the height of the sea level proves to be:

Another is the discrepancy between spirit levelling and geodetic level-
ling in obtaining the elevation of the threshold of the Dorpat Observa-
tory. This amounts to nearly 4 metres, and is suggestive of a consid-
erable local disturbance.

The first local attraction observed in Russia was in the neighborhood
of Moscow, where, owing to the absence of hills, one might least ex-
pect a discrepancy between geodetic and astronomic results. Soon
after the completion of the triangulation in the province of Moscow
this deflection attracted public attention, and the astronomer Schweizer
undertook a special investigation, The result showed that in this
province, almost in the direction from east to west, there is a strip along
whose northern boundary there is a considerable (5/’) northern deflec-
tion, and on the southern border a southerly deflection of 10’. It is
supposed that along this belt there must be a vast extent of matter of
comparatively small density, or underlying it great cavities.

The most elaborate investigation of local deflection of the plumb-line
was made in the Caucasus by General Stebnizki and published in the
Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for 1870. From
the analysis of the astronomic and trigonometric operations executed
on both sides of the principal Caucasian ridge it became evident that,
in general, to the north of the mountains there exists a deflection to
the south and on the south an opposite deflection. The greatest dis-
crepancies in the astronomic and geodetic latitudes proved to be in
Viadikaukasus, —35”.76; in Alexandrovskaja, —18/.14; in Petrovk,
—18/.56; and in Dushet, +18/.29. Availing himself of the surveys
already executed furnishing a great number of very accurately deter-
mined points, General Stebnizki computed the effect which the attrac-
tion of the exterior mountainous mass would have upon the astronomic
latitude of the different stations. In these computations no attracting
mass was considered which was distant more than 240 versts, while the
chief disturbing causes were frequently found to lie within a circle with
a radius of 80 versts, the station occupying the central point. It was
found that the greater part of the noted discrepancies were sufficiently
accounted for by the law of attraction having regard to the exterior
mass alone. In the cases just cited the computed differences reduced
the station errors to 3”, —1/ .31, +2/.15 and —0’.86, But there are other

"

stations where the computed attraction is either insufficient for the ex-
planation of the observed discrepancy or even contradicts it. Among
such stations the following are remarkable:

As all of these stations lie approximately on the same parallel, and
each showed a strong deflection to tha south, there must lie to the south
under the surface of the earth an extent of matter of great density, or
to the north under the Caucasian ridge a mass of less density. The
latter hypothesis has found a parallel in the deflections observed near
the foot of the Himalaya Mountains. Besides the latitude deflections,
General Stebnizki calculated the deflections of the vertical at longitude
stations, but their number so far is insufficient to serve as a basis for
generalization.

For more than a century, the pendulum has been regarded in Russia
as a geodetic instrument of great value, but no very accurate observa-
tions were made prior to 1826~29, when Captain Lutke made a cruise
around the world on the man-of-war Seniavin. He swung a Kater
pendulum at ten stations. The results, published in 1833, gave for the
ellipticity 1: 267.8, or 1: 269 if two somewhat doubtful stations are
disregarded. Besides the desultory observations of Professor Parrot
of Dorpat in 1829, nothing of consequence was attempted until 1865-68,
when the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg sent out an expedition
in charge of Sawitch, Smyslow, and Lenz. They selected twelve
stations along the great Russian meridional are (Tornea, Nicolaistad,
St. Petersburg, Reval, Dorpat, Jakobstadt, Vilna, Belin, Kremenetz,
Kishener, Kamenetz and Ismail), and employed a reversible Repsold
pendulum. The results 1 : 309 for the ellipticity of the earth.

Since this time, many observations have been made in various portions
of the Russian domain, and with the pendulum work, as with all other
branches of geodetic operations, the best methods soon find a place, and
results are obtained that are comparable with those of any country.

In almost all investigations which the physicist carries out in the lab-
oratory, he has to deal with and to measure with accuracy those subtle
and to our senses inappreciable forces to which the so-called laws of
nature give rise. Whether he is observing by an electrometer the be-
havior of electricity at rest, or by a galvanometer the action of elec:
tricity in motion; whether in the tube of Crookes he is investigating the
power of radiant matter, or with the famous experiment of Cavendish
he is finding the mass of the earth—in these and in a host of other cases
he is bound to measure with certainty and accuracy forces so small that
in no ordinary way could their existence be detected; while disturbing
causes which might seem to be of no particular consequence must be
eliminated if his experiments are to have any value. It is not too
much to say that the very existence of the physicist depends upon the
power which he possesses of producing at will and by artificial means
forces against which he balances those that he wishes to measure,

I had better perhaps at once indicate in a general way the magnitude
of the forces with which we have to deal.

The weight of a single grain is not to our senses appreciable, while
the weight of a ton is sufficient to crush the life out of anyone ina
moment. A ton is about 15,000,000 grains. It is quite possible to
measure with unfailing accuracy forces which bear the same relation to
the weight of a grain that a grain bears to a ton.

To show how the torsion of wires or threads is made use of in meas-
uring forces, I have arranged what I can hardly dignify by the name of
an experiment. It is simply a straw hung horizontally by a piece of
wire. Resting on the straw is a fragment of sheet-iron weighing 10
grains. A magnet so weak that it can not lift the iron yet is able to
pull the straw round through an angle so great that the existence of the
feeble attraction is evident to everyone in the room.

Now it is clear that if, instead of a straw moving over the table simply,

we had here an arm in a glass case and a mirror to read the motion of
the arm, it would be easy to observe a movement a hundred or a thou-
sand times Jess than that just produced, and therefore to measure a
force a hundred or a thousand times less than that exerted by this feeble
magnet.

Again, if instead of wire as thick as an ordinary pin I had used the
finest wire that can be obtained, it would have opposed the movement
of the straw with afar less force. It is possible to obtain wire ten times
finer than this stubborn material, but wire ten times finer is much more
than ten times more easily twisted. Itis ten thousand times more easily
twisted. This is because the torsion varies as the fourth power of the
diameter, so we say 10x10 =1Q0; 100x100 =10,000. Therefore with
the finest wire, forces 10,000 times feebler still could be observed.

It is therefore evident how great is the advantage of reducing the
size of a torsion wire. Even if it is only halved the torsion is reduced
sixteen-fold. To give a better idea of the actual sizes of such wires and
fibers as are in use I shall show upon the screen a series of photographs
taken by Mr. Chapman, on each of which a scale of thousandths of an
inch has been printed.

(Fig. 2), which [ recently obtained from Messrs. Nalder Brothers, It is
only a little over one-thousandth of an inch in diameter. Ordinary
spun glass, a most beautiful material, is about one-thousandth of an
inch in diameter, and this would appear to be an ideal torsion thread
(Fig. 3). Owing to its fineness its torsion would be extremely small,
and the more so because glass is more easily deformed than metals.
Owing to its very great strength, it can carry heavier loads than would
be expected of it. I imagine many physicists must have turned to this
naterial in their endeavor to find a really delicate torsion thread. I
have so turned only to be diseppointed. It hasevery good quality but
one, and that is its imperfect elasticity. For instance, a mirror hung
by a piece of spun glass is casting an image of a spot of light on the
seale. If I turn the mirror, by means of a fork, twice to the right, and
then turn it back again, the light does not come back to its old point
of rest, but oscillates about a point on one side, which however is
slowly changing, so that it is impossible to say what the point of rest
really is. Further, if the glass is twisted one way first, and then the
other way, the point of rest moves in a manner which shows that it is
not influenced by the last deflection alone; the glass remembers what
was done to it previously. For this reason spun glass is quite unsuit-
able as a torsion thread ; it is impossible to say what the twist is at
any time, and therefore what is the force developed.

So great has the difficulty been in finding a fine torsion thread that
the attempt has been given up, and in all the most exact instruments
silk has been used. The natural cocoon fibers, as shown on the screen
(Fig. 4), consist of two irregular lines gummed together,
eacb about one two-thousandth of an inch in diameter.
These fibers must be separated from one another and
washed. Then each component will, according to the ex-
periment of Gray, carry nearly 60 grains before breaking,
and can be safely loaded with 15 grains. Silk is there-
fore very strong, carrying at the rate of from 10 to 20 tons
to the square inch. It is further valuable in that its tor-
sion is far less than that of a fiber of the same size of metal
or even of glass, if such could be produced. The torsion
of silk, though exceedingly small, is quite sufficient to
upset the working of any delicate instrument, because it is
never constant. At one time the fiber twists one way, and
another time in another, and the evil effect can only be
mnitigated by using large apparatus in which strong forces
are developed. Any attempt that may be made to increase
the delicacy of apparatus by reducing their dimensions is
at once prevented by the relatively great importance of the
vagaries of the silk suspension.

The result then is this. The smallness, the length of
period, and therefore delicacy, of the instruments at the

318 QUARTZ FIBERS.

physicist’s disposal have until lately been simply limited by the behavior
of silk. A more perfect suspension means still more perfect instruments,
and therefore advance in knowledge.

It was in this way that some improvements that I was making in an
instrument for measuring radiant heat came to a dead-lock about 2 years
ago. I would not use silk, and I could not find anything else that would
do. Spun glass even, was far too coarse for my purpose; it was a
thousand times too stiff.

There is a material invented by Wollaston long ago, which however
I did not try because it is so easily broken. It is platinum wire which
has been drawn in silver, and finally separated by the action of nitric
acid. A specimen about the size of a single line of silk is now on the
screen, showing the silver coating at one end (Fig. 5).

As nothing that I knew of could be obtained that would be of use to
me, I was driven to the necessity of trying by experiment to find some
new material. The result of these experiments was
the development of a process of almost ridiculous
simplicity which it may be of interest for me to show.

The apparatus consists of a small cross-bow, and
an arrow made of straw with a needle point. To
the tail of the arrow is attached a fine rod of quartz
which has been melted and drawn out in the oxy-
i) hydrogen jet. I have a piece of the same material
" in my hand, and now after melting their ends and
joining them together, an operation which produces
| a beautiful and dazzling light, all I have to do is to
liberate the string of the bow by pulling the trigger
' with one foot, and then if ali is well a fiber will have
been drawn by the arrow, the existence of which can
be made evident by fastening to it a piece of stamp
paper.

In this way threads can be produced of great
length, of almost any degree of fineness, of extraor-
dinary uniformity, and of enormous strength. I do
not believe, if any experimentalist had been prom-
ised by a good fairy that he might have anything he
desired, that he would have ventured to ask for any
one thing with so many valuable properties as these
fibers possess. I hope in the course of this evening
to show that I am not exaggerating their merits.

In the first place, let me say something about the
degree of fineness to which they can be drawn.
There is now projected upon the screen a quartz
fiber one five-thousandth of an inch in diameter (Fig.
6). This is one which I had in constant use in an instrument loaded
with about 30 grains, Jt has a section only one-sixth of that of a single

——

QUARTZ FIBERS. 319

line of silk, and it is just as strong. Not being or-
ganic, it is in no way affected by changes of moisture
and temperature, and so it is free from the vagaries
of silk which give so much trouble. The piece used
in the instrument was about 16 inches long. Had it
been necessary to employ spun glass, which hitherto
was the finest torsion material, then, instead of 16
inches, I should have required a piece 1,000 feet long,
and an instrument as high as the Eiffel tower to put
it in.

There is no difficulty in obtaining pieces as fine as
this, yards long if required, nor in spinning it very
much finer. There is upon the screen a single line
made by the small garden spider, and the size of this is
perfectly evident (Fig. 7). You now seea quartz fiber
far finer than this, or, rather, you see a diffraction phe-
nomenon, for no trueimage is formed at ail; but even
this is @ conspicuous object in comparison with the
tapering ends, which it is absolutely impossible to
trace in a microscope. The next two photographs,
taken by Mr. Nelson, whose skill and resources are
so famous, represent the extreme end of a tail of quartz, and though
the scale is a great deal larger than that used in the other photographs,
the end will be visible only to a few. Mr. Nelson has photographed
here what it is absolutely impossible to see. What the size of these
ends may be I have no means of telling. Dr. Royston Piggott has
estimated some of them at less than one-millionth of an inch, but what-
ever they are they supply for the first time objects of extreme smallness
the form of which is certainly known, and therefore I can not help look-
ing upon them as more satisfactory tests for the microscope than
diatoms and other things of the real shape of which we know nothing
whatever.

Since figures as large as a million can not be realized properly, it may
be worth while to give an illustration of what is meant by a fiber one-
millionth of an inch in diameter.

A piece of quartz an inch long and an inch in diameter would, if
drawn out to this degree of fineness, be sufficient to go all the way
round the world 658 times; or a grain of sand just visible—that is, one-
hundredth of an inch long and one-hundredth of an inch in diameter—
would make 1,000 miles of such thread. Further, the pressure inside
such a thread due to a surface tension equal to that of water would be
60 atmospheres. ;

Going back to such threads as can be used in instruments, I have
made use of fibers one ten-thousanth of an inch in diameter, and in
these the torsion is 10,000 times less than that of spun glass.

As these fibers are made finer their strength increases in proportion

320 QUARTZ FIBERS.

to their size, and surpasses that of ordinary bar steel, reaching, to use
the language of engineers, as high a figure as$0 tons totheinch. Fibers
of ordinary size have a strength of 50 tons to the inch.

While it is evident that these fibers give us the means of producing
an exceedingly small torsion, and one that is not affected by weather,
it is not yet evident that they may not show the same fatigue that
makes spun glass useless. I have therefore a duplicate apparatus with
a quartz fiber, and you will see that the spot of light comes back to
its true place on the screen after the mirror has been twisted round
twice.

T shall now for amoment draw your attention to that peculiar property
of melted quartz that makes threads such as [ have been describing a
possibility. A liquid cylinder, as Plateau has so beautifully shown, is
an unstable form. It can no more exist than can a pencil stand on its
point. It immediately breaks up into a series of spheres. This is well
illustrated in that very ancient experiment of shooting threads of resin
electrically. When the resin is hot, the liquid cylinders which are pro-
jected in all directions break up into spheres, as you see now upon the
screen. As the resin cools they begin to develop tails; and when it
is cool enough, #. ¢., sufficiently viscous, the tails thicken, and the beads
become less, and at last uniform threads are the result. The series of
photographs show this well.

There is a far more perfect illustration which we have only
to gointo the garden to find. There we may see in abundance
what is now upon the screen—the webs of those beautiful geo-
metrical spiders. The radial threads are smooth, like the one
you saw afew minutes ago, but the threads that go round
and round are beaded. The spider draws these webs slowly,
and at the same time pours upon them a liquid, and still
further to obtain the effect of Jaunching a liquid cylinder in
space he, or rather she, pulls it out like the string of a bow,
and lets it go with a jerk. ‘The liquid cylinder can not exist,
and the result is what you now see upon the screen (Fig. 8).
A more perfect illustration of the regular breaking up of a
liquid cylinder it would be impossible to find. The beads
are, as Plateau showed they ought to be, alternately large
and small, and their regularity is marvellous. Sometimes
two still Smaller beads are developed, as may be seen in the
second photograph, thus completely agreeing with the results
of Plateau’s investigations.

IT have heard it maintained that the spider goes round her
web and pldces these beads there afterwards. But since a
web with about 360,000 beads is completed in an hour—that
is, at the rate of about 100 a second—this does not seem likely. That
what I have said is true, is made more probable by the photograph of

QUARTZ FIBERS. Sait

a beaded web that I have made myself by simply stroking
a quartz fiber with a straw wetted with castor oil (Fig. 9).
It is rather larger than a spider line; but I have made
beaded threads, using a fine fiber, quite indistinguishable
from a real spider web, and they have the further similarity
that they are just as good for catching flies.

Now, going back to the melted quartz, it is evident that
if it ever became perfectly liquid it could not exist as a
fiber for an instant. It is the extreme viscosity of quartz,
at the heat even of an electric arc, that makes these fibers
possible. The only difference between quartz in the oxy-
hydrogen jet, and quartz in the are, is that in the first you
make threads and in the second are blown bubbles. I have
in my hand some microscopic bubbles of quartz showing all
the perfection of form and color that we are familiar with in
the soap bubble.

An invaluable property of quartz is its power of insulating
perfectly, even in an atmosphere saturated with water. The
gold leaves now diverging were charged some time before
the lecture, and hardly show any change, yet the insulator
is arod of quartz only three-quarters of an inch long, and the air is
kept moist by a dish of water. The quartz may even be dipped in tho
water and replaced with the water upon it without any difference in
the insulation being observed.

Not only can fibers be made of extreme fineness, but they are won-
derfully uniform in diameter. So uniform are they that they perfectly
stand an optical test so severe that irregularities invisible in any mi-
croscope would immediately be made apparent. Everyone must have
noticed when the sun is shining upon a border of tlowers and shrubs
how the lines which spiders use as railways to travel from place to
place glisten with brilliant colors. These colors are only produced when
the fibers are sufficiently fine. If you take one of these webs and exam-
ine it in the sunlight, you will find that the colors are variegated, and
the effect consequently is one of great beauty.

A quartz fiber of about the same size shows colors in the same way,
but the tint is perfectly uniform on the fiber. If the color of the fiber
is examined with a prism, the spectrum is found to consist of alternate
bright and dark bands. Upon the screen are photographs taken by
Mr. Briscoe, a student in the laboratory of South Kensington, of the
spectra of some of these fibers at different angles of incidence. It will
be seen that coarse fibers have more bands than fine, and that the num-
ber increases with the angles of incidence of the light. There are pecu-
liarities in the march of the bands as the angle increases which I can
not describe now. I may only say that they appear to move not uni-
formly but in waves, presenting very much the appearance of a cater-
pillar walking.

sae QUARTZ FIBERS.

So uniform are the quartz fibers that the spectrum from end to end
consists of parallel bands. Occasionally a fiber is found which presents
a slight irregularity here and there. A spider line is so irregular that
these bands are hardly observable; but as the phetograph on the
screen shows, it is possible to trace them running up and down the
spectrum when you know what to look for.

To show that these longitudinal bands are due to the irregularities,
I have drawn a taper piece of quartz by hand, in which the two edges
make with one another an almost imperceptible angle, and the spec-
trum of this shows the gradual change of diameter by the very steep
angle at which the bands run up the spectrum.

Into the theory of the development of these bands I am unable to
enter; that is a subject upon which your professor of natural philos-
ophy is best able to speak. Perhaps I may venture to express the
hope, as the experimental investigation of this subject is now rendered
possible, that he may be induced to carry out a research for which he
is so eminently fitted.

Though this is a subject which is altogether beyond me, I have been
able to use the results in a practical way. When it is required to place
into an instrument a fiber of any particular size, all that has to be done
is to hold the frame of fibers toward a bright and distant light, and
look at them through a low-angled prism. The banded spectra are
then visible, and it is the work of a moment to pick out one with the
number of bands that has been found to be given by a fiber of the de-
sired size. A coarse fiber may have a dozen or more, while such fibers
as I find most useful have only two dark bands. Much finer ones ex-
ist, showing the colors of the first order with one dark band; and fibers
so fine as to correspond to the white or even the gray of Newton’s
scale are easily produced.

Passing now from the most scientific test of the uniformity of these
fibers, I shall next refer to one more homely. It is simply this: the
common garden spider, except when very young, can not climb up one
of the same size as the web on which she displays such activity. She
is perfectly helpless, and slips down with a run. After vainly trying
to make any headway, she finally puts her hands (or feet) into her
mouth, and then tries again, with no better success. I may mention
that a male of the same species is able to run up one of these with the
greatest ease, a feat which may perhaps save the lives of a few of these
unprotected creatures when quartz fibers are more common.

It is possible to make any quantity of very fine quartz fiber without
a bow and arrow at all, by simply drawing out a rod of quartz over
and over again in a strong oxyhydrogen jet. Then, if a stand of any
sort has been placed a few feet in front of the jet, it will be found cov-
ered with a maze of thread, of which the photograph on the sereen rep-
resents a sample. This is hardly distinguishable from the web spun
QUARTZ FIBERS. 328

by this magnificent spider in corners of greenhouses and such places.
By regulating the jet and the manipulation, anything from one of these
stranded cables to a single ultra-microscope line may be developed.

And now that I have explained that these fibers have such valuable
properties, it will no doubt be expected that I should perform some
feat with their aid which, up to the present time, has been considered
impossible, and this I intend to do.

Of all experiments the one which has most excited my admiration is
the famous experiment of Cavendish, of which I have a full-size model
before you. ‘The object of this experiment is to weigh the earth by
comparing directly the force with which it attracts things with that
due to large masses of lead. As is shown by the model, any attraction
which these large balls exert on the small ones will tend to deflect this
6-foot beam in one direction, and then if the balls are reversed in posi-
tion the deflection will be in the other direction. Now, when it is con-
sidered how enormously greater the earth is than these balls, it will be
evident that the attraction due to them must be in comparison excess-
ively small. To make this evident the enormous apparatus you see
had to be constructed, and then, using a fine torsion wire, a perfectly
certain but small effect was produced. The experiment however could
only be successfully carried out in cellars and underground places,
because changes of temperature produced effects greater than those
due to gravity.*

Now I have—in a hole in the wall—an instrument no bigger than a
galvanometer, of which a model is on the table. The balls of the Cav-
endish apparatus, weighing several hundredweight each, are replaced
by balls weighing 13 pounds only. The smaller balls of 13 pounds are
replaced by little weights of 15 grains each. The 6-foot beam is re-
placed by one that will swing round freely in a tube three-quarters of
an inch in diameter. The beam is, of course, suspended by a quartz
fibre. With this microscopic apparatus, not only is the very feeble
attraction observable, but I can actually obtain an effect eighteen times
as great as that given by the apparatus of Cavendish, and, what is
more important, the accuracy of observation is enormously increased.

The light from a lamp passes through a telescope lens and falls on
the mirror of the instrument. It is reflected back to the table, and
thence by a fixed mirror to the scale on the wall, where it comes to a
focus. If the mirror on the table were plane, the whole movement of
the light would be only about 8 inches, but the mirror is convex, and
this magnifies the motion nearly eight times. At the present moment
the attracting weights are in one extreme position, and the line of light
is quiet. I will now move them to the other position, and you will see
the result—the light slowly begins to move, and slowly increases in

movement. In 40 seconds it will have acquired its higbest velocity,
and in 40 more it will have stopped at 5 feet 84 inches from the start-
ing point, after which it will slowly move back again, oscillating about
its new position of rest.

It is not possible at this hour to enter into any calculations; I will
only say that the motion you have seen is the effect of a force of less than
one ten-millionth of the weight of a grain, and that with this apparatus
I can detect a force two thousand times smaller still. There would be
no difficulty even in showing the attraction between two No. 5 shot.

And now in conclusion, I would only say that if there is anything
that is good in the experiments to which I have this evening directed
your attention, experiments conducted largely with sticks and string
and straw and sealing-wax, I may perhaps be pardoned if I express my
conviction that in these days we are too apt to depart from the simple
ways of our fathers, and instead of following them, to fall down and
worship the brazen image which the instrument-maker hath set up.

Li.

Before I enter upon the subject upon which I have to address you, I
wish to point out that, quite apart from any deficiency on my part which
will be only too apparent in the course of the evening, it is my inten-
tion to commit two faults which may well be considered unpardonable.
In the first place, I shall speak entirely about my own experiments, even
though I know that theiteration of the first personal pronoun for the
space of one hour is apt to be as monotonous to an audience as it is
wanting in taste on the part of a lecturer. In the second place, I am
going almost to depend upon the motions of a spotof light to illustrate
the actions which I shall have to describe, in spite of the fact that it is
impossible for an audience to get up any enthusiasm when watching
the wandering motion of a spot of light the result of the manipulation
of a mystery box, of which it is impossible to see the inside. These
however are faults which are the immediate consequence of the nature
of my subject.

Physicists deal very largely with the measurement of extremely mi-
nute forces, which it is of the utmost importance that they should be able
to measure accurately. Now, forees may be considered under two
aspects. It may be that the force which is developed and which has
to be measured is a twist, in which case the twisting force may be ap-
plied to the end of a wire directly, when the amount through which
that wire is twisted is a measure of the twisting force. Or the force
may bea direct pull or a push, which may also be measured by the
twist of a wire if itis applied to the end of a lever or arm carried by the
wire.

* Lecture delivered on September 8, 1890, at the Leeds meeting of the British Asso-
ciation.

QUARTZ FIBERS. 325

Now supposing that the foree—whether of the nature of a twist or of
a pull (it does not matter which)—is too small to produce an appreciable
twist in the wire, it is obvious that a finer wire must be employed, but
it is not obvious how much more easily a fine wire is twisted than a
coarse one. If the fine wire is one-tenth of the diameter of the coarse
one, we must multiply ten by itself four times over in order to find how
much more easily twisted it is, and thus obtain the enormous number
10,000; it is 10,000 times more easily twisted than the coarse one.
Thus there is an enormous advantage in increasing the minuteness of
the wire by means of which feeble twisting or pulling forces are meas-
ured. Butif the delicacy of the research is such that even the finest
wire which can be made is still too stiff, then, even though with such
wire, which is somewhere about the thousandth of an inch in diameter,
forces as small as the millionth part of the weight of a single grain can
be detected with certainty, the wire is of no use; and as wire can not be
made finer, some other material must be used. Spun glass is fine and
strong, and is still more easily twisted than the finest wire, but it
possesses a property somewhat analogous to putty. When it has been
twisted and then let go, it does not come back to its old place, so that
though it is much more largely twisted than wire by the application of
a force, it is not possible with accuracy to measure that force. There
is, or rather I should say there was, no material that could be used as
a torsion thread finer than spun glass; and therefore physicists use in-
stead a fiber almost free from torsion. A single thread of silk as spun
by the silkworm is taken and split down the middle, for it is really
double, and one-half only is used. This is far finer than spun glass,
and being softer in texture, it is much more easily twisted. Silk is ten
thousand times more easily twisted than spun glass. So easily twisted
is silk that in the majority of instruments the stiffness of the silk is
either of no consequence at all, or at any rate it only produces but the
slightest disturbing effect. Now, if it is necessary to push the investiga-
tion further still by the continued increase in the delicacy of the appa-
ratus, silk itself begins to prevent any progress. Silk has a certain
stiffness, but if that were always the same it would not matter; but
then it possesses that putty-like character of spun glass, but in a far
higher degree; it is affected by every variation of temperature and
moisture, and any really delicate measures are out of the question when
silk is used as the suspending fiber.

This, I believe, is a fairly accurate account of the state of the case, three
years ago. At that time I was improving, or attempting to improve, a
certain class of apparatus of which I shall have more to say presently,
and I was met by the difficulty that a greater degree of delicacy was
required than was possible with existing torsion threads. Silk would
have entirely prevented me from reaching the degree of delicacy and
certainly in this instrument that I hope to show this evening that I have
attained.
326 QUARTZ FIBERS.

Being then in this difficulty I was by good fortune and necessity led
to devise a process which | propose at onee to show you. I shall not
describe the preliminary experiments, but simply describe the process
as it stands. There is a small cross-bow held in a vice, and a little
arrow made of straw with a needle point, and I have here a fragment
of rock crystal which has been melted and drawn into arod. It re-
quires a temperature greater than that developed in any furnace to
melt this material so that it may be drawn out. If the arrow, which
also carries a piece of the quartz rod, is placed in the bow, and if both
pieces are heated up to the melting point and joined together, and then
the arrow is shot, a fiber of quartz is drawn,—that is to say, it is drawn
if there is not an accident.

The arrow has flown, and there is now a fiber not very fine this time,
which I shall hand to our president. At the same time I can pass him
a piece of much finer fiber, made this afternoon, which shows (and this
is a proof of its fineness) all the brilliant colors of the spider line when
the sun shines upon it, but with a degree of magnificence and splendor
which has never been seen on any natural object.

The main features of these fibers are these. You can make them as
fine as you please; you can make them of very considerable length;
you can make pieces 40 or 50 feet long, without the slightest trouble, at
almost every shot. Even though of that great length, they are very
uniform in diameter from end to end, or at any rate the variation is
small and perfectly regular. Thestrength of the fiber is, I think Imay
safely say, something astonishing. Fibers such as I have in use at the
present time in an instrument behind me are stronger than ordinary
bar steel; they carry from 60 to 80 tons to the square inch. That is
one of their most important features, for this reason,—that on account
of their enormous strength you can make use of very much finer fibers
than would be possible if they were not so strong; and I have already
explained the importance of the fineness of the fiber when delicacy is
of the first importance.

As to the diameter of these fibers, I have said they can be made as fine
as you please. I shall not trouble you with a large number of figures,
but one or two may probably be interesting to those who are in the
habit of using philosophical apparatus. In the first place, a fiber a
great deal finer that a single fiber of silk (that is, one five-thousandth
of an inch in diameter), will carry an apparatus more than 30 grains
in weight. I have in one of the pieces of apparatus which I shall use
presently, a fiber the fifteen-thousandth of an inch in diameter. That
is, so fine that if you were to take a hundred of them and twist them
into a bundle you would produce a compound cable of the thickness of
a single silkworm’s thread. Ido not mean the silk used for sewing that
is wound on a reel, because that is composed of an enormous number
of silk threads; but a single silkworm’s thread as it is wound from the
- QUARTZ FIBERS. 327

cocoon, and that fiber is at the present time carrying a mirror the move-
ments of which will presently be visible in all parts of this large room.

But that is by no means the limit of the degree of fineness which can
be reached. A fiber the fifteen-thousandth of an inch in thickness is
quite a strong and conspicuous object. You may go on making them
until you can not see them with the naked eye. You may go on follow-
ing them with the microscope until you can not see them with the micro-
scope—that is to say, you can not find their end,—they gradually go
out. The ends are so fine that it is impossible ever to see them in any
microscope that can be constructed, not because the microscopes are
bad, but because of the nature of light. But that is a point upon which
I shall not say more this evening. It has been estimated that probably
the ends of some of these are as fine as the millionth part of an inch—
I do not care whether they are or whether they are not, because they
can never be seen and never be used—but certainly the hundred-thou-
sandth of an inch is by no means beyond the limit which ean be obtained.
As these large numbers of hundreds of thousands and millions are
figures which it is impossible for anybody thoroughly to realize, I may
for the purpose of illustration say that if we were to take a piece of
quartz about as big as a walnut, and if we could draw the whole of that
into a thread one hundred-thousandth of an inch in diameter—threads
which can certainly be produeed—there would be enough to go round
the world about six or seven times.

These quartz fibers, on account of their fineness, are eminently capa-
ble of measuring minute forces—that is to say, they would be capable
if they were free from that putty-like quality which I have described
as making spun glass useless. Now, experiments made both in this
country and in Australia show that to a most extraordinary degree
they are perfectly free from that one fault of spun glass.

The number of useful properties of quartz that has been melted is so
great that I can merely take, in amore or less disjointed way, one or
two; and I propose, in the first place, to say something which I think
may be especially interesting to chemists and perhaps to our president.
I should like to ask experimental chemists what they would think of
a material which could be drawn into tubes, blown into bulbs, joined
together in the same way that glass is joined, drawn out, attached to
a Sprengel pump, sealed off with a Sprengel vacuum which would be
transparent, which would be less acted upon than glass by corrosive
chemicals, and which finally at the point at which platinum is as fluid
as water would still retain its form. Here is such a tube with a bulb
blown at the end. I have found that it is possible to make tubes
(though it can not be done in the ordinary way as with glass) and to
blow bulbs with quartz, and that they have this advantage which glass
does not possess, namely, that it is almost impossible to crack them
by the sudden application of heat.

Then there is another property which quartz fibers and rods possess
328 QUARTZ FIBERS.

which I shall be able to show only imperfectly, namely, the power of
insulating anything charged with electricity under conditions under
which in general insulation is impossible. You now see upon the screen
an electroscope, the leaves of which were charged at noon, and they
are still divergent, but not to a very great extent, because they have
suffered from unavoidable shaking during the day. The point to
which I especially wish to refer is this. In electroscopes and all elec-
trostatic apparatus one puts in a dish of sulphuric acid, (which is an
abomination,) in order to keep the atmosphere dry. I have in tiis
electroscope such a dish, but it is filled with water in order to keep the
atmosphere moist. Experiments carefully made, using the same box——
everything the same, except that in one case the insulating stem was
made of quartz and in the second case it was made of the best flint
glass well washed, of the same shape and size—show that if the
atmosphere is perfectly dry the electricity escapes from both at the
same rate; but that if the atmosphere is perfectly moist the electricity
escapes from the leaves insulated by the clean washed flint glass
only too quickly; whereas, from the leaves insulated by the quartz the
rate is identically the same as it was in cither case when the atmos.
phere was perfectly dry.

I have said that these fibers are uniform in diameter, and fine and
smooth and strong, and that they glisten with ail the colors of the
spider web, but that they are far more brilliant. It was naturally
rather a curious point to note what a spider would do if by any chance
she should find herself on such a web; and now that I am dealing with
live and wild animals which can not possibly be trained, the conditions
are such as to render the success of an experiment entirely a matter of
chance. However, I propose to make use of the spider as a test of the
very great smoothness and slipperiness of one of these fibers. There
are here three little spiders which have been good enough, since they
came to Leeds, to spin upon these little wooden frames their perfect
and beautiful geometrical webs. I have succeeded in placing one of
these frames in the lantern without disturbing the spider, which you
can now see waiting upon her web. I must now, without disturbing
the peace of mind of the spider, carry her to a web of quartz; and
therefore it is necessary that the spider should be fortunate enough to
catch a fly. Now, instead of bringing a fly I will make an ordinary
tuning-fork buzz against the web. She immediately pounces upon the
imaginary fly, and thus I can without frightening her place her upon
the quartz fiber. Unfortunately this spider has slipped and has got
away, but with another I am more successful. I intended to show that
the small and common garden spider could not climb the quartz fiber,
but for some reason this spider is able to get up with difficulty. How-
ever I shall not spend any more time upon this experiment.

I shall now at once speak about the instrument which actually led
me to the invention of the process for making quartz fibers. ‘This,

QUARTZ FIBERS. 329

which I have called a radio-micrometer, is an instrument of very great
delicacy for measuring radiant heat from such a thing as a candle, a fire,
the sun, or anything else which radiates heat through space. .

The radio-micrometer which I wish to show this evening is resting
upon a solid and steady beam, and as usual its index is a spot of light
upon the scale. You see that that spot of light is almost perfectly
steady. Now the heat that I propose to measure, or rather the influence
of which I intend to show you, is the heat which is being radiated from
a candle fixed in the front of the upper gallery some 70 or 80 feet from
the instrument ; and in order that you may be sure that the indication
of the instrument is due to the heat from the candle, and not to any
manipulation of the apparatus on the beam, I shall perform the experi-
ment as follows. None of the apparatus at this end of the room will
be touched or moved in any way; but by a string I shall simply pull
the candle along a slide up to a stop, at which position it will shine
upon the sensitive part of the radio-micrometer. Instantly the spot of
light darts along the scale for a distance of ten feet, and then after
leaving the scale it comes to rest upon the face of the balcony five or
six seconds after it began to move. Now if the candle is allowed to
move back through about a foot, you will see that the instrument will
cool down at once—it is at present suffering from the heat which falls
upon it from the distant candle; but it will cool down at once, and the
index will go back to its old place. It is very nearly at its old place
now. I will now let the candle shine uponit again. The index at once
goes on to the balcony as before, and now that the candle is moved
away again, the index has assumed its old place upon the scale.

That really shows that we have here the means of measuring heat
with a degree of delicacy, and also with a degree of certainty, ease,
and quickness, which has never yet been equalled. It is probable that
the measure which I have given of the degree of delicacy that I have
reached in my astronomical apparatus—namely, that the heat of a can-
dle more than two miles away can certainly be felt-——will not seem so
absurd now that you have seen this less perfect apparatus at work, as
it does to people whose experience is limited by the thermopile or their
senses.

You can now see the spot of light; itis perfectly quiet in its old
place. I wish to show you that this instrument is unlike those which
are ordinarily used for this purpose. All the heat, the very consider-
able heat, due to this electric are lamp, is actually falling on the in-
strument, but not upon its sensitive surface, and there is no indication.
There are a large number of people in the room—it does not feel the
heat from them. Stray heat which it is not meant to feel—which is not
in the line along which it can see, or feel—has no influence upon it.
When the candle was moved to the place to which it was looking, it
felt the heat, and you saw the movement of the index. What is per-
haps more important than all is that it is an instrument which does
330 QUARTZ FIBERS.

not even feel the influence of a magnet. I have here a magnet, and on
waving the magnet about near the instrument there is no movement of
the index at all; it does not dance up and down the seale, as it cer-
tainly would do in the case of a galvanometer, because this magnet
would affect a galvanometer at the other end of the room. We have
then a degree of sensibility which is certainly not easily developed in any
other way. I must except however the instrument which Professor
Langley of America has recently brought to a great state of perfection.
IT am unable to state, from want of information, whether his instrument
is as Sensitive as the one I have just shown, but whether it is or is not
as sensitive, it certainly can not compare with this in its freedom from
the disturbing effects of stray heat falling upon it, or of the magnetic
or thermo-electric disturbances which give so much trouble where the
galvanometer is employed.

Now this apparatus I was recently using in some astronomical ex-
periments on the heat of the moon and the stars. As these experi-
ments could only be made with an instrument such as this, possessing
extreme sensibility and freedom from extraneous disturbances, and as
this instrument is both the cause of the discovery and the first result
of the application of the quartz fibers, I have thought it well to repeat
a typical experiment upon the moon’s heat, but, dike Peter Quince, I
am in this difficully. As he said, “There is two hard things, that is to
bring the moonlight into a chamber.” In fact, at the present time the
moon has not risen, and if it had we should not be much better off.
Peter Quince proposed that they should in case of moonlight failing
havea “lanthorn” anda buneh of thorns. That no doubt was sufficient
for the conversation of Pyramus and Thisbe, but that would not do for
the purpose of showing the variation of radiation from point to point
upon the moon’s surface, and as that is the experiment which I now
wish to show—an experiment which this instrument enables one to
make with the greatest ease and certainty—it is necessary to have
something better than a “lanthorn” and a bunch ofthorns. Therefore I
have been obliged, as the moon is not available, to bring a moon.
Now this moon is a real moon; it is not a representation; it is not a
slide; it is a real moon, and it is made by taking an egg-sheill and
painting it white. That egg-shell is now placed upon a stand, and is
illuminated by the sun—that is, an eleetrie light; and in order that
the moon may be visible, the room must be darkened. The moon is
now shining in the sky. An image of the moon is cast by means of a
concave mirror upon a translucent sereen. There is in addition an-
other mirror which throws a small image of the same moon upon the
radio-micrometer There is one more thing to explain. There is upon
the screen a black spot which represents the sensitive surface of the
radio-micrometer. That bears the same proportion to the moon which
vou see on the screen as the sensitive surface of the radio-micrometer
bears to the image of the moon that is cast upon it. Now the two mir-
QUARTZ FIBERS. oon

rors are arranged to move by clock-work, so as to make the two images
travel at proportional rates. The moon is travelling with the dark edge
foremost, and now that the terminator of the moon has come upon the
sensitive surface, the heat is felt and the deflection of the instrument
is the result. Now, as the moon is gradually travelling through the
sky, the radiation is slowly and steadily increasing, because the radia-
tion from the moon gets greater and greater, as the point at which
the sun is shining vertically—that is, a point at right angles with the
terminator—is approached; it is here a maximum, and then it falls
back, and as soon as the moon has gone off the instrument, you will
see the index fall back almost suddenly. But there is something more.
This moon in one respect is better than the other moon. At the pres-
ent time it represents the moon nineteen days old, a moon, that is to
say, which is waning, and which goes through the sky with its dark
edge foremost. The clock-work will now bring the moon back again,
and convert the nineteen-day moon into a nine-day moon, one in which
the bright edge goes forward. What I want you to notice (and it will
be perfectly evident) is this, that the spot of light will now go up the
scale suddenly, will then rise to a maximum position, and will then fall
slowly until the terminator is reached, which proves that in the former
case the slow rise and sudden fall, or the present sudden rise and slow
fail was not a peculiarity of the instrument, but was due to the fact
that the different points of the moon radiated in the manner which I
have stated. There is one point which, as the moon has now left the
instrument, I should like to show; that is, that it is a real moon and
not a mere slide. That is shown by gradually moving the sun round.
Now it is at right angles to the line of view, and we have got the half:
moon. As if goes round, the moon continues waning, appearing more
like anew moon, and at last we have an eclipse of the sun, which may be
annular if the proportions of the apparatus are properly arranged.

I wish now to make a few statements as to the delicacy of apparatus
that can be made with the help of quartz fibers. I would wish you
most distinctly to understand that it is not sufficient to go into a shop
and buy apparatus as it is now made, replace the silk by quartz, and
to suppose you can get a degree of delicacy such as I have shown you.
That is not sufficient. If you take out the silk and put in a quartz fiber
the apparatus will be much improved, and you can then increase its
delicacy. You will then escape the troubles due to silk; but one after
the other a new series of disturbances will appear, and anything like
ultimate, extreme, and minute accuracy will still seem out of the ques-
tion. Now, it has been my business to eliminate one by one these dis-
turbing influences. I will not weary you with a description of them all,
and the methods by which they may be certainly provided against.
These disturbing causes, which at the present time with instruments
carrying a silk fiber are not even known to exist, or if known to exist,
are practically of no consequence whatever, come one by one into prom-
aon QUARTZ FIBERS.

inence, when you attempt to push the delicacy of your apparatus to the
extent that I have reached in the home-made apparatus which I have
here thisevening. I do not propose to give more than one illustration,
and as this is one which I found out by accident, and which at the time
very much annoyed me, I imagine that it may be of interest to explain
the circumstances under which this was observed.

In the experiments I made on the heat of the moon and the stars it
was necessary to determine to what degree of delicacy the apparatus
could be brought,—that is to say, to determine what deflection would
be produced by a known and familiar source of radiation. For this pur-
pose the source of heat that I used was a common candle, placed suffi-
ciently far off to produce a convenient deflection. I began by placing
the candle about 100 yards away, but I was obliged to place the candle
at a distance of 250 yards. At that distance I could not conveniently
at night turn the shutter on and off with a string. Therefore I adopted
the more simple and practical plan of asking my niece to stand at. the
top of the hill and to pull the string when I gave the signal. The signal
was nothing more nor less than my saying the word “ on” or “ off,” so
that without moving I could observe the deflection due to the heat of
the candle at that distance. Those were the circumstances, but when
I shouted “on,” before the sound could have reached my niece at the
top of the hill, the spot of light had been driven violently off the scale.
This seemed as if, as I suspected at the time, one of my little eight-
legged friends had got inside the apparatus, and feeling the trembling
due to the sound, struck forward, as the diadema spider is known to do,
and tried to catch the thing that was flying by. But further experiments
showed that this was not the case. It happened that the sound of my
voice was just that to which the telescope tube would respond. It echoed
to that note, the instrument felt the vibration of the air, and that was
the result.

In order to show that an instrument will feel the motion in the air
under the influence of sound, I have arranged an experiment of the sim-
plest possible character. I should say that the first instrument of this
kind was made many years ago by Lord Rayleigh; but I feel sure that
even he would not be prepared for the delicacy to which apparatus on
this principle can be brought. It simply depends upon this familiar
and well-known fact. A card or a leaf allowed to drop through the air
does not fall the way of the least resistance—that is, edgeways—but it
turns into the position of greatest resistance, and falls broadside on, or
it overshoots the mark, and so gets up a spin.

Supposing you take a little mirror suspended at an angle of 45 de-
grees to the direction of the waves of sound, the instant sound-waves
_ proceed to travel, that mirror turns so as to get into such a position as
to obstruct them. The mirror that I have for this purpose weighs
about the twentieth part of a grain, and the fiber on which it is sus-
pended is about the fifteen-thousandth part of an inch in diameter.
QUARTZ FIBERS. 333

The mirror is so small and light that the moment of inertia is a two-
hundredth part of that which people ordinarily call the minute and
delicate needle of the Thomson mirror-galvanometer. With a fiber
only a few inches long, there is no difficulty in getting a period of oscil-
lation of 10 or 11 seconds. When the light from the lamp is reflected
and falls upon the scale, as it will be in a minute, then a movement of
the light from one of those great divisions to the next—that is, a move-
ment of 3 inches—will correspond to a twisting force such as would
be produced by pulling the end of a Jever an inch long with a force of a
thousand-millionth part of the weight of a grain. It would be easy to
observe a movement ten or a hundred timesless. My difficulty now is
that it is impossible to speak and at the same time to keep that spot
at rest, because the instrument is arranged to respond to a certain
note. This is not the predominating note of my voice, but since the
voice, like all other noises as distinguished from pure musical sounds,
consists of a great number of notes, every now and then the note to
which the instrument is tuned is sure to be sounded, and then it will
respond. Therefore, while I am speaking it is impossible to keep the
spot of light at rest. However, in order to show that the instrument
does respond to certain notes, even if feeble, with a degree of energy
and suddenness which I believe would never be expected, I shall with
these small organ pipes sound three notes. But I must explain before-
hand what I am going to do, as the sound of my voice will spoil the
experiment. I shall, standing as far away as I can get from the instru-
ment, first sound a note that is too high; I shall then sound a note
that is too low; and then I shall sound the note to which the instru-
ment is tuned. I must ask everyone during this experiment to be as
quiet as possible, as the faintest sound of the right sort will interfere
with the success of the experiment. [The first two notes sounded
loudly produced no result, while the moment the right note was heard
the light went violently off the scale and travelled round the room.|
When this little organ pipe was blown at the farthest end of the room
this afternoon, it drove the light off the scale almost as violently as it
did just now.

[The Cavendish experiment of observing the attraction due to grav-
itation between masses of lead was then explained, and the actual
experiment, performed with apparatus no larger than a galvanometer,
in which the attracting masses were two pounds and fifteen grains, re-
spectively, in which the beam was only about five-eighths of an inch long,
and in which the total force was less than one ten-millionth of the weight
of a grain, was then shown. The actual deflection on the scale was
rather more than ten feet, and eighty seconds were required for the
single oscillation. With this apparatus forces two thousand times as
small could be observed, though the fiber is, in comparison with others
that were made use of, exceedingly coarse. Forces equivalent to one
334 QUARTZ FIBERS.

million-millionth of the weight of a grain were stated to be within the
reach of a manageable quartz fiber. |

Now that I have shown all that my limited time has permitted me, I
wish finally to answer a question which is frequently put to me, and which
possibly some in the room may have asked theselves. The question may
be put broadly in this form: ‘These fibers no doubt are very fine and
very wonderful, but are they of any practical use?” This is a question
which I find it difficult to answer, because I do not clearly know what
is meant by “practical use.” If by ‘a thing of practical use” you mean
something which is good to eat or to drink or if you mean something
which we may employ to protect ourselves from the extremes of heat
or cold or moisture, or if you mean—and this is a point which those
who have studied biology will perhaps appreciate more than others—
something which may be made use of for the purpose of personal adorn-
ment, if that is what you mean by ‘practical use,” then, with the ex-
ception of the possibility of being able to weave garments of an extraor-
dinary degree of fineness, softness, and transparency, quartz fibers are
of no “practical use.” But if you mean something which will enable
a large and distinguished body of men to do that which is most impor-
tant to them more perfectly than has been possible hitherto—I allude
of course to the experimental philosopher and his experimental work,
which after all has laid the foundations upon which so much that is
called practical actually is built—if this is what you mean, then I hope
that the few experimepts which I have been able to show this evening
are sufficient to prove that quartz fibers are of some practical use; and
they have served this additional purpose, with what success I am una-
ble to say: they have provided a subject for an evening lecture of the
British Association.
THE RESEARCHES OF DR. R. KCSNIG
ON THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY, AND TIMBRE.*

By Prof. SYLVANUS P. THOMPSON.

lf

Not often does it fall to the lot of a scientific man to become the
mouthpiece of another whose researches have lasted over a quarter of
a century; yet this is the enviable position in which I find myself on
this occasion as the spokesman of Dr. Rudolph Koenig, who is known
not only as the constructor of the finest acoustical instruments in the
world, but as an investigator of great originality and distinctien, and
author of numerous memoirs on acoustics. Dr. Koenig, who has of
late made very important contributions to our knowledge of the phys-
ical basis of music, using apparatus immeasurably superior to any
hitherto employed in experimental investigations of this subject, has
on various occasions, when [ have visited him in Paris, shown me these
instruments, and repeated to me the results of his researches. Impor-
tant as these are, they are all too little known in this country, even by
the professors of physics. It was, therefore, with no little satisfaction
that the Council of the Physical Society learned that Dr. Koenig was
willing to send over to London for exhibition on this occasion the in-
struments and apparatus used in these researches. And their satisfae-
tion to-day is heightened by the fact that Dr. Koenig has himself very
kindly come over to demonstrate his own researches, and has given us
the opportunity to welcome him personally amongst us.

The splendid apparatus around me belongs to Dr. Kenig and forms
but a very small part of the collection which adorns his atelier on the
Quai @Anjou. He lives and works in seclusion, surrounded by his in-
struments, even as our own Faraday lived and worked amongst his
electric and magnetic apparatus. His great tonometer, now nearly
completed, comprises a set of standard tuning forks, adjusted each one
by his own hands, ranging from 20 vibrations per second up to nearly
40,000, with perfect continuity, many of the forks being furnished with
sliding adjustments, so as to give by actual marks upon them any de-

sired number of vibrations within their own limits. Beside this colos-
sal master-piece, Dr. Kaenig’s collection includes several large wave-
sirens and innumerable pieces of apparatus in which his ingenious
manometric flames are adapted to acoustical investigation. There also
stands his tonometric clock, a timepiece governed, not by a pendulum,
but by a standard tuuing-fork, the rate of vibration of which it accu-
rately records.

It is not surprising that one who lives amongst the instruments of
his own creation and who is familiar with their every detail should
discover amongst their properties things which others whose acquaint-
ance with them is less intimate have either overlooked or only im-
perfectly discerned. If he has in his researches advanced propositions
which contradict or seem to contradict the accepted doctrines of the
professors of natural philosophy, it is not that he deems himself one
whit more able than they to offer mathematical or philosophical expla-
nations of them; it is because, with his unique opportunities of ascer-
taining the facts by daily observation and usage, he is impelled to state
what those facts are and to propound generalized statements of them,
even though those facts and generalized statements differ from those at
present commonly received and supposed to be true.

At the very foundations of the physical theory of music stand three
questions of vital importance:

(1) Why is it that the ear is pleased by a succession of sounds be-
longing to a certain particular set called a scale ?

(2) Why is it that, when two (or more) musical sounds are simultane-
ously sounded, the ear finds some combinations agreeable and others
disagreeable ?

(3) Why is it that a note sounded on a musical instrument of one sort
is different from and is distinguishable from the same note sounded
with equal loudness upon an instrument of another sort ?

These three queries involve the origin of melody, the cause of harmony,
and the reason of timbre.

The theories which have been framed to account for each of these
three features of music are based on a double foundation, partly
physical, partly physiological. With the physiological aspect of this
foundation we have to-night nothing to do, being concerned only with
the physical aspect. What, then, are the physical foundations of
melody, of harmony, and of timbre? Demonstrable by experiment
they must be, in common with all other physical facts; otherwise they
can not be accepted as proven. What are the facts and how can they
be demonstrated ?

We are not here, however, to fight over again the battle of the tem-
peraments, nor do I purpose to enter upon a discussion of the origin
of melody, which, indeed, I believe to be associative rather than phys-
ical. I shall confine myself to two matters only, with which the recent
researches of Dr. Koenig are concerned :—the causeof harmony, and the
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 337

nature of timbres. Returning, then, to the ratios of the vibration num-
bers of the major scale, we may note that two of these, namely, the
ratios 9:8 and 15:8, which correspond to the intervals called the
major whole tone and the seventh, are dissonant—or, at least, are usu-
ally soregarded. It will also be noticed that these particular fractions
are more complex than those that represent the consonant intervals.
This naturally raises the question: Why is it that theconsonant intervals
should be represented by ratios made up of the numbers 1 to 6 and by no
others ?

To this problem the only answer for long was the entirely evasive
and metaphysical one that the mind instinetively delights in order and
number. The true answer or rather the first approximation to a true
answer was only given about 40 years ago, when von Helmholtz, as the
result of his ever-memorable researches on the sensations of tone,
returned the reply: Because only by fulfilling numerical relations which
are at once exact and simple can the “ beats” be avoided which are the cause
of dissonance. The phenomenon of beats is so well known that I may
assume the term to be familiar. An excellent mode of making beats
audible to a large audience is to place upon a wind-chest two organ-pipes
tuned to wfp=128, and then flatten one of them slightly by holding a
finger in frontofits mouth. Von Helmholtz’s theory of dissonance may
be briefly sammarized by saying that any two notes are discordant if
their vibration numbers are such that they produce beats ;—maximum
discordance occurring when the beats occur at about 33 per second,—
beats if either fewer than these or more numerous being less disagree-
able than beats at this frequency. Itis an immediate consequence
that the degree of dissonance of any given interval will depend on its
position on the scale. For example, the interval of the major whole
tone, represented by the ratio 9:8, produces four beats per second at
the bottom of the pianoforte keyboard, 32 beats per second at the mid-
dle of the keyboard, and 256 beats per second at the top. Such an
interval ought to be discordant therefore in the middle octaves of the
scale only.

To this view of von Helmholtz it was at first objected that, if that
were all, all intervals should be equally harmonious provided one got
far enough away from being in a bad unison; fifths, augmented fifths,
and sixths, minor and major, ought to be equally harmonious. This no
musician will allow. To account for this von Helmholtz makes the
further supposition that the beats occur, not simply between the funda-
mental or prime tones, but also between the upper partials which
usually accompany prime tones. This leads me to say a word about
upper partial tones and harmonics. I believe many musicians use these
two terms as synonymous, but they ought to be carefully distinguished.
The term harmonics ought to be rigidly reserved to denote higher
tones which stand in definite harmonic relations to the fundamental
tone. The great mathematican Fourier first showed that any truly

periodic function, however complex, could be analyzed out and ex-
pressed as the sum of a certain series of periodic functions having
frequencies related to that of the fundamental or first number of the
series, aS the simple numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, ete. Thirty years later, G. S.
Ohm suggested that the human ear actually performs such an analysis,
by virture of its mechanical structures, upon every complex sound of a
periodic character, resolving it into afundamental tone, the octave of that
tone, the twelfth, the double octave, ete. Von Helmholtz, arming him-
self with a series of tuned resonators, sought to pick up and recognize
as members of a Fourier series the higher harmonics of the tones of
various ipstruments. In his researches he goes over the ground pre-
viously traversed by Rameau, Smith, and Young, who had all observed
the co-existence, in the tones of musical instruments, of higher partial
tones. These higher tones correspond to higher modes of vibration in
which the vibratile organ—string, reel, or air column—subdivides into
two, three, four, or more parts. Such parts naturally pessess greater
frequency of vibration, and their higher tones, when they co-exist along
with the lower or fundamental tone, are denominated upper partial tones,
thereby signifying that they are higher in the scale and that they cor-
respond to vibrations in parts. It is to be regretted that Professor
Tyndall, in his lectures on sound, rendered von Helmholtz’s Oberpar-
tialtine by the term overtones, omitting the most significant half of the
word. To avoid all confusion in the use of such a term I shall rather
follow Dr. Koenig in speaking of these as sounds of subdivision. And
I must protest emphatically against calling these sounds harmonics,
for the simple reason that in many cases they are very inbarmonious.
It is a matter to which I shall recur presently.

Returning to the subject of beats, the question arises, What becomes
of the beats when they occur so rapidly that they cease to produce a
discontinuous sensation upon the ear? The view which I have to put
before you in the name of Dr. Keenig is that they blend to make a tone
of their own. Earlier acousticians have propounded, in accordance
with this view, that the grave harmonic of Tartini (a sound which cor-
responds to a frequency of vibration that is the difference between
those of the two tones producing it) is due to this cause. Von Helmholtz
has taken a different view, denying that the beats can blend to form
a sound, giving reasons presently to be examined. Von Helmholtz
considered that he had discovered a new species of combinational
tone, namely, one corresponding in frequency to the swm of the fre-
quencies of the two tones, whereas that discovered by Tartini (and be-
fore him by Sorge) corresponded to their difference. Accordingly, he
includes under the term of combinational tones the differential tone of
Tartini and the summational tone which he considered himself to have
discovered. To the existence of such combinational tones he ascribed
a very important part in determining the character, harmonious or
otherwise, of cords; and to them also he attributes the ability of the
THR PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 339

ear to discriminate between the degrees of harmoniousness possessed
by such intervals (fifths, sixths, etc.) as consist of two tones too widely
apart on the scale to give beats of a discontinuous character. He also
considers that such combinational tones are chiefly effective in pro-
ducing beats, the summational tones of the primaries beating with
their upper partial tones; and that this is the way in which they make
an interval more or less harmonious.

The whole fabric of the theory of harmony as laid down by von
Helmholtz is thus seen to repose upon the presence or absence of
beats; and the beats themselves are in turn made to depend, not upon
the mere interval between two notes, but upon the timbres also of those
notes, as to what upper partials they contain, and whether those par-
tials can beat with the summational tone of the primaries. It becomes,
then, of the utmost importance to ascertain the precise facts about the
beats and about the supposed combinational tones. What the numbers
of beats are in any given case, whether they do or do not correspond
to the alleged differential and summational tones, these are vital to
the theory of harmony. Equally vital is it to know what the timbres
of sounds are, and whether they can be accurately or adequately repre-
sented by the sum of a set of pure harmonics corresponding to the
terms of a Fourier series.

In investigating beats and combinational tones, Dr. Koenig deemed
it of the highest importance to work with instruments producing the
purest tones; not with harmonium reeds or with polyphonic sirens,
the tones of which are avowedly complex in timbre, but with massive
steel tuning forks, the pendular movements of which are of the sim-
plest possible character. Massive tuning-forks properly excited by
bowing with a violoncello bow, or, in the case of those of high pitch,
by striking them with an ivory mallet, emit tones remarkably free from
all sounds of subdivision, and of so truly pendular a character (unless

_over-excited) that none of the harmonics corresponding to the members
of a Fourier series can be detected. No living soul has had a tithe of
the experience of Dr. Koenig in the handling of tuning forks. Tens of
thousands of them have passed through his hands. He is accustomed
to tune them himself, making use of the phenomenon of beats to test
their accuracy. He has traced out the phenomenon of beats through
every possible degree of pitch, even beyond the ordinary limits of audi-
bility, with a thoroughness utterly impossible to surpass or to equal.
Hence, when he states the results of his experience, it is idle to contest
the facts gathered on such a unique basis. The results of Dr. Koenig’s
observations on beats are easily stated. He has observed primary
beats, as well as beats of secondary and higher orders, from the inter-
ference of two simple tones simultaneously sounded.

When two simple tones interfere, the primary beats always belong
to one or other of two sets, called an inferior and a superior set, cor-
responding respectively in number to the two remainders, positive and
340 DR. KCENIG’S RESEARCHES ON

negative, to be found by dividing the frequency of the higher tone by
that of the lower.

This mode of stating the facts is a little strange to those trained in
English medes of expressing arithmetical calculations, but an example
or two will make it plain. Let there be as the two primary sounds two
low tones having the respective frequencies of 40 vibrations and 74 vi-
brations. What are the two remainders, positive and negative, which
result from dividing the higher number, 74, by the lower number 40?
Our English way of stating it is to say that 40 goes into 74 once and
leaves a (positive) remainder of 34over. Butitis equally correct to say
that 40 goes into 74 twice all but 6, or that there is a negative remainder
of 6. Well, Dr. Keenig finds that, when these two tuning forks are
tried, the ear can distinguish two sets of beats, one rapid, at 34 per sec-
ond, and one slow, at 6 per second.

Again, if the forks chosen are of frequencies 100 and 512, we may
calculate thus: 100 goes into 512 five times, plus 12; or 100 goes into
512 six times, minus 88. In this actual case the 12 beats belonging to
the inferior set would be well heard; the 88 beats belonging to the su-
perior set would probably be almost indistinguishable. As a rule, the
inferior beat is heard best when its number is less than half the frequency
of the lower primary, whilst, when its number is greater, the superior
beat is then better heard. Dr. Konig has never been able to hear any
primary beat which did not fall within this rule.

Dr. Keenig will now illustrate to you-the beats, inferior and superior,
as produced by these two massive tuning-forks,* each weighing about
50 pounds and each provided with a large resonating cavity consisting
of a metal cylinder about 4 feet long, fitted with an adjustable piston.
One of them is tuned to the note wt;=64. The other also sounds uh ;
but, by sliding down its prongs the adjustable weights of gun-metal and
screwing in the piston of the resonator, its pitch can be raised a whole
tone to re;=72. Dr. Koenig excites them with the ’cello bow, first sep-
arately, that you may hear their individual tones, then together. At
once you hear an intolerable beating, the beats coming 8 per second.
This is the inferior beat, corresponding to the positive remainder ; the
superior beat you cannot hear. Dr. Koenig will raise the note of the
second fork from re; to mi;=80, and the beats quicken to 16 per second.
Raising it to fa,=854, and then to sol; =96, while the first fork is still
kept at wt, the beats increase in rapidity, but are fainter in distinet-
ness. If Dr. Koenig now substitutes for the second fork one tuned to
la, =1062, you may be able to hear two beats, the inferior one rapid and
faint at 422 per second, and the superior one slower, but also faint, at
214 per second. Still raising the pitch to the true seventh tone=112,
the rapid inferior beat has died out, but now you hear the superior

Dr. Koenig’s apparatus, have since been acquired by the Science and Art Depart-
ment for the Science Collection at South Kensington,
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 341

strongly at 16 per second. If it is raised once more to si;=120 (the
seventh of the ordinary scale), the beats are still stronger and slower
at 8 per second. Finally, when we bring the pitch up to the octave
Uty=128, we find that all beats have disappeared: there is a perfectly
smooth consonance. The facts so observed are tabulated for you as
follows:

Suppose now, keeping the lower fork unaltered, we raise the pitch
of the higher note (taking a new fork that starts at the octave) from
ut, to sol, by gradual steps, we shall find that there begins a new set of
primary beats, an inferior set, which are_at first slow, then get more
rapid and become undistinguishable, but succeeded by another rapid
and indistinct, which grow stronger and slower, until as the pitch rises
to sol, the frequency of which is exactly three times that of wt), all
beats again vanish. This range between the octave and the twelfth
tone may be called the second “period,” to distinguish it from the
period from unison to the first octave, which was our first period.
Similarly, the range from the twelfth tone to the second octave is the
third period, and from thence to the major third above is the fourth
period, and so forth. In each period up to the sixth or seventh of such
periods, a set of inferior and a set of superior beats may be observed,
and in every case the frequency of the beats corresponds, as I have
said, to one or other of the two remainders of the frequencies of the
two tones. No beat has ever been observed corresponding to the sum
of the frequencies, even when using the slowest forks. None has ever
been observed corresponding to the difference of the frequencies, save
in the first period, where of course the positive remainder is simply
the difference of the two numbers.

That you may hear for yourselves the beats belonging to one of the
higher periods, Dr. Koenig will take a pair of forks which will give us
some of the superior beats in the fourth period. One of the forks is
the great wt;=64, as previously used, the other is mi,;=320, their
ratio being 1:5. Sounded together they give a pure consonance, but if
the smaller one is loaded with small pellets of wax to lower its pitch
342 DR. KG:NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

slightly, and then bow it, at once you hear beats. Ut was in studying
the beats of these higher periods that Dr. Kenig made the observation
that, whereas the beats of an imperfect unison are heard as alternate
silences and sounds, the beats of the (imperfect) higher periods—twelfth
tone, double octave, etc.—consist mainly in variations in the loudness
of the lower of the two primary tones, an observation which was inde-
pendently made by Mr. Bosanquet, of Oxford.

Passing from the beats themselves, I approach the question, What
becomes of the beats when they occur too rapidly to produce on the
ear a discontinuous sensation? On this matter there have been several
conflicting opinions, some holding, with Lagrange and Young, that
they blend into a separate tone; others, with von Helmholtz, main-
taining that the combinational tones can not be so explained and arise
from a different cause. Let it be observed that, even if beat-tones exist,
it is quite possible for beats and beat-tones to be simultaneously heard.
A similar co-existence of a continuous and a discontinuous sensation
is afforded by the familiar experiment of producing a tone by pressing
a card against the periphery of a rapidly rotating toothed wheel. There
is a certain speed at which the individual impulses begin to blend into
a continuous low tone, while yet there are distinguishable the discon-
tinuous impulses, the degree of distinctness of the two co existing
sounds being dependent on the manner in which the card is pressed
against the wheel, that is to say, on the nature of the individual im-
pulses themselves. The opponents of the view that beats blend into a
tone state plainly enough that, in their opinion, a mere succession of
alternate sounds and silences cannot blend into a tone different from
that of the beating tone. Having said that the beats can not blend,
they then add that they do not blend; for, say they, the combinational
tones are a purely subjective phenomenon. Lastly, they say that even
if the beats blend they will not so explain the existence of combinational
tones, because the combinational tones have frequencies which do not
correspond to the number of the beats:

In the teeth of all these views and opinions, Dr. Kanig—without
dogmatizing as to how or why it is—emphatically affirms that beats do
produce beat tones; and he has pursued the matter down toa point that
leaves no room for doubting the general truth of the fact. The alleged
discrepancy between the frequency of the observed combinational tones
and that of the beats disappears when closely scrutinized. Those who
count the beats by merely taking the difference between the frequen-
cies of the two primary tones, instead of calculating the two remain-
ders, will assuredly find that their numbers do not agree in pitch with
the actual sounds heard. But that is the fault of their miscalculation.
Those who use harmonium reeds or polyphonic sirens instead of tuning
forks to produce their primary tones must not expect from such impure
sources to re-produce the effects to be obtained from pure tones. And
those who say that the beats calculated truly from the two remainders
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. j43

will not account for the summational tones have unfortunately some-
thing to unlearn—namely, that, when pure tones are used, under no
circumstances isa tone ever heard the frequency of which is the sum
of the frequencies of the two primary tones.

The apparatus which Dr. Koenig has brought over enables him to
demonstrate in a manner audible, [ trust, to the whole assembly in this
theatre the existence of the beat tones. His first illustrations relate
to tones of primary beats, some belonging to the inferior, others to the
superior set, in the first period.

He takes here the fork wf; = 2048, five octaves higher than the great
ut;. To excite it he may either bow it or strike it with an ivory mallet.
With it he will take the fork one note higher, re; = 2304. When he took
the same interval with wt, and re,;, the number of beats was 8 The ut
and re of the next octave higher would have given us 16 beats, that of
the next 32, that of the next 64, of the fourth octave 128, and that of
the fifth 256. But 256 per second is a rapidity far too great for the ear
to hear as separate sounds. If there were 256 separate impulses, they
would blend to give us the note wf; = 256. They are not impulses, but
beats; nevertheless, they blend. Dr. Koenig strikes the uf, then the
rés, both shrill sounds when you hear them separately; but when he
strikes them in quick succession one after the other, at the moment
when the mallet strikes the second fork you hear this clear wt; sound-
ing out. I am not going to waste your time in a disputation as to
whether the sound you hear is objective or subjective. Itis enough
that you hear it, pure and unmistakable in pitch. It is the grave har-
monic; and the number 256, which represents its frequency, corre-
sponds to the positive remainder when you divide 2304 by 2048.

Now let me give you a beat tone belonging to the superior set; it also
will be a grave harmonie, if you so please to call it; but its frequency
will correspond neither to the difference nor to the sum of the frequen-
cies of the two primary tones. Dr. Koenig takes uf;=2048 as pre-
viously, and with it si; = 3840. Let us calculate what the superior beats
ought to be: 2048 goes into 3840 twice, less 256. Then, 256 being the
negative remainder, we ought to hear from these two forks the beat
tone of 256 vibrations, which is wé;, the same note as in our last experi-
ment. He strikes the forks, and you hear the result. The beat tone,
which is neither a differential tone nor a summational tone, corre-
sponds to the calculated number of beats.

If I take wt; = 2048 and sol; = 3072, the two remainders both come out
at 1024, which is wt; Dr. Koenig will first sound wt; itself, separately,
on an wt; fork, that you may know what sound to listen for. Its sound
has died away ; and now he strikes wf and so/,, when at once you hear
ut; ringing out. That sound which you all heard corresponds to the
calculated number of beats. That is enough for my present purpose.

The next illustration is a little more complex. I select a case in
which the beat tones corresponding to the inferior and the superior
344 DR. K@NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

beats will both be present. We shall have four tones altogether—two
primary tones and two beat tones. The forks 1 select are ut; = 2048,
as before, and a fork which is tuned to vibrate exactly 11 times as
rapidly at wt;—it is the eleventh harmonie of that note, but does not cor-
respond precisely to any note of the diatonic scale. It has 2816 vibra-
tions, and is related to ut, as 11: 8. The two remainders, will now be
768 and 1280, which are the respective frequencies of sol, and mi;.
Dr. Koenig will first sound those notes on two other forks, that you
may know beforehand what to listen for. Now, on striking the two
shrill forks in rapid succession, the two beat tones are heard.

If I select, instead of the eleventh harmonic, the thirteenth harmonic
of ut;, vibrating 3328 times in the second, to be sounded along with
ut,, the same two beat tones will be produced as in the preceding case ;
but mi; = 1280 is now the inferior one, corresponding to the positive re-
mainder, whilst sol, = 7638 is the superior tone, corresponding to the
negative remainder. It is certainly a striking corroboration of Dr.
Keenig’s view that the beat tones actually heard in these last two ex-
periments should come out precisely alike, though on the old view,
that the combinational tones were simply the summational and differ-
ential tones, one would have been led to expect the sounds in the two
experiments to be quite different.

One other example I will give you of a beat tone belonging to the
second period. The two primary notes are given by the forks ut; =
1024 and re, = 2504, The beat tone which you hear is wt; = 256, which
corresponds to the positive remainder.

It will be convenient to draw up in tabular form the results just
obtained. These may be considered as abbreviations of the much more
extended tables drawn up by Dr. Koenig, which hang upon the walls,
and which are to be found in his book, ‘Quelques Expériences
d’Acoustique.”

So far we have been dealing with primary beats and beat-tones; but
there are also secondary beats and secondary beat-tones, which are pro-
duced by the interference of primary beat-tones. An example of a sec-
ondary beat is afforded by the following experiment. Recurring to the
preceding table of experiments, it may be observed that when the two
shrill notes, wuts, sols, giving the interval of the fifth, are sounded to-
gether, the inferior and superior beat-tones are both present and of the
saine pitch. If, now, one of the two forks is lightly loaded with pel-
lets of wax to put it out of adjustment, we shall get beats, not between
the primary tones, but between the beat-tones. Suppose we add enough
wax to reduce the vibration of sol; from 5,072 to 3,070. Then the posi-
tive remainder is 1,022 and the negative remainder is 1,026, the former
being wt; flattened two vibrations, the latter the same note sharpened
to an equal amount. As a result there will be heard four beats per
second—secondary beats. Similarly, the intervals 2 : 5,2: 7, if slightly
mistuned, will, like the fifth, yield secondary beats. Or, to put it in
another way, there may be secondary beats from the (mistuned) beat-
tones that are related (as in our experiment) in the ratio 1: 1 or in the
ratios 3:4, 3: 5, etc., and even by those of 1: 2, 4:5, 4:7, ete.

I have given you an example of secondary beats; now for an exam-
ple of a secondary beat-tone. This is afforded by one of the previous
experiments, in which were sounded wt, and the 11th harmonic of wt.
In this experiment, as in that which followed with the 13th harmonic,
two (primary) beat-tones were produced, of 768 and 1,280 vibrations re-
spectively. These are related to one another by the interval 3:5. If
we treat these as tones that can themselves interfere, they wili give us
for their positive remainder the number 256, which is the frequency of
ut, As amatter of fact, if you listen carefully you may, now that your
attention has been drawn to it, hear that note, in addition to the two
primary tones and the two beat-tones to which you listened previously.

In von Helmholtz’s Tonempfindungen he expresses the opinion
that the distinctness with which beats are heard depends upon the
liarrowness of the interval between the primary tones, saying that
they must be nearer together than a minor third. But, as we have
seen, using bass sounds of a sufficient degree of intensity and purity,
as is the case with those of the massive forks, beats can be heard with
every interval from the mistuned unison up to the mistuned octave.
Even the interval of the fifth, wt, to sol,, gave strongly marked beats
of 32 per second. When this number is attained or exceeded, the ear
usually begins to receive also the effect of a very low continuous tone,
the beats and the beat-tone being simultaneously perceptible up to
about 60 or 70 beats, or as a roughness up to 128 per second. If, using
forks of higher pitches, but of narrower interval, one produces the
same number of beats, the beat-tone is usually more distinct. Doubt-
346 DR. KCNIG’S RESEARCHES ON

less this arises from the greater true intensity of the sounds of higher
pitch. With the object of pursuing this matter still more closely, Dr.
Koenig constructed a series of 12 forks of extremely high pitch, all
within the range of half a tone, the lowest giving si, and the highest
ut; The frequencies and the beats and beat-tones given by seven of
them are recorded in Table 111.

The first of these intervals is a diatonic semitone; the second of them
is a quarter-tone; the third is an eighth of a tone; nevertheless, a sen-
Sitive ear will readily detect a difference of pitch between the two sep-
arate sounds. The last of the intervals is about half a comma.

These forks are excited by striking them with a steel hammer. Some
of the resulting beat-tones will be heard all over the theater; but, in
the case of the very low tones of 40 and 32 vibrations, only those who
are Close at hand will hear them. The case in which there are 26 beats
is curious. Most hearers are doubtful whether they perceive a tone or
not. There is a curious fluttering effect, as though a tone were there,
but not continuously.

We have seen, then, that the beat-tones correspond in pitch to the
number of the beats; that they can themselves interfere and give sec-
ondary beats; and that the same number of beats will always give
the same beat-tone irrespectively of the interval between the two pri-
mary tones. What better proofs could one desire to support the view
that the beat-tones are caused, as Dr. Young supposed, by the same
cause as tiie beats, and not, as von Helmholtz maintains, by some
other cause? Yet there are some further points in evidence which are
of significance and lend additional weight to the proofs already ad-
duced.

Beats behave like primary impulses in the following respect, that
when they come with a frequency between 32 and 128 per second, they
may be heard, according to circumstances, either discontinuously or
blending into a continuous sensation.

It has been objected that, whereas beats imply interference between
two separate modes of vibration arising in two separate organs, combi-
nation-tones, whether summational or differential or any other, must
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 347

take their origin from some one organ or portion of vibratile matter
vibrating in a single but more complex mode. ‘To this objection an ex-
perimental answer has been returned by Dr. Koenig in the following
way. Hetakes a prismatic bar of steel, about 9 inches in length, and
files it to a rectangular section, so as to give, when it is struck at the
middle of a face to ev oke transversal vibrations, a sound of some well-
defined pitch. By carefully adjusting the sides of the rectangular see-
tionin proper proportions, the same steel bar can be made to give two
different notes when struck in two directions respectively parallel to
the long and short sides of the rectangle. A set of such tuned steel
bars are here before you. Taking one tuned to the note uf;=2,048, with
rég=2,394, Dr. Koenig will give you the notes separately by striking
the bar with a small steel hammer when it is lying on two little bridges
of wood, first on one face, then on the other face. If, now, he strikes it
on the corner, so as to evoke both notes at once, you immediately hear
the strong boom of wf;=256, the inferior beat-tone. If Dr. Koenig takes
a second bar tuned to ut; and sig =5,840, you hear also uts, this time the
superior beat-tone. If he takes a bar tuned to wfs and the 11th har-
monic of ut; (in the ratio 8:11) you hear the two beat-tones sol, and mi;
(in ratios of 3 and 5 respectively), precisely as you did when two sepa-
rate forks were used instead of one tuned bar.

Dr. Koenig goes beyond the mere statement that beats blend to a
tone, and lays down the wider proposition that any series of maxima
and minima of sounds of any pitch, if isochronous and similar, will al-
ways produce a tone the pitch of which corresponds simply to the fre-
quency of such maxima and minima. <A series of beats may be regarded
as such maxima and minima of sound; but there are other ways of pro-
ducing the effect than by beats. Dr. Kcenig will now illustrate some
of these to you.

If a shrill note, produced by a small organ-pipe or reed, be conveyed
along a tube, the end of which terminates behind a rotating disk pierced
with large, equidistant apertures, the sound will be periodically stopped
and transmitted, giving rise, if the intermittences are slow enough, to
effects closely resembling beats, but which, if the rotation is suffi-
ciently rapid, blend to a tone of definite pitch. Dr. Koenig uses a large
zine disk with 16 holes, each about 1 inch in diameter. In one set of
experiments this disk was driven at 8 revolutions per second, giving
risé to 128 intermittences. The forks used were of all different pitches
from ut; = 256 to ut; = 4096. In all cases there was heard the low note
ut, corresponding to 128 vibrations per second. In another series of
experiments, using forks wt, and wt;, the number of intermittences was
varied from 128 to 256 by increasing the speed, when the low note rose
also from wt, to uty.

From these experiments it is but a step to the next, in which the in-
tensity of a tone is caused to vary in a periodic manner. For this pur-
348 DR. KG@NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

pose Dr.Koenig has constructed a siren-disk (Fig. 1), pierced with holes
arranged at equal distances around seven concentric circles ; but the
sizes of the holes are made to vary periodically from small to large.
In each circle are 192 equidistant holes, and the number of maxima in
the respective circles was 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, and 96. On rotating

Fia. 1°

this disk, and blowing from behind through a small tube opposite the
outermost circle, there are heard, if the rotation is slow, a note cor-
responding to the number of holes passing per second and a beat cor-
responding to the number of maxima per second. With more rapid
rotation two notes are heard—a shrill one, and another 4 octaves lower
in pitch, the latter being the beat-tone. On moving the pipe so that
wind is blown successively through each ring of apertures, there is
heard a shrill note, which is the same in each case, and a second note
(corresponding to the successive beat-tones) which rises by intervals of
fourths and fifths from circle to circle.

These attempts to produce artificially the mechanism of beats were,
however, open to criticism; for in them the phase of the individual
vibrations during one maximum is the same as that of the individual
vibrations in the next succeeding maximum; whereas in the actual
beats produced by the interference of two tones the vhases of the indi-

Fic. 2.

vidual vibrations in two successive maxima differ by half a vibration,
as may be seen by simple inspection of the curves corresponding to a
series of beats. When this difference was pointed out to Dr. Koenig,
he constructed a new siren disk (Fig. 2), haying a similar series of
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 349

holes of varying size, but spaced out so as to correspond to a difference
of half a wave between the sets. With this disk, beats are distinctly
produced with slow rotation, and a beat-tone when the rotation is
more rapid.

Finding this result from the spacing out of apertures to correspond
in position and magnitude to the individual wavelets of a complex train
of waves, it occurred to Dr. Koenig that the phenomena of beats and
of beat-tones might be still more fully re-produced if the ed ge of the disk
were cut away into a wave-form corresponding precisely to the case of
the resultant wave produced by the composition of two interfering
waves. Accordingly he calculated the wave-forms for the cases of sev-
eral intervals, and having set out these curves around the periphery
of a brass plate, cut away the edge of the plate to the form of the de-
sired wave. Two such wave-disks, looking rather like circular saws
with irregular teeth, are depicted in Figs. 3and 4. These correspond to

the respective intervals 8: 15 and 8: 23. A number of such wave-
disks corresponding to other intervals lie upon the table; these two
will however suffice. In the first of these the curve is that which
would be obtained by setting out around the periphery a series of 120
simple sinusoidal waves, and a second set of 64 waves, and then com-
pounding them into one resultant wave. In order to permit of a com-
parison being made with the simple component sounds, two concentric
rings of holes have been also pierced with 120 and 64 holes respectively.
Regarding these two numbers as the frequency of two primary tones,
there ought to result beats of frequency 8 (being the negative re-
mainder corresponding to the superior beat). An interior set of 8 holes
is also pierced, to enable a comparison to be made. To experiment
with such wave disks they are mounted upon a smoothly running
whirling-table, and wind from a suitable wind-chest is blown against
the wave edge from behind through a narrow slit set radially. In
this way the air-pressures in front of the wave-edge are varied by the
rush of air between the teeth. It isa question not yet decided how
350 DR. K@NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

far these pressures correspond to the values of the ordinates of the
curves. This question, which involves the validity of the entire prin-
ciple of the wave-siren, can not here be considered in detail. Suffice it
to say that for present purposes the results are amply convincing.

The wave-disk (Fig. 3) has been clamped upon the whirling-table,
which an assistant sets into rotation at a moderate speed. Dr. Kenig
biows first through a small pipe through one of the rows of holes, then
through the other. The two low notes sound out separately, just a
major tone apart. Then he blows through the pipe with a slotted mouth-
piece against the waved edge; at once you hear the two low notes inter-
fering, and making beats. On increasing the speed of rotation the two
notes become shrill, and the beats blend into a beat-tone. Notice the
pitch of that beat-tone: itis precisely the same as that which he now
produces by blowing through the small pipe against the ring of 8 holes.
With the other wave-disk, having 184 and 64 holes in the two primary
circles, giving a wave form corresponding to the interval 8: 23, the
effects are of the same kind, and when driven at the same speed gives
the same beat-tone as the former wave-disk. It will be noted that in
each of these two cases the frequency of the beat-tone is neither the
difference nor the sum of the frequencies of the two primary tones.

A final proof, if such were needed, is afforded by an experiment, which
though of a striking character, will not necessarily be heard by all per-
sons present, being only well heard by those who sit in certain posi-
tions. If a shrill tuning-fork is excited by a blow of the steel mallet,
and held opposite a flat wall, part of the waves which it emits strike on
the surface, and are reflected. This reflected system of waves, as it
passes out into the room, interferes with the direct system. Asa result,
if the fork, held in the hand, be moved toward the wall or from it, a
series of maxima and minima of sound will successively reach an ear
situated in space at any point near the line of motion, and will be heard
as a Series of beats; the rapidity with which they succeed one another
being proportional to the velocity of the movement of the fork. The
fork Dr. Koenig is using is wts, which gives well marked beats, slow
when he moves his arm slowly, quick when he moves it quickly. There
are limits to the speed at which the human arm can be moved, and the
quickest speed that he can give to his, fails to make the beats blend to
atone. But if he will take sol, vibrating 14 times as fast, and strike
it, and move it away from the wall with the fastest speed that his arm
will permit, the beats blend into a short low growl, a non-uniform tone
of low pitch, but still having true continuity.

The first portion of my account of Dr. Koenig’s researches may then
be summarized by saying that in all circumstances where beats, either
natural or artificial, can be produced with sufficient rapidity, they blend
to form a beat-tone of a pitch corresponding to their frequency.
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 351

III.

I now pass to the further part of the researches of Dr. Koenig which
relates to the timbre of sounds. Prior to the researches of Dr. Keenig
it had been supposed that in the reception by the ear of sounds of com-
plex timbre the ear took no account of, and indeed was incapable of
perceiving, any differences in phase in the constituent partial tones.
For example, in the case of a note and its octave sounded together, it
was supposed and believed that the sensation in the ear, when the
difference in phase of the two compere was equivalent to one-
half of the more rapid wave, was the same as when that difference of
phase was one-quarter, or three-quarters, or zero. JI had myself, in
the year 1876, when studying some of the phenomena of binaural audi-
tion, shown reasons for holding that the ear does nevertheless take cog-
nizance of such differences of phase. Moreover, the peculiar rolling or
revolving effect to be noticed in slow beats is a proof that the ear per-
ceives some difference due to difference of phase. Dr. Koenig is
however the first to put this matter on a distinct basis of observations.
That such differences of phase occur in the tones of musical instru-
ments is certain; they arise inevitably in every case where the sounds
of subdivision are such that they do not agree rigidly with the theo-
retical harmonics. Fig. 5 depicts a graphic record taken by Dr. Koenig
from a vibrating steel wire, in which a note and its octave had been
simultaneously excited. The two sounds were scarcely perceptibly
different from their true interval, but the higher note was just suffi-
ciently sharper than the true harmonic octave to gain about one wave
in 180. The graphic trace has in figure 5 been split up into five pieces

to facilitate insertion in the text. It will be seen that as the phase
gradually changes the form of the waves undergoes a slow change
from wave to wave. Now, it is usually assumed that in the vibrations
of symmetrical systems, such as stretched cords and open columns of
air, the sounds of subdivision agree with the theoretical harmonics.
For example, it is assumed that when a stretched string breaks up into
a nodal vibration of four parts, each of a quarter its length, the
352 DR. KCENIG’S RESEARCHES ON

vibration is precisely four times as rapid as the fundamental vibration
of the string as a whole. This would be true if the string were abso-
lutely uniform, homogeneous, and devoid of rigidity. Strings never
are so; and even if uniform and homogeneous, seeing that the rigidity
of a string has the effect of making a short piece stiffer in proportion
than a long piece, can not emit true harmonies as the sounds of subdi-
vision. In horns and open organ pipes the width of the column (which
is usually neglected in simple calculations) affects the frequency of the
nodal modes of vibration. Wertheim found the partial tones of pipes
higher than the supposed harmonics.

These things being so, it is manifestly insufficient to assume, as von
Helmboitz does in his great work, that all timbres possess a purely
periodic character; with the necessary corollary that all timbres con-
sist merely in the presence, with greater or less intensity, of one or more
members of a series of higher tones corresponding to the terms of a
Fourier series of harmonics. When, therefore, following ideas based
on this assumption, von Helmholtz constructs a series of resonators,
accurately tuned to correspond to the terms of a Fourier series (the
first being tuned to some fundamental tone, the second to one of a fre-
quency exactly twice as great, the third to a frequency exactly three
times, and so forth), and applies such resonators to analyze the tim-
bres of various musical and vocal sounds, he is trying to make his reson-
ators pick up things which in many cases do not exist—upper partial
tones which are exact harmonies. If they are not exact harmonics,
even though they exist, his tuned resonator does not hear them, or only
hears them imperfectly, and he is thereby lead into an erroneous appre-
ciation of the sound under examination.

Further, when in pursuance of this dominant idea he constructs a
system of electro-magnetic tuning-forks, accurately tuned to give forth
the true mathematical harmonics of a fixed series, thinking therewith
to reproduce artificially the timbres not only of the various musical
instruments but even of the vowel sounds, he fails to reproduce the
supposed effects. The failure is inherent in the instrument; forit can
not reproduce those natural timbres which do not fall within the cir-
cumscribed limits of its imposed mathematical principle.

Nothing is more certain than that in the tones of instruments, partic-
ularly in those of such instruments as the harp and the pianoforte, in
which the impulse, once given, is not sustained, the relations between
the component partial tones are continually changing, both in relative
intensity and in phase. The wavelets, as they follow one another, are
ever changing their forms; in other words, the motions are not truly
periodic—their main forms may recur, but with modifications ever
changing.

To estimate the part played in such phenomena by mere differences
of phase—to evaluate, in fact, the influence of phase of the constitu-
ents upon the integral effect of a compound sound—Dr, Keenig had
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. Je

recourse to the wave-siren, an earlier invention of his own, and of which
the wave-disks which have already been shown are examples.

In the first place, Dr. Koenig proceeded synthetically to construct the
wave-forms for tones consisting of the resultant of a set of pure har-
mouics of gradually decreasing intensity. The curves of these, up to
the tenth member of the series, were carefully compounded graphically :
first with zero difference of phase, then with all the upper members
shifted on one quarter. then with a difference of a half-wave, then with
a difference of three-quarters. The results are shown in the top line of
curves in Fig. 6, wherein it will be noticed that the curve for difference

Fic. 6.

of phase = 4 is like that for zero difference, but reversed, left for right;
and that the curve for difference of phase = 3 is like that for difference
= 4, but inverted. Now, according to von Helmholtz, the sounds of
all these four curves should be precisely alike, in spite of their differ-
ences of form and position. To test the matter, these carefully plotted
curves were set out upon the circumference of a cylindrical band of thin
metal, the edge being then cut away, leaving the unshaded portion,
the curve being repeated half a dozen times, and meeting itself after.
passing round the circumference. For convenience, the four curves to
be compared are set out upon the separate rims of two such metallic
cylindrical hoops, which are mounted upon one axis, to which a rapid
motion of rotation can be imparted, as shown in Fig. 7. Against the
dentilated edges of these rims, wind can be blown through narrow
slits connected to the wind chamber of an organ table. In the appara-
tus (Fig. 7) the four curves in question are the four lowest of the set of
six. It will be obvious that as these curves pass in front of the slits
H. Mis. 129 23

354 DR. KCENIG’S RESEARCHES ON

from which wind issues, the maximum displacement of air will result
when the slit is least covered, or when the point of greatest depression
of the curve crosses the front of the slit. The negative ordinates of the
curve correspond therefore approximately to condensations. Air is

now being supplied to the slits; and when I open one or other of
the valves which control the air passages, you hear one or other of the
sounds. It must be audible to everyone present that the sound is
louder and more forcible with a difference of phase of + than in any
other case, that produced with ? difference being gentle and soft in tone,
whilst the curves of phase 0 and 4 yield tones of intermediate quality.
Dr. Koenig found that if he merely combined together in various phases
a note and its octave (which was indeed the instance examined by me
binaurally in 1876), the loudest resultant sound is given when the phase
difference of the combination is 4, and the mildest when it is 3.

Returning to Fig. 6, in the second line are shown the curves which
result from the superposition of the odd members only of a harmonic
series of decreasing amplitude. On comparing together the curves of
the four separate phases, it is seen that the form is identical for phases
0 and 3, which show rounded waves, whilst for phases + and 3 the forms
are also identical, but with sharply angular outline. These two varie-
ties of curve are set out on the two edges of the highest metallic cir-
cumference in the apparatus depicted in Fig. 7. The angular waves are
found to yield a louder and more strident tone than the rounded waves,
though, according to yon Helmholtz, their tones should be alike.

A much more elaborate form of compound wave siren was constructed
by Dr. Koenig for the synthetic study of these phase relations. Upon
a Single axis, one behind the other, is mounted a series of 16 brass disks,
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. Hay)

cut at their edges into sinusoidal wave forms. These represent a har-
monic series of 16 members of decreasing amplitnde, there being just
16 times as many small sinuosities on the edge of the largest disk as
there are of large sinuosities on that of the smallest disk. A photo-
graph of the apparatus is now thrown upon the screen. It is described
fully by Dr. Koenig in his volume on ‘‘Quelques Expériences,” and was
figured and described in Nature, July 20, 1882, vol. xxvi, p. 277.
Against the edge of eack of the 16 wave disks wind ean be separately
blown through a slit. This instrument therefore furnishes a funda-
mental sound with its first fifteen pure harmonics. It is clear that any
desired combination can be obtained by opening the appropriate stops
on the wind-chest; and there are ingenious arrangements to vary the
phases of any of the separate tones by shifting the positions of the slits.
The following are the chief results obtained with this instrument. If we
first take simply the fundamental tone and its octave together, the total
resultant sound has the greatest intensity when the difference of phase
o=4(t. e, when the maximum displacement of air occurs at the same
instant for both waves); and at thesame time the whole character of the
sound becomes somewhat graver, as if the fundamental tone predomi-
nated more than in other phases. The intensity is least when 0=%. If,
however, attention is concentrated on the octave note while the phase is
changed, its intensity seems about the same for d6=} as for 6=3, but
weaker in all other positions. The compound tones formed only of odd
members of the series have always more power and brilliancy of tone
for phase differences of 4 and 3, than for 0 and 4; but the quality for 4
is always the same as for ?, and the quality for 0 is always the same as
for 4. ‘This corresponds to the peculiarity of the corresponding wave
form, of which the fourth line of curves in Fig. 6 is an example. For
compound tones corresponding to the whole series, odd and even, there
is in every Case minimum intensity, brilliaucy, and stridence with d=,
and maximum with d=}. Inspection of the first and third lines of
curves in Fig. 6 shows that in these wave forms that phase which is
the most forcible is that in which the maximum displacement and re-
sulting condensation is sudden and brief.

Observing that wave-forms in which the waves are asymmetrical—
steeper on one side than on the other—are produced as the resultant of
a whole series of compounded partial tones, it occurred to Dr. Koenig
to produce from a perfect and symmetrical sinusoidal wave curve a com-
plex sound by the very simple device of turning into an oblique position
the slit through which the wind was blown against it. In Fig. 8 is
drawn a simple symmetrical wave form, egluprtv. If a series of such
wave forms is passed in front of a vertical slit, such as ab, a perfectly
simple tone, devoid of upper partials, is heard. But by inclining the
slit, as at ab’, the same effect is produced as if the wave form had been
changed to the oblique outline e/g/l/n‘p'7't’v’, the slit all the while re.
maining upright. But this oblique form is precisely like that obtained
356 DR. K(@NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

as resultant of a decreasing series of partial tones (Hig. 6, a). If the
slit be inclined in the same direction as the forward movement of the
waves, the quality produced is the same as if all the partial tones coin-
cided at their origin, or with 6 =0; while if inclined in the opposite

direction the quality is that corresponding tod = 4. It is easy to ex-
amine whether the change of phase produces any effect on the sound.
Before you is rotating a simple wave disk, and air is being blown across
its edge through a slit. Dr. Kenig will now tilt the slit alternately
backward and forward. On tilting the slit forward to give 6 = 0, you
hear a purer and more perfect sound; and on tilting it back, giving
6 = 4, a sound that is more nasal and forcible.

All the preceding experiments agree then in showing that differences
of phase do produce a distinct effect upon the quality of compound tones;
what then must we say as to the effect on the timbre of the presence of
upper partial tones or sounds of subdivision that do not agree with any
of the true harmonies? A mis-tuned harmonic—if the term is permissi-
ble—may be looked upon as a harmonie which is undergoing continual
change of phase. The mistuned octave which yielded the graphic curve
in Fig. 5, is a case in point. The wavelets are continually changing
their form. It iscertain that in a very large number of musical sounds,
instrumental and vocal, such is the case.

It was whilst experimenting with his large compound wave siren that
Dr. Kenig was struck by the circumstance that under no conditions,
and by no combination of pure harmonies in any proportion of intensity
or phase, could he reproduce any really strident timbres of sound, like
those of harmonium reeds, trumpets, and the like; nor could he produce
satisfactory vowel qualities of tone. Still less can these be produced
satisfactorily by von Helmholtz’s apparatus with electro-magnetic
tuning forks, in which there is no control over the phases of the com-
ponents. The question was therefore ripe for investigation whether
for the production of that which the ear can recognize as a timbre, a
definite unitary quality of tone, it was necessary to suppose that all
the suecessive wavelets should be of similarform. Or, if the forms of
THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MUSICAL HARMONY. 357

the successive wavelets are continually changing, is it possible for the
ear still to grasp the result as a unitary sensation ?

If the ear could always separate impure harmonic or absolutely in-
harmonie partials from their fundamental tone, or if it always heard
pure harmonics as an indistinguishable part of the unity of the timbre
of a fundamental, then we might draw a hard and fast line between
mere mixtures of sound and timbres, even as the chemist distinguishes
between mere mixtures and true chemical compounds. But this is not
So; sometimes the ear can not unravel from the integral sensation the
inharmonious partial; on the other hand, it can often distinguish the
presence of truly harmonious ones. Naturally, something will depend
on the training of the ear; as is the case with the conductor of an or-
chestra, who will pick out single tones from a mixture of sounds which
to less perfectly trained ears may blend into a unitary sensation.

Dr. Konig accordingly determined to make at least an attempt to
determine synthetically hov far the ear can so act, by building up spe-
cific combinations of perturbed karmonics or inharmonic partials, giv-
ing rise to waves that are multiform, as distinguished from the uniform
waves of atrue periodic motion. The wave siren presented a means of
carrying this attempt to aresult. On the table before me lie a number
of wave disks constructed with this aim. This will be successively
placed upon the whirling table, and sounded; but [ must warn you
that the proper effects will only be perceived by those who are near the
apparatus, and in front of it.

Upon the edge of the first of the series there has been cut a curve
graphically compounded of 24 waves as a fundamental, together with
a set of four perturbed harmonics of equal intensity. The first har-
monic consists of 49 waves (2 x 24+ 1), the second of 75 waves
(3x 2443), the third of 101 (4x24+5), the fourth of 127 (5x 2447).
The resulting curve possesses 24 waves, no two of them alike in form,
and some highly irregularin contour. The effect of blowing air through
a slit against this disk is to produce a disagreeable sound, quite lacking
in unitary character, and indeed suggesting intermittence.

The second wave disk is constructed with the same perturbed har-
monies, but with their amplitudes diminishing in order. This disk pro-
duces similar effects, but with more approach to a unitary character.

Inthe third disk there are also 24 fundamental waves, but there are no
harmonies of the lower terms, the superposed ripples being perturbed
harmonies of the fifth, sixth, and seventh orders. Their numbers
are 6x 24+6, 7x 244-7, and 8x24+8, being, in fact, three harmonies
of a fundamental 25. This disk gives a distinetly dual sort of sound,
for the ear hears the fundamental quite separate from the higher tones,
which seem in themselves to blend to a unitary effect. There is also
an intermittence corresponding to each revolution of the disk, like a
beat.

The fourth disk resembles the preceding; but the gap between the
358 DR. K@NIG’S RESEARCHES ON

fundamental and the three perturbed harmonies has been filled by the
addition of three true harmonics. This disk is the first in this research
which gives a real timbre, though it is a peculiar one. It preserves,
however, a unitary character, even when the slit is tilted in either
direction. The 24 waves in this disk all rake forward like the teeth of
a circular saw, but with multiform ripples upon them. The quality of
tone becomes more crisp when the slit is tilted so as to slope across the
teeth, and more smooth when in the reverse direction.

The fifth disk, which is larger, has 40 waves at its edge. These are
cut with curves of all sorts, taken hap-hazard from various combinations
of pure harmonics in all sorts of proportions and varieties, no two being
alike, there maxima and minima of the separate waves being neither
isochronous nor of equal amplitude. This disk gives an entirely unmu-
sical effect, amid which a fundamental tone is heard, accompanied by a
sort of rattling sound made up of intermittent and barely recognizable
tones.

The sixth disk is derived from the preceding by selecting eight only
of the waves, and repeating them five times around the periphery. In
this case each set of eight acts as a single long curve, giving beats,
with a slow rotation and a low tone (accompanied always by the rattling
mixture of higher tones) when the speed is increased.

The seventh disk was constructed by taking 24 waves of perfect sin-
usoidal form, and superposing upon them a series of small ripples of
miscellaneous shapes and irregular sizes, but without essentially depart-
ing from the main outline. This disk gives a timbre in which nothing
can be separated from the fundamental tone, either with vertical or
tilted slit.

The eighth and last disk consists of another set of 24 perfect waves,
from the sides of which irregular ripples have been carved away by
hand, with the file, leaving however the summits and the deepest
parts of the hollows untouched, so that the maxima and minima are
isochronous and of equal amplitude. This disk gives also a definite
timbre of its own, a little raucous in quality, but still distinctly having
a musical unity about it.

We have every reason therefore to conclude that the ear will recog-
nize aS possessing true musical quality, as a timbre, combinations in
which the constituents of the sound vary in their relative intensity and
phase from wave to wave.

What, then, is a timbre? Dr. Koenig would be the first to recognize
that these last experiments, though of deepest interest, do not afford a
final answer to the question. Wemay not yet bein a position to frame
a new definition as to what constitutes a timbre, but we may at least
conclude that, whenever that definition can be framed, it will at least
include several varieties, including the non-periodic kinds with multi-
form waves, as well as those that are truly periodic with uniform waves.
We must not on that account however, rush to the conclusion that the

thrown. The corrections introduced into lunar theory by Hansen and
Newcombe have not overturned the splendid generalizations of New-
ton. What we can and must confess is that we now know that the
acoustic theory of von Helmholtz is, like the lunar theory of Newton,
correct only as a first approximation, It has been the distinctive merit
of Dr. Koenig to indicate to us the magnitude of the correcting terms,
and to supply us not only with a rich store of experimental facets but
with the means of prosecuting the research synthetically, beyond the
point to which he himself has attained.

In thanking Dr. Koenig for the courtesy which he has shown to this
society in bringing over his apparatus and in demonstrating its use to
us, we must join in congratulating him on the patience, perspicacity,
and skill with which he has carried out his researches. We know that
his exceptional abilities as experimentalist and constructor have done
more than those of any other investigator to make the science of experi-
mental acoustics what it is to-day ; and we must unite in wishing him
long life and prosperity to complete the great work on which elready
he has advanced so far.
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO DAY.*

By VictorR MEYER.

Translated by L. H. FriepBura.t

When, a short time ago, I was called upon to speak before you, I
gladly and zealously approached the work which such an occasion
seemed to call forth. It seemed to me that it would be an effort worthy
of this assemblage of scientific men to recall the permanent addi-
tions that chemistry has made in our day to the treasure of human
knowledge and to enumerate the problems which seem to lie nearest us
in the future.

A science which, as such, is hardly older than the great European
revolution, the centennial of which we witnessed a few months ago,
and which in this short time has caused changes in our spiritual and
material life hardly less than those of the political revolution, such a
science, I have thought, may without temerity boast of its achieve
ments.

And yet the chemist approaches such a task with a certain hesita-
tion from which the astronomer, the physicist, and the mathematician
are free. Has it not been in our own day that the most prominent ora-
tor amongst German naturalists, one who astonishes us by the compre-
hensiveness of his knowledge, has adopted as his own Kant’s judgment
on chemistry, namely, that chemistry is a science, but not a science
in the highest sense of the word; that is, a knowledge of nature reduced
to mathematical mechanics.” And this dictum is accepted, not as a
blemish upon our science, but with the fullest and most perfect recog-
nition of the immense achievements which modern chemistry has regis-
tered as its own.

But all of the marvellous successes of the atomic theory and of the
doctrine of structure, the synthesis of the most complicated organic
compounds, the blessings of an enlarged pharmacopceia, the potent
revolution in technological processes, the new and systematic methods

of production which have been characterized by an eminent technolo-
gist as “the gaining of gold from rubbish ”—all this seems trifling to
the mind that looks down from its standpoint of mathematical mechan-
ics when compared with the work of a promised Newton of chemistry,
who some day wili represent chemical reactions in the thought and in
the language of mathematical physics.

And if he who looks from a height is justified in the expression that
to-day chemistry, in the recognition of ultimate causes, stands yet
below astronomy of the time of Kepler and Copernicus, must not the
chemist lose courage if he attempts, before an illustrious assemblage,
to raise a song of praise to his science, to glorify what she has done
and what in the future she seems chosen to do? If in spite of this
the attempt be made, it must be with that resignation which rests upon
the belief that “we should consider everything, but aim only at that
which is possible.”

Though we share, with full conviction, the expectations of a New-
tonian period in chemistry, we hardly venture to hope that that period
is near, and even the most enlightened representatives of the newer
physical chemistry seem but precursors of that distant era.

Perhaps the chemist, immersed in the daily work of his science, fails
to take the comprehensive view of one who from a distant height looks
down upon the same. But those who are surrounded by the whirl of
hourly renewed work recognize all the more clearly the immense
amount that remains still to be achieved before those distant aims can
be realized. This epoch, so rich in path-finders in the department of
physics, has rarely directed the highest order of research into the ter-
ritory of our science, and especially have the more complicated chem-
ical phenomena been avoided.

If in a period that has witnessed the discoveries of Helmholtz, Robert
Mayer, Joule, Clausius, and van’t Hoff, the revolutionizing progress of
knowledge has been limited to physics, and if only modest applications
of what was gained have been made in related studies, then the epoch
seems not yet to be at hand in which chemical processes can be thought
of as we think of the movements which we feel as sound, light, or heat.

A humiliating statement! But, strange to say, the chemist of to-day
has hardly time to complain of this resignation imposed upon him, and
this for reasons easily understood.

If without question it is the aim of all natural science to under-
stand phenomena so fully that they may be described in a mathematical
form, and, as far as they are unknown, may be predicted, a science
which is so far distant from this aim as to look merely for the path that
shall some day lead to it, must be considered as in its infancy. In
the present stage our way of thinking and acting has this peculiarity.
In every science imagination must stand as another power alongside of
knowledge and reasoning. But the influence of imagination upon knowl-
edge is all the greater the further this latter is distant from the men-
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 363

tioned ideal. And thus it happens that in the chemistry of to-day im-
agination and intuition have a larger scope than in other sciences, and
that occupation with the same, besides the pure scientific satisfaction
that it yields, brings an enjoyment which, in a certain sense, reminds
one of the activity of an artist. He however who only knows chemistry
as a tradition of perfectly clear facts, or who thinks to see the real soul
of chemical study in measuring the physical phenomena which accom-
pany chemical transformations, feels no breath of this enjoyment.

The feeling is only disclosed to him who ventures into that ocean of
the unknown that is spread out before us in the organic chemistry of the
day; to him who is not appalled by a wilderness, populated with
thousands of indivuals, of which every one shows a peculiar, fully
unknown originality, and to him who attempts to become better
acquainted with some of them, even if he is at a loss for a means of
approaching them. To proceed with success in this direction is only
granted to the genius; the method that leads onward can not be
learned, and it has only been practiced with success by a small number
of chosen ones.

Indeed, in the experimental study of organic chemistry, the “ pre-
sentiment” of happenings, the actuality of which is not indicated by
any law to be expressed in words, has shown surprising results; here
the thought is aided by a something, which we may meanwhile term
“chemical feeling,” a name which will disappear as soon as the pro-
gressive approach of chemistry to the mathematical physieu basis
shall have disclosed its meaning and shall have tabulated it amongst
the methods which lead to the recognition of the new. The effect of
this peculiar chemical method of study is not here to be dwelt upon in
detail. Let it suffice to say that without it, the most brilliant discov-
eries in organic chemistry would not have been made: just as little
as a Kekulé would without it, have been able—in contradiction of
numerous data in chemical literature never before doubted—to affirm
the non-existence of isomeric monochlorbenzol and of such bodigzs as
were said to consist of a benzol ring and but one bi-valent atom. Those
significant hypotheses by means of which the knowledge of aromatic
substances has been revealed to us, could not have been made solely
upon the ground of exact observation; they required at the same time
a pronounced chemical instinct. There wasno logical reason in declaring
the existence of a phenylene oxide as an impossibility, since the ethylene
oxide did exist; he who nevertheless ventured to do so, and at the
same time ran directly in the face of experience, was surely led by a
feeling which the present status of chemistry forbids us to replace by
a process of thought.

But to return from the field of organic to that of general chemistry.
Before we can arrive at a mathematico-physical treatment of chemical
phenomena in genera!, two fundamental problems must be solved; an
hypothesis which allows a control by experiment (even within the same
364 THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY.

limits which to this day are imposed upon physics in regard to the law
of gravitation), must answer these questions: What is Chemical Affinity?
and What is Valency?

By means of laborious detail work, chemistry tries to approach the
solution of these enigmas; but he who pursues chemical methods, who
stands in the midst of chemical work—which aims only, as at a far
distant task, at the discovery of a sure path—still sees such obstacles
to be cleared away that he gives up the hope of living tosee the new
chemicalera. He finds satisfaction in the consciousness of having ex-
erted his best abilities in the elucidation of some minor and precursory
principles.

If now we begin to consider—within the appointed limits—the most
important achievements of chemistry, we can not, at this place and at
this hour of our meeting, be in doubt as to what is to be mentioned in
the first place. The hospitable city which shelters us boasts of an ad-
vantage which is envied her by every other alma mater; here, chemis-
try for more than a human lifetime has been represented by Robert
Bunsen, of glorious name, and the very days which find us here as-
sembled, follow immediately the moment in which this hero of science
has retired from his academical occupation. Who does not think, at
such an hour, of the great teacher around whom ardent pupils from all
parts of the globe were accustomed to congregate? But who, being
called upon to-day to speak of the results of chemistry within the
walls of Heidelberg, would not before all direct an eye upon that one
discovery which has lifted chemistry beyond terrestrial research, which
has enabled her, like astronomy, to search the universe and to dissect
the starry heavens, chemically, by the subtle appliances of analysis?
If “old Heidelberg” has become a pearl amongst German cities by its
history, by its numerous traditions, by the incomparable beauty of its
situation,—if its university is the ideal of the German academical youth,
we may well regard as an immortal leaf in its wreath of honor, along
with these glorious titles, the union of those two great men who first
met in this city in the most courageous enterprise of the penetrating
mind; who have pursued with astonishing success the investigation
which has made spectral analysis the most potent of scientific weapons,
and has rendered their names a charm calling forth the admiration of
the older minds and kindling in the minds of mere school boys the flame
of enthusiasm in the study and exploration of nature. The immeas-
urable results of that discovery—the consequences of which extend
every day over new territories—are known in the widest circles, and to
mention them to-day in detail would be but carrying owls to Athens.
It behooves us in this place to mention reverently the names of Bunsen
and Kirchhoff, to think of them with gratitude, and to hope that men,
their equals, may not be entirely wanting in the next generation! The
vounger one of them—whose scientifie fertility was only equalled by
his greatness of soul and the charming modesty of his heart—has
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 365

been taken away from us before old age had nuaturally limited him.
Bunsen we still rejoice to call ours, who now, allowing the tools of his
work to drop from his hand, looks forth to the evening of his life in
quiet, happy leisure. May be be permitted for a long time to look back
upon a life filled with greatest scientific achievements; may his calm,
friendly eye rest for many years upon the incomparable picture of his
beloved Heidelberg.

We have mentioned spectrai analysis, though it has been almost for
an age the common property of science. Let us also cast a grateful
retrospect upon a deeply furrowing revolution—of which chemistry
also, for several decades, has boasted as a substantial possession—upon
the development of the doctrine of structure, that solid theoretical foun-
dation from which the proud edifice of modern organic chemistry rises.
A generation has grown up around us which has received as a matter
of fact this doctrine which still seems new to us older ones. But those
far-seeing men, whose eyes recognized the immensely simple in the seem-
ingly impenetrable compheation of the carbon compounds, are still ac-
tively alive amongst us, and it is their happy lot to reap in their own
activity what once they sowed in juvenile work. Here the eye is di-
rected upon the master of chemical researeh—August Wilhelm von
Hofmann ; before all upon his researches upon the organic nitrogenous
bases,—researches which do not find their equal in organic chemistry
and which, even more perfectly than Dumas’ fundamental discovery of
trichoracetic acid, allowed the fundamental conception of substitution
toexpand into the living consciousness of chemists, at first, curiously,
by supporting the theory of types in organic compounds and then by
promoting the transition to the structural or constitutional view, which
at present embraces, with unparalleled perfection, the whole territory of
organic compounds.

But the suggestion of this doctrine, which finds its crowning success
in the recognition of the inner aggregation of the atoms, is associated
for all time with the name of a man who, although a master of rare art
in experimenting, knew how to surpass what he had achieved at the
laboratory table, by the convincing power of his speculative work. We
ean not here dispute the part which other eminent chemists have taken
in the development of the doctrine of structure—there are, Butlerow,
Cooper, Erlenmeyer, Frankland, Kolbe, Odling, Williamson—but the
glorious guide in this great and victorious movement forward, he, to
whose eyes was disclosed not only the tetra-valence of carbon, but also
the solution of the problem of the constitution of organic compounds,
in the recognition of the property of carbon atoms to be linked to each
other by their valencies; he is the philosopher of organic chemistry—
August Kekulé. The name of this discoverer, who also started upon
his high and soaring flight from Heidelberg, is justly mentioned alone
when we want to recall in a word the putting forth and the development
of the leading chemical theories.
366 THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY.

The researches in this direction are so numerous and so toilsome, and
yet the result is so surprisingly simple! The carbon atom is endowed
with four, the oxygen atom with two, the hydrogen atom with one point
of attack for the chemical affinity. The cause of the aggregation of the
atoms within the molecule lies in the mutual saturation of these units
of affinity or valencies. It is the number of valencies which decides
the possibility of the existence of a compound. Amongst the legion of
imaginable combinations of these three elements only those are capable
of existence in which every valency is saturated by that of another
atom. Through this knowledge a new method of inquiry was opened,
in particular for organic chemistry, the immense territory of which for
many years seemed totally to absorb the working power of chemists.
But then dawned the first signs of a further development. Hardly a
decade had elapsed since the general admission of the doctrine of va-
lency when a fundamental deepening of the same was announced, which
our science owes to two savants, working independently of each other—
to Le Bel and van’t Hoff. These chemists, consid: ring those substances
which turn the plane of polarization cf light, arrived at views which
soon led to a result until then thought to be out of reach, a conception
of the aggregation of the atoms within the molecules in space. Thus
a field of study was created which van’t Hoff called “la chimie dans
Vespace” and which we now Call Stereo-chemistry.

It was recognized that the carbon atom stretched out its four valen-
cies in definite directions, and this in a symmetrical manner. The
combination of a carbon atom with four other atoms, for example,
methane, CH,, is representable by the picture of a tetrahedron in the
stereometric center of which the carbon atom is situated, while the
hydrogen atoms occupy its four corners.

Numerous cases of isomerism, until then not understood, could be
explained in this manner and were regarded as stereo-chemical ones.
The cause of optical activity was found to consist in the presence of an
a-symmetric carbon atom, that is, one which is combined with four dif-
ferent groups.

Also the stereometric forms of a few simple molecules were consid-
ered; it was recognized, e. g., that a compound of three carbon atoms
linked together by one bond respectively could not contain those atoms
in 2 straight line, but that they must lie in the angles of a triangle the
sides of which form an angle equal to that in which the directions of
valency of the carbon atom intersect each other.

By the applications of these considerations to more complicated
molecules, which contain a chain of atoms closed within itself, Adolph
von Baeyer has enlarged our theory in a manner full of consequence.

Kekulé in times past had recognized that carbon shows a particular
disposition to form closed chains of six atoms. The discoveries of Bae-
yer and his followers, as well as Fittig’s work on lactones, taught that
such closed chains or rings formed of fewer atoms also exist. But
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 367

while rings of six or five atoms easily form, it is more difficult to com-
bine fewer atoms, four or three, to a closed chain. The cause of this
fact Baeyer recognized as lying in the stereometric conditions. The
angles which the sides of a regular hexagon and pentagon form with
each other very nearly coincide with those in which the directions of
the valencies of the carbon atom intersect each other, and thus in
linking five or six atoms together the circle, so to speak, closes itself,
while if more or less atoms are present this can only be arrived at by
strong deviation of the directions of affinity.

But still more surprising discoveries were hidden in van’t Hoft’s the-
ory. The gifted Dutch thinker had penetrated to the idea that two
atoms which are linked together by asingle valency rotate freely around
an axis the direction of which coincides with that of the linking valency,
but that this rotation is stopped as soon as double linking takes place.
This latter is an immediate ¢ nsequence of the tetrahedric conception.
IfI stretch out my two fore-fingers and let their points touch each other,
then the hands can rotate around them as an axis; butif I stretch both
thumbs and both fore-fingers and allow their corresponding points to
touch each other, then a system results in which rotation is impossible.

These two propositions of van’t Hoff, having remained almost un-
noticed for a decade, have lately come into great prominence. Inaseries
of important researches Johannes Wislicenus has proved that apply-
ing these propositions and at the same time considering the specific
affinities of the groups or elements present, the stereometric aggrega-
tion of the atoms in certain molecules can be determined with prob-
ability. In an ingenious manner he has utilized the addition phenomena
shown by carbon atoms trebly linked together for an interpretation of
a stereometric aggregation of the atoms in the compounds formed,

Wislicenus, applying van’t Hoff’s ideas with courage and strictness,
has advanced organic chemistry in an important manner and has opened
a ‘field for experimental research, which heretofore had been avoided
with a precaution suggestive of timidity.

New discoveries came from other sides. An intimate research into
the oxims of benzil lead to the surprising result that the validity of the
second proposition of van’t Hoff is not without exception. Cases were
noticed in which the free rotation of carbon atoms united by a simple
bond, which van’t Hoff disclosed, did not obtain. Further inquiry into
this subject led to a renewal of the question, ‘* What does chemical
valency really mean?” A question to which the mind incessantly de-
mands an answer. It had long since been suggested that vaiency had
some relation to the electric behavior of the atoms. The chemistry of
the day expresses Faraday’s fundamental electrolytic law thus: An
electric current which flows through several fused electrolytes severs
in each of them the same number of valencies, not of atoms.

It was found by von Helmholtz that those quantities of electricity
which, during the electrolytic process, move with the ions are dis-
368 THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY.

tributed among the valencies. Riecke, in virtue of his pyro-electric re-
searches, was led to the view that the atoms are surrounded by certain
systems of positive and negative electric poles.

Uniting these results with those of purely chemical experimentation,
we arrive at the idea that the valencies do not appear as points of attack
proper, but as having linear dimensions. The carbon atom represents
itself as a sphere, surrounded by an envelope of ether which contains
the valencies. The latter seem to be determined by the presence of two
opposite electric poles which rest at the ends of a very short straight
line. Such a system is calleda di-pole. The attachment of two valencies
to each other consists in the attraction of their opposed poles. It is
evident that ina radial position of the di-poles they form an axis around
which the atoms are able to rotate, but that this rotation is upset in
ease of a tangential position. In what has been said so far and through
further considerations in regard to the electrical charge of the atoms
and of the di-poles a reason is found for tbe repulsion of the four
valencies and consequently for the tetrahedric grouping of the same.

The fact that the valencies can deviate from this position now becomes
intelligible; we perceive why the valencies of one atom can not unite
with one another, while those of different atoms can combine; it is
clear that there can exist two kinds of simple linking, one of which
admits of rotation, while the other does not; finally, that in cases of
manifold linking the free rotation must be annulled. Hence this hypoth-
esis opens to us an understanding of the most important properties of
chemical valency.

So much may be said of the problems relating to the theory of valency.

But the doctrine of substitution has likewise experienced a peculiar
enlargement. Dumas first showed that the properties of organic com-
pounds are generally little changed when the hydrogen of the same is
replaced by univalent elements or groups. Now it has been learned
from later experiments that even much more radical changes in tie
composition do not materially influence the properties of the substance.
If for example we replace in the hydro-carbon benzol—two carbon and
two hydrogen atoms by one atom of sulphur, the resulting product,
thiophen, resembles benzol chemically and physically so closely as to
be mistaken for it. We learn from this that the sulphur atom is able
to take upon itself the functions of four atoms of entirely different
nature. Similar facts have been found in regard to oxygen and to the
imido group, which is equivalent to it.

Turning away from these researches to cast a glance upon general
chemical studies which lie some years behind us, we must above all
consider one of the most far-reaching discoveries of our epoch, the rev-
elation of the natural system of the chemical elements. We owe this to
the far-seeing Demetrius Mendelejeff. By the side of the titanic figure
of the Russian scholar we see the Englishman, Newlands, and our own
countryman, Lothar Meyer, successfully co-operating in the foundation
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 369

and the structure of this work. What these men created has since
become generally known; they showed that the properties of the elements
are functions of their atomic weights. Mendelejeff taught us to predict
the existence and the properties of chemical elements as yet unknown
with a certainty that reminds us of Le Verrier’s prediction of the dis-
covery of the planet Neptune. We can say with confidence that even
to-day numerous elements, the qualities of which, as well as the place
which they will occupy in the system, can be minutely foretold, wait
merely to be discovered.

The natural system has imposed upon us a problem of the greatest
significance in the new determination of the atomic weights, the numer-
ical values of which are pow of increased interest. But numerous other
problems are presented by the new system of the elements. Above all
we are at a loss to discern the cause of the inner nexus of the elements
as the system offers it. Also by diligent work the less studied elements
must be properly brought within the system. Fortunate circumstances
may allow us to discover the numerous elements indicated by the peri-
odic law. Here let us note a peculiar coincidence. We know to-day
about seventy elements, but Mendelejeff’s table indicates so far—two
small periods of seven elements each, and five large ones of seventeen
elements, respectively. To these must be added hydrogen, forming a
‘‘ group ” in itself.

By addition of these figures, (2 x 7) + (5 x 17) + 1, we obtain exactly
the number 100.

Itis true that no one can say whether the missing elements will
really be discovered, or if further new periods might not be indicated
by which this number 100 would be exceeded. But, as far as positive
data are at hand, they indicate exactly the number mentioned and
nothing points beyond it,—an odd coincidence which seems to ally
the number of the existing elements with the number of our fingers.

The discovery of the system of the elements leads us back to the
question whether the chemical elements are separate worlds in them-
selves or whether they represent different forms or conditions under
which one ultimate substance exists, a question that has occupied the
philosophical mind since very early times. The same question was
raised anew by the discovery of spectral analysis. Whosvever regards
the numerous lines of the spectrum of a metal will hardly be convinced
that the metal from which they emanate should be an eternally un-
decomposable element. Ina similar manner the compound nature of
the elements is indicated by comparison of the regularities in numbers
of the atomic weights with the homologous series of organic chemistry.

In the pursuit of this question, which, since Prout’s hypothesis and
the surprises offered by Stas’s determinations of atomic weights, has not
been allowed to rest, positive results are not to be found. The decom-
position of substances called elements into simpler ones has not been
accomplished.

H. Mis. 12924
370 THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY.

Nevertheless something has been achieved, since an increased interest
has been drawn towards pyro-chemical research.

To-day new methods of experiment permit of a comparatively easy
determination of the vapor density and consequently of the molecular
state of the substances at the highest temperatures.

Numerous inorganic compounds, above all the very elements, have
been studied in regard to their vapor density at a white heat.

While many of them, as oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and mercury, re-
main unchanged under such conditions, the molecules of chlorine, bro-
mine, and iodine, respectively, were split into two atoms, in conformity
with Avogadro’s surmise of the compound nature of elementary mole-
cules.

In the same manner, the vapor density, and hence the molecular
condition of the less volatile substances, zinc, thallium, antimony, and
bismuth, was sucessfully determined at a white heat.

Careful research resulted in the exposure of the old fallacy of the
existence of a sulphur molecule containing six atoms.

But how many of the problems which crowd around us at this Boing
are for the time being entirely beyond the reach of the experimenter !

To-day pyro-chemical work is limited to a temperature of 1700° C.,
because vessels of porcelain and platinum, to the use of which we are
limited, fuse above that temperature. The possibility of performing
quantitative experiments at these temperatures seemed to us some years
ago to be an unexpected progress, but to-day we complain that the
trivial cause of a want of proper vessels forbids us to increase the tem-
perature up to 2000° or 3000° C. There is no doubt that we should
arrive at new unthought-of facts, that the splitting of still other ele-
mentary molecules would be possible, that a new chemistry would be
revealed to us, if—being provided with vessels of infusible material, we
could work at temperatures at which water vapor could not exist and
at which detonating gas would be a non-inflammable mixture!

Let us now enter other fields of physical chemistry. Golden fruit,
daily increasing, has been harvested upon this field during these latter
days. Again we see van’t Hoff take the lead. His keen eye has en-
abled us to penetrate the nature of solution, which forms the beginning
of anew epoch in molecular physics. The quintessence of his discover-
ies may be thus expressed:

‘Solutions of different substances in the same liquid, which contain
in the same volume an equal number of molecules of the dissolved sub-
stance, show the same osmotic pressure, the same vapor pressure, and the
same freezing point.”

This surprising generalization offers the possibility of determining
the true molecular weight of substances by experimenting upon them in
solution, while heretofore this has only been possible by transforming
them into the gaseous state, hence only for volatile substances, since
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. ol

dilute solutions behave in regard to the molecular state of the dissolved
substance like gases.

In this manner new methods are given for the determination of molec-
ular weights, which we are now able to determine by means of meas-
urements relating to the freezing point, the vapor pressure, or the osmotic
pressure of a solution of the substance to be tested.

These results are of the highest possible practical im portance for chem-
istry, since they widen in an unexpected manner the possibility of the
determination of molecular weights, and in a still higher degree we are
surprised by the elucidation which they offer in regard to the nature of
solution. Clausius had already admitted, within narrower limits, that
in solutions of electrolytes some of the dissolved molecules were decom-
posed into their ions, but now this has been proved in a larger measure,
particularly by Arrhenius. What achange our conceptions will have
to undergo if we have to accustom ourselves to regard a dilute solution
of sodium chloride as one containing, not undecomposed molecules of
this salt, but separated atoms of sodium and chlorine!

We owe these revolutionizing innovations to the investigations of
van’t Hoff, Arrhenius, Ostwald, Plauck and de Vrie, but in regard to
experimental research especially to the splendid work of Raoult, which
during recent years has etfected this mighty theoretical progress.

Thus we see physical chemistry moving on in weighty development.
Special laboratories are opened for her, and a special journal also has
been started which is open alike to the records of experiment and to
theoretical discussion. Through the foundation of this organ physical
chemistry has been furthered in a most active manner. All the
questions of the time and all those in dispute belonging to this depart-
ment of science receive in this paper a thorough discussion. Dynamical-
chemical questions are successfully studied, a significant impetus is
given to the study of structure and affinity (widened as our knowledge
of the nature of solutions has made necessary), by means of the study
of the relations between chemical nature and electric conduction.

The inquiry into the intimate relations that exist between physical
and chemical properties, which was inaugurated half a century ago by
Hermann Kopp, is now being deepened and widened.

It is true that the great hopes which sprang from the study of thermo-
chemical questions have so far been only partly fulfilled, but consecutive
measurements offer more clearness also in this case.

There is no field of our science in which we may expect greater revo-
lutions in the time near at hand than in that of physical chemistry !
The value of these for general chemistry will be greater in proportion
as the representatives of the same will recognize their task in this:
Above all to remain upon the chemical standpoint and to improve chem-
istry by the application of physical modes of thought and experiment.
Those who tried to further the progress of chemistry by the use of
physical methods, but with insufficient consideration for chemical rela-

tions, have been led into serious errors. The respect due to work of
the highest merit, continued for years, has thus been lessened. Ap-
parently this has even been overdone, and it is much to be deplored if
the interest of chemists for physical chemistry should be diminished
because some of its representatives are inclined to over-rate the value
of their results. He who swims in the midst of high waves is unable
at times to see over the crests.

Innumerable, also, are the problems which meet us in the domain of
organic chemistry.

After the astonishing harvest of synthetical results which has been
reaped here, hardly any problem of synthesis seems unapproachable.
Since the artificial preparation of alizarin by Graebe and Liebermann,
of indigo by von Baeyer, of conine by Ladenburg, of uric acid by Hor-
baezewski and particularly by Behrend, since Emil Fischer and Kili-
ani have elucidated the chemistry of the sugar group and Wallach
that of the terpenes, we may well look hopefully for a clearer knowledge
of the bodies comprised under the name albumin, and to its synthesis.

But even such success tends only to render us more modest, since
it shows us at the same time how narrow are the limits within which
chemical synthesis moves. Assuming even that the preparation of
albumin had been achieved, how infinitely far we should still be from
a conception of the nature of organized bodies! Perhaps science is
separated by an impassable chasm from the artificial preparation of a
simple cell. Such an achievement lies at least beyond the sphere of
chemistry.

But shall we really never succeed in sounding the process of assim-
ilation, which, in spite of its simplicity, presents itself to us so enig-
matically? Will it be found impossible to prepare artificially in our
laboratories, from carbon dioxide and water, sugar and starch, a proc-
ess which nature performs unceasingly in the green parts of plants?

The chemist however should not step prematurely upon the field of
biology while so many great problems remain untouched in his own
peculiar sphere of investigation.

The method of research in organic chemistry, in spite of the brilliant
successes already recorded, forces us even to-day to confess that only
a very minute proportion of known substances is within its reach. In
order to isolate an organic substance we are generally confined to the
purely accidental properties of crystallization or volatilization. Have
not those thousands of amorphous substances which cannot be char-
acterized by any chemical property and which the chemist is forced to
lay aside because he is unable either to purify them or to transform
them into volatile or crystallizable bodies,—have they not the same
claim upon our interest as their more beautiful and more manageable
comrades ?

The most significant progress of organic chemistry does not consist
in single discoveries, nor in further expansion of synthetical success.
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 373

What we want is: new methods for recognizing the individuality of
substances. The black substances of earthy nature, the innumerable
formless and resinous products in the bodies of plants and animals,
the coloring matter which gives beauty to flowers, all of these to-day
mock our efforts to know them; they will form a new and inexhaustible
field for the prosecution of chemical research, when methods shall have
been found with which to begin this research.

And as in organie chemistry, so in mineral chemistry every step leads
to questions which we have as yet no means of answering. The syn-
thesis of minerals and of rocks has made important progress, it is true,
and this as well as the application of the doctrine of structure to the
study of mineral species gradually leads to the understanding of their
constitution; but we are as yet unable to use, in the study of min-
erals, the method of analytical decomposition which has been so success-
fully used to study the constitution of organic substances, and above
all we lack the least knowledge in regard to the true molecular weight
of minerals.

Quite recently we have been presented with no less than three new
and fruitful methods for the @etermination of the molecular weight, but
not one of them gives us an indication of the true moiecular weight of
the most simple oxides, such as silicic anhydride or calcium oxide.

We know to-day very well that silicic auhydride can not have the
formula SiO., that this must be multiplied by a very large factor; but
of the numerical value of this latter we have no indication. And thus
also in mineral chemistry we must aim not exclusively at finding new
facts, but new methods of research in the first place, if a period of new
discoveries is to be attained in this branch of our science.

But how can we conclude this brief review without mentioning also
the applications of chemistry to the industrial arts, the progress of which
has mainly contributed to spread the splendor of our science most
widely? The infinite variety of the tar colors, surpassing the colors of
flowers in number and brightness, is daily increased by new discoveries.
The technology of these dyes and pigments forms the most brilliant
triumph of purely scientific laboratory work applied to manufactures.
This industry in the simplest manner and on the largest scale performs
the synthesis of compounds the complex nature of which is indicated
by the names they bear. The unscientific man is frightened when a
beautiful and brilliant dye is referred to as Hevamethylmethoxytriamido-
triphenylcarbinol; for the initiated there lies in this unpleasant name
a full account of the synthesis and the constitution of the dye.

Industry has learned to derive not only colors, but healing medicines
also from coal tar. Antipyrin, discovered by Knorr, upon the basis of
Emil Fischer’s fundamental research upon the hydrazines, brings to
thousands suffering from fever, relief at least—if notcure. Let us hope
that the time is not far distant when real fever curatives, which like
the natural alkaloids of the cinchona bark, not only temporarily sup-
374 THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY.

press the disease, but really cure it, may be prepared by synthesis.
Until then be patient and do not chide chemistry if, for the time being,
she offers only silver instead of gold.

Events in this field of the great chemical industries are significant.
We are the witnesses of a great combat taking place between the older
process of Le Blane for the preparation of soda and the new one of
Solvay called the ammonia-soda process. The intelligence and in-
ventive genius of manufacturers have added under the pressure of this
competition a large number of improvements to the manufacture of
sulphuric acid and of soda, and new and valuable methods for the
preparation of chlorine. Here, more than in any other branch of
chemical industry, the struggle for existence is fierce.

The manufacture of iron, that most important chemical industry, is
transformed by innovations. The imposing changes wrought by the
older process of Bessemer, by the new one of Thomas, are they not
based purely upon chemical reactions? The grandest application of a
a complicated chemical reaction to a great manufacture is, perhaps,
the dephosphorizing of pig-iron by lining the Bessemer converter with
basic material, an invention which we owe to Thomas and Gilchrist.
From this again, agriculture derives an advantage in the use of the
Thomas slag containing the phosphorus which heretofore rendered iron
ore less valuable. This then is truly a transformation of stone into
bread, similar to the older manufacture of soluble fertilizers from
mineral phospbates. Nevertheless, the era of bliss which was prophe-
sied three years ago at the Berlin meeting of naturalists by our illus-
trious colleague, Ferdinand Cohn, has not yet dawned. He held that
all struggles for existence amongst men, arising from want of food, (the
bread question,) will be done away with, when chemistry shall have
learned to prepare starch from carbon dioxide and water. But since
time immemorial the farmer is occupied in this very chemical industry,
and it would hardly be great progress if the farm were merely replaced
by a chemical factory. But we may reasonably hope that chemistry
will teach us to make the fiber of wood a source of human food.

Indeed, if we consider how small is the quantity of starch which the
grain furnishes us, and further that the wood fiber has exactly the same
chemical composition as starch, we see the possibility of increasing the
production of food indefinitely by solving this problem: To transform
cellulose into starch.

Jf this problem were solved we should find an inexhaustible source
of human food in the wood of our forests, in grass, and even in straw
and chaff. The beautiful researches of Hellriegel have recently dis-
closed the fact, which in former times was disputed, that certain piants
transform atmospheric nitrogen into albumin and that this process can
be improved by suitable treatment.

The increase of albumin in plants, according to a plan, together with
the production of starch out of cellulose—this would in reality signify
the abolition of the bread question.
THE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY. 375

May it some day be granted to chemistry through such a discovery
to inaugurate a golden age for humanity.

I have tried to give a review of the most important problems which
are set before chemical science. I have mentioned a goodly number,
but the short time of one hour permits me to touch but slightly upon
the greater ones. There are so many problems before us, which await
an immediate solution as to justify what I said in the beginning; that
to-day the chemist has no time to complain because the epoch of a
mathematical treatment of his science has not vet arrived.

Nevertheless, the brilliant successes which have been gained, the
wonderful results which are immediately within our reach, have not
the power to turn our eyes from this final problem.

The Newton prophesied to Chemistry by Emil du Bois Reymond,
may he appear at a later period; until he comes, may many a genera-
tion honorably plow on in the sweat of its brow! We must remember
that nature is not understood by us until we are able to reduce its phe-
nomena to simple movements, mathematically traceable.

The time will come, even for chemistry, when this highest kind of
treatment will prevail. The epoch in which the foremost impulse of
its research was a serenely creative imagination will then have passed;
the joys, but also the pangs and struggles, peculiar to youth, will have
been overcome.

Re-united to Physics, her sister science, from whom her ways at
present are separated, Chemistry will run her course with firm and
unfaltering steps.
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE.*

By Prof. RAPHAEL MELDOLA, JF. R.S.

The history of a discovery which has been developed to such a
remarkable degree of perfection as photography has naturally been a
fruitful source of discussion among those who interest themselves in
tracing the progress of science. It is only my presence in this lecture
theater, in which the first public discourse on photography was given
by Thomas Wedgwood at the beginning of the century, that justifies
my treading once again a path which has already been so thoroughly
well beaten. If any further justification for trespassing upon the
ground of the historian is needed, it will be found in the circumstance
that in the autumn of last year there was held a celebration of what
was generally regarded as the jubilee of the discovery. This celebra-
tion was considered by many to have reference to the public disclosure
of the Daguerreotype process, made through the mouth of Arago to the
French Academy of Sciences on August 10, 1839. There is no doubt
that the introduction of this process marked a distinct epoch in the
history of the art, and gave a great impetus to its subsequent develop-
ment. But while giving full recognition to the value of the discovery
of Daguerre, we must not allow the work of his predecessors and con-
temporaries in the same field to sink into oblivion. After the lapse of
half a century we are in a better position to consider fairly the influ-
ence of the work of different investigators upon modern photographie
processes.

I have not the least desire on the present occasion to raise the ghosts
of dead controversies. In fact, the history of the discovery of pho-
tography is one of those subjects which can be dealt with in various
ways, according to the meaning assigned to the term. There is ample
scope for the display of what Mr. Herbert Spencer calls the ‘bias of
patriotism.” If the word “ photography” be interpreted literally as
writing or inscribing by light, without any reference to the subsequent
permanence of the inscription, then the person who first intentionally
caused a design to be imprinted by light upon a photo-sensitive com-
pound must be regarded as the first photographer. According to Dr.
Eder, of Vienna, we must place this experiment to the credit of Johann

Heinrich Schulze, the son of a German tailor, who was born in the Duchy
of Madgeburg, in Prussia, in 1687, and who died in 1744, after a life of
extraordinary activity as a linguist, theologian, physician, and philoso-
pher. In the year 1727, when experimenting on the subject of phos-
phorescence, Schulze observed that by pouring nitrie acid, in which
some silver had previously been dissolved, on to chalk, the undissolved
earthy residue had acquired the property of darkening on exposure to
light. This effect was shown to be due to light, and not to heat. By
pasting words cut out in paper on the side of the bo!tle containing his
precipitate, Schulze obtained copies of the letters on the silvered chalk.
The German philosopher certainly produced what might be called a
temporary photogram. Whatever value is attached to this observa-
tion in the development of modern photography, it must be conceded
that a considerable advance was made by spreading the sensitive com-
pound over a surface instead of using it in mass. It is hardly necessary
to remind you here that such an advance was made by Wedgwood and
Davy in 1802.* The impressions produced by these last experimenters
were unfortunately of no more permanence than those obtained by
Schulze three quarters of a century before them.

It will perhaps be safer for the historian of this art to restrict the
term photograph to such impressions as are possessed of permanence.
I do not of course mean absolute permanence, but ordinary durability
in the common-sense acceptation of the term. From this point of view
the first real photographs, 7. €., permanent impressions of the camera
picture, were obtained on bitumen films by Joseph Nicéphore Niepce,
of Chalons-sur-Sione, who, after about 20 years’ work at the sub-
ject, had perfected his discovery by 1826. Then came the days of silver
salts again, when Daguerre, who commenced work in 1824, entered into
a partnership with Niepce in 1829, which was brought to a termination
by the death of the latter in 1833. The partnership was renewed be-
tween Daguerre and Niepce de St. Victor, nephew of the elder Niepce.
The method of fixing the camera picture on a film of silver iodide on a
silvered copper plate—the process justly associated with the name of
Daguerre—was ripe for disclosure by 1838, and was actually made
known in 1839.

The impartial historian of photography who examines critically into
the evidence will find that quite independently of the French pioneers
experiments on the use of silver salts had been going on in this coun-
try, and photographs, in the true sense, had been produced almost
simultaneonsly with the announcement of the Daguerreotype process by
two Englishmen whose names are as household words in the ranks of
science. I refer to William Henry Fox Talbot and Sir John Herschel.
Fox Talbot commenced experimenting with silver salts on paper in

1854, and the following year he sueceeded in imprinting the camera
picture on paper coated with the chloride. In January, 1839, some of
his ** photogenic drawings”—the first ‘silver prints” ever obtained—
were exhibited in this insarcian by Michael Faraday. In the same
month he communicated his first paper on a photographie process to the
Royal Society, and in the following month he read a second paper
before the same society, giving the method of preparing the sensitive
paper and of fixing the prints. The outcome of this work was the
‘*Calotype” or Talbotype process, which was sufficiently perfected for
portraiture by 1840, and which was fully described in a paper commu-
nicated to the Royal Society in 1841. The following year Fox Talbot
received the Rumford medal for his *‘ discoveries and improvements in
photography.”*

Herschel’s process consisted in coating a glass plate with silver chlo-
ride by subsidence. The details of the method, from Herschel’s own
notes, have been published by his son, Prof. Alexander Herschel.t
By this means, the old 40-foot reflecting telescope at Slough was pho-
tographed in 1859. By the kindness of Professor Herschel, and with
the sanction of the Science and Art Department, Herschel’s original
photographs have been sent here for your inspection. The process of
coating a plate by allowing a precipitate to settle on it in a uniform
film is however impracticable, and was not further developed by its
illustrious discoverer. We must credit him however as being the first
to use glass as a sub-stratum. Herschel further discovered the im-
portant fact that while the chloride was very insensitive alone, its sen-
sitiveness was greatly increased by washing it with a solution of silver
nitrate. It is to Herschel also that we are indebted tor the use of
sodium thiosulphate as a fixing agent, as well as for many other dis-
coveries in connection with photography which are common matters of
history.

Admitting the impracticability of the method of susidence for pro-
ducing a sensitive film, it is interesting to trace the subsequent devel-
opment of the processes inaugurated about the year 1539. The first of
photographie methods—the bitumen process of Niepce—survives at
the present time, and is the basis of some of the most important of
modern photo-mechanical printing processes. [Specimens illustrating
photo-etching from Messrs. Waterlow & Sons exhibited.| The Daguer-
reotype process is now obsolete. As it left the hands of its inventor
it was unsuited for portraiture on account of the long exposure re-
quired. It is evident moreover that a picture on an opaque metallic
plate is incapable of re-production by printing through, so that in this
respect the Talbotype possessed distinet advantages. This is one of
the most important pomits in Fox Talbot’s contributions to photogra-

phy. He was the first to produce a transparent paper negative from
which any number of positives could be obtained by printing through.
The silver print of modern times is the lineal descendant of the Tal-
botype print. After 40 years’ use of glass as a substratum we are
going back to Fox Talbot’s plan, and using thin flexible films—not ex-
actly of paper, but of an allied substance—celluloid. [Specimens of

If L interpret this fragment of history correctly, the founders of mod-
ern photography are the three men whose labors have been briefly
sketched. The jubilee of last autumn marked a culminating point in
the work of Niepee and Daguerre and of Fox Talbot. The names of
these three pioneers must go down to posterity as coequal in the annals
of scientific discovery. {Portraits by Mr. H. M. Elder shown.| The
lecture theater of the Royal Institution offers such tempting opportu-
nities to the chronicler of the history of this wonderful art that I must
close this treatment of the subject by reminding myself that in select-
ing the present topic I had in view a statement of the case of modern
photography from its scientific side only. There is hardly any inven-
tion associated with the present century which has rendered more splen-
did services in every department of science. The physicist and chemist,
the astronomer and geographer, the physiologist, pathologist, and an-
thropologist will all bear witness to the value of photography. The
very first scientific application of Wedgwood’s process was made here
by the illustrious Thomas Young, when he impressed Newton’s rings on
paper moistened with silver nitrate, as described in his Bakerian lecture
to the Royal Society on November 24, 1803. Professor Dewar has just
placed in my hands the identical slide, with the Newton rings still visi-
ble, which he believes Young to have used in this classic experiment.

Our modern photographie processes depend upon chemical changes
wrought by light on films of certain sensitive compounds. Bitumen
under this influence becomes insoluble in hydro-carbon oils, as in the
heliographiec process of the elder Niepce. Gelatine mixed with potas-
sium dichromate becomes insoluble in water on exposure to light, a
property utilized in the photo-etching process introduced in 1852 by
Fox Talbot, some of whose original etchings have been placed at my
disposal by Mr. Crookes. [Shown.] Chromatized gelatine now plays
a most important part in the autotype and many photo-mechanical proc-
esses. The salts of iron in the ferric condition undergo reduction to the
ferrous state under the influence of light in contact with oxidizable or-
ganic compounds. The use of these iron salts is another of Sir John
Herschel’s contributions to photography (1842), the modern ‘ blue
print” and the beautiful platinotype being dependent on the photo-
reducibility of these compounds. [Cyanotype print developed with

THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE. 381

Of all the substances known to chemistry at the present time, the
salts of silver are by far the most important in photography on account
of the extraordinary degree of sensitiveness to which they can be
raised. The photographic image with which it is my privilege to deal
ou this occasion is that invisible impression produced by the action of
light on a film of a silver haloid. Many methods of producing such
films have been in practical use since the foundation of the art in 1839,
All these depend on the double decomposition between a soluable chlo-
ride, bromide, or iodide, and silver nitrate, resulting in the formation
of the silver haloid in a vehicle of some kind, such as albumen (Niepee
de St. Victor, 1848), or collodion on glass, as made practicable by Scott
Archer in 1851. For 20 years this collodion process was in universal
use; 1ts history and details of manipulation, its development into a
dry plate process by Colonel Russell in 1861, and into an emulsion
process by Bolton and Sayce in 1864, are facts familiar to every one.

The photographie film of the present time is a gelatino-haloid (gen-
erally bromide) emulsion. If a solution of silver nitrate is added to a
solution of potassium bromide and the mixture well shaken, the silver
bromide coagulates and rapidly subsides to the bottom of the liquid as
a dense curdy precipitate. [Shown.] If instead of water we use a
viscid medium, such as gelatine solution, the bromide does not settle
down, but forms an emulsion, which becomes quite homogeneous on
agitation. [Shown.] ‘This operation, omitting all details of ripening,
washing, etc., as well known to practical photographers, is the basis of
all the recent photographic methods of obtaining negatives in the
camera. The use of this invaluable vehicle, gelatine, was practically
introduced by R. L. Maddox in 1871, previous experiments in the same
direction having been made by Gaudin (1855-61). Such a gelatino-
bromide emulsion can be spread uniformly over any sub-stratum-—glass,
paper, gelatine, or celluloid—and when dry gives a highly sensitive
film.

The fundamental problem which 50 years’ experience with silver haloid
films has left in the hands of chemists is that of the nature of the chemical
change which occurs when a ray of light falls on such a silver salt. Long
before the days of photography, far back in the sixteenth century, Fabri-
cius, the alchemist, noticed that native horn silver became colored when
brought from the mine and exposed. The fact presented itself to Robert
Boyle in the seventeenth century, and to Beccarius, of Turin, in the
eighteenth century. The change of color undergone by the chloride
was first shown to be associated with chemical decomposition in 1777
by Scheele, who proved that chlorine was given off when this salt dark-
ened under water. I can show you this in a form which admits of its
being seen by all. | Potassium iodide and starch paper were placed in
« glass cell with silver chloride, and the arrangement exposed to the

off under these circumstances is either the free halogen or an oxide or
acid of the halogen, according to the quantity of moisture present and
the intensity of the light. I have found that the bromide affects the
iodide and starch paper in the same way, but silver iodide does not give
off any gas which colors the test paper. All the silver haloids become
colored on exposure to light, the change being most marked in the
chloride, less in the bromide, and least of all in the iodide. The latter
must be associated with some halogen absorbent to render the change
visible. [Strips of paper coated with the pure haloids, the lower halves
brushed over with silver nitrate solution, were exposed.| The differ-
ent degrees of coloration in the three cases must not be considered as a
measure of the relative sensitiveness; it simply means that the prod-
ucts of photo-chemical change in the three haloids are inherently pos-
sessed of different depths of color.

From the fact that halogen in some form is given off, it follows that
we are concerned with photo-chemical decomposition, and not with a
physical change only. All the evidence is in favor of this view. Halo-
gen absorbents, such as silver nitrate on the lower halves of the papers
in the last experiment, organic matter, such as the gelatine in an emul-
sion, and reducing agents generally, all accelerate the change of color.
Oxidizing and halogenizing agents, such as mercuric chloride, potas-
sium dichromate, etc., all retard the color change. [Silver chloride
paper, painted with stripes of solutions of sodium sulphite, mercuric
chloride, and potassium dichromate, was exposed.| It is impossible to
account for the action of these chemical agents, except on the view of
chemical decomposition. The ray of light falling upon a silver haloid
must be regarded as doing chemical work; the vibratory energy is
partly spent in doing the work of chemical separation, and the light
passes through a film of such haloid partly robbed of its power of doing
similar work upon a second film. It is difficult to demonstrate this sat-
isfactorily in the lecture room on account of the opacity of the silver
haloids, but the work of Sir John Herschel, J. W. Draper, and others
has put it beyond doubt that there is a relationship of this kind be-
tween absorption and decomposition. It is well known also that the
more refrangible rays are the most active in promoting the decomposi-
tion in the case of the silver haloids. This was first proved for the
chloride by Scheele, and is now known to be true for the other haloids.
It would be presumption on my part in the presence of Captain Abney
to enlarge upon the effects of the different spectral colors on these ha-
loids, as this is a subject upon which he can speak with the authority
of an investigator. Itonly remains to add that the old idea of @ special
“actinic” force at the more refrangible end of the spectrum has long
been abandoned. It is only because the silver haloids absorb these par-
ticular rays that the blue end of the spectrum is most active in pro-
moting their decomposition. Many other instances of photo-chemical
decomposition are known in which the less refrangible rays are the most
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE. 3383

active, and it is possible to modify the silver haloids themselves so as
to make them sensitive for the red end of the spectrum.

The chemical nature of the colored products of photo-chemical decom-
position is still enshrouded in mystery. Beyond the fact that they con-
tain less halogen than the normal salt, we are not much in advance of
the knowledge bequeathed to us by Scheele in the last century. The
problem has been attacked by chemists again and again, but its solu-
tion presents extraordinary difficulties. These products are never
formed—even under the most favorable conditions of division and with
prolonged periods of exposure—in quantities beyond what the chemist
would call ‘a mere trace.” Their existence appears to be determined
by the great excess of unaltered haloid with which they are combined.
Were I to give free rein to the imagination I might set up the hypothesis
that the element silver is really a compound body invariably containing
a minute percentage of some other element which resembles the com-
pound which we now call silver in all its chemical reactions, but alone
is sensitive to light. I offer this suggestioa for the consideration of the
speculative chemist.* For the colored product as a whole, #. ¢., the
product of photo-decomposition with its combined unchanged haloid,
Carey Lea has proposed the convenient term ‘“ photo-salt.” It will avoid
circumlocution if we adopt this name. The photo-salts have been
thought at various times to contain metallic silver, allotropic silver, a
sub-haloid, such as argentous chloride, ete., or an oxy-haloid. The free-
metal theory is disposed of by the fact that silver chloride darkens
under nitric acid of sufficient strength to dissolve the metal freely. The
acid certainly retards the formation of the photo-salt, but does not pre-
vent it altogether. When once formed the photo-chloride is but slowly
attacked by boiling dilute nitric acid, and from the dry photo-salt
mercury extracts no silver. The assumption of the existence of an
allotropic form of silver insoluble in nitric acid can not be seriously
maintained. The sub-haloid theory of the product may be true, but it
has not yet been established with that precision which the chemist has
aright todemand. We must have analyses giving not only the per-
centage of halogen, but also the percentage of silver, in order that it
may be ascertained whether the photo-salt contains anything besides
metai and halogen. The same may be said of the oxy-haloid theory ;
it may be true, but it has not been demonstrated.

The oxy-haloid theory was first suggested by Robert Hunt? for the

*T have gone so far as to test this idea experimentally in a preliminary way, the
result being, as might have been anticipated, negative. Silver chloride, well dark-
ened by long exposure, was extracted with a hot saturated solution of potassium
chloride, and the dissolved portion, after precipitation by water, compared with the
ordinary chloride by exposure to light. Not the slightest difference was observable
either in the rate of coloratiou or in the colors of the products. Perhaps it may be
thought worth while to repeat the experiment, using a method analogous to the
‘method of fractionation” of Crookes.

384 THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE.

chloride; it was taken up by Sahler, and has recently been revived by
Dr. W. R. Hodgkinson. It has been thought that this theory is dis-
posed of by the fact that the chloride darkens under liquids, such as
hydro-carbons, which are free from oxygen. I have been repeating
some of these experiments with various liquids, using every possible
precaution to exclude oxygen and moisture; dry silver chloride heated
to incipient fusion has been sealed up in tubes in dry benzene, petroleum,
and carbon tetrachloride, and exposed since March. [Tubes shown.]}
In all cases the chloride has darkened. The salt darkens moreover in
a Crookesian vacuum.* By these experiments the oxy-chloride theory
may be scotched, but it is not yet killed; the question now presents
itself, whether the composition of the photo-salt may not vary according
to the medium in which it is generated. Analogy sanctions the sup-
position that when the haloid darkens under water or other oxygen-
containing liquid, or even in contact with moist or dry air, that an
oxychloride may be formed and enter into the composition of the photo-
salt. The analogy is supplied by the corresponding salt of copper, viz,
cuprous chloride, which darkens rapidly en exposure. [Design printed
on flat cell filled with cuprous chloride by exposure to electric light.]
Wohler conjectured that the darkened product was an oxychloride, and
this view receives a certain amount of indirect support from these
tubes [shown], in which dry cuprous chloride has been sealed up in
benzene and carbon tetrachloride since March; and although exposed
in a southern window during the whole of that time the salt is as white
as when first prepared. Some cuprous chloride sealed up in water and
exposed for the same time is now almost black. [Shown.]}

When silver is precipitated by reduction in a finely divided state in
the presence of the haloid, and the product treated with acids, the ex-
cess of silver is removed and colored products are left which are some-
what analogous to the photo-salts proper. These colored haloids are
also termed by Carey Lea photo-salts because they present many anal-
ogies with the colored products of photo-chemical change. Whether
they are identical in composition it is not yet possible to decide, as we
have no complete analyses. The first observations in this direction were
published more than 30 years ago in a report by a British Association
Committee,t in which the red and chocolate-colored chlorides are dis-

* Some dry silver chloride which Mr. Crookes has been good enough to seal up for
me in a high vacuum darkens on exposure quite as rapidly as the dry salt in air. It
soon regains its original color when kept in the dark. It behaves, in fact, just as the
chloride is known to behave when sealed up in chlorine, although its color is of
course much more intense after exposure than is the case with the chloride in chlorine.

tThese results were arrived at in three ways. In one case hydrogen was passed
through silver citrate suspended in hot water, and the product extracted with citric
acid. “The result of treating the residue with chloro-hrydic acid, and then dissolving
the silver by dilute nitric acid, was a rose-tinted chloride of silver.” In another ex-
periment the dry citrate was heated in a stream of hydrogen at 212° F., and the pro-
duct, which was partly soluble in water, gave a brown residue, which furnished ‘‘a

tinetly described. Carey Lea has since contributed largely to our
knowledge of these colored haloids, and has made it appear at least
highly probable that they are related to the products formed by the
action of light. [Red photo-chloride and purple photo-bromide and
iodide shown. |

The photographic image is impressed on a modern film in an inap-
preciable fraction of a second, whereas the photo-salt requires an ap-
preciable time for its production. The image is invisible simply be-
cause of the extremely minute quantity of haloid decomposed. In the
present state of knowledge it can not be asserted that the material ecom-
posing this image is identical in composition with the photo-salt, for we
know the composition of neither the one nor the other. But they are
analogous in so far as they are both the result of photo chemical de-
composition, and there is great probability that they are closely related,
if notidentical, chemically. Itmay turnout that there are various kinds
of invisible images, according to the vehicle or halogen absorbent—in
other words, according to the sensitizer with which the silver haloid is
associated. The invisible image is revealed by the action of the de-
veloper, into the function of which I do not propose to enter. It will
suffice to say that the final result of the developing solntion is to mag-
nify the deposit of photo salt by accumulating metallic silver thereon by
accretion or reduction. Owing to the circumstance that the image is
impressed with such remarkable rapidity, and that it is invisible when
formed, it has been maintained, and is still held by many, that the first
action of light on the film is molecular or physical, and not chemical.
The arguments in favor of the chemical theory appear to me to be tol-
erably conclusive, and [ will venture to submit a few of them.

The action of reagents upon the photographic film is quite similar
to the action of the same reagents upon the silver haloids when ex-
posed to the point of visible coloration. Reducing agents and halogen
absorbents increase the sensitiveness of the film: oxidizing and _halo-
genizing agents destroy its sensitiveness. It is difficult to see on the
physical theory why it should not be possible to impress an image on
a film, say of pure silver bromide, as readily as on a film of the same
haloid imbedded in gelatine. Everyone knows that this can not be
done. I have myself been surprised at the extreme insensitiveness of
films of pure bromide prepared by exposing films of silver deposited
on glass to the action of bromine vapor. On the chemical theory we

and Llewelyn. B. A. Rep., 1859, p, 103.

know that gelatine is a splendid sensitizer—?. e., bromine absorbent.
There is another proof which has been in our hands for nearly 30 years,
but I do not think it has been viewed in this light before. It has been
shown by Carey Lea, Eder, and especially by Abney, who has investi-
gated the matter most thoroughly, that a shearing stress applied me-
chanically to a sensitive film leaves an impression which can be devel-
oped in just the same way as though it had been produced by the
action of light. [Pressure marks on Eastman bromide paper developed
by ferrous oxalate.| Now that result can not be produced ona surface
of the pure haloid; some halogen absorbent, such as gelatine, must be
associated with the haloid. Weare concerned here with a chemical
change of that class so ably investigated by Professor Spring, of Liége,
who bas shown that by mere mechanical pressure it is possible to bring
about chemical reaction between mixtures of finely divided solids.*
Then again, mild reducing agents, too feeble to reduce the silver hal-
oids directly to the metallic state, such as alkaline hypophosphites, glu-
cose or lactose and aikali, ete., form invisible images which can be de-
veloped in precisely the same way as the photographic image. All
this looks like chemical change, and not physical modification pure and
simple.

T have in this discourse stoically resisted the tempting opportunities
for pictorial display which the subject affords. My aim has been to suin-
marize the position in which we find ourselves with respect to the in-
visible image after fifty years’ practice of the art. This image is, I
venture to think, the property of the chemist, and by him must the
scientific foundation of photography be laid. Wemay not be able to
give the formula of the photo-salt, but if the solution of the problem has
hitherto eluded our grasp itis because of the intrinsic difficulties of the
investigation. The photographic image brings us face to face—not
with an ordinary, but with an extraordinary class of chemical changes
due entirely to the peculiar character of the silver salts. The material
com posing the image is not of that definite nature with which modern
chemical methods are in the habit of dealing. The stability of the
photosalt is determined by some kind of combination between the sub-
haloid or oxy-haloid, or whatever it may be, and the excess of unaltered
haloid which enters into its composition. The formation of the colored
product presents certain analogies with the formation of a saturated
solution; the product of photo-chemical decomposition is formed under
the influence of light up to a certain percentage of the whole photo-salt,
beyond which it can not be increased,—in other words, the silver haloid
is saturated by a very minute percentage of its own product of photo-
decomposition. The photo-salt belongs to a domain of chemistry—a no-

*The connection between the two phenomena was suggested during a course of
lectures delivered by me two years ago (‘‘ Chemistry of Photography,” p. 191). I
have sincelearnt that the same conclusion had been arrived at independently by Mr,
C. H. Bottamley, of the Yorkshire College, Leeds.

man’s land—peopled by so-called “ molecular compounds,” into which
the pure chemist ventures but timidly. But these compounds are
more and more urging their claims for consideration, and sooner or
later they will have to be reckoned with, even if they lack that definite-
ness which the modern chemist regards as the essential criterion of
chemical individuality. The investigation may lead to the recognition
of a new order of chemical attraction, or of the old chemical attraction
in a different degree. The chemist who discourses here upon this sub-
ject at the end of the half century of photography into which we have
now entered will no doubt know more about this aspect of chemical
affinity ; and if I may invoke the spirit of prophecy in concluding, I
should say that a study of the photographic film with its invisibleimage
will have contributed materially to its advancement.
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.*

BY M. TREUB.

A short time ago botanic gardens were arraigned by the rector of
one of the largest universities of Kurope iu a serious discourse. The
orator, a celebrated phyto-physiologist, complained that these gardens
no longer keep pace with the botanical science of the day. In the
middle ages and until the middle of the sixteenth century botanic gar-
deus were collections of officinal plants. Since that period they have
become truly scientific institutions. Abandoning pure speculation,
attention was given to living things themselves, particularly to plants.
Patrons and scientists combined their efforts to bring from the most
distant countries rare or unknown specimens. In the gardens, depos.
itories of this wealth, the difficult task was attempted of presenting,
ona reduced scale, the entire vegetable world, and of bringing together
(as far as possible), all existing vascular plants. In spite of the con-
stantly increasing number of plants introduced into Europe, this gen-
eral plan was for a long time followed, and not until the beginning of
the present century, was it felt that the method must be changed. In
the first place it should have been recognized that it was impossible to
collect in a single garden, however large and well managed, anything
like the enormous number of vascular plants distributed on our globe.
Besides, (and thisis a more serious argument,) the conditions offered to
introduce plants in gardens are so far from natural, that exotic culti-
vated plants can not be considered as furnishing a proper basis of com-
parison in scientific researches, as these are at present understood.
Too many plants in conditions too abnormal is briefly the criticism
made by the orator.

These institutions, attacked from so high a place, have not failed of
defenders. While recognizing that part of the criticismis well founded,
it is urged that if the object in view was varied somewhat by insisting
—wmore than has heretofore been done—upon the adoption of a common
plan, the botanic gardens of Europe would easily avoid the dangers
with which they are menaced. It is not necessary that we take any
part in this controversy, for the objections—whether well-founded or
not—do not apply to botanic gardens of the tropics, as we will endeavor
to show in the following pages.

162-183.

390 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

The number of botanic gardens situated in the tropical zone is much
greater than might be supposed. According to a recent enumeration
there are not less than fifteen in the British possessions. In the French
colonies they are found at St. Denis in Reunion Island, at La Point-a-
Pitre in Guadeloupe Island, at St. Pierre in Martinique, at Pondicherry,
and at Saigon. Spain has one at Havana, and one at Manila; and Hol-
land has a single one at Buitenzorg in theisland of Java. There are also
tropical botanie gardens in South America, and these bring the total
number to a considerable figure. Still it must be admitted that some
are not botanic gardens properly so-called, but rather agricultural sta-
tions and gardens of acclimation. There are others however, that
while not abandoning tropical agriculture, merit the names of great
scientific establishments. As the chief of this kind, those of Calcutta,
of Buitenzorg in Java, and of Peradeniya in Ceylon (in chronological
order) should be cited.

The royal garden of Calcutta was founded in 1786 by Col. Robert
Hyde, who was its first director. Among his successors are found the
celebrated names of Wallich and Griffith, the greatest naturalist of
our century in the extreme East. The garden of Calcutta has now
been for several years under the wise and able direction of Dr. G. King,
to whose care the herbarium of Calcutta owes its great reputation.
The royal garden of Peradeniya in the Island of Ceylon was founded in
1821. Situated near Kandy, at an altitude of nearly 500 metres [1,600
feet], having a moist and hot climate, occupying more than 60 hectares
[150 acres], and connected as it is with the post of Colombo by a railway,
the garden of Peradeniya possesses conditions most favorable in every
respect. For many years it was under the direction of Dr. Thwaites,
aman of real merit, but who thought a botanic garden in a tropical
country should be in some manner a reduced copy of the virgin forest.
This system, more original than meritorious, excludes any methodical
arrangement of plants and necessarily restricts the number of speci-
mens. Dr. H. Trimen, the successor of Dr. Thwaites, as soon as he
arrived in Ceylon, 9 years ago, realized the disadvantages of the plan
of his predecessor. To distribute over an area of 60 hectares, without
any order, a great number of plants, for the most part not labelled,
was to fatally embarrass the scientific use of the rich collections that
had been brought together. So Dr. Trimen did not hesitate to adopt
anew arrangement of plants according to the natural system and to
Jabel them as far as it was possible todo so. With branch establish-
ments upon the plain and upon the mountain, the garden of Peradeniya
has before it a brilliant future. The third of the gardens mentioned,
that of Buitenzorg in the island of Java, was founded in 1817. We
will briefly relate its history and show by a study of its present organ-
ization that a new era is commencing for large tropical gardens, and
that their influence will constantly increase in the future evolution of
the science of plants.
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN. 391

I.

On the 29th of October, 1815, a squadron quitting the roadstead of
Texel in the north of Holland set sail for the Hast Indies. The passen-
gers (for they carried them upon these ships of war), must have rejoiced
that they had left the storms and fogs of the North Sea for the sunny
coasts of Malaysia. The squadron took to Java the commissioners-
general to whom the sovereign of Holland had committed the task
of assuming in his name the government of the Dutch East Indies.
Being a man of broad views, the new king had attached to the com-
mission a distinguished naturalist, Reinwardt, professor in the Athe-
neum of Amsterdam, in order that the study of the marvellous natural
products which constitute the wealth of the Dutch possessions in the
south of Asia might be settled upon a solid basis.

The squadron did not enter the straits of Sunda until the last of
April in the following year. The high functionaries, sailing after a
long voyage between charming islets, set like emeralds in thin silver
fillets of breakers, breathing the faint odors from the neighboring
coasts, must at last land and take up their task. The future indeed
reserved for them many disappointments, and it was only after long and
tedious diplomatic manceuvers that the English authorities, on the 19th
of August, 1816, decided to turn over to the plenipotentiaries of the king
of Holland the rule of the Dutch Indies. Baron Van der Capellen
the commissioner who was to perform the functions of governor-general
shortly installed himself at Buitenzorg, taking Reinwardt with him.

Buitenzorg, the residence of the viceroy of the Dutch Indies, is
situated 58 kilometres [36 miles] from Batavia, in 106° 53’ 5” east
longitude and 6° 35’ 8” south latitude, upon one of the long ridges
that extend to the north of the great mountain of Salak. An enchant-
ing site, possessing a beautiful and healthful climate, it is not surpris-
ing that the governors-general established themselves there instead of
at Batavia, however large and beautiful that “ city of villas” might be.
This preference, accorded to Buitenzorg by the representatives of the
king, was the cause of the creation of a botanical establishment at that
point. In fact, upon the request of Reinwardt, the commissioners-
general decided —by a decree of April 15, 1817—to found a botanic garden
at Buitenzorg upon an uncultivated territory belonging to the domain
and ceded by Baron Van der Capellen. On this territory, contiguous
to the park and to the palace garden, work was commenced on the 15th
of May by some fifty native workmen, under the direction of two chief
gardeners, one of whom, brought out by Reinwardt, had been employed
in the same capacity in Holland, while the other was a pupil of the
royal garden of Kew. It would have been difficult to find in the whole
island of Java a place more appropriate for a garden of this kind, for
owing to certain conditions, Buitenzorg unites to other advantages
that of having no dry season, properly speaking. It is evident that

only a small number of plants could endure a period of almost con-
tinuous drought for 4 or 5 months, such as is habitual to the east
of Java. Even the climate of Batavia, where 2 or 3 months without
heavy rains are not rare, would be Jess suitable for a botanic garden
than Buitenzorg, where they complain if in the middle of the dry sea-
son, rain is absent for 3 consecutive weeks. These frequent and
heavy rains are doubly advantageous for the garden; Buitenzorg owes
to them its ever luxuriant vegetation (never ceasing, as one may Say),
and they cause a lowering of the mean temperature which makes it
possible to cultivate many plants from the virgin forests of the moun-
tains, although the altitude of Buitenzorg is only 280 metres [900 feet].
In order to give an idea of the mass of water which is ordinarily shed
upon the “Sans Souci” of Java,* it will be sufficient to say that at
Buitenzorg there falls a mean quantity of 4,600 millimetres |180 inches]
of rain per year, while in Holland, one of the most rainy countries of
Europe, there falls per year but 660 millimetres [26 inches]. No set-
tled plan was at first adopted, and the archives contain no indication of
any kind relative to the earliest management of the garden. We
merely know that its founder, Reinwardt, took advantage of many
voyages made by him to send plants to Buitenzorg. Yet the first eata-
logue of the *“* Botanic Garden of the State,” the name officially adopted,
published some months after the departure of Reinwardt, enumerates
only 912 species of plants. Reinwardt returned to Europe in June,
1822, to oceupy a chair in the University of Leyden. Upon his recom-
mendation the Government placed at the head of the garden a botanist
of exceptional merit, Dr. C. L. Blume, who thus became the first director
of the *‘Hortus Bogoriensis,”+ and whose scientific renown was cradled
in the garden at Buitenzorg. Blume displayed a remarkable activity
as director. He commenced in 1825 the publication of a work upon
the flora of Dutch India; with a feverish activity he brought out dur-
ing 1825 and the early part of 1826, seventeen parts, describing more
than 1,200 new species, a great number of genera, and several families
of plants entirely unknown up to that time. The garden profited
directly from the work of Blume, because the collection of living plants
was enriched by a numerous series of species discovered by him. On
the other hand, Blume succeeded in attaching to the garden, besides a
considerable force and the two chief gardeners, a third European gar-
dener, and a draftsman. In short, the young institution came out
brilliantly in every respect, and it seemed to promise a remarkable
future. A cruel reverse however soon proved the uncertainty of these
favorable prognostications. Blume, after having nearly broken down,
had to return to Europe in 1826, to re-establish his health. Almost at
the same time Baron Van der Capellen was re-placed by the Viscount

du Bus de Gisignies. The former had neglected nothing to stimulate
the colony, but in doing this, grand seigneur that he was, he had no
thought of cost. So Du Bus was sent out as commissioner-general,
with an order to diminish the expenses, and to re-establish the balance
of the colonial budget. He executed the orders received, and the ex-
penses were immediately reduced, but how many useful institutions
were nearly or quite suppressed! The botanic garden of Buitenzorg
was the first victim of the new measures. It was nearly wiped out.
In August, 1526, the posts of director and draftsman were abolished and
but one European gardener was left. By a decree of the following year
the special appropriation for the garden was discontinned, and it was
decided that thereafter the “ Botanic Garden of the State” should be
kept up by a part of the sum allowed to the governors-general for the
maintenance of their Park of Buitenzorg.

Happily there are providential interventions, thanks to which, strug-
gling institutions resist the most murderous attacks. Such an inter-
vention occurs when there arises a firm and persevering man who is able
to demonstrate for yet another time, that will triumphs over the most
vigorous decrees due to the necessities of the moment, and destined to
disappear with the circumstances which brought them forth. Sueh a
man arose and the intervention was effected. General Count van den
Bosch, successor to the Viscount Bus de Gisignies, who landed at Ba-
tavia in January, 1830, brought with him from Holland an assistant
gardener, a young man who had occupied an inferior position in a coun-
try house near The Hague. Toward the end of the year the only chief
gardener remaining at the garden fell sick, set out for Europe, and died
on the voyage. The assistant gardener of the governor general was
selected to replace him. His name was J. EK. Teysmann. Half a cen-
tury later this simple gardener, who was given no other instruction
than that of the primary schools, received a testimonial as brilliant as
it was rare of the esteem he had won in the scientific world.

Besides diplomas of honor, medals struck with his effigy, felicitations
from all parts of the world, there was given him an album, in which
more than a hundred botanists, together with Darwin and De Candolle,
offered him their greetings, and this album had inseribed upon it, on a
plate of gold, the following:

*¢ Celeberrimo indefessoque, J.-E. Teysmann cum dimidium per seculum
Archipelagi indici thesaurum botanicum exploravit, mirantes college.”

To have attained this eminence a man must have possessed extraor-
dinary qualities, and Teysmann certainly had them. A man of strong
character in every respect, he to the end of his life united with great
energy and an active intelligence the ardent desire to seize any occa-
sion for self-instruction, for extending his knowledge of his specialty,
and particularly for enlarging his views.

From 1830 to 1837, nothing is heard of either the Garden of Buiten-
zorg or of the chief gardener. The botanic garden existed during that
394 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

period only in name, and the chief officer considered that the first ten
years he passed in Java was only a term of apprenticeship. Still it
was during that period, in 1837, that the colonial government decided
on a measure which was finally to bring about most fortunate conse-
quences.

The executive member of a so-called natural history commission, to
whom was assigned the scientific direction of Buitenzorg, was then
Diard, of French nationality, and it was he who warmly urged upon the
governor the appointment of Mr. Hasskarl, who had recently landed at
Batavia and who wished a position. Diard succeeded in obtaining a
provisional appointment for Mr. Hasskarl, first as gardener, then as
botanist, and in the latter capacity he was charged with the systematic
arrangement of the plants of the garden. Tbis idea of Diard, carefully
carried out, by Mr. Hasskarl, contributes much more to the scientific
value of the garden than does the great number of species cultivated.
Extensive arborescent groups, composed of the largest plants, were
thus arranged in the natural order, and the botanist during the five
years that he was attached to the garden was able to determine a large
number of species and to compose the second catalogue of the garden,
published in 1844, embracing over 3,000 plants, among which were
many entirely new.

Diard and Mr. Hasskarl went to Europe on leave, and Teysmann
again remained alone and in very difficult circumstances, for after the
departure of Diard the control of the botanic garden passed to a mili-
tary man, the steward of the governor general’s palace. ‘This extraor-
dinary arrangement continued, and for about 30 years soldiers con-
trolled the Hortus Bogoriensis. Under such conditions a new period of
decline, if not of complete eclipse, of the garden would have been in-
evitable had it not been for the presence of the energetic Teysmann.
The more difficulties he encountered the more he displayed his rare
qualities in the interests of the institution to which he felt himself at-
tached for life. Travelling much throughout the whole archipelago, he
coutinually sent plants and seeds to the Buitenzorg. Upon his return
he was constantly in the breach, fighting for the interests of his gar-
den, not even recoiling from conflicts with his military chief, conflicts
that it must be confessed were frequent. The result of this line of
conduct was that in 1864, with the aid of Binnendijk, who came to Java
in 1850, Teysmann issued the third catalogue of the garden, in which
the number of species under permanent culture exceeded 8,000.

Finally, in 1868, the long periods of vicissitudes came to a close.
The garden again became a scientific institation of the state, with a
special director and appropriation, and entirely independent of the
stewards of the palace, with whom it was to have, hereafter, only
neighborly relations. This return to the primitive organization was due
to the influence of Teysmann, who himself maintained continuous rela-
tions with the garden by numerous consignments of seeds and plants

gathered during voyages to the remotest parts of the Dutch posses-
sions. The government appointed as director Dr. Scheffer, of the Uni-
versity of Utrecht, a pupil of Mignel, the author of the Flora of the
Dutch East Indies. The new director began his scientific researches
as soon as he was installed at Java. A few years later he obtained
from the government a subsidy for the publication of a scientific collec-
tion entitled Annals of the Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg. During the
administration of Dr. Scheffer two changes of great importance took
place. The collections belonging to the service of the Mines, contained
in a large museum opposite the garden, were transferred to Batavia,
and the government gave the building to the botanic garden for its
herbarium, its collections, and its library. A second, not less impor-
tant, was the founding, in 1876, of a garden and school of agriculture.
The latter has since been abandoned. The considerable extension given
to the garden ought to have implied an increase in the scientific staff.
Unfortunately this was not understood, and Dr. Scheffer remained
alone up to the time of his death, which took place in 1880, when he
was 32 years old. The period since the death of Dr. Scheffer can not
be said to belong to the domain of history, and we will therefore con-
tent ourselves with casting a rapid glance over the present organiza-
tion of the garden. —

The interest attached to the history of any institution depends, above
all, upon the importance and extent which that institution presents at
the time when it is considered. The reader will judge if that is the
case with the establishment of which we are writing.

The State Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg comprises three different
gardens. There is first, the botanic garden proper, in the center of
the city, occupying an area of 36 hectares [89 acres], wedged in between
the park of the governor-general, a little river, the Tjiliwong, and the
postal road. Itis traversed throughout its width by a large and fine
avenue called the Avenue of the Kanaries, after the native name of
the trees that border it, beautiful trunks of Canarium Cammune, attain-
ing a height of about 30 metres [100 feet]. Upon this avenue, which
borders a great pond enlivened by a pretty island, carriages and foot-
men freely pass. TF'rom it roads practicable for carriages, in part open
to the public, pass in all directions and form the arteries to which are
attached a perfect maze of foot-paths of different sorts. Plants of one
family are, as we have said, found together. They form scattered
groups, or rather they occupy one or more divisions bounded by the paths.
Each division has at one of the angles a list of the genera it contains.
Each species is represented by two specimens, one of which carries a
label bearing the scientific name, the native name if there is one, and
usually stating the products of the plant. In consideration of the great
number of climbing plants of tropical countries, Teysmann had the
happy idea of putting them together in a special part of the garden,
where they also are arranged according to their natural affinities.
396 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

There is here offered a wide field for interesting observations. Includ-
ing herbaceous plants, the total number of species is about 9,000. In
the middle of the garden there is a range of nurseries where young
plants are cultivated, partly under shelters that protect them from the
heat of the sun or from the injurious effect of beating rains. Some
plants require special care, notably a certain number of ferns, arums,
and orchids. These are placed in two buildings that resemble the hot-
houses of Europe, with the difference, however, that at Buitenzorg they
serve to keep the plants cool and notto give them a more elevated tem-
perature. The garden has its own carpenters who construct buildings
of this sort; asmall detail which will give an idea of the scale upon
which everything is organized. The native force is composed of about
100 individuals, among whom are 3 employés having special knowledge
of botany, much more than we would expect to find among Malays.
This force works under the orders of a chief gardener and a second
gardener. ‘The garden is open night and day, an arrangement which is
only possible in the Kast where they are not yet sufficiently advanced
to consider that property is robbery. At the two principal entrances
there are gate-keepers but no gates.

The agricultural garden, the second division of the Hortus Bogori-
ensis, i8 situated about a league from the center of Buitenzorg and cov-
ers not less than 70 hectares [173 acres]. The arrangement of the place
and the distribution of the plants at once shows that the aim is ex-
clusively practical. Everything is regular, the roads and foot-paths
intersecting at right angles, the divisions thus formed of almost uniform
size, the plants in each division all of the same species and the same
age. While in the scientific division each species is represented by but
two specimens of each species, here there are a hundred, but only cul-
tivated plants that are or may become useful to agriculture or colo-
nial industries; the different species and varieties of coffee, of tea, of
sugar-cane, of rubber and gutta-percha trees, the Hrythroxylon Coca
which furnishes cocaine, trees which produce tannin and oils, forage
plants, ete. A special part of the garden is reserved for officinal
plants. There is a gardener-in-chief to direct the work, and a force of
70 native workmen.

The third garden is found at a considerable distance from Buitenzorg
on one of the slopes of the neighboring voleano of Gede. With an area
of 30 hectares [74 acres], at an altitude of 1,500 metres [5,000 feet], it
possesses a climate marvelously adapted for the cultivation of plants
of the indigenous mountain flora, as well as those of Australia and
Japan. About 10 natives work there under the orders of a European
gardener. The three gardens which together constitute the State
Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg havea total area of nearly 140 hectares
[346 acres].

The museum, situated opposite the botanic garden proper, is a build-
ing 44 metres long [144 feet], specially constructed for the purpose to
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN. 397

which it is now applied, although it was originally used for mineralog-
ical collections. It is composed of a hall occupying the body of the
principal story, and of two wings. On the floor of the hall are upright
closets along the wall, and glass cases in the center containing collec-
tions both botanical and technical. Part of the exhibits are dried and
part are preserved in spirits. The herbarium occupies the gallery
which runs around the entire hall, 4 metres above the floor. The dried
plants are not, as in Europe, placed in portfolios, but in tin boxes in
order that they may be better protected against insects and moisture,
those great enemies of collections in tropical countries. As a matter of
course, corrosive sublimate, naphthaline and carbon bisulphide are con-
sidered at Buitenzorg as important allies in this constant fight against
insects. The number of tin boxes containing the herbarium exceeds
1,200. Hach box contains, on an average, 100 specimens. One of the
wings of the building is set apart for the service of the museum, a divi-
sion which has for its chief the adjunct director of the garden assisted
by a naturalist. The other wing, a little more than 10 metres long and
nearly 11 metres wide, is wholly devoted to the library, which contains
more than 5,000 volumes. This is a considerable number when it is
remembered that it is a special botanical library, although books of
general natural history and transactions of academies of sciences such
as those of Paris, Berlin and London, are not wanting. In the matter
of descriptive botany an attempt is made to obtain, besides classical
and indispensable works, whatever relates to the flora of the extreme
Orient. The books on general botany are supplemented by the most
recent treatises and publications on morphology, anatomy, physiology,
and vegetable paleontology. But the special wealth of the library of
the garden at Buitenzorg is the series, generally complete, of all the
reports and botanical reviews of the first rank at present published in
Dutch, French, English, and Italian. The special isolation of a botan-
ical garden sit uated at equally remote distances from the scientific cen-
tres of the Old and the New World makes it necessary to attend care-
fully to the maintenance of the library, keeping it well up to the
advances of science.

There are three laboratories, and there will soon be a fourth, for in
accordance with the proposition of the colonial government accepted
by the mother country, the force in the garden of Buitenzorg is to be
increased by two new functionaries, a botanist and a chemist, whose
task it will be to furnish by patient and careful investigations scientific
data as to the useful plants of tropical countries and their culture. The
laboratory intended for the chemist is not yet opened. Behind the
museum in a special building is the pharmacological laboratory where
a pharmacal chemist temporarily attached to the garden carries on
investigations upon alkaloids and other curious and useful substances
which tropical plants contain. Considering the small amount of exact
knowledge that we have concerning these substances this happy inno-
398 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

vation can not but produce results of great practical utility as well as
of great scientific interest.

Two botanical laboratories are placed in the main botanic gardens,
behind the range of nurseries. One of these, a large hall 6 metres wide
and 20 long, is reserved for foreign scientists who come to pass some
time at the Hortus Bogoriensis to make investigations and to study the
tropical flora in its home. This laboratory is lighted by five windows
at each of which there is a work table. Closets placed against the op-
posite wall contain the necessary utensils, optical and other apparatus,
flasks, vases, etc., and the so-called micro-ehemical reagents. Besides,
there is a small collection of working books so that investigators need
not have to depend upon the main library. It is also proposed to facil-
itate the researches of visitors, by placing in the hall a herbarium con-
sisting entirely of specimens of plants cultivated in the garden, so that
in cases of doubt the rapid identification of any such plant may be made
without having recourse to the herbarium of the museum. This special
laboratory herbarium is at present only begun. The arrangement of
the hall is simple, offering at once the advantages of good light and
plenty of room. This last point is an essential thing in hot countries,
where open space is necessary, especially in a laboratory for research.
Even at Buitenzorg, where the evenings, nights, and mornings are
fresh, the mean temperature in the middle of the day is from 28° to 29°
C. [82° to 849 F.]. There are even days during the dry season when
for 2 or 3 hours in the latter part of the day the mercury rises to 31°
C. (88°F. ].

The second botanical laboratory, about 100 paces distant, backed up
against the office of the garden and communicating with it, is reserved
for the director and the new functionary, the botanist who is expected
from Europe.

The fourth laboratory, that of agricultural chemistry will shortly be
established in the garden of agriculture. In the near vicinity of the
botanical laboratory are the offices and a small photographic and litho-
graphic workshop for the draftsman photographer. The offices, formerly
badly arranged in two small rooms of the museum, have just been trans-
ferred to a special building, given up for that use by the Government,
a new proof of the solicitude the government of the Dutch East Indies
and of the mother country always feels for the Garden of Buitenzorg.

if:

What are the principles of the organization we have just described,
and how does it work? What are the advantages peculiar to large
botanical gardens in the tropics, and why is there reason to expect
them to exercise a great influence over the future development of
botany? Before answering these questions an understanding must be
reached on an essential point; that is to say, the different way in which
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN. 399

pure and applied science is studied in Hurope on the one hand and in
a tropical country on the other. When among European peoples sci-
ence took the marvellous flight which characterizes our century, a differ-
entiation soon commenced. Purely scientific studies and investigations
remained as formerly more or less directly attached to the universities
and faculties, ina word, to superior instruction, properly so called. But
at the same time the remarkable useful applications which accempanied
the progress of science necessitated the creation of special institutions,
polytechnic schools, technical laboratories, experimental gardens, agri-
cultural stations, etc. Both of these sister branches, pure and applied
science, equally demanded indefatigable workers, trained in method and
gifted in intelligence. While having a totally different object, they
remain in relation and continual coatact. Still the specialization exists
and it may be easily foreseen that it will increase. It is the same or
will be the same in colonies where the climatic conditions permit the
European to fix his permanent habitation, but it is not the case for
European colonies in tropical countries. There the colonists do not
come with the intention of remaining permanently. On the contrary,
from the time of their arrival in the distant country, however beautiful
and fertile it may be, they are firmly resolved to return to their native
land. The majority of them, having acquired social position or the
wished-for fortune, hasten to return home, almost certain to find that
the recollections of childhood and youth are deceptive, and that the
climate and social organization in Europe are far from reaching the
ideal which they had formed during their sojourn at the antipodes.

Recently the question has been much discussed whether Europeans
can found colonies (in the strict serse of the word) in tropical countries,
reside there for several successive generations, and raise there a pure
blooded race. The celebrated Professor Virchow is one of those who
deny with great authority and energy the possibility of a true acclima-
tion of a European race in a tropical country. If a naturalist who has
dwelt in the beautiful island of Java for some years, and who is a fervent
admirer of it, may be allowed to have an opinion on this mooted ques-
tion, I must avow that everything goes to show that M. Virchow is right.
But whatever opinion may be held concerning the theoretical possibility
of this acclimation, the plain fact is this, that in the Dutch East Indies,
and so far as I know in other tropical countries also that have been
under European control for some centuries, the pure race has not suc-
ceeded in becoming acclimated.

This point once understood, it will be clearly seen why (with rare ex-
ceptions) universities, faculties of sciences, and similar institutions have
hitherto been wanting in tropical colonies. Families send their sons to
Europe to study and take their degrees. The teaching body of the uni-
versity, with its laboratories, its libraries, its cabinets, and its collections,
does not there exist; and yet it is especially in a tropical colony that
material interests, so important there, ought to cause great value to be
400 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

placed upon applied science. This is a contradiction at once apparent,
and which becomes still more obvious if we pass from the general case
to the special one of botany, which is of the first importance, because
of the great influence it has upon tropical agriculture. The time has
passed, and we should be glad of it, when the high price of colonial prod-
ucts, the want of co-operation, excessively cheap labor, and sometimes
also oppression of the native population, made all special knowledge
superfluous to anyone who chose to take the chance of making his for-
tune in agriculture. We are already tar from the period when the
grossest empiricism was usually sufficient, permitting the acquirement
of wealth by those destitute of education and often even of intelligence.

To insure solid results, tropical agriculture—no lessthan that of tem-
perate countries—demands judgment and special knowledge, and the
need is felt of establishing it also on a firm scientific basis. It has it
is true been said, adopting a practical view of the very narrowest kind,
that the contradiction we have just pointed out, did not necessarily exist,
since it was only necessary to take fora scientific basis the results of
the researches of European scientists, only that the application will be
somewnat different in the tropics. This is avery grave error, especially
since it relates tothe phenomena of life. It is vain for us to compare as
to their effects upon vegetation, the dry season with winter, and the
rainy season with spring and summer, The forms and functions in
which vegetable life manifests itself in an equatorial country are quite
different from those in the temperate zone. The essential laws which
rule life are the same, but the manifestations of it are quite different.
It is therefore for the immediate interest of tropical colonies to possess
scientific establishments for the study of life in its forms and in its
functions. As institutions of this kind depending upon universities or
faculties do not exist, it is evident that botanic gardens established by
the state are indispensable. These gardens serve a double purpose,
scientific and practical, but it should not be forgotten that it is in science
only that they must have their root. The scientific institution forms
the trunk on which the branches are grafted. If the trunk is hampered
ever so little in its growth and loses its vigor, the branches will cer-
tainly suffer, and in the end may perish. Thus everything which lowers —
the scientific tone of a tropical botanic garden is contrary not only to
the advancement of science, but also to the direct interests of the colony.

It is neccessary to insist upon this truth because there is always
among agriculturists a tendency to confound a botanic garden with an
agricultural station or with an experimental garden. This error is ex-
cusable in persons who not understanding the festina lente of science,
are continually wishing immediate answers to questions of vegetable
pathology and physiology which they ask in the interests of the special
culture in which they are engaged. This want of patience and compre-
hension of the modus operandi in scientific investigations is the prinei-
pal reason why agricultural stations founded by agriculturists them-
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN, 4()1

selves are liable not to give the results expeeted and certainly merited
by the laudable efforts of those who established them. <A state estab-
lishment pursues its regular development protected against these im-
patient demands. It gradually extends its sphere of action for the
interests of all, but without allowing the variable and often exaggerated
exigencies ofthe moment todisturbit. The first duty of the functionaries
placed by the colonial government at the head of the botanic gardens
is to combat the lack of stability and continuity, the scourge of every
colony. Itis not only the right but the duty of governments to demand
that the persons to whom they have entrusted these posts shall not
have variable and narrow views, excusable in others, but never in a
naturalist. The latter has had the benefit of an enlightened scientific
education, and there is expected of him a certain breadth of view which
should be the result of his own researches. These general principles
admitted, let us see how they are carried out in the particular case
under consideration. The government of the Dutch East Indies author-
izes the director of the garden at Buitenzorg to distribute gratuitously
seeds and plants of useful vegetables. In 1888 there was sent to all
parts of the archipelago 1,400 packages of seeds, cuttings, and young
seedlings of useful plants. It is by means of the garden of agriculture
that it is possible to gratify so many demands. But this garden is part
of a-scientifie organization and would not work well if alone. The fol-
lowing examples will show this: When the remarkable anestbetie
qualities of cocaine were discovered, it was only necessary to go to the
two specimens of Hrythroxylon coca of the group of Erythroxylacex in
the botanic garden proper. Enough seed could be gathered to make a
little plantation in the garden of agriculture. When, a year after, a
scientist urged upon the colonial secretary at The Hague that the in-
troduction of Erythroxylon coca should be attempted at Java, the Bui-
tenzorg authorities were able to answer that thousands of seed gathered
in the garden of agriculture had just been distributed. The tree for a
long time known as the producer of the best quality of gutta-percha,
the Palaquium (Isonandra) gutta is believed to grow nowhere in a wild
state; at all events it is almost impossible to obtain seeds. In the
division of Sapotacew in the garden of Buitenzorg, are two specimens
from 30 to 40 years old which produce every 2 years a great number
of seeds. From them has come the young plantation in the garden of
agriculture as well as a great number of specimens in a large separate
plantation of gutta-percha trees commenced by the government some
years ago under the auspices of the garden of Buitenzorg. The cam-
phor tree of Sumatra, a plant of great value, is very difficult to obtain,
first because its seed are very few, then because they lose very rapidly
their germinating power, even during a short voyage. By taking
special pains Teysmann succeeded in introducing the tree at Buiten-
zorg. In 1885 the specimens at the botanic garden began to bear fruit,
and now the garden of agriculture possesses a plantation of young
H, Mis, 129——26
402 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

Sumatra camphor trees, while there is besides a considerable number
of plants to be distributed during the next rainy season. Why was it
that a short time after their qualities became known, the garden of agri-
culture possessed new cacao trees from Nicaragua, rubber trees, forage
plants, and new varieties of coffee plants from Brazil, oleiferous plants,
plants for cooking and useful trees from Gaboon, rubber climbers from
Zanzibar, etc.?2 It was only because, having the great botanic garden
to depend upon, it could offer its correspondents in exchange many a
plant interesting to botany or horticulture. The researches hitherto
made at Buitenzorg upon the pathology and physiology of plants of
general culture have been but few in number, and besides they have
been more or less against the interests of the garden, an additional
proof of what has just been stated. As soon as the two new function-
aries, the botanist and the chemist, especially appointed for these
researches shall arrive, the scientific force of the garden at Buitenzorg
will be sufficiently numerous and varied to answer every need. Onthe
one hand it will be impossible to lower the general scientific tone; on
the other, patient and careful researches will give to agriculture a solid
basis by which it will not fail to profit. The trunk will preserve the
necessary sap for the food of the branches on which practical aims will
have been grafted. That which will be accomplished in a little time for
agriculture, took place a year ago for pharmacology and toxicology.
Although the skillful pharmacal chemist who is the chief of this new
division has only commenced his researches, the results obtained up to
the present time furnish conclusive proofs both of the utility of the
measure undertaken by the colonial government and of the necessity of
attaching this laboratory to a great botanic garden.

At the time of the founding of the Hortus Bogoriensis the great
utility which it would finally be to the colony was perceived, but this
was not the chief motive for its creation. When the government of
Holland sent Reinwardt to the Dutch East Indies it was, as expressly
stated by the sovereign, ‘‘for the purpose of obtaining as thorough a
knowledge of our colonies as our neighbors possess of theirs.” It was
the intention of the king to contribute, by encouraging scientific explo-
ration in the colonies, toward ‘rendering manifest the happy rehabili-
tation of the Dutch name. The result of generous and elevated ideas,
it is the duty of the garden of Buitenzorg never to forget its origin.
To continue an emulation with the neighboring colonies, to aid in mak-
ing known every possible aspect of the exuberant vegetation of the
tropics, to contribute to the advancement of science independent of any
direct utility, is really to render service to the colony, and in a way
which, in the long run, is quite as efficacious as that which looks only
towards direct practical interest. The more civilization advances the
more it is demanded of nations which possess great kingdoms in far-
away countries blessed by heaven that they should not forget that roy-
alty has its responsibilities and that it can not be allowed to withdraw
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN. 403

itself from the noble task of adding to our knowledge of nature, inde-
pendent of any direct advantage, either present or future.

A considerable part of this duty falls upon botanic gardens, especially
when they possess special advantages like that of Buitenzorg. We
said at the beginning that the adverse criticisms made against botanic
gardens would not apply to those of the tropics because the latter are
placed under quite special conditions. In fact, the short descriptions
which we have just given will suffice to make it understood that judg-
ing by Buitenzorg there is no attempt at making an immense collec-
tion of plants in abnormal conditions. It is true that in many divisions
of the garden growth has caused the trees to approach each other too
closely, but the specimens that suffer in this way do not at all remind
us of those slender, spindling specimens of hothouse growth attacked
by the learned critic. As to the conditions offered to plants it is evident
that there is a great difference between hothouses and a garden. Not
that the Hortus Bogoriensis offers to all its plants a perfectly natural
situation, but from that to abnormal conditions is a long way. It is
sufficient to recall that aside from young plants and the very few species
that are cultivated under shelter, all the plants grow in the open ground.
In the second place it is evident that the great number of vegetables
scattered over such a vast space implies the impossibility of giving a
factitious life to any one specimen by over-care. In general it may be
said that every plant introduced into Buitenzorg with which the climate
does not agree ends by dying,—generally in a very short time. The
plants that continue to grow in a tropical garden may develop more or
less well, but it is very rare that we have to admit that they are abnor-
mally developed, so the taxonomist and the morphologist can study the
plants of the garden without fearing to fall every moment upon charac-
ters that are unnatural or disfigured by culture. In the rare cases of
doubt the herbarium is there to serve as a check and to allow a com-
parison with neighboring species not cultivated in the garden. In view
of the great number of tropical ligneous-plants, the study of living spec-
imens has for the systematist some real advantages over the study of
herbarium specimens. The latter are necessarily but small fragments,
carrying, it is true, flowers and fruits, but very rarely showing poly-
morphism, so frequent in vegetation. The physiologist and the anato-
mist may make their researches on development, the play of functions,
and the minute structure of the plants of the garden without the fear
of being led into error by degenerations and reductions due to a life of
starvation and ill-health consequent on unnatural conditions. For this
sort of researches the absence of a dry season is of special advantage
to the garden of Buitenzorg. The periodicity shown in the successive
stages of the evolutionary cycle of a plant is there almost always due
to internal causes and quite rarely to the direct influence of external
causes. This is, for the phyto-physiologist, an advantage which he
does not find in the temperate zone and rarely in the tropics.
404 A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN.

We seein what favorable circumstances the botanists attached to the
Hortus Bogoriensis and residing at Buitenzorg study in every aspect
the flora of the Dutch East Indies, and in general the manifestations
of vegetable life in a tropical country, but they would have very badly
understood their task and shown a regrettable narrowness of ideas if
they had wished to preserve for themselves the discoveries and the in-
vestigations in this vast and fertile field of study. Far from this, it is
their duty to constantly urge their brethren beyond the sea to come and
profit by the opportunity of studying a great number of questions it
would be impossible to attack in Europe. A generous scientific hos-
pitality offered to all, profitable to science and worthy of the colony
that has the advantage of being able to offer it, is the only line of con-
duct proper to follow. For the purpose of carrying outa plan like this
the government of the Dutch East Indies founded at Buitenzorg four
years ago the laboratory of research which is at the disposal of foreign
naturalists.

At length we have reached the important question, what reason is
there to think that botanic gardens in the tropics have entered upon a
new phase in which they will exercise great influence upon the study
of botany? The answer is as simple as it is short: because they have
become botanical stations similar to the zodlogical stations on the coasts
of Europe. Any one interested in natural sciences must know that
zoology owes a great part of its recent rapid advancement to these
littoral stations. However unlikely it may appear we may predict that
botanical gardens of the tropics will have in future a still greater im-
portance in the advancement of botany. To effect this they must be
large and favorably situated like that of Buitenzorg and of Paradeniya,
where they have just followed the example of establishing a laboratory
for visitors.

In order that this prognostication may be realized two things are
necessary. First, that botanists shall follow the example given by
their colleagues, the zodlogists, in becoming less reclusive; then, that
they should have more accurate ideas as to the ‘ perils” to which one
is exposed in a sea voyage, and especially as to the ‘‘dangers” which
meet a visitor to a tropical climate. Rocks, hurricanes, and shipwrecks
on one side, fatal diseases, wild beasts, serpents, and venomous crea-
tures of all kinds on the other, are so many phantoms which haunt
timid imaginations and prejudiced minds. Whoever is acquainted with
the great steamers that make the voyage to the Indian Ocean knows
that the perils and inconveniences which it was imagined must be en-
dured on board these well-equipped and comfortably fitted vessels have
very little basis of fact. Three or four weeks of dolce far niente passed
on board a great mail steamer, during which one enjoys the excellent
fresh sea air, are advantageous to the health. Itis true that 161s some-
times a little tiresome, that there is at times a little monotony in the
diversions offered by the flying fish and porpoises. But on the other
A TROPICAL BOTANIC GARDEN. 405

hand what excellent memories are preserved of the long days on
board! The apprehension which has the least foundation in fact, that of
the dangers which one incurs by passing a few months in a tropical
country, is yet more difficult to dissipate. The false opinions on this
subject, which are found in every country, have a singular tenacity of
life. If one only goes to a healthy and civilized locality a sojourn of
a few months in a tropical country presents no danger whatever. On
the contrary, for many constitutions, autumn and winter in Europe are
far from being as healthy as the climate of the tropics. Certainly it is
possible that the latter may be injurious, but such an effect is only felt
after a prolonged exposure.

However unfounded such fears may be they can not be overcome if
there remains any doubt but that a sojourn of some months in a botanic
garden in the extreme Orient will be of great use to a naturalist. The
remark has sometimes been made that a botanic garden of this kind,
however great and rich it may be, can not give by itself any adequate
idea of the vegetation of a virgin forest which has such an irresistible
attraction for the observer of living nature. This is true, but it should
not be forgotten that in Java, as in many other tropical countries,
primitive nature and civilization jostle each other. At Buitenzorg, the
vice-regal residence, an excursion of 1, 2, or 3 days transports the bot-
anists to a perfectly virgin forest, so near is it. Besides, a branch
establishment of the garden is situated upon the mountain called
Tjibodas, which touches the very edge of the forest from which it was
recovered. There naturalists visiting the botanical station of Buitenzorg
go to pass some time for the purpose of making observations and gather-
ing at their ease plants from their native wilds. In order that these
wilds may be safe from any injury by the natives, and that their prim-
itive character may be preserved, the government has taken care to put
an area of some 250 hectares [nearly 1 square mile] under the immediate
control of the botanic garden.

There are certain obstacles to be met when one would make a voyage
to the East Indies, such for example as preparing for an absence of
considerable duration, a leave to be obtained or a public mission to be
asked for, or objections of members of the family unaccustomed to travel-
ling. Therefore it may be asked whether such a voyage secures to the
investigator not only the certainty of establishing new facts which
may be arranged on well-known lines, but also whether there is much
chance of discovering new paths which when explored will lead science
to new results. This question should receive a stronger affirmative
answer than might be supposed by many naturalists who have never
guitted Europe. In order to appreciate how fierce is the struggle for
life in the tropics, and to comprehend how nature has exhausted herself
in furnishing to the combatants a diversity of offensive and defensive
arms elsewhere unknown, it is necessary to observe it upon the spot.
One must see for one’s self—to cite but one example—trees of lofty

stature covered to the top with a bosky vegetation of parasites and
epiphytes, to be able to conceive how, in their own special way these
wrestlers have muititudes of special adaptations of which we as yet
but dimly perceive the origin and the functions. Only after having
experienced the surprise caused by the sight of the luxuriant végetation
of the tropics, can the physiologist at last obtain a true idea of the
wonders reserved for him in the study of vital phenomena manifesting
themselves with such remarkable force. Finally, it should be borne in
mind that the present climatological conditions of equatorial countries
are very much like those which formerly extended over the entire sur-
face of our globe. It is therefore indispensable that we should study
tropical plants if we wish to solve the series of riddles relating to the
origin and affiliation of the plant groups of our period. To the botan-
ists who study this marvellous flora in its native situation is reserved
the honor of filling out the great gaps in our present knowledge and
of making discoveries whose importance and signification we can now
but partially guess.

What we have just said is neither premature nor out of place. First,
the results already obtained sustain it. Besides, naturalists have
recently given a proof of the interest they have in extending their
researches to equatorial countries. During the 4 years that the
laboratory for research has been established at Buitenzorg it has been
visited by fourteen naturalists, and all but one came from beyond the
sea and from different countries. It is to be regretted that we have
to add that no French botanist has, up to the present time, come to
occupy a work table in the laboratory of the Hortus Bogoriensis.
Without doubt the number of visitors will go on increasing, and at
length they will come from all nations. He who has the honor of now
directing the scientific establishment described in this article is the
first to desire it. Indeed, it is with the intention of encouraging and
stimulating this movement that it has been written.
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.*
By HENRY DE VARIGNY.

Everything that lives generates heat. Wherever there is life there
is Simultaneously a production and liberation of heat. On the other
hand, there exist for all organic life, animal or vegetable, limits of tem-
perature, above or below which life can not be sustained and between
which points only can full development be attained. Temperature is
therefore an imporiant element in all life, and it is interesting to con-
sider in detail the facts upon which this conclusion rests. We must
weigh successively two questions: namely, the generation of heat by
organic life, and the influence exerted upon that life by the theometric
variations to which it may be subjected—variations which necessarily
react upon internal temperature, with different degrees of intensity,
however, as we shall see.

iS

Every animal is a source of heat. This is distinctly appreciable in
man, birds, and superior organisms in general, and the characteristic
temperature of the various members of the animal kingdom presents
interesting, although inconsiderable, differences. Birds generate more
heat than any other organism, in so far as their temperature is shown
to reach a higher point. According to various observers, it varies
from 39° to 44° C., while that of man and mammals ranges between
37° and 39° C. (98° and 102° F.)

Man,mammals, and birds are called creatures of equable temperature,
homeothermic—that is warm-blooded—animals. By this is meant that
their individual temperature is high, that it varies but slightly, and
that it does not follow the changes in the surrounding atmosphere.
Another class of organisms, representatives of which are never found
among birds or mammals, are called heterothermic—cold-blooded—
animals; creatures of variable temperature, since, in their normal
physiological state, their individual temperature follows closely the
changes in the atmosphere about then. The temperature of reptiles,
batrachians, fishes, mollusks, crustacea, insects, ete., is almost identical

408 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

to that of the water or air surrounding them. All animals except
mammals and birds are cold-blooded animals. It is to be noted how-
ever that certain mammals, usually rodents, are in turn warm-
blooded and cold-blooded. These are hibernating animals, which after
the fall of the external temperature below a certain point, become tor-
pid and fall asleep, their own temperature being hardly higher than
that of the air about them. Of these we shall speak again later.

Without the aid of certain instruments heterothermic animals would
appear to generate no heat whatever; for to our senses, their tempera-
ture is the same as that of their surroundings. In the case of reptiles,
however, the temperature exceeds that in which they are placed, (the
difference being estimated when the external temperature was at a
point between 5° and 15° C.) as much as 6, 7, and 8 degrees, though it
more frequently varies from 1 to 4 degrees. In the case of batrachians
it is less, scarcely exceeding 2 or 5 degrees under the same conditions.
The difference is still less appreciable in fishes, and it reaches its low-
est point in invertebrates, in which the temperature only occasionally
shows an excess of one-fourth or one-half of a degree centigrade over
the temperature of their surroundings. Insects, particularly those
whieh live in communities, generate at times considerable heat. Thus
Réaumur observed the temperature in a bee-hive raised to 12°.5 C,
when the external air was at —3°.7 C. Inshort, heterothermic animals
generate little heat, but its production is constant.

What is the cause of this calorification? This is the ouestion into
which we are now to inquire. The strangest ideas have been enter-
tained in regard to it. One investigator makes a mysterious principle
of animal heat, the seat of which is the heart, where it develops so high
a degree of temperature that touching this organ by chance results in
a painful burn. . The author of this theory has evidently never prac-
tised vivisection, for, as a matter of fact, the heart is one of the coldest
of the organs, in mammals its temperature rarely exceeding 39° or 40°
C. According to J. Hunter, the celebrated surgeon and anatomist, this
mysterious principle of animal heat resides in the stomach. Barthez
and his followers attribute it to an entirely different cause; more rea-
sonable (in that it excludes the supernatural and mysterious), but no
less erroneous. Their belief is that it is due to the commingling of the
several liquid and solid portions of the organism. It was Lavoisier
who laid the foundations of the true theory of calorification. Having
made an exact calculation of the nature and properties constituting the
atmosphere in its normal condition, he demonstrated in an irrefutable
manner that air, expelled by a living creature, contains carbonie acid
in larger quantities than the air whieh he inhales. A combination has
therefore taken place between the oxygen in the air and the carbon
contained in the organism. ‘Pure air, in passing through the lungs,
effects a combination analogous to that which takes place in the com-
bustion of charcoal. Now, in the combustion of charcoal there is a
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 409

liberation of matter from the fire, consequently there must be likewise a
liberation of matter from the combustion in the lungs.” That is to say,
since the lungs evolve carbonic acid, a generation of heat must follow, for
the reason that heat is under all circumstances an accompaniment of
combustion. <A living organism produces heat because it burns. The
study of a century goes to show the accuracy of this conclusion.

According to Lavoisier the lungs appear to be the seat of respiratory
combustion and calorification. On this point however he is guarded
in what he says, and this reserve is justifiable, as, in point of fact, their
role is quite a different one from that which he supposes. Lagrange,
a short time after Lavoisier, combatted this supposition, stating that
if the lungs were actually the seat of these combustions, the heat gen-
erated would be of such intensity that this organ would suffer injury
sufficiently serious to be incompatible with life. This, however, is an
exaggeration. The production of heat has been estimated, and, even
supposing the lungs to be the exclusive seat of this function, the tem-
perature of this organ would not be intense enough to be injurious.
The most exact researches have shown what is the work assigned to
the lungs in the process of calorification. This organ which, owing to
its innumerable cells, representing a surface of 150 or 200 square
metres (this, although astonishing, is indisputable), only serves to bring
in contact the blood and the air. The net-work of capillaries, separated
from the air by a fine layer of cells, represents a surface equal to about
three-fourths of that of the entire lungs, and forms a sanguineous coat-
ing of 100 or 150 square metres. This has little depth, it is true, only
containing 2 litres of blood. This however signifies little, for in order
to secure absorption, it is extent of surface rather than depth which is
required; the latter being of slight consequence. Moreover if there
are at a given moment 2 litres of blood in the lungs it is estimated by
a simple calculation that the total quantity of blood passing through
the lungs in the course of 24 hours is about 20,000 litres. In fact, the
anatomy of the lungs is admirably arranged to give them this absorb-
ing capacity, and experience shows that their role is exactly that for
which their organization is best adapted. The blood which permeates
the lungs absorbs the oxygen in the inhaled air, by reason of a chemical
affinity between the hamoglobine of these red globules and that gas,
and carries it throughout the body. It is in the recesses of the tissues
over all parts of the organism that this oxygen, separating itself from
the hemoglobine, unites with the carbon of the tissues, and ignites in
order to give birth to heat and carbonic acid; necessary results of all
combustion. Theacid which is taken up by the blood is finally expelled
through the lungs.

Calorification is thus the result of combustions which take place at
all points of the animal economy. It is in complete dependence upon
the relations of two other functions—respiration (that is to say, the sup-
ply of oxygen for burning) and alimentation (the supply of carbon or of
410 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

combustibles). ‘We shall have occasion to refer to this point later on.
Calorification is produced not only in the lungs, as Lavoisier believed
up to acertain point, but in all the tissues of the organism, the proof
of it being that the tissues respire in a condition of life. Hxception is
made, however, of cutaneous growths, such as hair and nails, these be-
ing lifeless portions of the organism. If the tissues respire it is because
there is a combination of oxygen and carbon, hence combustion, hence
heat. The demonstration of the respiration of the tissues is easily fur-
nished by experiment. Let an animal be killed and fragments of mus-
cle, liver, brain, bone, etc., detached. Let these be placed in a test
tube containing oxygen, and inverted on mercury. At the end of a
space of time, which varies in length, and in proportion differing ac-
cording to the tissues, there will be found in the test tube carbonic
-acid which has replaced a part of the oxygen, and which establishes in
an indisputable manner the respiration which has taken place.

In short, animal heat results from combustion of the carbon in the
‘tissues with the oxygen of the air, this element being introduced into
the blood by the action of the lungs, and carried by this liquid through-
out every portion of the body. Combustion takes place in all the tis-
sues (and in the blood itself, although but slightly) in varying degrees,
being greater in extent in the muscles, brain, and glands, and less so
in the bones and other anatomical portions of the structure.

Is calorification, then, the result of combustion and oxydation only?
It was for a long time so believed, but in reality other influences enter
into this function. The organism is, in fact, the theater of chemical
phenomena, infinite in variety. The materials derived from the food
are assimilated by various chemical processes, and the action of elimi-
nation is accomplished by phenomena of no less variety. All the con-
binations, decompositions, reductions, etc., which the different materials
undergo, give rise invariably to the generation or absorption of heat.
In plain language, all chemical action produces heat or cold, according
to circumstances, and this production is in conformity with chemical
laws which are now fully understood.

Among numerous chemical phenomena of this sort in the organism—
phenomena which have been thoroughly studied by M. Berthelot—special
reference may be made to hydrations, decompositions, combinations,
and fermentations. All these phenomena take place in the bodies of
living creatures, and all play their part in the process of calorification.
Calorification is then the result of multiplied chemical actions which oc-
cur at all points of the organism, actions of which some generate, while
others absorb heat, but among which those of the former evidently pre-
dominate. Among the heat-giving phenomena oxydations are the most
important, but it is well to remember that this is not their only attri-
bute, as Lavoisier believed.

The simple fact that respiration is not carried on with the same
activity in all the tissues indicates a priori that there must be an appre-
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. Ali

ciable difference in their temperature. This is in spite of the fact that
in living organisms the equal distribution of temperature is favored by
the contact of heated portions with those which are less so, either directly
or indirectly, by the circulation of the blood. In spite of this tendeney
to establish an equality of temperature, it is easy to distinguish those
of the highest temperature. They are naturally those of most activity,
from a chemical standpoint, and whose respirations are most frequent.
The liver, brain, glands, heart, and muscles belong to this class. The
heat generated by these organs is in proportion to the chemical activity
and to the amount of work which they themselves perform. Every
organ is, in fact, warmer when in a state of activity than when in a state
of repose.

Calorification is thus the result of chemical phenomena which take
place in the recesses of the tissues. These phenomena, which are nu-
merous and active in animals ot the higher class (homeotherms), are
much less so in cold-blooded animals; but this point is not important,
the difference being in degree, not in kind.

Here a question arises: Why does man have an equable temperature
at the poles, where the temperature is 30 degrees below zero, and in
Sahara, where there are 40 degrees of heat? Why are not man and
warm-blooded animals influenced to a greater degree by the temperature
in which they live, and how are they enabled to contend with these ex-
tremes of temperature? In several ways, from a physiological stand-
point, for at this time we are not to consider the means devised by man
for his protection. To enable him to endure extreme heat, he is supplied
with a sudatory apparatus which acts as soon as the internal tempera-
ture begins to rise. The action of external heat brings the sudatory
glands into activity, and evaporation of the perspiration produces re-
frigeration to a marked degree. Note, by the way, that this evapora-
tion is only possible in an atmosphere relatively dry, and is less in pro-
portion to the humidity of the atmosphere surrounding the body. On
this account one suffers more from heat when the air is full of moisture
than when itis dry. Humidity impedes and retards evaporation, and
in consequence also refrigeration.

Certain animals are endowed with this sudatory apparatus for the

_Same purpose as man, but many of them are entirely without it. Among
the latter class are birds, dogs, rabbits, ete. In what way are these
protected against heat? As far as we know, no researches have been
made on this pointin regard to birds; but concerning dogs, M. Ch.
Richet has reached very interesting conclusions. In this animal refrig-
eration is effected by means of the respiratory organs, for it is by this
means only that they can bring about a copious evaporation. The dog
perspires through his lungs, as is the case with all creatures which
have this organ, even man himself, but with the dog this is the only
means of effecting perspiration, and it is therefore employed to a far
greater extent. When a dog is heated he thrusts out his tongue in
412 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE,

order to facilitate the passage of air through the mouth. He breathes
guickly, sometimes with great rapidity, in order to induce a more
abundant exhalation of moisture. It is much to be desired that astudy
of refrigerating mechanisms be pursued in behalf of those beings
which have no perspiring capabilities, as such a study would be fruitful
in interesting results.

When the internal temperature of man is at alow point, sufficient
refrigeration is effected simply by the flow of blood, which is always
towards the surface. Influenced by external heat the cutaneous tubes
expand, by this means they are able to contain a larger quantity of
blood, and radiation from the skin is thus increased, resulting in a
cooling tendency, which spreads through the entire system by reason
of the circulation of the blood, which is also accelerated, and thus
facilitates refrigeration.

From a physiological point of view the organism is less fully equipped
for protection against extreme cold. Cold however is less dangerous
to organic life than heat, and for this reason nature has prepared it
more perfectly to meet the latter. A sensation of cold stimulates
animal life to activity, and by this very result produces warmth. More-
over animals of cold climates have in the winter a heavier growth of
fur, which serves as a protection. In addition to this resource, we shall
point out the fact that cold contracts the tubes of the skin which dimin-
ishes refrigeration; respiration is accelerated and with it organic com-
bustion. The need of food is greater and it is eaten in larger quanti-
ties, all of which introduces into the system a greater quantity of
combustible material. Observe for a moment the immense importance
of the nervous system in its effect upon bodily temperature. This fact
has been clearly demonstrated by many experiments in physiology, as
well as by clinical observations.

To epitomize, the heat of animals is generated by chemical phenomena
which takes place within the organism. With some species these phe-
nomena are very active and the temperature proportionately high. In
addition they are furnished with a regulating apparatus so arranged
that within certain broad limits oscillations in the external temperature
modify only to a slight degree, or insensibly, their internal tempera-
ture. These are the homeothermic species. With the others (the
heterotherms) in which chemical phenomena are feeble and inactive,
there is a temperature correspondingly low. These, moreover, have no
protection against the influence of the outside temperature, following
closely its variations. Their own temperature is, in fact, the result of
their environment, more than of the chemical phenomena within. This
difference between warm and cold blooded animals is considerable, for
in the case of the former, under average normal conditions, the exter-
nal temperature has no, or little, action upon the temperature of the
animal.

Calorification is a general phenomena among animals from protozoan
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 413

to man. There are differences in degree, but the fact is universal. It
remains for us to prove that this is not only the rule with animals, but
is also true wherever there is vegetable life, constituting in fact an
inherent function in all animate matter.

Plants respire, consequently they generate heat. This is an ascer-
tained fact of which proof has been given by numerous experiments.
The cholorophyllic function, which effects a decomposition of carbonic
acid in the oxygen which is exhaled, and in carbon which is incorporated
in the tissues, has, for a considerable time, obscured the true manner
of respiration, making it appear that vegetables respire in an entirely
different way from animals. The process is the same in the two classes
of organisms, To assure ourselves of the fact, however, it is necessary
to eliminate the chlorophyllic function by having recourse to @ particu-
lar arrangement; experimenting upon plants without chlorophyll, or
upon chlorophyllic plants kept in darkness—the chlorophyllic funetion
acting only in light. In taking the above precautions, we establish
the fact that respiration exists among all plants—with more activity,
it is true, in young plants than in older ones, in plants which are in
course of development, rather than those which have already attained
their full growth. This respiration, as ip animals, consists of chemical
phenomena. It is caused by an absorption of oxygen, and a combina-
tion of that gas with the tissues of the plant, by which heat is produced.
As observation has demonstrated to us, everything that has life gener-
ates heat by reason of the chemical phenomena which accompany life.
The germination of seeds, for example, does not occur without this
evolution of heat. To assure ourselves of this, let a thermometer be
placed in the midst of a quantity of seed in process of germination,
taking care to insure the elimination of carbonie acid in proportion as
it is produced—for it arrests respiration and calorification. The ther-
mometer will be seen to rise 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20° ©. The generation of
heat in this case is therefore considerable. Various experiments made
with seeds have substantiated the conclusion. Flowers also produce a
remarkable amount of heat, the truth of which Lamarck was the first to
establish. It is with flowers of certain aroides that experiments have
been most successful, and which have furnished the most exact data.
The temperature of the spathe of these plants when in full flower indi-
cates a generation of considerable heat, presenting sometimes an excess
of 5°, 10°, and 15° over the surrounding temperature. To show that
this calorification is a result of respiration, let a flower be covered with
oil in order to exclude the oxygen in the air, or let it be placed in an
inert gas from which all oxygen has been exhausted (nitrogen for in-
stance), and its temperature will be reduced to almost nothing; combus-
tion is retarded if not entirely suppressed. Very delicate experiments
have established beyond a doubt that a close correlation exists between
the supply of oxygen and the amount of heat produced, the latter being
proportionate in intensity to the quantity of oxygen absorbed.
414 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

One has a right therefore to assume that all flowers evolve a certain
amount of heat, variable, it is true, for one flower differs from another,
but always clearly appreciable. A similar evolution is observed in the
active organs of plants when they are excited to movement. it has
been established in the case of germs by the means of thermo-electric
needles. It is much more sensible than in the case of adult plants, in
which life is less active and intense.

We see in the vegetable, as in the animal kingdom, that heat is gen-
erated, and that it is due, for the most part, to oxidations within them-
selves. It is possible to establish the existence of a complete likeness
between these two classes of organisms. The demonstration which
substantiates itself every day of the identity and unity of the funda-
mental laws of life, in spite of variation in furm and appearance, is not
one of the least benefits which have resulted from the investigations of
modern science.

At the point where calorification results from chemical phenomena
accompanying nutrition and respiration a close dependence springs up
between it and the process of alimentation. This dependence clearly
exists. The phenomena of alimentation are in consequence of the in-
troduction of food into the organism in such a manner that it can be
assimilated, portions of it immediately, and that which remains after
it has undergone chemical modifications. To the former category va-
rious salts and water belong; to the la(ter, organic compounds, flesh,
fruits, vegetables, milk, etc. Where there is a total lack or insuffi-
ciency of alimentation the animal perishes, especially when there is no
reserve supply of nutriment in the form of fat. At the same time its
temperature falls. This fact has been established by Chossat, who has
made an exhaustive study of inanition. Animals deprived of nutri-
ment generate less heat. Their temperature diminishes each day, and
finally, at the moment of death, sinks to 10°, 15°, or 20° below the nor-
mal medium. The temperature of pigeons, for example, falls from 40°
or 42° to 20° or 18°. The same phenomenon exists in the case of man
or mammals. It is the same with them as with a boiler when the fur-
nace is not fed; the fire is extinguished and heat disappears. In the
vegetable kingdom there is in all probability a similar occurrence, al-
though no visible proof is given of it as far as we know, Experiment
in this case is very difficult, but an indirect proof is furnished by the
fact, well known to agriculturists and botanists, that the suppression
or diminution of such and such mineral salts necessary to vegetable
life will result in the deterioration and relative unfruitfulness of the
plant. That which diminishes their vitality and their proportions di-
minishes also their nutrition, and as a natural consequence their pro-
duction of heat.

There is therefore between the processes of alimentation and calori-
fication a fixed relation, and one can readily determine among the many
different kinds of foods those which contribute most towards caiorifi-
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 415,

cation. Chemistry shows us by exact analyses that different bodies, in

oxidation, evolve varying degrees of heat. Let us imagine a given:
quantity of oxygen introduced into the blood to assist the oxidations |
which are the principal though not exclusive source of animal heat.

The amount of heat which will be produced by the combustion of this .
volume of oxygen with the material existing in the tissues will vary ae-

cording to the nature of the material. Combining with certain sub-

stances the same quantity of oxygen will generate ten times more heat .
than will result from certain other combinations. That which is true:
of oxidations is also true of other chemical phenomena incident to ca-

lorification—that is to say, hydrations, de-hydrations, decompositions, ,
combinations, ete. The production of heat varies considerably accord-

ing to the chemical nature of the substances which are influenced by

these modifications. It is enough to say that certain foods are more

productive of heat than others. Observation has long since shown the

effects, in a cold climate, of a diet rich in fats and in sugar, and expe-

rience establishes the fact that these substances develop a greater de-

gree of heat than albuminoids. On the other hand, we all know that

inhabitants of warm climates need less food and are more abstemious

than those of a cold region. The need for being heated is less pro-

nounced in their case on account of the temperature in which they live,

and in which the external cooling is little or nothing in extent.

The relations which exist between the processes of calorification and
respiration are no less evident. Anything that obstructs respiration
obstructs also the generation of heat. This is more pronounced in the
case of creatures with whom oxidation plays a very important part in
the generation of heat. The deprivation or diminution of pure air very
quickly results in serious disturbance, due to the irregularity ocea-
sioned in the vital functions by an insufficient exchange between the
blood and the atmosphere. Supposing that life were possible during
a temporary but somewhat prolonged cessation of respiration, the
temperature of the body would quickly diminish. The higher class
of beings may not furnish proof of this fact, being so exceedingly sensi-
tive to the deprivation of pure air, but by the lower organisms it is
clearly proven. We have seen it in depriving of its share of oxygen
-a flower of arum or of colocasia by dipping it either in oil or in azote,
‘when the phenomenon of thermogenesis is considerably diminished.

In fine, the:relations of calorification to the activity of the organism
are quite.as. clear as those of which we have just spoken. These are
manifest among vegetables as among animals. With the first the
generation of heat is greatest.during movement, or in reference to the
more active portions, from the point of view of witality and growth,
and during the organization of the tissues; in germs, ‘in which the
chemical changes are rapid, numerous, intense, and in flowers during
the operation of fecundation.

With animals all activity is accompanied by an elevation of the ‘tetir-
416 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

perature, local or general, according to the intensity and duration of
the activity. It is thus that a muscle in the act of contracting evolves
more heat than when in a state of repose, and this production is such
that it easily increases the temperature of the body 2°, 3°, 5°. In
the same manner, a mental or intellectual effort results in a produc-
tion of considerable heat. The glands in an active state generate
large quantities of heat, as is seen by the temperature of their secre-
tions and of the venous blood, which has served in the formation of the
latter. This is why the venous blood of the kidneys is warmer than
the arterial blood, and according to Claude Bernard the temperature
of the hepatie vein, which brings back the blood from the liver to the
heart, is the highest in temperature, especially during the process of
digestion, at which time the liver is very active, and the chemical proc-
esses which take place are also numerous and intense. This is suffi-
cient to show the dependence of the generation of heat upon the chem-
ical activities of the body.

By reason of natural and normal cessations of the phenomena which
are instrumental in generating and liberating heat, it is impossible for
the temperature of a being to be absolutely equable. Even with the
most warm-blooded animals there are many normal variations. In a
sound man, in normal condition, these variations take place within the
space of about 24 hours. The temperature is highest from 10 o’clock,
or midday, to 6 or 7 o’clock in the evening, reaching its lowest point
between midnight and 6 o’clock in the morning. Violent exercise, of
course, increases it several degrees, and the process of digestion is
accompanied by a slight fever. Ina word, a multitude of circumstances
occur each hour which render variable, within certain limits, it is true,
the generation of heat. In addition, and this is quite natural, accord-
ing to the explanations given above, the temperature is not the same
in all portions of the organism. Certain portions are more thermogenic
than others, and others are more exposed to a loss of heat. The calo-
rifie topography of the organism is accurately known. We know that
the hepatic vein is one of the warmest points of the body, its position
being a protected one, and containing, as it does, blood heated by the
intense chemical action which takes place in the liver. The brain has
probably the same temperature as this vein. On the other hand, the
skin always shows a much lower temperature (3°, 5°, or 6°) than that
of the rest of the organism, suffering as it does considerable loss from
radiation.

Leaving the question of external heat, we find that internal tempera-
ture is the direct result of two factors, thermic generation and waste.
Heat generated is the result of chemical processes, infinite in variety,
of which the body is the theatre, processes among which that of oxi-
dation holds a predominant place. As soon as oxidation is retarded,
there follows a difficulty in breathing, accompanied by a lowering of
the temperature. The cause of this is the diminution itself and the
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 417

reaction it probably exercises upon the other thermogenic chemical
actions. As to waste, this is incurred in accordance with well-known
physical laws, and with warm-blooded animals it is sometimes facilitated
and sometimes diminished by the action of the regulating mechanism
placed under the dependence of the nervous system, a mechanism
which in its normal condition tends to preserve for the organism a tein-
perature nearly constant, diminishing the losses when the production
of heat is feeble or insufficient in respect to the temperature of the sur-
rounding medium, and augmenting these losses, on the contrary, when
the atmosphere is too high, or when the production is so great that it
tends to inflame the bodily organism.

The only difference, from the physiological standpoint, in the calori-
fication which exists among warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals
is, that with the latter the production of heat is slight and the regu-
lating apparatus absent. These species engender little heat, and are
unable to regulate their losses. They also follow the variations in the
outside temperature almost to as great an extent as inanimate objects;
whereas warm-blooded animals conform ina less degree to the outer
atmosphere, and also with less impunity.

LT

We are now to consider between what limits of temperature organic
life can be maintained. Animals of the highest temperature, protected
though they are against the extremes of heat and cold, can be placed
under conditions which render these protective means inadequate, and
this in a state of nature and apart from all experimentation.

A word first on the thermic variations which occur in the inhabited
zone of our planet; a zone limited in extent, comprising an average of
8 to 10 kilometres in altitude, its elevations and depressions being
about equal in distance from the level of the sea; a zone exceedingly
small when compared with the diameter of the earth. Beyond the
limits of this region life has never existed, or at least exists no longer.
We are more especially interested in that portion of the earth which
can support organic life. The extreme points of temperature observed
in the atmosphere are — 70° and + 56°C. The former observation was
made at Iakoutsk, the latter at Mourzouk. These are said to represent
very exactly the extreme limits, forming a difference of 125° or 130°C,
At these far distant points human life is possible, and also that of cer-
tain animals. In the ocean the thermometrie digressions are not as
great. According to Wyville Thompson, the temperature of the At-
lantic Ocean reaches 0° at a depth of only 4,200 metres; at 6,000 metres
it registers 5°; at 800 metres, 4°, and at 2,000 meties it is 3°, About
the same can be said of the Pacific Ocean. Should the temperature
upon the surface or at the bottom of the sea descend lower than —1°
or —2° the water freezes. It is not necessary for us to consider this

H. Mis, 129-———27
418 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

point however, since it is complicated by the introduction of a new
factor—the suffocation of the inhabitants of the water as a result of
this congelation. The Mediterranean Sea is less cold, the temperature
at the bottom being about 12° or 138°. The Red Sea rises to 21°, and
at the surface to 32°. The variations are less in the center, not exceed-
ing 34°C. It is therefore on the earth and in the air that the extremes
of temperature are found. The immense influence of the rays of the
sun upon temperature should be taken into account. A thermometer
which registers 27° in the shade will rise to 31° when placed in the
sun, and when resting upon a bit of black cloth it will reach 80°. A
thermometer placed on the helmet of a cuirassier and exposed to the
sun will rise to 60° or 70°, and in a compartment of a furnace it rises to
75°C. On the other hand we must not forget that life exists in regions
where the temperature reaches 90° and 98° © (Hooker, Flourens, ete.).
This conclusion, therefore, is reached, that there are some creatures
which can live at +100° and others at —60° or —70°. These figures
represent the extremes of temperature to which living beings are ex-
posed under actual terrestrial conditions, but they do not represent
those which certain of these classes can resist, for certain spores of
bacteria resist more than +100° and —100° ©, according to recent ex-
periments. Let us admit at the start, to simplify matters, that life can
be sustained at —150° and at +150°. Are all these creatures able to
sustain life with impunity, even for a short time, in such extremes of
temperature ? Possibly so, but only for a limited space of time, and .
surrounded by a nonconductor. This proves nothing; the only inter-
esting phases of this question are the facts or experiments which relate
to the results obtained by organisms remaining in such extremes for a
prolonged length of time—interesting where they succumb, being suf-
focated or frozen, as well as when they are able to survive by pre-
serving their normal temperature, We will not dwell upon those cases,
which are both numerous and interesting, where man and animal have
endured for a few moments or seconds extremes of temperature, only
considering the cases where their continuation is sufficiently prolonged
for the temperature to affect them.

There is for every species of animal and vegetable, indeed even for
each variety, a thermic optimum, that is to say, an average of tempera-
ture which is most favorable to its growth and development. It should
not be forgotten, however, that with all species of organic life a certain
adaptation is possible, the limits of which are more or less restricted.
In many instances it is possible to sustain life among animals in a
medium which would have been fatal to them if they had been suddenly .
introduced into it, by carefully managing the conditions and transi-
tions. This fact is especially recognized in chemical elements, of which
many instances have been given. It is true as well of thermic condi-
tions. At the same time, even when adaptations are made, new envi-
ronment acts on the organism, influencing and modifying its structure
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 419

or functions, and it may be said that for all life there is a degree of
temperature which is more favorable than any other to its perfect
development. The limits of temperature thus favorable to a given
class are surprisingly narrow. This is especially true in the case of
microbes.. The bacillus of butyric fermentation is most active at 40°,
At 42° it multiplies more rapidly, but diminishes in activity. At 45°
it no longer effects fermentation. For alcoholic fermentation the most
favorable point is between 25° and 30°, although it ceases at zero—the
freezing point, and at 100°--the boiling point. The microbe of ecar-
buncular diseases thrives at 37° to 39°, At 41° it dies. Convincing
evidence of this is given by Pasteur, who has shown that a fowl in
normal condition, its temperature being from 41° to 42°, can not become
inoculated with a disease of this kind. If you cool the fowl artificially
by means of cold water, so that its temperature diminishes 2° or 3°,
the microbe multiplies abundantly in the blood of the fowl and
kills it, at least if the cooling process is continued. If that ceases, a
return to the normal condition of the animal will dissipate the disease,
A temperature of 35° is most favorable to lactic fermentation. The
fermentation of putrid matter is less restricted, It is carried on any-
where from 0° to 40°, although the most favorable points are between
15° and 35°. Examples of this kind may be given in great numbers,
What is more interesting, however, than this enumeration, is the study
of the results which are induced by subjecting a given microbe to a
degree of temperature higher than that which is best adapted to it, not
sufficiently high, however, to be fatal to its existence. Very evident
modifications are by this means produced in its physical condition. It
becomes weakened, and there is a marked diminution in its vitality.
This fact is the basis of the interesting processes of preventive vaccina-
tions, of which Pasteur has given us so many striking and useful exam-
ples. Only a slight increase of temperature is needed to transform a
dangerous microbe into an invaluable auxiliary in the art of healing or
preventing infectious diseases. On the contrary spores of bacteria can
be subjected to considerable variations of temperature without being
productive of any modifications. These spores withstand admirably
extremes of temperature, for instance —100° and +100°, the bacteria
which spring from these losing none of their virulence. Some species
of bacteria may be frozen for many months and live. This is true of
the bacteria of typhoid fever, according to Fraenkel and Prudden.
Contrary to the general impression, congealing does not purify impure
yater.

It is interesting to note that the sensibility of common leavens, as
referred to their thermic variations, is repeated in soluble leavens—
that is to say, with the products of the activity of certain cellules, which
exhibit some of the qualities of the ordinary leavens. Thus pepsin is
active anywhere between 37° and 40°. At 50° it acts in a less degree, -
becoming almost inactive at 90°. The pancreatic juice exercises its

chemical action most thoroughly at 40°. At 20° it acts slightly, and at
60° its action ceases entirely. In considering the tissues of complex
organisms, we ascertain analogous phenomena. Protoplasms of dif-
ferent organisms, although they are often supposed to be identical,
present very unequal opposition to thermic variations. In one case it
dies at 30° or 20°, in others it lives at 0°, at —5°, at —10° (Norden-
skiold). We know that eggs of birds require for their development a
temperature, narrow in limits, which can not be overstepped without
destroying the embryo, or producing malformations. Hggs of inverte-
brates are somewhat similar, but their exigencies are less restricted,
and they accommodate themselves to greater differences of temperature.

Every being, to live and move, requires environment of a certain
temperature. Some are less exacting, and adapt themselves to varia-
tions; others, on the contrary, can not endure even slight changes.
Some seek the cold, others—heat; but all in a marked manner, as we
know from the difficulties experienced in acclimating species to a new
climate. A few examples will not be out of place. The polar region,
with its prolonged and rigorous cold, and our high summits, always
clothed with a mantle of ice, produce a fauna and flora which is peculiar
to them. In these regions, where man is able to exist only at the cost
of a considerable effort, there are mammals, insects, plants of all kinds,
which can reach here only their full growth and perfect development.
In a temperate or warm climate they lose their vitality and perish,
never in reality becoming acclimated. Warm-blooded animals which
live in these regions have the same temperature as their co-species in
warm climates. They maintain themselves by appropriate food and
a heavy growth of fur, discarded by them when the weather moderates,
Captain Black has observed in Siberia when the external temperature
was at —35°, that the temperature of a fox was 41°, making a difference
of 76°. The reverse of these polar regions and glaciers are the hot
springs. Here also we find a characteristic fauna and flora. Many
observers have drawn up a list of sea weeds, infusorials, and fungi,
living in the waters, the temperature of which varies from 50°, 60°, and
even 90° ©, and that thrive and multiply.

Between the coldest regions, which some species delight in, and the
hot springs, or the tropical regions, where others attain their highest
development, we find grades of organisms whose resistance to extremes
of temperature is less and which prefer more temperate surroundings,
manifesting a partiality for such and such a point in the thermic scale.
To be assured of these preferences one has only to consult the docu-
ments showing the distribution of species and their acclimation. The
most curious fact disclosed by the preceeding data is the great resist-
auce of the protoplasm of certain creatures to temperatures, which,
judging from other cases, one would suppose must be fatal. The pro-
toplasm in certain cases can sustain a temperature of zero, or lower
still, and others can live at 90° and even higher temperatures. ‘This is
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 421

a remarkable fact which neither physiologists nor chemists are able to
explain.

In short, there exists among organisms a certain number of species,
vegetable or animal, able to withstand extremes of temperature, and
to live normally therein, while the majority can live only in more uni-
form and moderate temperatures. We will now see by what means the
different organisms withstand or succumb to temperatures, other than
those to which they naturally accomodate themselves, and to what
influences they are subjected.

Let us consider first heterothermic organisms, or cold-blooded animals,
which follow the oscillations of the surrounding atmosphere, and the
temperature of which rises and falls proportionately on account of the
absence of the regulating apparatus by which they could control their
own production and loss of heat. These organisms possess a sensibility
which is regardless of variations in their temperature. They can un-
dergo with impunity oscillations in the atmosphere about them which
would endanger the life of warm-blooded animals, possibly destroying
it entirely. The latter, man included, can not live a moment if their in-
ternal temperature exceeds about 45° (113° F.) The cold-blooded animals
can vary their temperature within very considerable limits. The enu-
meration of the latter would not be particularly interesting; it is suffi-
cient to say that the temperature of cold-blooded animals of our coun-
tries varies according to circumstances from 0° to 35° and 40°. That
which arrests our attention is the summing up of the influence of differ-
ent temperatures on the functions of these animals. As a matter of
course, temperatures exist which are not deadly, which are consistent
with the life of these creatures. We shall see later in what way the ex-
tremes of temperature act.

Itis a well-substantiated fact, by means of experiments which, though
not numerous, are very exact, that there is for every living creature a
degree of heat which is absolutely indispensable in order that its devel-
opment be as complete as possible. On this point we have had for
several years, thanks to the valuable labors of Boussingault, most inter-
esting data. Being given a certain vegetable we can estimate that the
time which elapses between the appearance of its vegetation and its
complete maturity is short in proportion to the height of the tempera-
ture at which it vegetates, and long in proportion to its degree of low-
ness, exception being made, let it be understood, of thermic conditions
which are dangerous or fatal. Otherwise stated: Being given a plant
which lives between 15° and 30°, of which the thermic optimum is 25°,
its development will be slower in a constant temperature of 15° than in
one of 20° to 25°, and the retardation is proportionate to the thermic
difference. It seems that in whatever latitude or climate it thrives,
there exists there for the plant just the quantity of heat necessary for
its development. It is easy to prove that this hypothesis is exact and
conforms to the facts of the case. The following is an example: From
422 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

the day when a seed germinates to the moment when the plant reaches
its maturity an average is taken of the temperature for each cycle of 24
hours. Afterwards an average is made of these averages for all! the
period which has passed between the two moments mentioned above and
this average is to be multiplied by the number of days which have passed.
Suppose this action of the plant has taken 90 days, and that the aver-
age of averages is 17, then you obtain the figure 1530, which represents
the degrees of heat furnished in 90 days,—a day being taken as a unit of
time. A very interesting fact is, that, if the same observations are made
with the same species of plant under different thermic conditions, or in
a different climate, the same figure is obtained, although the number
of days necessary to the development may vary from simple to treble,
according to the climate. The study of vegetable physiology is rich in
interesting facts from the standpoint which is now occupied. In this
way different seeds are very differently influenced by cold. One does
not germinate below 15°, while others germinate at 4°, and still others
at zero. One plant developes best at a temperature which is fatal to
another.

In the animal kingdom analogous facts have been observed in a very
exact manner. A little fresh-water mollusk (lymnée) furnishes Carl
Semper, the learned zodlogist of Wiirzburg, with very interesting
facts in this connection. Below 12° this animal, although leading an
active life and taking its food regularly, underwent no growth, though
it was able to reproduce, its eggs developing perfectly. From 12° to
25° (which is its most favorable temperature) its assimilation was per-
fect, and the animal grew and developed. Semper remarks that these
mollusks, subjected permanently to a temperature of 10° or 12°, remain
small and cease to develop. They produce a dwarfed breed, which in
their turn reproduce normally, remaining, however, smaller than the
other lymnées. On the other hand, an unnaturally large species can be
produced by maintaining the mollusks by artificial means at the highest
point of temperature. There is still another fact which accords with that
of which we have just spoken. A well-known naturalist, Moebius, has
discovered that the same species of marine mollusks common to the
Baltic and to the coast of Greenland differ greatly in size. At the
Baltic they are small and have a thin shell, while on the coast of Green-
land they are much larger in size and are provided with a thick shell.
This is explained by the fact that in the Baltic the variations of tem.
perature are more frequent and the cold is more intense than in Green-
Jand, in consequence of which the development of the mollusk is more
difficult and intermittent.

Temperatures lower than this most favorable point have a marked
effect upon animals and plants, which shows itself in the latter by a
retardation of development which at the same time becomes less com-
plete. On the contrary, temperatures not fatal, but relatively high in
regard to their natural condition, favor their growth, which becomes
proportionately rapid and complete. It is thus with the eggs of certain
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 423

species of crustacea, as the apus and branchipus, which develop between
0° and +502, accomplishing their complete evolution in 24 hours at a
temperature of 30°, while between 16° and 20° it takes weeks to obtain
the same result. ‘Tadpoles hateh in 10 days at a temperature of 15.5° ;
at 10.5° it requires 15 days. Notice how various are the requirements
of different creatures in the matter of temperature. That of 36°, so
favorable to branchipus, is fatal to many, excepting the entire animal
life of Arctic seas, and also, as I have already shown, a number of spe-
cies of the Mediterranean, especially those which inhabit the seashore
and can not adapt themselves to temperatures in pools heated by the
summer sun.

There is therefore for every species a certain temperature at which de-
velopment is most rapid and life most easy. The limits of this thermic
condition vary considerably according to the species and even the va-
riety. Subjected to the influence of a lower temperature than that
which is most favorable, each animal’s development is retarded, in dif:
ferent degrees, and often fails to attain perfection. If exposed to a
higher temperature than that which is best adapted to them, disturb-
ances are produced, alimentation becomes impaired, and the animal—
or vegetable—begins to pine, as is also the case with man in excessively
hot climates.

This influence of temperature on life is not only manifested in de-
gree and rapidity of development, it also appears in other phenom-
ena; coloration, for instance. In this way Weissmann has shown that
two butterflies, Vanessa levana and Vanessa prorsolevana, differing in
coloration upon certain points, have been looked upon as belonging to
two distinct species, whereas in reality they represent but one. The
difference is simply a question of temperature. One comes from an
egg laid during the winter, and one from one laid in the summer, but
it is easy to obtain at will either variety from the same egg by heating
or cooling artificially, according to the case. A more important ques-
tion is the influence which the temperature exerts upon sexual devel-
opment. Cold retards and sometimes arrests it; a certain degree of
temperature favors and accelerates it; and it is well known that sexual
development in man himself is hastened by the influence of a hot
climate. In Cuba, and other warm climates, a girl attains maturity at
12 years. But the temperature must not be too high either. Crusta-
cea kept for several weeks at 19° do not acquire sexual activity, whereas
at 9° or 10° it is acquired in 2 days.

Temperature thus exercises considerable influence upon all organ-
isms. An interesting proof of these effects on the intensity of life (if it
may thus be called) is furnished by a study of the influence exercised
by this factor on the action of poisons and medicines. Alexander von
Humboldt, and after him many investigators, have noted that this ac-
tion is more instantaneous and rapid in high temperatures (which are
neither fatal nor dangerous in themselves) than at a lower degree.
424 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

Occasionally in the latter case, a poison becomes perfectly inactive and
inoffensive, although it would prove deadly if the temperature rose a
few degrees. This fact is now well understood, and account of it is
taken in dealing with toxicology. This explains the frequent contra-
dictions between the conclusions of different investigators, because
they have not experimented under the same thermic conditicns, and
most of them have failed to note the exact temperature. Another
proof of temperature on the general functions of the organism is the
proof furnished by a comparative study of the resistance of beings to
asphyxia. When the temperature is low, asphyxia is slower and more
difficult. A frog immersed in water, its head covered, and only cuta-
neous respiration possible, will survive from 6 to8 hours with the water
at 0°, At 15° or 16° it will only live a fourth of this time. To consider
another phase of the same question: poisonous plants are more deadly
under thermic conditions favorable to their growth than when strug-
gling to live in an atmosphere colder or warmer than that adapted to
their peculiarities.

We have been considering so far the influence of thermic variations
which are not of necessity deadly. We will now turn our attention
to those which are fatal in their effects, first observing that the ef-
fects vary according to the species, and also according to certain con-
ditions, some intrinsic or inherent in the organisms, others extrinsi¢ or
relative to the conditions under which the thermic extremes occur. It
is well known, for example, how unequal is the resistance of vegeta-
bles and seeds to extremes of heat and cold. Some freeze easily, others
with difficulty. It depends much upon their bulk and the proportion
of water contained in their tissues. Somedo not die immediately after
freezing, even when the thawing is rapid, others only survive when the
thawing is slow and gradual. A very important factor is the condition
of the vitality. We know that spores of bacteria and seeds of plants
withstand degrees of temperature at which neither bacteria nor plants
could live. This fact is so well known that it is only necessary to
touch upon it.

It may seem strange that torpid organisms have more resistance than
the higher species to adverse circumstances; yetit is true that the less
active the life the less vulnerable it is, and less can exterior forces dis-
turb the functions which are already almost dormant and torpid. Cold
kills a great number of the lower organisms by reason of the disorgan-
ization of the tissues which takes place when congealed, and this dis-
organization is complete in proportion to the amount of water which
the tissues contain. There are, however, many organisms among the
cold-blooded class which die before they reach the point of freezing.
Invertebrates and plants belonging to warm climates, as well as many
microbes, succumb when the thermometer has only reached 0°. In
which case the method of death is different, it being produced by a
slackening of all the functions. Extreme heat kills plants and animals
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE, 425

of the cold-blooded class at different degrees of intensity, being much
higher, however, than those at which warm-blooded species succumb.
Jn the one case they are, in plain language, dried up, the heat depriving
the tissues and functions of the water necessary to their existence; in
the other, the vital material coagulates and life is no longer possible,
this cause being the more general one. This congealing, however, is
not always fatal, even in the case of animals of high organization. It
has long been known that in the northern part of America and Russia
travelers transport frozen fishes, rigid and brittle, which being placed
in water of a temperature of 8° and 10° regain their activity, although
they may have been frozen for 10 or 12 days. Science has refused to
believe these statements, but careful experiments have authenticated
them. In 1828 and 1829 Gaymard froze several toads thoroughly, and
they returned to their normal condition and activity on being thawed.
Care must be taken that both the freezing and thawing are gradual.
This is the principal precaution to be taken in making experiments of
this sort. The great English naturalist, Hunter, believed that the life
of man could be prolonged by being frozen from time to time. He
thought that if frozen and revived several times in the course of a few
years the limits of life could be considerably extended. Unfortunately
the experiment brought death instead of prolonging life.

Let us now consider the warm-blooded organisms, the creatures whose
temperature is more stable and does not follow the thermic variations
in the atmosphere about them. A mammal or a bird withstands a con-
siderable amount of cold. If indigenous toa cold region, protected by
thick fur or warm plumage, and in a position to secure the nourishment”
it needs, it can live in a temperature at 50° below zero, its own tem-
perature remaining fixed and normal. It is true also of man, who by
protecting himself by appropriate clothing, easily withstands quite as
low points of temperature, particularly if there is an absence of wind.
We all know by experience that a moderately cold temperature with
wind blowing is much harder to bear than intense cold without wind.
The explanation of this fact is very simple. The wind tends to con-
stantly deprive the body of the layer of warm air, which forms between
the body and the clothing, and to facilitate radiation and loss of heat
by substituting for it cold air.

But what happens under experimental or natural conditions when
an animal or man is subjected to the action of intense cold? The organ-
ism withstands it for a certain length of time, but this endurance has
its limits, variable, it is true, according to species and conditions. A
moment necessarily arises, if the cold be sufficiently severe or prolonged,
when the organism is no longer in a state to generate sufficient heat to
withstand the cold or, what is practically the same, when the loss is
too considerable though the generation were sufficient. Irom that
moment the temperature of the animal begins to decrease. This dimi-
nution is compatible with life up toa certain point, which varies accord-

ing to the species. Some animals can live, their temperature being as

low as 15° or 20°. The temperature of a rabbit, for example, can fall

from 38° or 40° to 20°, That of man may fall to 26°, 25°, and even 24°

without resulting in death, according to authentic observations made

by Reinke and Nicolayssen upon drunkards. It does not seem, how-

ever, according to Claude Bernard, Magendie, and other physiologists,

that one can with impunity lower the temperature of warm-blooded

animals below 20° C. At 20° death is almost inevitable; below that.
point it is certain. The nervous system is destroyed, involving the
entire organism. The blood becomes weakened and unequal to per-

form its work.

Surgeons of large armies have left us valuable information concern-
ing the effects of intense cold on human beings. In the case of men
who are tired and jaded, intense cold is immediately fatal—especially
where it is a sudden immersion in very cold water, for in this case the
loss of bodily heat is great. Larrey states that in crossing the Beresina,
men perished instantly upon entering the water, and Virey and Desgen-
ettes testify to similar cases. With some death was caused by cerebral
congestion, with others it was caused by anemia of the brain. When
the action of the cold is less sudden, but more prolonged, the result is
otherwise. A general benumbing of the body takes place,—of the senses,
the brain, the intelligence, a gradual torpor, an invincible sleep from
which none awake. ‘* Whoever seats himself, falls into a sleep, and
whoever sleeps awakes no more,” said Solander. Death is produced by
a Slow paralysis of the nervous system or by asphyxia.

Warm-blooded animals are enabled to resist the cold by reason of
their very active thermogenesis, which prevents them from becoming
chilled. But once let their resistance be overcome and they succumb
to much higher temperatures than those which overcome cold-blooded
organisms. Many of the latter can endure 102, 5° and even 0° without
perishing. The former die when once their internal temperature falls
below 18° or 20°. A more forcible reason why the latter can not resist
intense cold is because it destroys the portion congealed and therefore
the entire organism.

Life is also difficult at high temperatures. Man and some animals
can, it is true, remain several minutes in a Sweating-room in which
the temperature is very high—even 100°, 120°, and 130° (Tillet and
Duhamel, Delaroche and Berger, etc.)—but under these conditions the
stay is always very short; if prolonged beyond 10 or 15 minutes the
experience would prove fatal. The perspiration is so excessive that it
produces a loss of the heat which is necessary to counterbalance the
temperature to which the atmosphere tends to subject the organism.
There is another point to be noticed. Air is a bad conductor, and hot
air heats the body incomparably less than water subjected to the influ-
ence of heat. Water, on the contrary, is an excellent conductor. It is
impossible to endure for any time the contact of water at 50° and 609.

=
TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 427

Moist air is a better conductor than dry air, and it is still better if
charged with steam. Thus man ean easily remain for 10 minutes in
a sweating room of dry air at 90° or 100°, but could not endure the
same length of time in moist air at even a lower temperature.’ He
would soon be overcome in the latter case at 90° or 100°. That which
is true of high temperature is naturally true also of low. Dry air is
not so good a conductor as moist, and moist air is inferior to water as
a conductor. One can live in air at degrees of cold which would surely
be fatal if the environment were a liquid. We have already stated
how weak is the resistance of warm-blooded organisms to high degrees
of temperature. In fact, in spite of perspiration and exhalations of
vapor by the lungs, it is often impossible for the equilibrium to be
maintained, and the organism becomes overheated. Its temperature
can be increased very little without being tatal. It endures a decrease
of 15° or 20° in its internal temperature, while an increase of more
than 5° or 6° would be dangerous. Ifthe temperature of man or mamn-
mal reaches 44° or 46° death results. Birds can exist at a point some-
what higher. First comes a period of great excitation and convulsions,
from which it falls into a comatose state, followed by death. This
result has not yet been elucidated as clearly as desirable. Death
under all circumstances is sufficiently complex, but its complexity
varies according to its conditions. There are dis-arrangements in the
chemistry of the muscles, a portion of which undergoes a change.
There are affections of the blood which may be lacking in oxygen
though not presenting indications of any particular poison. Notwith-
standing Claude Bernard, it is the thermic rigidity and the muscular »
injury which are most serious. These are of themselves sufficient to
cause death, for their effect is to arrest respiration and circulation.

In conclusion we can say that there is, in the case of heterothermic
organisms, great endurance of intense cold, and, to a certain extent, of
heat, despite the very marked action of thermic variations upon their
organizations. In the case of homeothermic organisms we find moder-
ate endurance of low temperature, and very little resistance to an
increase of internal temperature. For then alow temperature is accom-
panied with much less danger than a high one. The former has to be
pronounced to entail death, whereas a slight rise of temperature beyond
a certain point will produce immediate and fatal results.

Between these two classes of organisms there is another group called
hibernating animals. These are, for the most part, rodents, which, at
the approach of cold weather, make an underground habitation well
covered with moss and other substances, where they remain motionless,
rolled up like a ball, during the bad season, sleeping during the entire
time, torpid, neither eating nor drinking. With these animals the
internal temperature becomes very low, following somewhat the ther-
mic variations. They scarcely breathe. Their respiratory combustions
diminish, and their temperature descends to 209, 15°, and 10°, and even
428 TEMPERATURE AND LIFE.

lower. Horwath has stated that the temperature of a hibernating
marmot reached 2°. As soon as warm weather returns they wake up,
become active, and their temperature becomes normal. They are much
leaner than before their winter’s sleep, having lived for several months
on their own accumulation of fat. Here is an animal alternately warm
blooded and cold blooded in summer and winter. The cause of this
strange alternation has not yet been explained and is exceedingly com-
plicated. With them the thermic production is relatively slight. It is
cold that determines the hibernal sleep, for it is easy to produce this
by subjecting the animal to prolonged cold by artificial means. No
juvestigations to my knowledge have been made of the resistance of
this species of animals to heat. I mean to say, of the elevation of
internal temperature above the normal level] of the summer, but it is
not to be supposed that their endurance would be as great as in case
of extremes of cold.

This class of hibernating animals unite the heterothermic and home-
othermic species, and serve to show once again that everything in
nature is related. Sudden leaps are no longer held to exist in the phy-
siology of creatures which are similar in organic structure; science
finds everywhere transitions.

Finally, all living organisms generate heat, more or less it is true,
according to their activity and their structure, but all produce it. In
the same manner all organisms submit to the influence of the surround-
ing atmosphere, although all do not follow the variations. For each
there is a degree of heat which is best adapted to its perfect develop-
ment. All die as soon as the external temperature reacts on the internal
temperature to such an extent that the latter is carried above or below
a certain point. The only difference is in the facility with which this
action of the external temperature operates upon the internal tempera-
ture of the organism,
MORPHOLOGY OF THE BLOOD CORPUSCLES.*

By CHARLES-SEDGWICK MINOT.

If one goes through the very extensive literature dealing with blood
corpuscles one finds the most divergent views defended, and can hardly
reach clear ideas, for the conceptions do not agree among themselves,
either as to their structure or as to the development of the corpuscles.
According to some the red corpuscles arise from the white; according
to others the white corpuscles arise from the red; and according to still
others both kinds arise from indifferent cells. In regard to one point
only is the majority of investigators united, namely, in the silent
assumption that all blood corpuscles are of one and the same kind in
spite of the absence of the nucleus in mammalian corpuscles. It is just
this assumption that has caused endless confusion, and the morphology
of the blood corpuscles can be cleared up only by starting with the
recognition of the fundamental difference between nucleated and non-
nucleated corpuscles. Further, it must be recognized that no corpus-
cles, neither red nor white, arise from nuclei.

The origin of red corpuscles from nuclei has been maintained several
times. This notion is based upon defective observations. It is very
easy in the chick, for example, to convince oneself that the first blood
corpuscles are cells; in the area vasculosa, at the time of the blood
formation, the red blood cells are readily seen, in part lying singly, in
part in groups (blood islands), adherent to the vascular walls; the free
celis are constituted chiefly by the nucleus, which is surrounded by a
very thin layer of protoplasm, which is very easily overlooked, especially if
the preparation is not suitably stained; thisexplains, I think, the state-
ment made by Balfour (Works, vol. I) and others, that the blood corpus-
cles consist only of nuclei. By following the development along further
we find that the protoplasm enlarges for several days, and that during
the same time there is a progressive diminution in size of the nucleus,
which however is completed before the layer of protoplasm reaches
its ultimate size. The nucleus is at first granular, and its nucleolus,
or nucleoli, stands out clearly; as the nucleolus shrinks it becomes

round, and is colored darkly and almost uniformly by the usual nuclear
stains. This species of blood corpusclé oceurs in all vertebrates, and
represents the genuine blood cells. According to the above description
we can distinguish three principal stages: (1) young cells with very
little protoplasm ; (2) old cells with much protoplasm and granular
nucleus; (3) modified cells with shrunken nucleus, which colors darkly
and more uniformly. I do not know whether the first form occurs in
any living adult vertebrate, although the assumption seems justified
that they are the primitive form. On the other hand, the second stage
is obviously that characteristic of the Ichthyopsida in general, while
the third form is typical for the Sauropsida. Therefore the development
of the blood cells in amniota offers a new confirmation of Louis Agas-
siz’s law (Haeckel’s Biogenetiches Grund gesetz).

The blood-cells of mammals pass through the same metamorphoses
as those of birds; for example, in rabbit embryos the cells have reached
the Ichthyopsidan stage on the eighth day; two days later the nucleus
is already smaller, and by the thirteenth day has shrunk to its final
dimensions. .

The white blood corpuscles appear much later than the red cells, and
their exact origin has still to be investigated, for it has not yet been
determined where they first arise in the embryo; nevertheless we may
venture to assert that they arise outside the vessels. The formations
of leucocytes outside of the vessels is already known with certainty to
occur in later stages as well as in the adult. The sharp distinction
between the sites of formation of the red and white cells appears with
special clearness in the medulla of bone in birds, as we know from the
admirable investigations of J. Denys (La Cellule, tomeIv). The white
blood corpuscles then are cells, which are formed relatively late, and
wander into the blood from outside.

The non-nucleated blood corpuscles of adult mammals are entirely
new elements which are peculiar to the class, and arise neither from
red nor yet from white blood cells. Their actual development was first
discovered (so faras I know) by E. A. Schafer, who has given a detailed
account of the process in the ninth edition of Quain’s Anatomy, and
has shown there a full appreciation of the significance of his discovery.
Unfortunately Schifer’s important investigations have received little
attention. Kuborn has recently confirmed Schiafer’s results in an arti-
cle (Anatom. Anzeiger, 1890) on the formation of blood corpuscles in
the liver. One can readily study the process in the mesentery and
omentum of human and other embryos. The essential point of Schifer’s
discovery is that the non-nucleate corpuscles have an intra-cellular
origin, and arise by differentiation of the protoplasm of vaso-formative
cells. Several corpuscles arise in each cell without participation of
the nucleus; they are therefore specialized masses of protoplasm, and
may perhaps best be compared to the plastids of botanists. I venture
to propose the name of blood-plastids for these structures, since the

MORPHOLOGY OF THE BLOOD CORPUSCLES. A

term corpuscle (globule, Koérperchen) has no definite morphological
meaning. ,

Sonsino (Arch. Ital. Biol. x1) affirms that the red blood cells trans-
form themselves into plastids. I have, however, never been able to
find the intermediate forms in my own numerous preparations. I deem
it probable that he has seen merely the degenerating stages of the red
cells.

The present article is an abstract of a communication made in August
last to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Since then Howells’s memoir on the blood corpuscles has appeared
(Journal of Morphology, tv, 57). The author describes the ejection of
the nucleus from the red cells, and believes that this results in the for-
mation of red plastids. The process is, 1 think, really degenerative,
and the resemblance between the non-nucleated body of the cell and a
true plastid, is not one ef identity. Certainly, until proof is offered that
the observations of Schiifer, Kuborn, and myself, upon the intra-cellu-
lar origin of the plastids are proved erroneous, the emigration of the
nucleus of the red cells can not be held to result in producing plastids,
but only to be degenerative. That the red cells degenerate and disap-
pear has been known; Howells’s valuable observations indicate the
method of their destruction.

The above review shows that the vertebrate blood corpuscles are of
three kinds: (1) red cells; (2) white cells; (3) plastids. The red and
white cells occur in all (2?) vertebrates; the plastids are confined to the
mammals. The red cells present three chief modifications; whether
the primitive form occurs in any living adult vertebrate I do not know ;
the second form is persistent in the Ichthyopsida, the third form in the
Sauropsida. According to this we must distinguish :

A.—One-celled blood, @. ¢., first stage in all vertebrates; the blood
contains only red cells, with little protoplasm.

B.—Two-celled blood, having red and white cells; the red cells
have either a large, coarsely granular nucleus (Ichthyopsida),
or a smaller, darkly staining nucleus (Sauropsida, mamma-
lian embryos).

C.—Plastid blood, without red ceils, but with white cells and red
plastids; occurs only in adult mammals.

Mammalian blood in its development passes through these stages, as
well as through the two phases of stage B, all in their natural sequence ;
the ontogenetic order follows the phylogenetic.

I pass by the numerous authors Whose views conflict with mine,
partly because the present is not a suitable oceasion for a detailed dis-
cussion, partly because those authors who have asserted the origin of
one kind of blood corpusecle by metamorphosis from another have failed
to find just the intermediate forms; it seems to me therefore that most,
at least, of the opposing views collapse of themselves.
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.*

By GEORGE J. ROMANES.

The recently published translation of Professor Weismann’s essays
on heredity and allied topics has aroused the interest of the general
public in the system of his biological ideas. But seeing that his
system, besides being somewhat elaborate in itself, is presented in a
series of disconnected essays, originally published at different times, it
is a matter of no small difficulty to gather from the present collection
of these essays a complete view of the systein as a whole. Therefore I
propose to give a brief sketch of his several theories, arranged in a
manner calculated to show their logical connection one with another.
And in order also to show the relation in which his resulting theory
of heredity stands to what has hitherto been the more usual way of
regarding the facts, I will begin by furnishing a similarly brief sketch
of Mr. Darwin’s theory upon the subject. It will be observed that
these two theories constitute the logical antipodes of explanatory
thought; and therefore it may be said, in a general way, that all other
modern theories of heredity—such as those of Spencer, Haeckel, Elsberg,
Galton, Naegeli, Brooks, Hertwig, and Vries—occupy positions more
or less intermediate between these two extremes.

When closely analyzed, Mr. Darwin’s theory—or ‘“ provisional hy-
pothesis of pangenesis”—will be found to embody altogether seven
assumptions, viz:

(1) That all the component cells of a multi-cellular organism throw
off inconceivably minute germs or “ gemmules,” which are then dis-
persed throughout the whole system.

(2) That these gemmules, when so dispersed and supplied with
proper nutriment, multiply by self-division, and under suitable condi-
tions, are capable of developing into physiological cells like those from
which they were originally and severally derived.

(3) That while still in this gemmular condition, these cell seeds have
for one another a mutual affinity, which leads to their being collected
from all parts of the system by the reproductive glands of the organism ;
and that, when so collected, they go to constitute the essential material
of she sexual elements, ova and spermatozoa being thus nothing more

434 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

than aggregated packets of gemmules which have emanated from all
the cells of all the tissues of the organism.

(4) That the development of a new organism out of the fusion of two
such packets of gemmules is due to a summation of all the develop-
ments of some of the gemmules which these two packets contain.

(5) That a large proportional number of the gemmules in each packet,
however, fail to develop, and are then transmitted in a dormant state
to future generations, in any of which they may be developed subse-
quently, thus giving rise to the phenomena of reversion or atavism.

(6) ‘That in all cases the development of gemmules into the form of
their parent cell depends on their suitable union with other partially
developed gemmules, which precede them in the regular course of
growth.

(7) That gemmules are thrown off by all physiological cells, not only
during the adult state of the organism, but during all stages of its de-
velopment. Or in other words, that the production of these cell seeds
depends upon the adult condition of parent cells, not upon that of the
multi-cellular organism as a whole.

At first sight it may well appear that we have here a very formidable
array of assumptions. But Mr. Darwin ably argues in favor of each of
them by pointing to well-known aualogies, drawn from the vital proc-
esses of living cells, both in the protozoa and metazoa. Jor example,
it is already a well-recognized doctrine of physiology that each cell of a
metazoon, or multicellular organism, though to a large extent depend-
ent on others, is likewise to a certain extent independent or automatous,
and has the power of multiplying by self-division. Therefore, as it is
certain that the sexual elements (and also buds of all descriptions) in-
clude formative matter of some kind, the first assumption—or that
which supposes such formative matter to be particulate—is certainly
not a gratuitous assumption. Again, the second assumption—namely,
that this particulate and formative material is dispersed throughout all
the tissues of the organism—is sustained by the fact that both in cer-
tain plants and in certain invertebrate animals a severed portion of the
organism will develop into an entire organism similar to that from which
it was derived, as for example is the case with a leaf of begonia and
with portions cut from certain worms, sea-anemones, jelly-fish, ete. This
well-known fact in itself seems enough to prove that the formative ma-
terial in question must certainly admit (at all events in many cases) of
being distributed throughout all the tissues of living organisms.

The third assumption—or that which supposes the formative mate-
rial to be especially aggregated in the sexual elements—is not so much
an assumption as a statement of obvious fact; while the fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh assumptions all follow deductively from their pred-
ecessors. In other words, if the first and second assumptions be
granted and if the theory is to comprise all the facts of heredity, then
the remaining five assumptions are bound to follow,
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY. 435

To the probable objection that the supposed gemmules must be of
impossibly minute size—seeing that thousands of millions of them
would require to be packed into a single ovum or spermatozobn—Mr.
Darwin opposes a calculation that a cube of glass or water having
only one ten-thousandth of an inch to a side contains somewhere be-
tween sixteen and a hundred and thirty-one billions of molecules.
Again, as touching the supposed power of multiplication on the part
of his gemmules, Mr. Darwin alludes to the fact that infectious mate-
rial of all kinds exhibits a ratio of increase quite as great as any that
his theory requires to attribute to gemmules. Furthermore, with
respect to the elective affinity of gemmules, he remarks that ‘in all
ordinary cases of sexual reproduction the male and female elements
certainly have an elective aftinity for each other ;” of the ten thousand
species of Composite, for example, ‘‘ there can be no doubt that if the
pollen of all these species could be simultaneously placed on the stigma
of any one species, this one would elect, with unerring certainty, its
own pollen.”

Such then in brief outline, is Mr. Darwin’s theory of pangenesis.

Professor Weismann’s theory of germ-plasm is fundamentally based
upon the great distiaction that obtains in respect of their transmissi-
bility between characters which are congenital and characters which
are acquired. By acongenital character is meant any individual pecul-
iarity, whether structural or mental, with which the individual is
born. By an acquired character is meant any peculiarity which the
individual may subsequently develop in consequence of its own indi-
vidual experience. For example, aman may be born with some mal-
formation of one of his fingers or he may subsequently acquire such a
malformation as the result of accident or disease. Now in the former
case—i. e., in that where the malformation is congenital—it is ex-
tremely probable that the peculiarity will be transmitted to his chil-
dren; while in the latter case—i. e., where the malformation is subse-
quently acquired—it is virtually certain that it will not be transmitted
to his children. And this great difference between the transmissibility
of characters which are congenital and characters which are acquired
extends universally as a general law throughout the vegetable as well
as the animal kingdom, and in the province of mental as in that of
bodily organization. Of course this general law has always been well
known and more or less fully recognized by all modern physiologists
and medical men. But before the subject was taken up by Professor
Weismann it was generally assumed that the difference in question
was one of degree, not one of kind. In other words, it was assumed
that acquired characters, although not so fully—and therefore not so
certainly—inherited as congenital characters, nevertheless were inher-
ited in some lesser degree ; so that, if the same character continued to
be developed successively in a number of sequent generations, what
was at first only a slight tendency to be inherited would become by
436 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

summation a more and more pronounced tendency, till eventually the
acquired character might be as strongly inherited as any other charac-
ter which was ab initio congenital. Now it is the validity of this
assumption that is challenged by Professor Weismann. He says there
is no evidence at all of any acquired characters being in any degree in-
herited, and therefore that in this important respect they may be
held to differ from congenital characters in kind. On the supposition
that they do thus differ in kind, he furnishes a very attractive theory
of heredity, which serves at once to explain the difterence, and to rep-
resent it as a matter of physiological impossibility that any acquired
character can, under any circumstances whatsoever, be transmitted to
progeny.

In order fully to comprehend this theory, it is desirable first of all to
explain Professor Weismann’s views upon certain other topics which
are more or less closely allied to, and indeed logically bound up with
the present one.

Starting from the fact that uni-cellular organisms multiply by fission
and gemmation, he argues that aboriginally and potentially, life is
immortal; for, when a protozoén divides into two—more or less equal
parts by fission, and each of the two halves thereupon grows into
another protozoén, it is evident that there has been no death on the
part of any of the living material involved; and inasmuch as this
process of fission goes on continuously from generation to generation,
there is never any death on the part of such protoplasmic material,
although there is a continuous addition to it as the numbers of individ-
uals increase. Similarly, in the case of gemmation, when a protozoén
parts with a small portion of its living material in the form of a bud,
this portion does not die, but develops into a new individual; and
therefore the process is exactly analogous to that of fission, save that
only a small instead of a large part of the parent substance is involved.
Now if life be thus immortal in the case of uni-cellular organisms, why
should it have ceased to be so in the case of multi-cellular organisms ?
Weismann’s answer is that all the multi-cellular organisms propagate
themselves, not exclusively by fission or gemmation, but by sexual fer-
tilization, where the condition to a new organism arising is—that minute
and specialized portions of two parent organisms should fuse together.
Now it is evident that with this change in the method of propagation,
serious disadvantage would accrue to any species if its sexual individ-
uals were to continue to be immortal; for in that case every species
which multiplies by sexual methods would in time become composed of
indivuals broken down and decrepit through the results of accident
and disease—always operating and ever accumulating throughout the
course of their immortal lives. Consequently as soon as sexual methods
of propagation superseded the more primitive a-sexual methods, it
became desirable in the interests of the sexually-propagating species
that their constituent individuals should cease to be immortal, so that

.
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY. 437

the species should always be recuperated by fresh, young, and well-
formed representatives. Consequently also, natural selection would
speedily see to it that all sexually-propagating species should become
deprived of tie aboriginal endowment of immortality, with the result
that death is now a universal destiny among all the individuals of such
species, that is to say, among all the metazoa and metaphyta. Never-
theless, it is to be remembered that this destiny extends only to the
parts of the individual other than the contents of those specialized cells
which constitute the reproductive elements, for although in each in-
dividual metazoén or metaphyton an innumerable number of these
specialized cells are destined to perish during the life and with the
death of the organism to which they belong, this is only due to the
accident, so to speak, of their contents not having met with their com.
plements in the opposite sex; it does not belong to their essential
nature that they should perish, seeing that those which do happen to
meet with their complements in the opposite sex help to form a new
living individual, and so on through successive generations ad infinitum.
Therefore the reproductive elements of the metazoa and metaphyta are
in this respect precisely analagous to the protozoa: potentially, or in
their own nature, they are immortal; and, like the protozoa, if they die,
their death is an accident due to unfavorable circumstances. But the
case is quite different with all the other parts of a multicellular organ-
ism. Here, no matter how favorable the circumstances may be, every
cell contains within itself, or in its very nature, the eventual doom of
death. Thus, of the metazoa and mtaphyta it is the specialized germ-
plasms alone that retain their primitive endowment of everlasting life,
passed on continuously through generation after generation of succes-
Sively perishing organisms.

So far, it is contended, we are dealing with matters of fact. It must
be taken as true that the protoplasm of the uni-cellular organisms and
the germ-plasm of the multicellular organisms have been continuous
through the time since life first appeared upon this earth ; and although
large quantities of each are perpetually dying through being exposed to
conditions unfavorable to life, this, as Weismann presents the matter,
is quite a different case from that of all the other constituent parts of
multi-cellular organisms, which contain within themselves the doom of
death. Furthermore,-it appears extremely probable that this doom of
death has been brought about by natural selection for the reasons
assigned by Weismann, namely, because it is for the benefit of all
species which perpetuate themselves by sexual methods that their con-
stituent individuals should not live longer than is necessary for the
sake of originating the next generation and fairly starting itin its own
struggle for existence. For Weismann has shown, by a somewhat
laborious though still largely imperfect research, that there is through-
out all the metazoa a general correlation between the natural life-time
of individuals composing any given species and the age at which they
438 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

reach maturity or first become capable of procreation. This general
correlation however is somewhat modified by the time during which
progeny are dependent upon their parents for support and protection.
Nevertheless, it is evident that this modification tends rather to confirm
the view that expectation of life on the part of individuals has in all
cases been determined with strict reference to the requirements of prop-
agation, if under propagation we include the rearing as well as the
production of offspring. I may observe in passing that I do not think
this general law can be found to apply to plants in nearly so close a
manner as Weismann has shown it to apply to animals; but leaving
this fact aside, to the best of my judgment it does appear that Weis-
mann has made out a good case in favor of such a general law with
regard to animals.

We have come then to these results. Protoplasm was originally
immortal (barring accidents), and it still continues to be immortal in
the case of unicellular organisms which propagate a-sexually. Butin
the case of all multicellular organisms, which propagate sexually, nat-
ural selection has reduced the term of life within the smallest limits
that in each given case are compatible with the performance of the
sexual act and the subsequent rearing of progeny, reserving however
the original endowment of immortality for the germinal elements,
whereby a continuum of life has been secured from the earliest appear-
ance of life until the present day.

Now in view of these results, the question arises, Why should the
sexual methods of propagation have become so general if their effect
has been that of determining the necessary death of all individuals
presenting them? Why, in the course of organic evolution, should
these newer methods have been imposed on all the higher organisms,
when the consequence is that all these higher organisms must pay for
the innovation with their lives? Weismann’s answer to this question
is as interesting and ingenious as all that has gone before. Seeing that
sexual propagation is so general as to be practically universal among
multi-cellular organisms, it is obvious that in some way or other it
must have a most important part to play in the general scheme of
organic evolution. What then is the part that it does play? What
is its raison Wétre? Briefly, according to Weismann, its function is
that of furnishing congenital variations to the ever-watchful agency of
natural selection, in order that natural selection may always preserve
the most favorable and pass them on to the next generation by hered-
ity. That sexual propagation is well calculated to furnish congenital
variations may easily be rendered apparent. We have only to remem-
ber that at each union there is a mixture of two germinal elements ;
that each of these was in turn the product of two other germinal ele-
ments in the preceding generation, and so backwards ad infinitum in
geometrical ratio. Remembering this, it follows that the germinal ele-
ment of no one member of a species can ever be the same as that of any
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY. 439

other member; on the contrary, while both are enormously complex
products, each has had a different ancestral history, such that while
one presents the congenital admixtures of thousands of individuals in
one line of descent, the other presents similar admixtures of thousands
of other individuals in a different line of descent. Consequently, when
in any sexual union two of these enormously complex germinal elements
fuse together and constitute a new individual out of their joint endow-
ments, it is perfectly certain that that individual can not be exactly
like any other individual of the same species or even of the same brood ;
the chances must be infinity to one against any single mass of germ-
plasm being exactly like any other mass of germ-plasm; while any
amount of latitude as to difference is allowed, up to the point at which
the difference becomes too pronounced to satisfy the conditions of fer-
tilization, in which case, of course, no new individual is born. Hence,
theoretically, we have here a sufficient cause for all individual varia-
tions of a congenital kind that can possibly occur within the limits of
fertility, and therefore that can ever become actual in living organ-
isms. In point of fact, Weismann believes—or at any rate began by
believing—that this is the sole and only cause of variations that are
congenital, and therefore (according to his views) transmissible by hered-
ity. Now whether or not he is right as regards these latter points, I
think there can be no question that sexual propagation is, at all events,
one of the main causes of congenital variation; and seeing of what
enormous importance congenital variation must always have been in
supplying material for the operation of natural selection, we appear to
have found a most satisfactory answer to our question,—Why has sex-
ual propagation become so universal among all the higher plants and
animals? It has become so because it is thus shown to have been the
condition to producing congenital variations, which in turn constitute
the condition to the working of natural selection.

Having got thus far, I should like to make two or three subsidiary
remarks. In the first place it ought to be observed that this luminous
theory touching the causes of congenital variations was not originally
propounded by Professor Weismann, but occurs in the writings of sev-
eral previous authors and is expressly alluded to by Darwin. Never-
theless, it occupies so prominent a place in Weismann’s system of theo-
ries and has by him been wrought up so much more elaborately than
by any of his predecessors that we are entitled to regard it as par ev-
cellence the Weismannian theory of variation. In the next place it
ought to be observed that Weismann is careful to guard against the
seductive fallacy of attributing the origin of sexual propagation to the
agency of natural selection. Great as the benefit of this newer mode
of propagation must have been to the species presenting it, the benefit
can not have been conferred by natural selection, seeing that the bene-
fit arose from the fact of the new method furnishing material to the
operation of natural selection, and therefore insofar as it did this,
440 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

constituting the condition to the principle of natural selection having
been called into play at all. Or in other words, we can not attribute
to natural selection the origin of sexual reproduction without involving
ourselves in the absurdity of supposing natural selection to have origi-
nated the conditions of its own activity.* What the causes may have
been which originally led to sexual reproduction is at present a matter
that awaits suggestion by way of hypothesis; and therefore it now
only remains to add that the general structure of Professor Weismann’s
system of hypotheses leads to this curious result, namely, that the
otherwise ubiquitous and (as he supposes) exclusive dominion of nat-
ural selection stops short at the protozoa, over which it can not exercise
any influence atall. For if natural selection depends for its activity
on the occurrence of congenital variations, and if congenital variations
depend for their occurrence on sexual modes of reproduction, it follows
that no organisms which propagate themselves by any other modes can
present congenital variations, or thus become subject to the influence
of natural selection. And inasmuch as Weismann believes that such
is the case with all the protozoa, as well as with all parthenogenetic
organisms, he does not hesitate to accept the necessary conclusion that
in these cases natural selection is without any jurisdiction. How, then,
does he account for individual variations in the protozoa? And still
more, how does he account for the origin of their innumerable species ?
He accounts for both these things by the direct action of external con-

* Since this paper was sent to press, Professor Weismann has published in Nature
(February 6, 1890: vol. XLI, pp. 317-323) an elaborate answer to a criticism of
his theory by Professor Vines (October 24, 1889: vol. XL, pp. 621-626). In the
course of this answer Professor Weismann says that he does attribute the origin of
sexual reproduction to natural selection. This directly contradicts what he says in
his essays, and for the reasons given in the text, appears to me an illogical departure
from his previously logical attitude. I herewith append quotations in order to reveal
the contradiction :

‘But when I maintain that the meaning of sexual reproduction is to render possi-
ble the transformation of the higher organisms by means of natural selection, such a
statement is not equivalent to the assertion that sexual reproduction originally came
into existence in order to achieve this end. The effects which are now produced by
sexual reproduction did not constitute the causes which led to its first appearance.
Sexual reproduction came into existence before it could lead to hereditary individual
variability (i. e., to the possibility of natural selection). Its first appearance must,
therefore, have had some other cause [than natural selection]; but the nature of this
cause can hardly be determined with any degree of certainty or precision from the
facts with which we are at present acquainted.”—(‘‘ Essay on the Significance of Sex-

ual Reproduction in the Theory of Natural Selection : English Translation,” pp. 281-
282.

“Tam still of opinion that the origin of sexual reproduction depends on the advan-
tage which it affords to the operation of naturalselection. - - - Sexual reproduction
has arisen by and for natural selection as the sole means by which individual varia-
tions can be united and combined in every possible proportion.”—( Nature, Vol. XLt,
p. 322.)

How such opposite statements can be reconciled I do not myself perceive.—G. J.
R., February 17, 1890.
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY. 441

ditions of life. In other words, so far as the uni-cellular organisms are
concerned, Weismann is rigidly and exclusively an advocate of the
theory of Lamarck, just as much as in the case of all the multi-cellular
organisms he is rigidly and exclusively an opponent of that theory.
Nevertheless, there is here no inconsistency ; on the contrary, it is con-
sistency with the logical requirements of his theory that leads to this
sharp partitioning of the uni-cellular from the multi-cellular organisms
with respect to the causes of their evolution. For, as he points out,
the conditions of propagation among the uni-cellular organisms are such
that parent and offspring are one and the same thing; ‘ the child is ¢
part, and usually a half, of its parent.” Therefore, if the parent has
been in any way modified by the action of external conditions, it is in-
evitable that the child should, from the moment of its birth (7. ¢., fissi-
parous separation), be similarly modified; and if the modifying influ-
ences continue in the same lines for a sufficient length of time the re-
sulting change of type may become sufficiently pronounced to consti-
tute a new species, genus, etc. But in the case of the multi-cellular or
sexual organisms the child is not thus merely a severed moiety of its
parent; it is the result of the fusion of two highly specialized and ex-
tremely minute particles of each of two parents. Therefore, whatever
may be thought touching the validity of Weismann’s deduction that
in no case can any modification induced by external conditions on these
parents be transmitted to their progeny, at least we must recognize the
validity of the distinction which he draws between the facility with
which such transmission must take place in the unicellular organisms
as compared with the difficulty—or, as he believes, the impossibility—
of its doing so in the multi-cellular.

We are now in a position to fully understand Professor Weismann’s
theory of heredity in all its bearings. Briefly stated, this theory is as
follows: The whole organization of any multi-cellular organisin is com-
posed of two entirely different kinds of cells, namely, the germ cells,
or those which have to do with reproduction, and the somatic cells, or
those which go to constitute all the other parts of the organism. Now
the somatic cells in their aggregations as tissues and organs may be
modified in numberless ways by the direct action of the environment
as well as by special habits formed during the individual life-time of
the organism. But although the modifications thus induced may be
and generally are adaptive,—such as the increased muscularity caused
by the use of muscles, “ practice making perfect ” in the case of nervous
adjustments, and so on,—in no case can these so-called acquired or
‘“ somato-genetic” characters exercise any influence upon the germ-cells,
such that they should re-appear in their products (progeny) as congen-
ital or ‘‘ blasto-genetic” characters. For according to the theory, the
germ-cells as to their germinal contents differ in kind from the somatic
cells, and have no other connection or dependence upon them than
that of deriving from them their food and lodging. So much then for
442 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

the somatic cells. Turning now more especially to the germ-cells, these
are the receptacles of what Weissmann calls the germ-plasm ; and this it
is that which he supposes to differ in kind from all the other constituent
elements of the organism. IT‘or the germ-plasm he believes to have had
its origin in the uni cellular organisms, and to have been handed down
from them in one continuous stream through all successive generations
of multi-celluiar organisms. Thus, for example, suppose we take a cer-
tain quantum of germ-plasm as this occurs in any individual organism
oi to-day. A minute portion of this germ-plasm, when mixed with a
similarly minute portion from another individual, goes to form a new
individual. But in doing so only a portion of this minute portion is
consumed ; the residue is stored up in the germinal cells of this new
individual in order to secure that continuity of the germ-plasm which
Weismann assumes as the necessary basis of his whole theory. Fur-
thermore, he assumes that this overplus portion of germ-plasm which is
so handed over to the custody of the new individual is there capable
of growth or multiplication at the expense of the nutrient materials
which are supplied to it by the new soma in which it finds itself located ;
while in thus growing or multiplying it faithfully retains its highly
complex character, so that in no one minute particular does any part of
a many thousand-fold inerease differ as to its ancestral characters from
that inconceivably small overplus which was first of all intrusted to
the embryo by its parents. Therefore one might represent the germ-
plasm by the metaphor of a yeast-plant, a single particle of which may
be put into a vat of nutrient fluid ; there it lives and grows upon the
nutriment supplied, so that a new particle may next be taken to impreg-
nate another vat, and so on ad infinitum. Here the successive vats
would represent successive generations of progeny ; but to make the
metaphor complete one would require to suppose that in each case the
yeast-cell was required to begin by making its own vat of nutrient
material, and that it was only the residual portion of the cell which
was afterwards able to grow and multiply. But although the meta-
phor is necessarily a clumsy one, it may serve to emphasize the all-im-
portant feature of Weismann’s theory, viz., the almost absolute inde-
pendence of the germ-plasm. For just as the properties of the yeast-
plant would be in no way affected by anything that might happen to
the vat short of its being broken up or having its malt impaired, so
according to Weismann the properties of the germ-plasm cannot be
affected by anything that may happen to its containing soma short of
the soma being destroyed or having its nutritive functions impaired.

Such being the relations that are supposed to obtain between the
soma and its germ-plasm, we have next to contemplate what is sup-
posed to happen when, in the course of evolution, some modification of
the ancestral form of the soma is required in order to adapt it to some
change on the part of itsenvironment. In other words, we have to con-
sider Weismann’s views on the modus operandi of adaptive develop-
ment, with its results in the origination of new species.
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY. 443

Seeing that according to the theory, it is only congenital variations
which can be inherited, all variations subsequently acquired by the in-
tercourse of individuals with their environment, however beneficial such
variations may be to these individuals, are ruled out as regards the
species. Not falling within the province of heredity, they are blocked
off in the first generation, and therefore present no significance at all
in the process of organic evolution. No matter how many generations
of eagles, for instance, may use their wings for purposes of flight; and
no matter how great an increase of muscularity, of endurance, and of
skill, may thus be secured to each generation of eagles as the result of
individual exercise; all these advantages are entirely lost to progeny,
and young eagles have ever to begin their lives with no more benefit
bequeathed by the activity of their ancestors than if those ancestors had
all been barn-door fowls. Therefore the only material which is of any
count as regards the species, or with reference to the process of evolu-
tion, are fortuitous variations of the congenital kind. Among all the
numberless congenital variations, within narrow limits, which are
perpetually occurring in each generation of eagles, some will have
reference to the wings; and although these will be fortuitous, or occur-
ring indiscriminately in all directions, a few of them will now and then
be in the direction of increased muscularity, others in the direction of
increased endurance, others in the direction of increased skill, and soon.
Now each of these fortuitous variations, which happens also to be a
beneficial variation, will be favored by natural selection; and because
it likewise happens to be a congenital variatiov, will be perpetuated by
heredity. In the course of time, other congenital variations will happen
to arise in the same directions ; these will be added by natural selection
to the advantage already gained, and so on, till after hundreds and
thousands of generations the wings of eagles become evolved into the
marvelous structures which they now present.

Such being the theory of natural selection when stripped of all rem-
nants of so-called Lamarckian principles, we have next to consider what
the theory means in its relation to germ-plasm. For as before ex-
plained, congenital variations are supposed by Weismann to be due to
new combinations taking place in the germ-plasm as a result of the
union of two complex hereditary histories in every act of fertilization.
Well, if congenital variations are thus nothing more than variations of
germ-plasm “ writ large ” in the organism which is developed out of the
plasm, it follows that natural selection is really at work upon these
variations of the germ-plasm. Tor although it is proximately at work
on the congenital variations of organisms after birth, it is ultimately,
and through them, at work upon the variations of germ-plasm out of
which the organisms arise. In other words, natural selection in pick-
ing out of each generation those individual organisms which are by
their congenital character best suited to their surrounding conditions
of life, is thereby picking out those peculiar combinations or variations
444 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

of germ-plasm, which, when expanded into a resulting organism, give
that organism the best chance in its struggle for existence. And
inasmuch as a certain overplus of this peculiar combination of germ-
plasm is intrusted to that organism for bequeathing to the next gen-
eration, this to the next, and so on, it follows that natural selection is
all the while conserving that originally peculiar combination of germ-
plasm, until it happens to meet with some other mass of germ-plasm
by mixing with which it may still further improve upon its original
peculiarity when, of course, natural selection will seize upon this im-
provement to perpetuate as in the previous case. So that on the whole
we may say that natural selection is ever waiting and watching forsuch
combinations of germ-plasm as will give the resulting organisms the
best possible chance in their struggle for existence; while at the same
time it is remorselessly destroying all those combinations of germ-plasm
which are handed over to the custody of organisms not so well fitted to
their conditions of life.

It only remains to add that, according to Weismann’s theory in its
strictly logical form, combinations of germ-plasm when once effected
are so stable that they would never alter except as a result of entering
into new combinations. In other words, no external influences or in-
ternal processes can ever change the hereditary nature of any particular
mixture of germ-plasm, save and except its admixture with some other
germ-plasm, which, being of a nature equally stable, goes to unite with
the other in equal proportions as regards hereditary character. So that
really it would be more correct to say that any given mass of germ-plasm
does not change even when it is mixed with some other mass—any
more, for instance, than a handful of sand can be said to change when
it is mixed with a handful of clay.

Consequently, we arrive at this curious result. No matter how many
generations of organisms there may have been, and therefore no matter
how many combinations of germ-plasm may have taken place to give
rise to an existing population, each existing unit of germ-plasm must
have remained of the same essential nature of constitution as when it
was first started in its immortal career millions of years ago. Or re
verting to our illustration of sand and clay, the particles of each must
always remain the same, no matter how many admixtures they may
undergo with particles of other materials, such as chalk, slate, ete.
Now inasmuch as it is an essential—because a logically necessary—
part of Weismann’s theory to assume such absolute stability or un-
changeableness on the part of germ-plasm, the question arises, and has
to be met,—What was the origin of those differences of character in the
different germ-plasms of multi-cellular organisms which first gave rise,
and still continue to give rise, to congenital variations by their mixture
one with another? ‘This important question Weismann answers by
supposing that these differences originally arose out of the differences
in the uni-cellular organisms, which were the ancestors of the primitive
WEISMANN’S THEORY OF. HEREDITY. 445

multi-cellular organisms. Nowas before stated, different forms of uni-
cellular organisms are supposed to have originated as so many results
of differences in the direct action of the environment. Consequently,
according to the theory, all congenital variations which now occur in
multi cellular organisms are really the distant results of variations that
were aboriginally induced in their uni-cellular ancestors by the direct
action of surrounding conditions of life.

I think it will be well to conclude by briefly summarizing the main
features of this elaborate theory. .

Living material is essentially, or of its own nature, imperishable,
and it still continues to be so in the case of unicellular organisms which
propagate by fission or gemmation. But as soon as these primitive
methods of propagation became, from whatever cause, superseded by
sexual, it ceased to be for the benefit of species that their constituent
individuals should be immortal, seeing that, if they continued to be
so, all species of sexually-reproducing organisms would sooner or later
come to be composed of broken down and decrepit individuals. Con-
sequently, in all sexually-reproducing or multi-cellular organisms, nat-
ural selection set to work to reduce the term of individual life-times
within the narrowest limits that in the case of each species are com-
patible with the procreation and the rearing of progeny. Nevertheless,
in all these sexually-reproducing organisms the primitive endowment
of immortality has been retained with respect to their germ-plasm,
which has thus been continuous, through numberless generations of
perishing organisms, from the first origin of sexual reproduction till
the present time. Now it is the union of germ-plasms which is required
to reproduce new individuals of multi-cellular organisms that determines
congenital variations on the part of such organisms, and thus furnishes
natural selection with the material for its work in the way of organic
evolution,—work therefore which is impossible in the case of uni-cel-
lular organisms, where variation can never be congenital, but always
determined by the direct action of surroanding conditions of life.
Again, as the germ-plasm of multi-cellular organisms is continuous from
generation to generation, and at each impregnation gives rise to a more
or less novel set of congenital characters which are of most service to
the organisms presenting them, is really or fundamentally at work
upon those variations of the germ-plasm which in turn give origin to
those variations of organisms that we recognize as congenital, there-
fore, natural selection has always to wait and to wateh for such varia-
tions of germ-plasm as will eventually prove beneficial to the individuals
developed therefrom, who will then transmit this peculiar quality of
germ-plasm to their progeny, and soon. Therefore also—and this is
most important to remember—natural selection as thus working be-
comes the one and only cause of evolution and the origin of species in
all the multi-cellular organisms, just as the direct action of the environ-
ment is the one and only cause of evolution and the origin of species
446 WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.

in the case of all the uni-cellular organisms. But inasmuch as the mul-
ti-cellular organisms were all in the first instance derived from the uni-
cellular and inasmuch as their germ-plasm is of so stable a nature that
it can never be altered by any agencies internal or external to the
organisms presenting it, it follows that all congenital variations are
the remote consequences of aboriginal differences on the part of uni-
cellular ancestors. And lastly, it follows also that these congenital
variations—although now so entirely independent of external conditions
of life, and even of activities internal to organisms themselves—were
originally and exclusively due to the direct action of such conditions
on the lives of their unicellular ancestry; while even at the present
day no one congenital variation can arise which is not ultimately due to
differences impressed upon the protoplasmic substance of the germinal
elements, when the parts of which these are now composed constituted
integral parts of the protozoa, which were directly and differentially
affected by their converse with their several environments.

Such then is Weismann’s theory of heredity in its original and
strictly logical form. But it is now necessary to add that in almost
every one of its essential features, as just stated, the theory has had to
undergo—or is demonstrably destined to undergo—some radical modi-
fication. On the present occasion however, my object is merely to
state the theory, not to criticise it. Therefore I have sought to present
the whole theory in its completely connected shape. Ona future occa-
sion—I hope within the present year—it will be my endeavor to dis-
connect the now untenable parts from the parts which still remain for
investigation at the hands of biological science.
THE ASCENT OF MAN.*

By FRANK BAKER, M. D.

The science of Anthropology, one of the younger daughters of human
knowledge, is so vast in its scope that to master all of its different ram-
ifications seems a hopeless task. Having for its object the comprehen-
sive study of man, including his origin, his development, and his present
condition, its aim is to focus and co-ordinate the general results derived
from avast number of subordinate branches. The philologist contrib-
utes information concerning the origin and growth of language and its
effect upon civilization; the mythologist tells of the psychological side
of the human mind and traces the rise and progress of religious ideas;
the archeologist, in order to fix their places in the history of mankind,
searches for the remains of peoples long since passed away. All these
depend for their material upon external records, left by tradition, by
writing, by sculpture, or by implements and weapons. With greatest
care every ancient habitation of man is searched in order to learn from
it the details of the life of its former inhabitants.

Within comparatively recent times still another avenue of informa-
tion has been found, for we have learned that it is not alone by these
external records that man’s history can be traced, but that important
facts may be obtained by studying the constitution of his body; that
the changes and vicissitudes of his existence are recorded on his very
bones, in characters long undeciphered, but to which the clew has at
last been found. My labors have led me more particularly to this
department of anthropology, and a concise summary of the main heads
of this research may be of value and interest.

The views propounded by Lamarck in the early part of this century,
with reference to the modification of living organisms by use and adap-
tation, have been remarkably confirmed in modern times. Exhaustive
researches into the constitution and properties of the cells composing
living tissues show that they are subject to continual change, each im-
pulse from without being registered by some small alteration in their
physical condition. Impulses of a similar kind continuously acting

produce greater changes, and long-continued repetition notably alters
even the hardest and most enduring of structures. Thus it is that
bones are modified in form by muscular pull and the surfaces of teeth
are shaped by incessant grinding. These alterations are more readily
apparent to us because they affect very hard and easily preserved
organs, but the effects are equally potent, though not so clearly recog-
nizable, in the softer tissues of the body. LHvery act of our lives is cer-
tainly but surely registered within the marvellous structure of our
bodies. Not a muscle can contract without an absolute change sub-
stance; in its not a nerve-cell can discharge with out some self-destruc-
tion.

Most of these changes being very minute and evanescent are quite
beyond our power to accurately estimate, and were the increments of
change confined to a single life-time, were each individual to stand only
for himself and compelled to earn his experience by the same tedious
struggle, use and adaptation would have but little power to mold man-
kind into races and varieties. But, by the action of a law as yet im-
perfectly understood, the adaptations of each individual are transmitted
to its offspring; or, tospeak more accurately, the offspring pass through
the changes more easily and quickly than the parent did. While each
has always to go back to the beginning and commence from the simple
blastema of the primitive egg, the younger has the advantage of being
able to adapt itself more quickly to its surroundings, provided these
have not too greatly changed, and thus starts a little way ahead of its
ancestor in the race for life. In consequence of this law, changes be-
come cumulative, and a cause acting for a great length of time upon a
series of successive generations finally produces a well-marked and
easily observed effect in the structure of individuals; changing colors,
modifying organs, shaping whole regions of the body.

Again, if after such changes have been effected, these causes cease
to operate and the organs they have shaped are no longer of use, the
latter become reduced in size, atrophy, and recede, remaining however
in a vestigial condition for many, many generations as records of the
past history of the race, as dolmens and cromlechs certify to former
customs and flint arrow-heads and stone hatchets give evidence of a
previous state of civilization.

often fierce, bloody, and pitiless.

These are found in every organ of the body, and each new investiga-
tion adds to their number. To enumerate them all would be impossible
within the limits assigned me by your patience. I will therefore touch
only upon a few of the more striking ones, especially those connected
with the modifications of the limbs, with the erect position, and with
the segmentation of the body,
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 449

The limbs, being organs of support and locomotion, show great varia-
tions in the zodlogical series, and the hand of man has long been looked
upon as especially significant of his high position in the auimal king-
dom, one of the chief distinctions between him and the nearest brutes.
Toa certain extent this is correct. No other creature possesses so highly
complex and effective an organ for grasping and adjusting objects, and
it is pre-eminently this that has made man a tool-using animal. On
comparing a human hand with that of the anthropoid apes it may be
seen that this efficiency is produced in two ways: first, by increasing
the mobility and variety of action of the thumb and fingers; second, by
reducing the muscles used mainly to assist prolonged grasp, they being
no longer necessary to an organ that is intended for delicate work,
and requires constant re-adjustment. Thus some elements are added
and some taken away. Now according to the theory I have enunciated,
the latest elements ought to show signs of their recent origin, to be
somewhat imperfectly differentiated and liable to return to their primi-
tive state, while those going out of active use ought to be vestigial, not
equal in size or force to muscular organs generally, very liable to varia-
tion or disappearance. This is what actually occurs.

Among the new elements is a special flexor muscle for the thumb,
arising high up on the forearm. <A very slight examination shows
that this muscle has been split off from the fibers of the deep flexor
that bends the terminal joints of the fingers. In most apes the two
form a single muscle, and in man the thumb flexor very often shows
unmistakable evidence of such origin. In about 10 per cent. of
persons, part of its fibers pass over to and become blended with the
parent muscle. Not infrequently I have seen the two entirely united,
returning absolutely to their primitive condition. The deep and super-
ficial flexors of the fingers show signs of a similar relationship, as they
frequently blend more or less, tending to revert to the type shown in
most lower animals. Indeed, if we go back to embryonic life we find
all the muscles of the anterior part of the fore-arm united in what is
termed the pronato flecor mass, recalling the original condition of mus:
culature in the earliest animals possessing limbs.

In the category of disappearing muscles comes the palmarus longus
a muscle of the fore-arm which in many animals is an important aid in
climbing and grasping. It takes its origin from the upper arm and
passes to the hand, where it expands into a large sheet of thick mem-
brane called the palmar fascia, which splits into several slips passing to
each finger. The pull of the muscle acts upon all the fingers together,
keeping them bent without independence of action, Now in man the
fingers have each two separate flexor tendons that can act to a certain
extent independently. To insure their independence they are at the
wrist enclosed in a remarkable tubular conduit or subway formed by
soldering the palmar fascia to the wrist-bones. This at once destroys
any effective action of the palmaris longus on the fingers and it becomes

H. Mis. 129———29
450 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

a flexor of the wrist. This soldering undoubtedly took place because
the muscle was no longer required as a finger-holder. Like other organs
that after playing a part of considerable functional importance have
come from change of habit to be of but little value, it shows the most
astonishing tendency to variation. Not a week passes in a large dis-
secting room that some curious anomaly is not found in this muscle.
Sometimes it is seen almostin its primitive condition, the palmar fascia
being comparatively movable and the palmaris longus having some effect
upon the flexion of the fingers ; oftener it unites wholly or partially with
some portion of the pronato-flexor mass or disappears altogether. The
disappearance is usually only ajyyparent, however. Regressive struc-
tures rarely disappear totally, for on careful search astrip of fascia ean
usually be found that represents the atrophied and aborted organ.

Since these two examples differ in that the first represents the devel-
opment of a new muscle while the second is the atrophy of an old one,
we ought to find racial differences corresponding to these two condi-
tions. Our studies of racial anatomy are as yet far from sufficient to
give us complete information upon these points, and I would especially
avoid generalizing upon too meager data. It has however appeared
to me that in negroes the palmaris longus is more inclined to assume its
primitive type—that is, is less likely to vary—while the long flexor of
the thumb is on the contrary more inclined to be partially, if not wholly,
united with the deep flexor of the fingers.

Connected intimately with the hand are the other portions of the
thoracic limb that carry it from place to place. Here again we may
note many points indicating a progressive development of the member,
When the arm is naturally and easily bent at the elbow it does not
carry the hand to the shoulder, as might be expected, but towards the
mouth. The reason for this is that the articular surfaces of the elbow-
joint are not cut horizontally across the axis of the humerus, but inclined
at an angle of about 20°. This obliquity does not occur in the foetus and
is less in Bushmen, Australians, and the anthropoid apes. It is associ-
ated with another peculiarity ; indeed, may be said to be caused by it.
This is a twisting of the humerus on its long axis, which occurs markedly
in the higher races. If we hold up endwise the humerus of a European
we see that the longest diameters of the upper and lower ends very
nearly coincide. In the negro we find the lower diameter turned more
towards the body, still more in the anthropoid apes, and again more as
we descend the scale. Embryology teaches that the humerus was for-
merly set so that the hollow of the elbow looked towards the body
rather than forward, and it seems therefore that as the functions of
the limb became more various, the lower end of the bone gradually
twisted outward around the long axis until its diameter described a
considerable are. This turned the hand with the palm to the front, ex-
tended its range, and adapted it for a wider usefulness. Greater twist
is found in the right humerus than in the left and in the humeri of
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 451

modern times than in those of the stone age. As the torsion increased
some provision became necessary for carrying the hand easily across
the body to the mouth. This was effected by the inclination of the ar-
ticular surfaces of the elbow-joint already mentioned.

Many moveinents of the arm in man are produced by muscles acting
upon the shoulder-blade or scapula. As the hand was turned outward
and a wider range given, these increased in extent and importance, and
the scapula accordingly widened out at its vertebral border in order to
give a more extensive attachinent for muscles. In order to accurately
estimate this change the ratio of the breadth to the length of the
scapula is taken. This ratio, called the scapular index, is highest
among the white races, less in the infant, in negroes, and in Austra-
lians, and still less in anthropoid apes. It is significant also that the
vertebral border of the scapula is the last to form in the foetus. We
have therefore three modifications—the torsion of the humerus, the
inclination of its lower articular surface, and the scapular index—all
depending upon each other, all varying together pari passu, and all
showing a progressive development both in the individual and the race.

Muscle is composed of one of the most highly organized and expen-
sive tissues of the body. Unless fed constantly with a great supply of
blood to keep up its active metabolic changes, it quickly wastes, func-
tional activity being absolutely necessary to its proper maintenance, as
any one knows who has seen how rapidly the muscles of an athlete
diminish when he goes out of training. If from accident or change of
habit its use altogether ceases, its protoplasm is gradually removed, its
blood supply diminishes, and it sbrinks to a mere band or sheet of
fibrous tissue. Changes of function may therefore affect the form of
muscles, one portion becoming tendinous or fascia-like; may even cause
them to shift their places, by inducing a development on one side and
an atrophy on another, or to disappear altogether, being replaced by
fascia orligament. A similar regression may take place in bone and car-
tilage a high-grade, actively metabolic tissue, difficult to maintain, being
replaced by a low-grade one comparatively slow to change, It is there-
fore not unusual to find that muscles, bones, and cartilages performing
important functions in some animals are represented by vestigial struc-
tures in those higher in the scale. Our conclusions on this subject are
confirmed by finding occasional instances where the hereditary ten-
dency has been greater than usual and the parent form is re-produced
more or less completely in the higher animal. The palmar fascia at the
distal end of the palmaris longus, to which allusion has been made,
represents a former muscular portion, relics of which probably remain
as some of the small thumb muscles.

Another interesting instance is the epitrochleo-anconeus, a small
muscle at the elbow joint, used in apes to effect a lateral movement of
the ulna upon the humerus. In man the ulna has become so shaped
that the lateral movement is almost wholly lost, and the muscle has
452 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

accordingly degenerated, being represented by a strip of fascia. Very
often however, a few muscular fibers are still found in this situation.

Several minor peculiarities that remind us of priwitive conditions
occur in the region of the humerus. Occasionally a supracondyloid
process is found, throwing a protecting arch over the brachial artery
and median nerve; in this resembling the supracondyloid foramen of
marsupials. Struthers found this to be hereditary, occurring in a father
and four children. A perforation of the olecranon fossa, the pit at the
lower end of the humerus into which the beak-like end of the ulna fits
when the arm is fully extended, may probably be regarded as a rever-
sion toward the condition of anthropoid apes. This frequently occurs
in South African and other low tribes and in the men of the stone age.
Recently Dr. D. S. Lamb has found it remarkably frequent in pre-historic
Indian humeri from the Salado Valley, Arizona.

While the region of the hand and fore-arm indicates increase of
specialization, the upper part of the limb generally testifies to a regres-
sion from a former more highly developed state. The anatomy of the
flying apparatus of a bird shows a series of muscular, ligamentous, and
bony structures connected with its upper arm far beyond anything
ever seen in man. The coracoid bone, a very important element of the
shoulder girdle in birds, has become reduced in man to a little vestigial
ossicle that about the sixteenth year becomes soldered to the scapula
as the coracoid process. The muscles arising from this,—pectoralis
minor, coraco-brachialis, and biceps,—are structures represented in birds
by strong, flying muscles. The subclavius, a little slip ending at
the clavicle, appears to have formerly passed to the coracoid bone or
to the humerus and been employed in arm movement. The pectoralis
major appears to represent what was formerly a series of muscles. All
these have a tendency to repeat their past history, and the number of
variations found among them is legion. The biceps show traces of its
former complexity by appearing with three, four, or even five heads,
by a great variety of insertions, by sending a tendon outside the joint
capsule instead of through it, as is the rule. The pectoralis major may
break up into several different muscular integers, inserted from the
shoulder capsule down to the elbow. The coraco-brachialis shows the
same instability, and by its behavior clearly indicates its derivation
from a much larger and more extensive muscular sheet.

Not less significant are the ligaments about the shoulder. Many of
these appear to be relics of organs found active in animals lower in the
scale. Thus the coraco-acromial ligament spanning over the shoulder
joint is probably a former extension of the acromion process; the rhom-
boid, conoid, trapezoid, and gleno-humeral ligaments represent regres-
Sive changes in the subclavius muscle, the coraco-humeral ligament, a
former insertion of the pectoralis minor. Bands of the deep cervical
fascia alone remain to testify to the former existence of the levator clav-
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 453

icule, a muscle present in most mammals and used to pull forward the
shoulder girdle when walking in a quadrupedal position. In negroes I
have frequently found it more or less complete. A fibrous strip unit-
ing the latissimus dorsi to the triceps is all that remains of an impor-
tant muscle, the dorso-epitrochlearis, passing from the back to the elbow
or forearm, used by gibbons and other arboreal apes in swinging from
branch to branch. Testut found this fully developed ina Bushman. I
have myself seen various muscular slips that must represent some por-
tions of it, and authors generally describe it as occurring in 5 or 6 per
cent. of individuals.

The hind limbs of apes are popularly thought to be remarkably
specialized. The term quadrumana or four-handed is used to charae-
terize the class ; yet it is quite true that this term involves a false con-
ception. No animal has four exactly similar feet, still less four hands.
The feet of the ape differ widely from hands; the great toe is not really
opposable like the thumb, but merely separable from the others and
differently set, so as to afford a grasp like that of a crampiron. The
gibbon alone has a small muscle of the foot that may be compared with
the opponens of the thumb. That these peculiarities are also shared
by man to some extent is well known. It is quite possible to train
the toes to do certain kind of prehensile work, even to write, cut paper,
and sew. A baby not yet able to walk can often pick up small objects
with its toes. Compare the marks caused by muscular action on the
sole of a baby’s foot with those on the hand, and it will be seen that
there are distinct signs of this prehension. Even the opponens hallucis
of the gibbon is not infrequently found in man. The foetal condition
of the foot also approaches that of the apes, the heel being shorter and
the joints so arranged that the sole can be easily turned inward. In
the ape the first or great toe is turned inward and upward by shorten-
ing its metatarsal bone and setting it obliquely upon the ankle. This
shortening and obliquity also occurs in the foetus; the adult condition,
in which the metatarsal bone is lengthened and set straight so as to
give a longer and firmer internal border to the foot, being gradually
acquired. Many savage tribes still use the foot for climbing and have
a shorter metatarsal, a wider span between the first and second toes,
and greater ease in inverting the sole. Connected with this ease of
inversion should be mentioned a peculiar, ape-like form of the tibia that
occurs in people of the stone age, in the mound builders, and in some
American Indians. This is a flattened, saber-like condition of the bone
known as platycnemy. It is apparently to give greater surface of
attachment and resistance to the pull of the tibialis anticus, the prin-
cipal muscle that turns the sole inward. It is interesting to note that
this peculiarity is much more marked in some early human skeletons
than in any of the anthropoid apes.

The poet says that while other animals grovelling regard the earth,
454 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

Jupiter gave to man an uplifted countenance, and ordered him to look
heavenward and hold his face erect towards the stars.

“Pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram,
Os homini sublime dedit, cceelumque tueri
Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus.’’*
Ovid, Metamorphoses: I, 84-86.

The erect position is however gradually acquired. As inthe sphinx’s
riddle, we literally go on all fours in the morning of life, and the diffi-
culty that an infant experiences in learning to walk is strong evi-
dence that this is an accomplishment acquired by the race late in its
history. We ought (if this is the case) to find in the human body indi-
cations of a previous semi-erect posture. There is a vast amount of evi-
dence of this character, and I can only sketch the outlines of it.

The erect position in standing is secured by the shape of the foot, by
the attachment of strong muscles at points of severest strain, and by
the configuration of the great joints which permits them to be held
locked when a standing posture is assumed. All these features are
liable to great variation; they are less marked in children and in the
lower races. Let us examine them somewhat more carefully.

The Caucasian type of foot is evidently that best adapted for the
erect position. The great toe is larger, stronger, and longer than the
others, making a firm support for the inner anterior pier of the arch
furmed by the bones—an arch completed by a well-developed heel and
maintained by a strong, dense band of fascia and ligament binding the
piers together like the tie-rod of a bowstring truss—thus producing a
light and elastic structure admirably adapted to support the weight of
the body and diminish the effect of shocks. In the lower races of man
all these characters are less marked. The great toe is shorter and
smaller, the heel-bone less strongly made, the arch much flatter. This
flattening of the arch produces the projection of the hee] found in some
races.

The muscles required for maintaining the erect position are those
which from our predilection for human anatomy we are apt to call the
great extensors, overlooking the fact that in other animals they are by
no means as well developed as in man. Being required at the points of
greatest strain, all are situated on the posterior aspect of the body—
the calf, the buttock, and the back.

A very slight examination of any lower animal will show how strik-
ingly it differs in the muscular development of these regions. The

* Compare Milton :

THE ASCENT OF MAN 455

great muscle of man’s calf, the triceps extensor sur, is formed by the
welding together of some four muscles separate in many lower forms.
Varieties are found in man showing all grades of separation in these
elements. One of the muscles, the plantaris, was formerly a great
flexor of the toes, the plantar fascia representing its former distal ex-
tent. Like the palmaris of the arm it lost its original function by the
welding of the fascia to the bones to secure the plantar arch, and its
functions being then assumed by other muscles it began to dwindle,
and is now represented by a mere vestigial rudiment of no functional
value. It is well known that the lower races of men have smaller
calves than Europeans. Again, it should be noted that as the erect
position is assumed the muscles required for the flexion and independ-
ent action of the toes become reduced in character. A comparison
with other forms shows that some of the small muscles now confined to
the region of the foot formerly took their origin higher up, from the
bones of the leg. Losing in functional importance, they have dwindled
in size and gradualiy moved downward.

The great glutei muscles of the buttock find their highest develop-
ment in man. They are subject to similar variations. Certain muscles
of this region, normal in apes, are occasionally found in man: a sepa-
rate head of the great gluteus, derived from the ischium, and the
scansorius or climbing muscle that assists the great flexor of the
thigh (the tlio-psoas), may be mentioned.

The enormous size and complexity of the muscles of the back in man
are well known. The erector of the spine fills up the vertebral grooves
and sends up numerous tendons along the back like stays supporting
the masts of a ship. The mass of this muscle is comparatively less
in anthropoid apes.

Notwithstanding all these powerful muscles, it would be impossible
to retain the erect position for any great length of time were we to
depend upon them alone, for it requires (as before stated) a great ex-
penditure of force to keep a muscle in active use. It becomes rapidly
fatigued and then loses its power, aS any one may prove by standing
in any constrained position, even ‘in the position of a soldier,” for half
an hour. To provide against this, a beautiful arrangement of joints
and ligaments has been developed.

When in the erect attitude the anklJe-joint is so arranged that its
bones are in a position of greatest stability and the center of gravity
is so adjusted that it falls directly upon it. This reduces to a minimum
the amount of muscular force required to keep the body erect. At the
knee the center of gravity falls a little in front of the axis of the limb,
and the back and sides of the joint are provided with check ligaments
or straps that hold the joints locked in a position of hyper-extension,
so that no muscular force whatever is used to maintain it. These liga-
ments are regressive structures, being vestiges of former insertions of
muscles near the joint. At the hip a similar condition occurs, the
A56 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

_ center of gravity falling behind the joint and the whole weight of the

trunk being hung upon the ilio-femoral ligament, a heavily thickened
portion of the joint capsule. This structure is much more marked in
man than in other mammals, and is found to vary considerably in its
size and strength.

The spinal column has been remarkably modified to adapt it to the
erect position. before the fifth month of uterine life the whole spine
deseribes a single, large, dorsally directed curve like that of the quad-
ruped, arranged to accommodate the viscera. As this would be incom.
patible with the erect posture, two additional curves in the opposite
direction are formed: one in the region of the loins just where the center
of gravity would begin to fall forward, another in the neck to counteract
the heavy and unstable weight of the head. These curves are gradually
acquired. While possessed by all races, and in a less degree by the
higher apes, they arrive at their highest development in Europeans;
while the lumbar curve of the lower races of men is much better
adapted to running in a semi-erect position through the jungle or bush.
Careful measurements show that the shapes of the vertebrie have been
gradually modified. There is no abrupt transition from the spine of the
lowest savages—Australian, Bushman, Andaman—to that of the gorilla,
gibbon,and chimpanzee. i

There is also evidence that the posterior limbs have moved forward
upon the spinal column in order that the erect position may be assumed
with less effort. In man there are between the skull and the sacrum
twenty-four vertebre. The other primates have usually twenty-six,
although the gorilla, chimpanzee, and orang agree with man. Now in
foetal life the attachment of the hip-bones to the sacruin commences
from below upward. Union first occurs with the third sacral vertebra,
leaving twenty-six pre-sacral, then advances forward, the first sacral
uniting last of all. The bip-bones actually move up along the spine a
distanee of two segments. Occasionally this shifting is carried still
further, and but twenty-three pre-sacral vertebrie are left. Anomalies
caused by an arrest of development at some stage of this process are
not at all infrequent. The most common is the want of union between the
hip-bones and the first sacral vertebra, thus producing apparently six
lumbar vertebrae. A most beautiful specimen of this anomaly was found
last winter in my laboratory.

The spine is sustained erect by stringing from vertebra to vertebra
numbers of short ligaments that reduce to a minimum the muscular
exertion required to support it. These are particularly numerous be-
tween the spines along the great dorsal curvature. Some of these lig-
aments are replaced by small muscles, very inconstant and variable,
the survivals of a whole system of musculature that had for its object
the moving of the separate joints of the spine, one upon another.

The head is also much modified by the erect position. In quadru-
peds, its suspension requires an extensive apparatus, a large, strong,
THE ASCENT OF MAN. ADT

elastic strap—the ligamentum nuche—passing from the tips of the
thoracic vertebrie to the occiput, sending processes to all the neck ver-
tebrie involved in the strain. Though need for it has in great degree
ceased since the head has become poised in such a way as to involve
but little expenditure of muscular force, yet relics of this great suspen-
sory apparatus remain in man’s neck in the form of thickened fascial
bands.

The arrangement of the great foramen of the skull that transmits
the central axis of the nervous system, the spinal cord, is necessarily
different in an animal carrying its head erect. The foramen would
naturally tend to be set forward more under the center of gravity and
its inclination would be more nearly horizontal. Here again we see
that the ideally perfect form is more nearly approached in the civilized
races. It is never quite realized, and indeed the whole skull and its
contents evince markedly that they are still undergoing an evolution.
Again the lower races show variations that unite them with the anthro-
poid apes. While a negro may have a foramen magnum inclined 37
degrees to the horizontal, the orang may fall to 36 degrees.

But it is not only in this way that we get evidence that the erect
position has been gradually acquired. Sinee gravity plays an impor-
tant part in the functions of the visceral and circulatory systems, any
marked change in the line of equilibrium must necessarily be accom-
panied by disturbances. These disturbances to a certain extent con-
flict with the acquirement of the position, as they weaken the animal.
In the course of time the body may perhaps become adapted to the
changed conditions, but before that perfect adaptation takes place tiere.
is a period of struggle. There is abundant evidence that such a strug-
gle has occurred and is yet going on, the adaptation being as yet far
from complete.

The most striking and important of these adaptations concerns the
pelvis. When the erect posture is assumed the weight of the visceré
being thrown upon this bony girdle, it becomes adapted for their sup-
port by assuming a more fixed and dish-like shape. This is naturally
more pronounced in the female, since with her the pelvis must bear
the additional weight of the pregnant uterus. It is evident that a
solid, unyielding, laterally expanded ring of small aperture would give
the most effective support in the erect position, but it is equally clear
that with any such structure parturition would be impossible. In the
quadruped the act of parturition is comparatively easy, the pelvis offer-
ing no serious hindrance. The shape of the female pelvis is therefore
the result of a compromise between two forms, one for support, the
other for ease in delivery. When we reflect that along with the
acquirement of the erect position, the size of the head of the child has
gradually increased, thus forming still another obstacle to delivery and
to the adaptation which might otherwise have taken place, we can
realize how serious the struggle has been, and no longer wonder that
458 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

deaths in child-birth are much more common in the higher races and
that woman in her entire organization shows signs of having suffered
more than man in the upward struggle.

In no other animal is there shown such a distinction between the
pelvis of the male and that of the female, a distinction that increases
as we ascend the scale. While the amount of individual variation is
great, we yet see, particularly in the pelvis of the Andaman Islanders
and of the Polynesian races, distinctly simian characters. The scanty
material at hand indicates that a similar transition occurred between
the modern and pre-historic types. The approximation of the infantile
and simian forms is well known.

The pelvis alone does not suffice to support the viscera. In quad-
rupeds the whole weight is slung from the horizontal spine by means
of a strong elastic suspensory bandage of fascia, the tunica abdominalis.
The part of this near the thorax has in man entirely disappeared, being
uo longer of any use. In the groin it remains to strengthen the weak
points where structures pass out from the abdominal cavity. That it
often is insufficient to withstand the great pressure is testified by the
great prevalence of hernia, another sign of imperfect adaptation. The
frequency of uterine displacements, almost unknown in the quadruped,
has also been noted. It is significant that one of the most effective
postures for treating and restoring to place the disturbed organ is the
so-called “ knee-elbow position,” decidedly quadrupedal in character.

Many other indications are found in the viscera. The urinary bladder
is So arranged in man, that any concretions that may occur, do not gather
near the opening of the urethra, where they might be discharged, but fall
back into the cul-de-sac at the base, where they enlarge and irritate the
mucous lining.* The cecum, with its vermiform appendage, a vestigial
organ finding its proper functional activity far below man, is so placed
in quadrupeds that the action of gravity tends to free it from fecal aceu-
mulations. In man this is not the case, and as a consequence inflam-
mation of this organ or its surrounding tissues, very serious and often
fatal, is by no means rare. It may be noted that the ascending colon
is obliged to lift its contents against gravity, and that in a lowered state
of the system this might very readily induce torpidity of function.

The gal! bladder in quadrupeds also discharges at an advantageous
angle. In man, although the difference is slight, it appears to be suffi-

* Since the above was written, my attention has been called to the following re-
markable passage in the works of Dr. ERASMUS DARWIN. It occurs in his ‘‘ Temple
of Nature,” Canto ii, foot-note to line 122.

“‘Tt has been supposed by some that mankind were formerly quadrupeds as well as
hermaphrodites ; and that some parts of the body are not yet so convenient to an
erect posture as to a horizontal one: as the fundus of the bladder in an erect posture
is not exactly over the insertion of the urethea ; whence it is seldom completely
evacuated, and thus renders mankind more subject to the stone than if he had pre-
served his horizontality.” (The preface to this poem is dated January 1, 1802.)
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 459

cient to cause at times retention and consequent inspissation of the
bile, leading to the formation of gall-stoues.

The quadruped’s liver hangs suspended from the spine, but as the
erect attitude is assumed it depends more and more from the diaphragm.
The diaphragm in its turn develops adhesions with the fibrous covering
of the heart, which is continuous with the deep fascia of the neck, so
that in effect the liver hangs suspended from the top of the thorax and
base of the skull. This restricts in some degree the action of the dia-
phragm and confines the lungs. This must have an effect upon the
aération of the blood, and consequently upon the ability to sustain pro-
longed and rapid muscular exertion. /.n extra lobe of the right lung
that in animals intervenes, either constantly or during inspiration, be-
tween the heart and the diaphragm, is occasionally found in a vestigial
state in man.

The vascular system abounds in evidences that it was primarily
adapted to the quadrupedal position. By constant selection for enor-
mous periods of time, the vessels have become located in the best pro-
tected situations. It is scarcely possible to injure a vessel of any size
in an animal without deeply penetrating the body or passing quite
through a limb. In man, on the contrary, several great trunks are
comparatively exposed, notably the great vessels of the thigh, those of
the forearm, and of the ventral wall.

The influence that gravity has upon the circulation is well known.
The horizontal position of the great venous trunks favors the easy flow
of blood to the heart without too greatly accelerating it. Man,in whom
these trunks are vertical, suffers thereby from two mechanical defects,—
the difficulty of raising blood through the ascending vena cava, whence
come congestion of the liver, cardiac dropsy, and a number of other
disorders, and the too rapid delivery through the descending cava,
whence the tendency to syncope or fainting if for any cause the action
of the heart is lessened. Clevenger’s admirable discovery that the
valves of the veins are arranged for a quadrupedal position should also
be mentioned here. Evidently intended to resist the action of gravity,
they should, to be effective, be found in the large vertical trunks. But
in the most important of these they are wanting. Hence are caused
many disorders arising from hydrostatic pressure, such as varicose veins,
varicocele, hemorrhoids, and the like. Yet the values occur in several
horizontal trunks, where they are, as far as we know, of no use what-
ever. Place man on all fours however, and it is seen that the entire
system of valves is arranged with reference to the action of gravity in
that position. The great vessels along the spine and the portal system
being then approximately horizontal do not require valves, while all
the vertical trunks of considerable size, even the intercostal and jugular
veins, are provided with them. A confirmation of this view is found in
the fact that the valves are variable in character and tend to disappear
in the veins where they are no longer needed.
460 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

Every animal possessing a backbone may be said to be formed by the
union of a series of disk-like segments arranged on a longitudinal axis.
These segments are originally similar in character, but become specially
modified in innumerable ways to meet the needs of the individual.
Anatomists conelude, upon surveying the whole field, that this indicates
a derivation of the vertebrates from some form of the annelid worms,
among which a single unit produces by successive budding a compound
longitudinal body. This view is fully confirmed by the behavior of the
human embryo.

The number of the segments varies considerably, rising sometimes to
as many as three hundred in some fishes and reptiles, and being gen-
erally greater in the animals below man, There are many indications,
however, that in man, segments formerly possessed have disappeared.
Leaving the skull for the present out of account, there are in the adult
thirty-three or thirty-four vertebra that may be held to represent these
segments; the additional vertebra, when it occurs, almost invariably
belonging to the coceygeal or caudal series. In the human embryo
thirty-eight segmentscan at one time be made out. Four or five of these
generally disappear, but cases are by no means wanting in which they
remain until after birth and constitute a well-marked free tail. In one
case, carefully examined and described by Lissner, a girl of 12 years had
an appendage of this character 12.5 centimetres (very nearly 5 inches)
long. Other observers, probably less careful and exact, report much
ereater lengths. From some observations it would appear that abnor-
nities of this kind may be transmitted from parent to offspring.

Dr. Max Bartels recently collected from widely scattered literature
reports of 116 actually observed and described cases of tailed men. In
35 instances, authors reported such abnormities to be possessed by an
entire people, they themselves having observed certain individuals.
These cases are scattered throughout the whole of the known globe and
extend back for a thousand years. When we consider that the authen-
ticity of many cases is beyond question, and that the number that
escaped accurate observation and report must be much greater, we can
see that we are not dealing with a phenomenon that is so rare as has
generally been supposed.

Other regressive structures are abundant in this region. ‘The spinal
cord in its earlier state extended the entire length of the vertebral canal.
In the child at birth it occupies only 85 per cent. of that length; in the
adult 75 per cent. This is due mainly to the more rapid growth of the
spine. There stretches however from the lower end of the cord down
to the very end of the spine a small thread-like structure, the jfilwm ter-
minale, a degenerated vestige of the lower caudal part of the spinal
cord. Wiedersheim suggests that the frequent occurrence of degenera-
tive disorders in the lower end of the adult cord may be due to a patho-
logical extension of the normal atrophy. Rauber found in this region
traces of two additional pairs of spinal nerves. The vessel that runs
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 461

down in front of the sacrum and coccyx corresponding to the caudal
artery of quadrupeds shows signs of a former more extensive distribu-
tion, as it ends in a curiously convoluted structure known as the cocey-
geal gland, containing vestiges of vascular and nervous tissues. Traces
of caudal muscles still remain, notably the ischio-coccygeus, which in
animals moves the tail sideways, and the anterior and posterior sacro-
coccygeus, for flexing and extending it. Occasionally the agitator cauda
is found as a muscular slip passing from the femur to the coceyx. These
muscles can not be of any value in man, as the coccyx is practically
immovable. At the point where the end of the spine was primarily
attached to the skin a dimple is formed by regressive growth, and here
the. direction of the hairs also indicates that an organ has become
aborted.

Another interesting condition connected with segmentation is the vary-
ing number of the ribs. Most mammals have more ribs than man, and
as we descend in the scale they continue to increase. <A study of devel-
opment indicates that a rib is probably to be considered as an integral
portion of a vertebra. As the arch of a vertebra incloses the central
nervous system, so the ribs inclose the visceral system. If this be cor-
rect they ought to be found throughout as far as the body cavity extends.
This is really the case. They exist in the neck as the anterior bars of
the transverse processes, in the loins as the transverse or costal pro-
cesses themselves, in the sacrum welded togetherinto what are known
as the lateral masses. A great number of considerations derived from
comparative anatomy, from embryology, and from variations found in
the adult, combine to support these conclusions.

Nothing would seem less likely at first sight than that the capacious
expanded brain-case or skull with its complicated structure should be
composed of segmental pieces like the vertebrie; yet there is no doubt
that the poet Goethe was on the right track when he made that impor-
tant generalization. The details of the segmentation are very far from
being worked out, but a vast amount of evidence indicates that the
general conclusion is correct. .

Since the predominant necessity in the construction of the skull is to
afford a protection for the brain, we need not be surprised to find that
it is very greatly modified in man. Enormous labor has been bestowed
upon craniology in an attempt to separate definitely the races of men
as well as to connect them with the lower forms. The success in estab-
lishing races has not been such as was anticipated. A constant inter-
grading of forms defies all attempts at a hard and fast classification.
We also see types that intergrade between anthropoids and man, and
find abundant evidence that the human skull was derived from a form
similar to that of still lower mammals.

At first man’s skull seems to be much simpler than the typical torm.
The bones are fewer and less complicated. But follow back the course
of development and we find the bones separating—the frontal into two
462 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

pieces, the occipital and temporal each into four, the sphenoid into
eight, repeating what we find as we descend the vertebrate scale.

Many of these peculiarities may remain throughout life. Such are
the inter-parietal bone (found very frequently in ancient Peruvian and
Arizonian skulls), the division of the frontal and temporal bones each
into two, the persistence of the intermaxillary bones and of that divi-
sion of the cheek or malar bone known as the os japonicum. Even cleft
palate, a deformity and defect in man, merely re-produces a state nat-
ural to some of the lower mammals.

There are also present structures that are homologous with the so-
called visceral arches represented in the thorax by ribs. Such are the
lower jaw, the hyoid bone, and the thyroid cartilage. A study of the
embryo shows us that these are portions of a series of bars primitively
arranged on the plan of the branchial apparatus of the water-breath-
ing vertebrates. Each bar has its appropriate skeleton and vascular
supply and is separated from the contiguous ones by a cleft that at
first passes entirely through the soft tissues and communicates with the
primitive visceral cavity. These clefts may persist and cause serious
deformities. The skeleton of the mandibular and hyoid bars is remark-
_able as containing indications of elements present in the lower verte-

brates. In fishes, the lower jaw articulates with a large bone appar-
ently not found in mammals, but on tracing carefully the development
of the mammalian skullit is found that this bone is represented by the
incus, one of the minute ossicles of the ear. In the foetus the primi-
tive lower jaw, in the shape of a bar of cartilage, actually extends into
the ear cavity and the upper end of 1¢ remains as the malleus. Relics
of the hyoid or second branchial arch are also found,—the styloid proe-
ess of the temporal bone being one of them.

The capacity of the cranium is usually held to distinguish man
remarkably, yet the lowest microcephali approach the apes in this res-
pect and the lower races have unquestionably smaller brains than the
higher. As far as can be judged, there has also been an increase in
average capacity during historic times. One fact pointed out by Gra-
tiolet is very significant. In monkeys amd in the inferior races the ossi-
fication of the sutures commences at the anterior part of the head, while
in Europeans these sutures are the last to close. This would indicate
a greater and longer continued increase of the frontal lobes of the brain.

The same remarks may be made concerning the facial angle and
prognathism. While by none of the different angles proposed have we
been able to definitely separate distinct races, yet we find that the
angle of the lower races and of microcephali approaches that of the
anthropoid apes, and that as the capacity of the skull has increased the
jaw has been thrust back under it to support the weight. This shorten-
ing of the jaw gives the characteristic expression of the civilized face.
We at once recognize a brutal physiognomy by the projection and de-
velopment of the great masticating apparatus, used in most animals
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 463

near man as a formidable weapon of defense. The shortening has
produced some very remarkable changes. It has shoved the third
molar or “ wisdom tooth” so far back that it is crowded against the as-
cending part of the jaw, thereby occasioning disturbance and trouble
in its eruption. Being no longer practically useful, it tends to dis-
appear, and many people never cut any wisdom teeth. Among the
Australasians, on the contrary, a fourth molar is not infrequently found ;
this rarely occurs in European skulls also. Evidences exist of a lost
incisor in the upper jaw on each side. Dental follicles form for it and
usually abort, but occ: sionally the tooth appears fully developed in the
adult. The great canines or eye-teeth, used in apes and other animals
for tearing and holding, are in them longer and larger than the other
teeth, and room is made for them in the opposite jaw by leaving an
interval, called the diastema, between the canine and the tooth next to
it. These large projecting canines have disappeared in the normal
human skull and the diastema has accordingly closed up. Yet it is by
no means uncommon to see the whole arrangement re-appear, especially
in low-type skuils. Projecting canines or “ snag teeth” are so common
in low faces as to be universally remarked, and would be oftener seen
did not dentists interfere and remove them. It may be noted also that
the muscle that lifts the lip from over the canines and bares the weapon,
often re-appears in man and is used to produce snarling and disdainful
expressions.

Many details of structure of the skull point in the same direction.
Occasionally the occipital bone has a third condyle, as in some other
mammals, or a large lateral projection like that of a vertebra, the para.
mastoid process, or indications of a separate centrum (0s basioticum of
Albrecht). It may have interiorly a hollow ( fossette vermienne) for the
vermiform process of the cerebellum, and exteriorly a large transverse
ridge (torus occipitalis) on which are inserted the muscles of the nape.
All these peculiarities are more frequent as we descend the scale,
whether we regard the lower races of man, microcephalic individuals,
or lower animals. Like many of these atavistic features they are also
more common among the criminal classes.

I have omitted the discussion of many important structural features
that mark various stadia in man’s ascent. From the muscular system
alone there could be adduced a very great number of instances of the
survival of primitive forms and of progressive variations, particularly
in the development of the muscles of the face and breast. In the
osseous system also there are many such, among which may be men-
tioned the episternal bones, the central bones of the wrist and ankle,
and the os acetabuli. The exact significance of these is still under
discussion, as is also the question of supernumerary digits that some-
times appear on the hands and feet.

Additional instances might be drawn from the visceral system. ‘The
larynx contains small throat pouches like the great air sacs of the
464 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

anthropoid apes. The pharynx of the embryo is lined with cilia like that
of the very lowest vertebrates. Traces of the primitive intestine are
shown by the peculiar distribution of nerves and the folding of the
peritoneum. The liver and spleen both occasionally indicate a previous
simpler condition, and the intestine has sometimes diverticula of no
functional use—indeed, likely to be disadvantageous—yet pointing to
a previous state. These anomalies never occur at random, but can be
explained consistently upon the theory of reversion.

The genito-urinary system abounds in them. The uterus may have
two cavities, as in many quadrupeds, or approach that condition by
being bicornuate, as in apes, and a great variety of other vestigial
structures occur, all pointing back to an original neutral condition,
before the sexes were differentiated.

In the nervous system there is no lack of instances. Our studies of
the brain are as yet far from complete—indeed, we seem to be only at
the threshold of a reasonable knowledge of the nervous centers—and
the crowd of names, the inextricable maze of synonymy that now ob-
scures that region, is only a mark of our ignorance. It is a case of
“omne ignotum pro mirifico;” ignorant of the true value of the parts
we examine, we have named even the most insignificant details of strue-
ture. Perhaps one of the most interesting results of modern research
is the conclusion that the psychic life of our ancestors must have been
different from ourown, since they possessed organs of sensation differing
in degree and probably in kind. The sense of smell as indicated by the
size of the olfactory bulbs of the brain is decreasing in acuteness. The
foetal brain possesses comparatively larger bulbs, as do also the brains
of lower races, and of anthropoid apes. The sense, being no longer re-
quired for the preservation of the species, is slowly becoming dulled.
Jacobson’s organ, a curious structure found in many mammals, com.
bining in some unknown manner the olfactory and gustatory senses,
occurs in a vestigial state in man, and the duct connecting it with the
mouth yet remains as the anterior palatine canal. The pineal and pitu-
itary bodies of the brain probably represent obliterated sense organs,
the former being an eye, the latter having some connection with the
pharynx. Our other senses have also been modified. The eye has a
rudimentary third eyelid, such as birds and lizards possess, covered
with minute hairs. The external ear shows signs of derivation from the
pointed ear of quadrupeds and abounds in vestigial muscles such as
they use for controlling and directing it.

From this rapid sketch it will be apparent to you that the evidence
that man’s path upward has led along the same route travelled by other
animals is now very powerful in its cumulative weight. By no other
argument can we satisfactorily explain the bewildering maze of resein-
blances; yet when called upon to fix the exact line by which we have
reached our present estate we at once meet with serious difficulties.
It is a popular misconception that there has been a regular chain-like
THE ASCENT OF MAN. 465

series, with now and thena “ missing link.” The various races of men
and the higher simians are merely one branch of the great tree Yggdrasil,
that overshadows the whole earth and reaches up into heaven. The
individuals that we compare occupy the terminal twigs of that branch,
being not related directly, but only as springing from a common stock.
The fact that resemblances occur does not necessarily prove a lineal
descent, but rather a common ancestry. The races of man arose far
back in pre-historic night. Hach in its own way fought the struggle for
existence. Favored more by climate, the Caucasian appears to have
attained an intellectual superiority ; yet it should not be forgotten that
the others also excel, each in its own special way. The white races en-
dure with difficulty the climate of the tropics, and without help would
starve in the Australian bush and the Arctic ice fields.

Notwithstanding ali that I have said concerning reversive characters,
we yet have hardly sufficient structural grounds for separating the
races of man. Different varieties of the Caucasian race show marked
variations. Between the lowest and most brutalized laborers and the
cultivated and intelligent classes there exist anatomical differences as
great as those which separate the white and the negro. The rapid
change in the African races, remarkably shown in America in the three
generations now before us, is a more conclusive proof of inferiority, as
it indicates that they have not had time to acquire fixed characters.

Again, as to the anthropoid apes, it is evident that they have widely
diverged from man and that none represent the primitive ancestor from
which all were derived. The comparison of a human skull with that of
an adult gorilla or chimpanzee is very striking. On the one hand we
see all the structural features subordinated to the necessity of forming
a capacious receptacle for the brain; on the other, a similar subordina-
tion for producing an effective fighting apparatus—jaws, teeth, and
ridges for the insertion of powerful muscles. In one, intelligence pre-
dominates; in the other, force. The skulls of the young of all these
species show however much greater resemblances than those of adults.
This seems to indicate that there must have been a primitive common
type from which all have diverged. Savages, when ili-fed and living in
unfavorable conditions, may simulate the habits of anthropoid apes, and
this has an effect upon their physical structure, yet not on that account
should we too readily accept their close relationship.

In this summary I have purposely refrained from any discussion of
the physiological phenomena that necessarily accompany anatomical
structure. Yet these are most important. Anatomy and physiology
are inseparable, each being dependent upon the other. The results of
the erect position, of increased size of brain, of greater specialization of
limbs, are almost incaleulably great, so great that they affect the whole
life of the animal, control his habits, direct his actions in war and in the
chase, and finally mold peoples, nations, and races.

4h6 THE ASCENT OF MAN.

As Cuvier was able to deduce an animal’s habits from the shape of
his teeth, so we may speculate as to man’s past and future from an ex-
amination of his anatomy. ‘Hx pede Herculem” has not ceased to be
true. It would be impossible for me to adequately treat of all these
results in one short hour; the subject must necessarily be deferred to
another time and another place. If I have succeeded in showing you
that structural features form no insignificant part of anthropology my
object is attained.
ANTIQUITY OF MAN.*

By JoHn Evans, F. BR. 5S.

In the year 1870, | had the honor of presiding over what was then
the Department of Ethnology in the Biological Section of the British
Association at its meeting in Liverpool. Since that time 20 years have
elapsed, during the greater portion of which period the subjects in
which we are principally interested have been discussed in a depart-
ment of anthropology forming part of the organization of the Biolog-
ical Section, although since 1883 there has been a new section of the
association, that of anthropology, which has thus been placed upon
the same level as the various other sciences represented in this great
parliament of knowledge. This gradual advance in its position among
other branches of science proves, at all events, that whatever may
have been our actual increase in knowledge, anthropology has gained
and not lost in public estimation; and the interest in all that relates to
the history, physical characteristics, and progress of the human race
is even more lively and more universal than it was 20 years ago. Dur-
ing those years much study has been devoted to anthropological ques-
tions by able investigators, both in England and abroad, and there is
at the present time hardly any civilized country in the world in which
there has not been founded, under some form or another, an anthropo-
logical society, the publications of which are yearly adding a greater
or less quota to our knowledge. The subjects embraced in these studies
are too numerous and too vast for me to attempt even in a cursory man-
ner to point out in what special departments the principal advances
have been made, or to what extent views that were held as well estab-
lished 20 years ago have had either to be modified in order to place
them on a surer foundation, or have had to be absolutely abandoned.
Nor could I undertake to enumerate all the new lines of investigation
which the ingenuity of students has laid open, or the different ways in
which investigations that at first sight might appear more curious than
useful have eventually been found to have a direct bearing upon the
ordinary affairs of human life, and their results to be susceptible of

application towards the promotion of the public welfare. I may how-
ever in the short space of time to which an openiug address ought to
be confined, call your attention to one or two subjects, both theoretical
and practical, which are still under discussion by anthropologists, and
on which as yet no general agreement has been arrived at by those who
have most completely gone into the questions involved.

One of these questions is: What is the antiquity of the human race,
or rather, what is the antiquity of the earliest objects hitherto found
which can with safety be assigned to the handiwork of man? This
question is susceptible of being entirely separated from any speculations
as to the genetic descent of mankind; and even were it satisfactorily
answered to-day, new facts might to-morrow come to light that would
again throw the question entirely open. On any view of probabilities
it is in the highest degree unlikely that we shall ever discover the exact
cradle of our race, or be able to point to any object as the first product
of the industry and intelligence of man. We may however I think,
hope that from time to time fresh discoveries may be made of objects of
human art—under such circumstances and conditions that we may infer
with certainty that at some given point in the world’s history mankind
existed, and in sufficient numbers for the relics that attest this exist-
ence to show a correspondence among themselves, even when discov-
ered at remote distances from each other.

Thirty-one years ago, at the meeting of this association at Aberdeen,
when Sir Charles Lyell, in the Geological Section, called attention to
the then recent discoveries of Paleolithic implements in the valley of
the Somme, his conclusions as to their antiquity were received with dis-
trust by not a few of the geologists present. Five years afterwards, in
1864, when Sir Charles presided over the meeting of this association at
Bath, it was not without reason that he quoted the saying of the Irish
orator, that ‘‘ they who are born to affluence can not easily imagine how
long a time it takes to get the chill of poverty out of one’s bones.” Nor
was he wrong in saying that ‘* we of the living generation, when called
upon to make grants of thousands of years in order to explain the events
of what is called the modern period, shrink naturally at first from mak-
ing what seems so lavish an expenditure of past time. Throughout our
early education we have been accustomed to such strict economy in all
that relates to the chronology of the earth and its inhabitants in remote
ages, so fettered have we been by old traditional beliefs, that even when
our reason is convinced and we are persuaded that we ought to make
more liberal grants of time to the geologist, we feel how hard it is to
get the chill of poverty out of our bones.”

And yet of late years how little have we heard of any scruples in ac-
cepting as a recognized geological fact, that both on the continent of
Europe and in these islands, which were then more closely connected
with that continent, man existed during what is known as the Quater-
nary period, and was a contemporary of the mammoth and hairy rhinoc-
ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 469

eros, and of other animals, several of which are either entirely or locally
extinct. It is true that there are still some differences of opinion as to
the exact relation in time of the beds of river gravel containing the relies
of man and the Quaternary fauna to the period of great cold which is
known as the Glacial period. Some authors have regarded the gravels
as pre-Glacial, some as Glacial, and some as post-Glacial; but afterall,
this is more a question of terms than of principle. All are agreed for
instance, that in the eastern counties of England implements are found
in beds posterior to the invasion of cold conditions in that particular
region, though there may be doubts as to how much later these condi-
tions may have prevailed in other parts of this country. <All too are
agreed that since the deposit of the gravels considerable changes have
taken place in the configuration of the surface of the country, and that
the time necessary for such changes must have been very great, though
those in whose bones the chill of poverty still clings are inclined to eall
in influences by which the time required for the erosion of the river
valleys in which the gravels occur may be theoretically diminished.

On the other hand, there have been not a few who, feeling that the
evidence of the existence of the human race has now been satisfactorily

established for Quaternary times, and that there is no proof that what
has been found in the ordinary gravels belongs to anything like the first
phases of the family of man, have sought to establish his existence in
far earlier Tertiary times. In the view that earlier relics of man than
those found in the river gravels may eventually be discovered, most of
those who have devoted special attention to the subject will, I think,
coneur. But such an extension of time can only be granted on conelu-
sive evidence of its necessity, and before accepting the existence of
Tertiary man the grounds on which his family tree is based require to
be most carefully examined.

Let me say a few words as to the principal instances on which the
believer in Tertiary man relies. These may be classified under three
heads:* (1) the presumed discovery of parts of the human skeleton ;
(2) that of animal bones said to have been cut and worked by
the hand of man; and (3) that of flints thought to be artificially fash-
ioned.

On most of these I have already commented elsewhere.t Under the
first head I may mention the skull discovered by Prof. Cocchi at Olmo,
near Arezzo, with which, however, distinctly Neolithic implements were
associated ; the skeletons found at Castelnedolo, of which I need only
say that M. Sergi, who described the discovery, regarded them as the
remains of a family party who had suffered shipwreck in Pliocene

Sir Charles Lyell, who may have been buried in more recent times un-
der lava of Pliocene date. On these discoveries no superstructure can
be built. The Calaveras skull seems to have better claims to a high
antiquity. It is said to have been found at a depth of 153 feet in the
auriferous gravels of California, containing remains of mastodon, and
covered by five or six beds of lava or voleanic ashes. But here again
doubts enter into the case, as well-fashioned mortars, stone hatchets,
and even pottery are said to occur in the same deposits. Inthe same
way the discoveries of M. Ameghino at the mouth of the Plata, in the
Argentine Republic, require much further corroboration.

The presumably worked bones which I have placed in the second
category, such as those with incisions in them, from St. Prest, near
Chartres, the cut bones of Cetacea in Tuscany, the fractured bones in
our own crag deposits, and numerous other specimens of a similar
character, have, by most geologists, been regarded as bearing marks
entirely due to natural agencies. It seems more probable that in
bones deposited at the bottom of Pliocene seas cuts and marks should
have been produced by the teeth of carnivorous fish than by men who
could only have lived on the shores of the seas, and who have left behind
them no instruments by which such cuts as those on the bones could
have been produced.

As to the third category, the instruments of flint reported to have
been found in Tertiary deposits, those best known are from St. Prest
and Thenay, in the northwest of France, and Otta, in Portugal.

These three localities I have visited ; and though at the two former,
the beds in which the flints were said to have been found are certainly
Pliocene, there is considerable doubt in some cases whether the flints
have been fashioned at all, and in others where they appear to have
been wrought, whether they belong to the beds in which they are re-
ported to have been found, and have not come from the surface of the
ground. Even the suggestion that the flints of Thenay were fashioned
by the Dryopithecus, one of the precursors of man, has now been re-
tracted. At Otta the flakes that have been found present, as a rule,
only a single bulb of percussion, and having been found on the surface,
their evidence is of small value. The exact geological age of the beds
in which they have occurred is moreover somewhat doubtful. Onthe
whole, therefore, it appears to me that the present verdict as to Ter-
tiary man must be in the form ‘ Not proven.”

When we consider the vast amount of time comprised in the Tertiary
period, with its three great principal subdivisions of the Eocene, Mio-
cene, and Pliocene, and when we bear in mind that of the vertebrate
land animals, of the Eocene, no one has survived to the present time,
while of the Pliocene, but one—the hippopotamus—remains unmodified,
the chances that man as at present constituted should also be a sur-
vivor from that period seem remote; and against the species Homo
sapiens having existed in Miocene times, almost inealeulable. The a
ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 471

priori improbability of finding man unchanged, while all the other ver-
tebrate animals around him have, from natural causes, undergone
more or less extensive modification, will induce all careful investigators
to look closely at any evidence that would carry him back beyond
Quaternary times ; and though it would be unsafe to deny the possibil-
ity of such an early origin for the human race, it would be unwise to
regard it as established except on the clearest evidence.

Another question of more general interest than that of the existence
of Tertiary man is that of the origin and home of the Aryan family.
The views upon this subject have undergone important modification
during the last 20 years. The opinions based upon comparative phi-
lology alone have received a rude shock and the highlands of Central
Asia are no longeraccepted without question as the cradle of the Aryan
family, but itis suggested that their home is to be sought somewhere
in northern Hurope. While the Germans contend that the primitive
Aryans were the blue-eyed dolichocephalic race of which the Seandi-
navians and North Germans are typical examples, the French are in
favor of the view that the dark-haired brachycephalic race of Gauls,
now well represented in the Auvergne, is that of the primitive Aryans.
I am not going to enter deeply into this question, on which Canon Isaac
Taylor has recently published a comprehensive treatise, and Mr. Frank
Jevons a translation of Dr. Schrader’s much more extensive work,
“The Pre-historic Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples.” Looking at the
changes that all languages undergo, (even when they have the advan-
tage of having been reduced into the written form,) and bearing in mind
the rapidity with which these changes are effected; bearing in mind,
also, our extreme ignorance of the actual forms of language in use
among pre-historic races unacquainted with the art of writing, I, for
one, can not wonder at a something like a revolt having arisen against
the dogmatic assertions of those who have, in their efforts to re construct
early history, confined themselves simply to the comparative study of
languages and grammar. But notwithstanding any feeling of this
kind, I think that all must admire the enormous industry and the
varied critical faculties of those who have pursued these studies, and
must acknowledge that the results to which they have attained can not
lightly be set aside, and that so far as language alone is concerned,
the different families, their provinces, and mutual relations, have in the
mail become fairly established. The study of “ linguistic paleontol-
ogy,” as it has been termed will help no doubt in determining still
more accurately the affinities of the different forms of language, and in
fixing the dates at which one separated from another, as well as the
position that each should occupy on the family tree, if such a tree
exists. But even here there is danger of relying too much on negative
evidence ; and the absence—in the presumed original Aryan language—
of special words for certain objects in general use, ought not to be re-
garded as attording absolute proof that such objects were unknown at
472 ANTIQUITY OF MAN.

the time when the languages containing such words separated from the
parent stock. Not only Prof. Huxley, but Broca and others have
insisted that language as a test of race is as often as not, or even more
often than not, entirely misleading. The manner in which one form of
language flourishes at the expense of another; the various ways in
which a language spreads even otherwise than by conquest ; the fact that
different races with totally different physical characteristics are fre-
quently found speaking the same language or but slightly different
dialects of it ;-—-all conduce to show how imperfect a guide comparative
philology may be so—far as anthropological results are concerned.

Of late, pre-historic archeology has been invoked to the aid of lin-
guistic researches ; but here again there is great danger of those who
are most conversant with the one branch of knowledge being but
imperfectly acquainted with the other. The different conditions pre-
vailing in different countries, the degrees of intercourse with other
more civilized nations, and local circumstances which influence the
methods of life, all add difficulties to the laying down of any compre-
hensive scheme of archeological arrangement which shall embrace the
relics, whether sepulchral or domestic, of even so limited an area as
that of Europe. We are all naturally inclined to assume that the
record of the past is comparatively complete. But in archeology no
more than geology does this appear to be the case. The interval
between the period of the river-gravels and that of the caves, such as
Kent’s Cavern, in England, and those of the reindeer period of the
south of France, may have been but small, but our knowledge of the
transition is next to none. The gap between the Paleolithic period
and the Neolithic has, to my mind, still to be bridged over, and those
who regard the occupation of the Belgian caves as continuous from
the days of the reindeer down to late Neolithic times seem to me pos-
sessed of great powers of faith. Even the relations in time between
the kjokkenmoddings of Denmark and the remains of the Neolithic age of
that country are not as yet absolutely clear; and who can fix the exact
limits of that age? Nor has the origin and course of extension of the
more recent Bronze civilization been as yet satisfactorily determined ;
and until more is known both as to the geographical and chronological
development of this stage of culture, we can hardly hope to establish
any detailed succession in the history of the Neolithic civilization that
went before it. In the meantime it will be for the benefit of our science
that speculations as to the origin and home of the Aryan family should
be rife ; but it will still more effectually conduce to our eventual knowl-
edge of this most interesting question if it be consistently borne in
mind that they are but speculations.

Turning from theoretical to practical subjects, I may eall attention
to the vastly improved means of comparison and study that the eth-
nologists of to-day possess as compared with those of 20 years ago.
Not only have the books and periodicals that treat of ethnology multi-

*
ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 473

plied in all European languages, but the number of museums that have
been formed with the express purpose of illustrating the manners and
customs of the lower races of mankind has also largely increased. On
the Continent, the museums of Berlin, Paris, Copenhagen, and other
capitals have either been founded or greatly improved; while in Eng-
land our ethnological collections infinitely surpass, both in the number
of objects they contain and in the method of their arrangement, what
was accessible in 1870. The Blackmore Museum at Salisbury was at
that time already founded, but has since been considerbly augmented.
In London, also, the Christy collection was already in existence, and
calculated to form an admirable nucleus around which other objects
and collections might cluster; and thanks in a great degree to the
trustees of the Christy collection, and in a far greater degree to the
assiduous attention and unbounded liberality of the keeper of the de-
partment, Mr. Franks, the ethnological galleries at the British Museum
will bear comparison with any of those in the other European capitals.
The collections of pre-historic antiquities, enlarged by the addition of
the fine series of urns and other relics from British barrows explored
by Canon Greenwell, which he has generously presented to the nation,
and by other accessions, especially from the French caverns of the
Reindeer period, is now of the highest importance. Moreover, for pur-
poses of comparison the collections of antiquities of the Stone and
3ronze periods found in foreign countries is of enormous value. In
the ethnological department the collections have been materially in-
creased by the numerous travellers and missionaries which this country
is continually sending forth to assist in the exploration of the habita-
ble world; and the student of the development of human civilization
has now the actual weapons, implements, utensils, dress, and other
appliances of most of the known savage peoples ready at hand for ex-
amination, and need no longer trust to the often imperfect representa.
tions given in books of travel. But besides the collection at Bloomsbury
there is another most important museum at Oxford, which that univer-
sity owes to the liberality of General Pitt-Rivers. It is arranged in a
somewhat different manner from that in London, the main purpose
being the exhibition of the various modifications which ornaments,
weapons, and instruments in common use have undergone during the
process of development. The skillful application of the doctrine of
evolution to the forms and characters of these products of human art
gives to this collection a peculiar charm, and brings out the value of
applying scientific methods to the study of all that is connected with
human culture, even though at first sight the objects brought under
consideration may appear to be of the most trivial character. - - -

The subjects of an anthropological survey of the tribes and castes in
our Indian possessions, and of the continued investigation of the
habits, customs, and physicial characteristics of the northwestern
tribes of the Dominion of Canada, were both recommended for consid-

eration to the council of this association by the general committee at
the meeting at Newcastle. We have heard from the report of the
council what has been done in the matter. The rapidity with which
the various native tribes in different parts of the world are either mod-
ified, or in some cases exterminated, affords a strong argument for their
characteristics, both physical and mental, being investigated without
delay.

There are indeed now but few parts of the world the inhabitants of
which have not, through the enterprise of travellers, been brought
more or less completely within our knowledge. Even the center of the
dark African continent promises to become as well known as the interior
of South America, and to the distinguished traveiler who has lately
returned among us, anthropologists as well as geographers owe their
warmest thanks, It is not a little remarkable to find so large a tract
of country still inhabited by the same diminutive race of human beings
that occupied it at the dawn of European history, and whose existence
was dimly recognized by Homer and Herodotus. The story related by
the latter about the young men of the Nasamones who made an expe-
dition into the interior of Libya and were there taken captive by a race
of dwarfs receives curious corroboration from modern travellers. Hero-
dotus may indeed slightly err when he reports that the color of these
pygmies was black, and when he regards the river on which their prin-
cipal town was situated as the Nile. Stanley however who states that
there are two varieties of these pygmies, utterly dissimilar in com-
plexion, conformation of the head, and facial characteristics, was not
the first to re-discover this ancient race. Atthe end of the sixteenth cen-
tury, Andrew Battel, our countryman, who, having been taken captive
by the Portuguese, spent many years in the Congo district, gave an
account of the Matimbas, a pigmy nation of the height of boys of
twelve years old; and in later times Dr. Wolff and others have recorded
the existence of the same or similar races in Central Africa. Nor must
we forget that for a detailed account of an Acca skeleton we are
indebted to the out-going president of this association, Professor Flower.
It isnot however my business here to enter into any detailed account of
African exploration or anthropology. I have made this incidental
mention of these subjects rather from a feeling that in Africa, as well
as in Asia and America, native races are in danger of losing their
primitive characteristics, if not of partial or total extermination, and
that there also the anthropologist and naturalist must take the earliest
possible opportunities for their researches.
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.*

3y Prof. A. H. SAYCE.

In my address to the Anthropological Section of the British Asso-
ciation in 1887, I stated that in common with many other anthopologists
and comparative philologists, | had come to the conclusion that the
primitive home of the Aryans was to be sought in northeastern Europe.
The announcement excited a flutter in the newspapers, many of whose
readers had probably never heard of the Aryans before, while others
of them had the vaguest possible idea of what was meant by the name.

Unfortunately it is a name which, unless carefully defined, is likely
to mislead or confuse. It was first introduced by Prof. Max Miiller
and applied by him in a purely linguistic sense. The ‘ discovery” of
Sanskrit and the researches of the pioneers of comparative philology
had shown that a great family of speech existed, comprising Sanskrit
and Persian, Greek and Latin, Teutonic and Slav, all of them sister-
languages descended from a common parent, of which however no
literary monuments survived. In place of the defective or eumber-
some titles of Indo-German, Indo-European, and the like, which had
been suggested for it, Prof. Max Miiller proposed to eall it Aryan—a
title derived from the Sanskrit Arya, interpreted * noble” in later Sans-
krit, but used as a national name in the hymns of the Rig- Veda.

It is much to be regretted that the name has not been generally
adopted. Such is the case however, and it is to day like a soul seek-
ing a body in which to find a habitation. But the name is an excellent
one, though the philologists of Germany, who govern us in such mat-
ters, have refused to accept it in the sense proposed by its author ; and
we are therefore at liberty to discover for it a new abode and to give
to it a new scientific meaning.

In the enthusiasm kindled by the sight of the fresh world that was
opening out before them the first disciples of the science of comparative
philology believed that they had found the key to all the secrets of
man’s origin and earlier history. The parent speech of the Indo-Euro-
pean languages was entitled the Ursprache, or ‘‘ Primeval Language,”
and its analysis, it was imagined, would disclose the elements of articu-

A716 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

late speech and the process whereby they had developed into the mani-
fold languages of the present world. But this was not enough. The
students of language went even further. They claimed not only the
domain of philology as their own, but the domain of ethnology as well.
Language was confounded with race, and the relationship of tribe with
tribe, of nation with nation, was determined by the languages they spoke.
If the origin of a people was required, the question was summarily de-
cided by tracing the origin of its language. English is on the whole a
Teutonic language, and therefore the whole English people must have
a Teutonic ancestry. The dark-skinned Bengali speaks languages akin
to our own; therefore the blood which runs in his veins must be derived
from the same source as that which runs in ours.

The dreams of universal conquest indulged in by a young science soon
pass away as facts accumulate, and the limit of its powers is more and
more strictly determined. The Ursprache has become a language of
comparatively late date in the history of linguistic development, which
differed from Sanskrit or Greek only in the fuller inflexional character.
The light its analysis was believed to cast on the origin of speech has
proved to be the light of a will-o’-the-wisp, leading astray and pervert-
ing the energies of those who might have done more profitable work.
The mechanism of primitive language often lies more clearly revealed
in a modern Bushman’s dialect or the grammar of Esquimaux than in
that much-vaunted Ursprache from which such great things were once
expected by the philosophy of human speech.

Ethnology has avenged the invasion of its territory by linguistic
science, and has in turn claimed a province which is not its own. It is
no longer the comparative philologist, but the ethnologist, who now and
again uses philological terms in an ethnological sense, or settles racial
affinities by an appeal to language. The philologist first talked about
an *“ Indo-European race ;” such an expression could now be heard only
from the lips of a youthful ethnologist.

As soon as the discovery was made that the Indo-European languages
were derived from a common mother, scholars began to ask where that
common mother-tongue was spoken. Butit was agreed on all hands that
this musthave beensomewherein Asia. Theology and history alike had
taught that mankind came from the East and from the East accordingly
the Ursprache musthavecometoo. Hitherto Hebrew had been generally
regarded as the original Janguage of humanity; now that the Indo-Eu-
ropean Ursprache had deprived Hebrew of its place of honor, it was
natural, if not inevitable, that like Hebrew, it should be accounted of
Asiatic origin. Moreover it was the discovery of Sanskrit that had led
to the discovery of the Ursprache. Had it not been for Sanskrit, with
its copious grammat, its early literature, and the light which it threw
on the forms of Greek and Latin speech, comparative philology might
never have been born, Sanskrit was the magician’s wand which had
called the new science into existence, and without the help of Sanskrit
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS. rar

the philologist would not have advanced beyond the speculations and
guesses of classical scholars. What wonder then if the language which
had thus been a key to the mysteries of Greek and Latin, and which
seemed to embody older forms of speech than they, should have
been assumed to stand nearer to the Ursprache than the cognate lan-
guages of Europe? The assumption was aided by the extravagant age
assigned to the monuments of Sanskrit literature. The poems of Ho-
mer might be old, but the hymns of the Veda, it was alleged, mounted
back to a primeval antiquity, while the Institutes of Manu represented
the oldest code of laws existing in the world.

There was yet another reason which contributed to the belief that
Sanskrit was the first-born of the Indo-European family. The founders
of comparative philology had been preceded in their analytic work by
the ancient grammarians of India. It was from Panini and his prede-
cessors that the followers of Bopp inherited their doctrine of roots and
suffixes and their analysis of Indo-European words. The language of
the Veda had been analyzed 2,000 years ago as no other single language
had ever been analyzed before or since. Its very sounds had been care-
tully probed and distinguished, and an alphabet of extraordinary com-
pleteness had been devised to represent them. It appeared as if the
elements out of which the Sanskrit vocabulary and grammar had grown
had been laid bare in a way that was possible in no other language, and
in studying Sanskrit accordingly the scholars of Europe seemed to feel
themselves near to the very beginnings of speech.

But it was soon perceived that if the primitive home of the Indo-
European languages were Asia, they themselves ought to exhibit evi-
dences of the fact. There are certain objects and certain phenomena
which are peculiar to Asia, or at all events are not to be found in Europe,
and words expressive of these ought to be met with in the scattered
branches of the Indo-European family. Ifthe parent language had been
spoken in India, the climate in which they were born must have left its
mark upon the face of its offspring.

But here a grave difficulty presented itself. Men have short memo-
ries, and the name of an object which ceases to come before the senses
is either forgotten or transferred to something else. The tiger may
have been known to the speakers of the parent language, but the words
that denoted it would have dropped out of the vocabulary of the derived
languages which were spoken in Europe. The same word which signi-
fies an oak in Greek signifies a beech in Latin. We can not expect to
to find the European languages employing words with meanings which
recall objects met with only in Asia.

How then are we to force the closed lips of our Indo-European lan-
guages, and compel them to reveal the secret of their birth-place? At-
tempts have been made to answer this question in two different ways,

On the one hand it has been assumed that the absence in a particular
language, or group of languages, of a term which seems to have been
478 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

possessed by the parent speech, is evidence that the object denoted by
it was unknown to the speakers. But the assumption is contradicted
by experience. Because the Latin equus has been replaced by caballus
in the modern Romanie languages, we can not conclude that the horse
was unknown in Western Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire.
The native Basque word for a ‘‘ knife,” haistoa, has been found by Prince
L.-L. Bonaparte in a single obscure village; elsewhere it has been re-
placed by terms borrowed from French or Spanish. Yet we can not
suppose that the Basques were unacquainted with instruments for cut-
ting until they had been furnished with them by their French and
Spanish neighbors. Greek and Latin have different words for “fire;”
we can not argue from this that the knowledge of fire was ever lost
among any of the speakers of the Indo-European tongues. In short,
we can not infer from the absence of a word in any particular language
that the word never existed in it; on the contrary, when a language is
known to us only in its literary form it is safe to say that it must have
employed many words besides those contained in its dictionary.

A good illustration of the imposibility of arriving at-.any certain re-
sults as long as we confine our attention to words which appear in one
but not in another of two cognate languages is afforded by the Indo-
European words which denote a sheet of water. There is no word
of which it can be positively said that it is found alike in the
Asiatic and the European branches of the family. Lake, ocean, even
river and stream, go by different names. A doubt hangs over the word
for *‘sea;” it is possible, but only possible, that the Sanskrit pdathas is
the same word as the Greek zévtos, the etymology of which is not yet
settled. Nevertheless, we know that the speakers of the parent lan-
guage must have been acquainted, if not with the sea, at all events
with large rivers. Naus, ‘a ship,” is the common heritage of Sanskrit
and Greek, and must thus go back to the days when the speakers of the
dialects which atterwards developed into Sanskrit and Greek still lived
side by side. It survives, like a fossil in the rocks, to assure us that
they were a water-faring people, and that the want of a common Indo-
European word for Jake or river is no proof that such a word may not
have once existed.

The example I have just given illustrates the second way in which
the attempt has been made to solve the riddle of the Indo-European
birthplace. It is the only way in which the attempt can succeed.
Where precisely the same word, with the same meaning, exists in both
the Asiatic and the Kuropean members of the Indo-European family—
always supposing, of course, that it has not been borrowed by either
of them—we may conclude that it also existed in the parent speech.
When we find the Sanskrit aswas and the Latin equus, the exact pho-
netic equivalents of one another, both alike signifying “horse,” we are
justified in believing that the horse was known in the country from
which both languages derived their ancestry. Though the argument
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS. 479
from a negative proves little or nothing, the argument from agreement
proves a great deal.

The comparative philologist has by means of it succeeded in sketching
in outline the state of culture possessed by the speakers of the parent
language, and the objects which were known tothem. They inhabited
a cold country. Their seasons were three in number, perhaps four, and
not two, as would have been the case had they lived south of the tein-
perate zone. They were nomad herdsmen, dwelling in hovels, similar,
it may be, to the low round huts of sticks and straw built by the
Kabyles on the mountain-slopes of Algeria. Such hovels could be
erected in a few hours, and left again as the cattle moved into higher
ground, with the approach of spring, or descended into the valleys
when the winter advanced. The art of grinding corn seems to have
been unknown, and crushed spelt was eaten instead of bread. A rude
sort of agriculture was however already practiced; and the skins
worn by the community, with which to protect themselves against the
rigors of the climate, were sewn together by means of needles of
bone. It is even possible that the art of spinning had already been
invented, though the art of weaving does not appear to have advanced
beyond that of plaiting reeds and withies. The community still lived
in the stone age. Their tools and weapons were made of stone or
bone, and if they made use of gold or meteoric iron, it was of the
unwrought pieces picked up from the ground and employed as orna-
ments; of the working of metals they were entirely ignorant. As
among savage tribes generally, the various degrees of relationship
were minutely distinguished and named, even the wife of a husband’s
brother receiving a special title ; but they could count at least as faras a
hundred. They believed in a multitude of ghosts and goblins, making
offerings to the dead, and seeing in the bright sky a potent deity. The
birch, the pine, and the withy were known to them; so also were the
bear and wolf, the hare, the mouse, and the snake, as well as the goose
and raven, the quail and the owl. Cattle, sheep, goats, and swine
were all kept; the dog had been domesticated, and in all probability
also the horse, Last, but not least, boats were navigated by means of
oars, the boats themselves being possibly the hollowed trunks of trees,

This account of the primitive community is necessarily imperfect.
There must have been many words, like that for “river,” which were
once possessed by the parent speech, but afterwards iost in either the
Eastern or Western branches of the family. Such words the comparative
philologist has now no means of discovering. He must accordingly pass
them over along with the objects or ideas which they represent. The
picture he can give us of the speakers of the primeval Indo-European
Janguage can only be approximately complete. Moreover it is always
open to correction. Some of the words we now believe to have been
part of the originai stock carried away by the derived dialects of Asia
and Kurope may hereafter turn out to have been borrowed by one of
A480 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

these dialects from another, and not to have been a heritage common to
both. Itis often very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with
borrowed words or not. If a word has been borrowed by a language
before the phonetic changes had set in which have given the language
its peculiar complexion, or while they were in the course of progress, it
will undergo the same alteration as native words containing the same
sounds. The phonetic changes which have marked off the High German
dialects from their sister tongues do not seem to go back beyond the
fall of the Roman Empire, and words borrowed from Latin before that
date will accordingly have submitted to the same phonetic changes as
words of native origin. Indeed, when once a word is borrowed by one
language from another and has passed into common use it soon becomes
naturalized and is assimilated in form and pronunciation to the words
among which it has come to dwell. A curious example of this is to be
found in certain Latin words which made their way into the Gaelic
dialects in the fourth or fifth century. We often find a Gaelic ¢ corre-
sponding to a Welsh p, both being derived from a labialized guttural
or qu, and the habit was accordingly formed of regarding a c as the
natural and necessary representative of a foreign p. When therefore
words likethe Latin pascha and purpura were introduced by Christianity
into the Gaelic branch of the Keltic family they assumed the form of
caisg and corcur.

It is clear that such borrowings can only take place where the speakers
of two different languages have been brought into contact with one
another. Before the age of commercial intercourse between Europe and
India we can not suppose that European words could have been bor-
rowed by Sanskrit or Persian, or Sanskrit and Persian words by the
European languages. But the case is quite otherwise if instead of
comparing together the vocabularies of the Eastern and Western
members of the Indo-European stock we wish to compare only Western
with Western or Eastern with Eastern. There our difficulties begin,
and we must look to history, or botany, or zodlogy for aid. From a
purely philological point of view the English hemp,the old high German
hanf, the old Norse hanpr, and the Latin cannabis might all be derived
from acommon source, and point to the fact that hemp was known to
the first speakers of the Indo-European languages in northwestern
Europe. But the botanists tell us that this could not have been the
case. Hemp is a product of the East which did not originally grow in
Germany, and consequently both the plant itself and the name by which
it was called must have come from abroad. So again, the lion bears a
similar name in Greek and Latin, in German, in Slavonic, and in Keltic.
But the only part of Europe in which the lion existed at a time when the
speakers of an Indo-European language could have become acquainted
with it were the mountains of Thrace, and it must accordingly have
been from Greek that its name spread to the other cognate languages
of the West.
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS. 481

It has been needful to enter into these details before we can approach
the question, What was the original home of the parent Indo-Euro-
pean language? They have been too often ignored or forgotten by
those who have set themselves to answer the question, and to this cause
must be ascribed the larger part cf the misunderstandings and false
conclusions to which the inquiry has given birth.

Until a few years ago, I shared the old belief that the parent speech
had its home in Asia, probably on the slopes of the Hindu Kush. The
fact that the languages of Europe and Asia alike possessed the same
words for ‘ winter” and “ice” and ‘‘ snow,” and that the only two trees
whose names were preserved by both—the “birch” and the “ pine”—
were inhabitants of a cold region, proved that this home did not lie in
the tropics. But the uplands of the Hindu Kush, or the barren steppes
in the neighborhood of the Caspian Sea, or even the valleys of Siberia,
would answer to the requirements presented by such words. Taken by
themselves they were fully compatible with the view that the first
speakers of the Indo-European tongues were an Asiatic people.

But when I came to ask myself what were the grounds for holding
this view, | could find none that seemed to me satisfactory. There is
much justice in Dr. Latham’s remark that it is unreasonable to derive
the majority of the Indo-Europear languages from a continent to which
only two members of the group are known to belong, unless there is
an imperative necessity for doing so. These languages have grown out
of dialects once existing within the parent speech itself; and it cer-
tainly appears more probable that two of such dialects or languages
should have made their way into a new world, across the bleak plains
of Tartary, than that seven or eight should have done so. The argu-
ment, it is true, is not a strong one, but it raises at the outset a pre-
sumption in favor of Kurope. Before the dialects had developed into
languages their speakers could not have lived far apart; there is in
fact evidence of this in the case of Sanskrit and Persian; and a more
widely spread primitive conimunity is implied by the numerous lan-
guages of Kurope than by the two languages of Asia. A widley spread
community however is less likely to wander far from its original seat
than a community of less extent, more especially when it is a commun-
ity of herdsnien and the tract to be traversed is long and barren,

Apart from the general prejudice in favor of an Asiatic origin due to
old theological teaching and the effect of the discovery of Sanskrit, I
ean find only two arguments which have been supposed to be of suffi-
cient weight to determine the choice of Asia rather than of Europe as
the cradle of Indo-European speech. The first of these arguments is
linguistic, the second is historical or rather quasi-historical. On the
one hand it has been laid down by eminent philologists that the less one
of the derived languages has deflected from the parent speech, the more
likely it is to be geographically nearer to its earliest home. The faith-
fulness of the record is a test of geographical proximity. As Sanskrit

482 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

was held to be the most primitive of the Indo-Kuropean languages, to
reflect most clearly the features of the parent speech, the conclusion was
drawn that that parent speech had been spoken at no great distance
from the country in which the hymns of the Rig- Veda were first com-
posed. The conclusion was supported by the second argument drawn
from the sacred books of Parsaism. Inthe Vendidad the migrations of
the Iranians were traced back through the suecessive creations of
Ormazd to Airyanem Vaéjo, “the Aryan Power,” which Lassen loeal-
ized near the sources of the Oxus and Jaxartes. But Bréal and De
Harlez have shown that the legends of the Vendidad, in their present
form, are late and untrustworthy—later, in fact, than tie Christian era ;*
and even if we could attach any historical value to them, they would
tell us only from whence the Iranians believed their own ancestors to
have come, and would throw no light on the cradle of the Indo-Euro-
pean languages as a whole. The first argument is one which I think
no student of language would any longer employ. As Professor Max
Miiller has said, it would suffice to prove that the Scandinavians emi-
grated from Iceland. But to those who would still urge it, I must re-
peat what I have saidelsewhere. Although in many respects Sanskrit
has preserved more faithfully than the European languages the forms
of primitive Indo-European grammar, in many other respects the con-
verse is the case. In the latest researches into the history of Indo-
European grammar, Greek holds the place once occupied by Sanskrit.
The belief that Sanskrit was the elder sister of the family led to the
assumption that the three short vowels 4, 6, and 6 have all originated
from an earlier 4 I was, I believe, the first to protest against this
assumption in 1874, and to give reasons for thinking that the single
monotonous & of Sanskrit resulted from the coalescence of three dis-
tinct vowels. The analogy of other languages goes to show that the
tendency of time is to reduce the number of vocalic sounds possessed
by a language, not the contrary. In place of the numerous vowels
possessed by ancient Greek, modern Greek can now show only five, and
cultivated English is rapidly merging its vowel sounds into the so-
called “neutral” 9. Since my protest the matter has been worked out
by Italian, German, and French scholars, and we now know that it is
the vocalic system of the Huropean languages rather than of Sanskrit
which most faithfully represents the oldest form of Indo-European
speech. The result of the discovery, for discovery it must be called,
has been a complete revolution in the study of Indo-European etymol-
ogy, and still more of Indo-European grammar, and whereas ten years
ago if was Sanskrit which was invoked to explain Greek, it is to Greek
that the “new school” now turns to explain Sanskrit. The comparative
philologist necessarily cannot do without the help of both; the greater

the number of languages he has to compare the sounder will be his
inductions; but the primacy which was once supposed to reside in Asia
has been taken from her. It is Greek, and not Sanskrit, which has
taught us what was the primitive vowel of the reduplicated syllable of
the perfect and the augment of the aorist, and has thus narrowed the
discussion into the origin of both.

Until quite recently however the advocates of the Asiatic home of
the Indo-European languages found a support in the position of the
Armenian language. Armenian stands midway, as it were, between
Persia and Europe, and it was imagined to have very close relations
with the old language of Persia. But we now know that its Persian
affinities are illusory, and that it must really be grouped with the lan-
guages of Kurope. What is more, the decipherment of the cuneiform
inscriptions of Van has cast a strong light on the date of its introduce-
tion into Armenia. These inscriptions are the records of kings whose
capital was at Van, and who marched their armies in all directions dur-
ing the ninth, eighth, and seventh centuries before our era. The latest
date that can as yet be assigned to any of them is B. c. 640. At this
time there were still no speakers of an Indo-European language in Ar-
menia. The language of the inscriptions has no connection with those
of the Indo-European family, and the personal and local names occur-
ring in the countries immediately surrounding the dominions of the Van-
nic kings, and so abundantly mentioned in their texts, are of the same
linguistic character as the Vannic names themselves.

The evidence of classical writers fully bears out the conclusions to be
derived from the decipherment of the Vannic inscriptions. Herodotus
(vit. 73) tells us that the Armenians were colonists from Phrygia, the
Phrygians themselves having been a Thrakian tribe which had migrated
into Asia. The same testimony was borne by Eudoxos,* who further
averred that the Armenian and Phrygian languages resembled one
another. The tradition must have been recent in the time of Herodotus,
and we shall probably not go far wrong if we assign the occupation of
Armenia by the Phrygian tribes to the age of upheavalin Western Asia
which was ushered in by the fall of the Assyrian Empire. Professor
Fick has shown that the scanty fragments of the Phrygian language that
have survived to us belong to the European branch of the Indo-European
family, and thus find their place by the side of Armenian,

Instead therefore of forming a bridge between Orient and Occident,
Armenian represents the furthermost flow of Indo-European speech
from West to East. And this flow belongs to a relatively late period.
Apart from Armenian we can discover no traces of Indo European
occupation between Media and the Halys until the days when Iranian
Ossetes settled in the Caucasus and the mountaineers of Kurdistan
adopted Iranian dialects. I must re-iterate here what I have said many
years ago: if there is one fact which the Assyrian monuments make

*According to Eustathios (in Dion, v. 694).
484 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

clear and indubitable, it is that up to the closing days of the Assyrian
monarchy no Indo-European languages were spoken in the vast tract of
civilized country which lay between Kurdistanand Western Asia Minor.
South of the Caucasus they were unknown until the irruption of the
Phrygians into Armenia. Among the multitudinous names of persons
and localities belonging to this region which are recorded in the Assy-
rian inscriptions during a space of several centuries there is only one
which bears upon it the Indo-European stamp. This is the name of the
leader of the Kimmerians, a nomad tribe from the northeast which de-
scended upon the frontiers of Assyria in the reign of Esor-haddon,
and was driven by him into Asia Minor. The fact is made the more
striking by the further fact that as soon as we clear the Kurdish ranges
and enter Median territory, names of Indo-European origin meet us
thick and fast. Wecan draw but one conclusion from these facts.
Whether the Indo European lan guages of Europe migrated from Asia,
or whether the converse were the case, the lineof march must have been
northward of the Caspian, through the inhospitable steppes of Tartary
and over the snow-covered heights of the Ural Mountains.

An ingenious argument has lately been put forward, which at first
sight seems to tell in favor of the Asiatic origia of Indo-European
speech. Dr. Penka has drawn attention to the fact that several of the
European languages agree in possessing the same word for * eel,” and
that whereas the eel abounds in the rivers and lakes of Scandinavia, it
is unknown in those cold regions of Western Asia where, as we have
seen, it has been proposed to place the cradle of the Indo-European
family. But it isa curious fact that in Greek and Latin, and apparently
also in Lithuanian, the word for ‘ eel” is a diminutive derived from a
word which denotes a snake or snake like creature. This, it has been
urged, may be interpreted to mean that the primeval habitat of the Indo.
European languages was one where the snake was known, but the eel
was net. The argument however cannot be pressed. We all agree
that the first speakers of the Indo European languages lived on the land,
not on the water, and that they were herdsman rather than fishermen.
Naturally therefore they would become acquainted with the snake be-
fore they became acquainted with the eel, however much it might abound
in the rivers near them, and its resemblance to the snake would lend to
it its name. In Keltic the eel is called a “ water-snake,” and to this
day a prejudice against eating it on the ground that is a snake exists in
Keltic districts. All we can infer from the diminutives anguilla, 2yyéhus
is that the Italians and Greeks in the first instance gave the name to
the fresh-water eel, and not to the huge conger.

I can not now enter fully into the reasons which have led me grad-
ually to give up my old beliefin the Asiatic origin of the Indo-Kuropean
tongues, and to subscribe to the views of those who would reter them
to a northern European birth-place. The argument is a complicated
one, and is necessarily of a cumulative character. The individual links
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS. 485

in the chain may not be strong, but collectively they afford that amount
of probability which is all that we can hope to attain in historical re-
search. Those who wish to study them may do so in Dr. Penka’s work
on the “ Herkunft der Arier,” published in 1886. His hypothesis that
southern Scandinavia was the primitive “ Aryan home” seems to me to
have more in its favor than any other hypothesis on the subject which has
as yet been put forward. It needs verification, it is true, but if it is
sound the verification will not be longin coming. A more profound ex-
amination of Teutonic and Keltic mythology, a more exact knowledge
of the words in the several Indo-European languages which are not
of Indo-European orgin, and the progress of archzeological discovery,
will furnish the verification we need.

Meanwhile it must be allowed that the hypothesis has the counte-
nance of history. Scandinavia, even before the sixth century, was char-
acterized as the * manufactory of nations; ”* and the voyages and set-
tlements of the Norse Vikings offer a historical illustration of what the
pre-historic migrations and settlements of the speakers of the Indo-
European languages must have been. They diifered from the latter
only in being conducted by sea, whereas the pre-historic migrations
followed the valleys of the great rivers. It was not until the age of the
Roman Empire that the northern nations became acquainted with the
sailing-boat; our English sail is the Latin sagulum, ‘the little cloak of
the soldier,” borrowed by the Teutons along with its name, and used to
propel their boats in imitation of the sails of the Roman vessels. The
introduction of the sail allowed the inhabitants of the Seandinavian
“hive” to push boldly out to sea, and ushered in the era of Saxon
pirates and Danish invasion.

Dr. Penka’s arguments are partly anthropological, partly arche-
ological. He shows that the Kelts and Teutons of Roman antiquity
were the tall, blue-eyed, fair-haired, dolicho-cephalic race which is now
being fast absorbed in Keltic lands by the older inhabitants of them.
The typical Frenchman of to-day has but little in common with the
typical Gaul of the age of Cesar. The typical Gaul was, in fact, as
much a conqueror in Gallia as he was in Galatia, or as modern
researches have shown, as the typical Kelt was in Ireland. It seems
to have been the same in Greece. Here too the golden-haired hero of
art and song was a representative of the ruling class, of that military
aristocracy which overthrew the early culture of the Peloponnese, and
cf whom tradition averred that it had come from the bleak North.
Little trace of it now remains: it is rarely that the traveler can dis-
cover any longer the modern kinsfolk of the golden-haired Apollo or
the blue-eyed Athéné.

If we would still find the ancient blonde race of Northern Europe in

gat yuasi officina ventium aut cerfe velut vagina nationum sue Jordanes De Getarum
> D> ,
sive Gothorum origine, ed. Closs, Cu:
486 THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS.

population is still that of the broad shouldered, long-headed blondes
who served as models for the Dying Gladiator. And it is in southern
Scandinavia alone that the pre-historic tumuli and burying-grounds
yield hardly any other skeletons than those of the same tall dolicho-
cephalic race which still inhabits the country. Elsewhere such skele-
tons are either wanting or else mixed with the remains of other races.
It is therefore reasonable to conclude that it was from southern Sean-
dinavia that those bands of hardy warriors originally emerged, who
made their way southward and westward and even eastward, the Kelts
of Galatia penetrating like the Phrygians before them into the heart
of Asia Minor. The Norse migrations in later times were even more
extensive, and what the Norse Vikings were able to achieve could
have been achieved by their ancestors centuries before.

Now the Kelts and Teutons of the Roman age spoke Indo-European
languages. It is more probable that the subject populations should
have been compelled to learn the language of their conquerors than
that the conquerors should have taken the trouble to learn the language
of their serfs. We know at any rate that it was so in Ireland. Here
the old “Ivernian” population adopted the language of the small band
of Keltic invaders that settled in its midst. It is only where the con-
quered possess a higher civilization than the conquerors, above all,
where they have a literature and an organized form of religion, that
Franks will adapt their tongues to Latin speech, or Manchus learn to
speak Chinese. Moreover in southern Scandinavia where we have
archeological evidence that the tall blonde race was scarcely at any
time in close contact with other races, it is hardly possible for it to have
borrowed its language from some other people. The Indo-European
languages still spoken in the country must, it would seem, be descended
from languages spoken there from the earliest period to which the evi-
dence of human occupation reaches back. The conelusion is obvious:
Southern Scandinavia and the adjacent districts must be the first home
and starting-point of the Western branch of the Indo-European family.

If we turn to the Kastern branch, we find that the farther east we go
the fainter become the traces of the tall blonde race and the greater is
the resemblance between the speakers of Indo-European languages and
the native tribes. In the highlands of Persia, tall, long-headed blondes
with blue eyes can still be met with, but as we approach the hot plains
of India the type grows rarer and rarer until it ceases altogether. An
Indo-European dialect must be spoken in India by a dark-skinned peo-
ple before it can endure to the third and fourth generation. As we
leave the frontiers of Europe behind us we lose sight of the race with
which Dr. Penka’s arguments would tend to connect the parent speech
of the Indo-European family.

I can not now follow him in the interesting comparison he draws be-
tween the social condition of the southern Scandinavians as disclosed
by the contents of the prehistoric “kitchen maidens,” and the social
THE PRIMITIVE HOME OF THE ARYANS. A87

condition of the speakers of the Indo-European parent speech according
to the sobered estimate of recent linguistic research. ‘The resemblance
is certainly very striking, though, on the other hand, it can not be denied
that archeological science is still in its infancy, and that Dr. Penka too
often assumes that a word common to the European languages belonged
to the parent speech, an assumption which will not, of course, be ad-
mitted by his opponents.

What more nearly concerns us here however is the name we should
give to the race or people who spoke the parent language. We can not
call them Indo-Europeans; that would lead to endless ambiguities, while
the term itself has already been appropriated in a linguistic sense. Dr.
Penka has called them Aryans, and I can see no better title with which
to endow them. The name is short; it has already been used in an
ethnological as well as in a linguistic sense, and since our German
friends have rejected it in its linguistic application it is open to
every one to confine it to a purely ethnological meaning. I know that
the author has protested against such an application of the term; but
it is not the first time that a father has been robbed of his offspring,
and he can not object to the robbery when itis committed in the cause
of science. For some time past the name of Aryan has been without a
definition, while the first speakers of the Indo-European parent speech
have been vainly demanding a name; and the priests of anthropology
cannot do better than to lead them to the font of science and there
baptize them with the name of Aryan.
THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY.*

By Canon ISAAc TAYLOR.

Nowhere in the world is there such a mixture of races—such a collu-
vies gentium—as in Italy.

At the beginning of the historic period we find Siculi and Sieani in
the south, Etruscans in the north, and in the center Umbrians, Latins,
Sabines, and Samnites, all speaking Aryan languages. Ata very early
time the Carthaginians made good their footing in the west of Sicily,
and the Greeks established colonies in the east. Southern Italy became
Magna Grecia—so that the greater Greece lay beyond the Adriatic,
just as the greater Britain now lies beyond the Atlantic. The Greeks
pushed their trading posts as far as Cum in the Bay of Naples, and
the Phoenicians established theirs at Ciere, 20 miles from Rome.

In the fourth century B. c. the Gauls poured over the Alps into the
plain of the Po, establishing a Gallia Cisalpina in the north answering
to the Magna Grecia in the south.

And then, when the Roman legions had conquered Italy and the
Kastern World, Rome herself was overrun by the peoples she had sub-
dued. Rome became an oriental city. The Orontes, asa Roman writer
complained, had emptied itselfinto the Tiber. A flood of Syrians, Jews,
Greeks, Kgyptians, Africans, Spaniards, Gauls, and Dacians—slaves,
freedmen, or adventurers—poured into the Eternal City, making it a
cloaca maxima—the universal sewer of the world. Then came the inroads
of the northern hordes—Heruls, Goths, Vandals, Huns, and Lombards
—who rushed in to appropriate the treasures which during four centu-
ries had been plundered from Africa and Asia. Next came the inroads
of Normans, Moors, Spaniards, French, and Germans, and lastly, the
peaceable invasion of winter residents.

These are the races which, in historic times, have been added to the
pre-historic peoples of the land.

At the beginning of the historic period we find the Etruseans estab-
lished north of the Tiber, the Latins and other tribes speaking Aryan
languages further to the south, and an earlier aboriginal population in
the Apennines and Calabria.

In books written only 30 years ago the oldest civilization of Italy
is attributed to a mysterious people, who are called the Pelasgi. We

“From The Contemporary Review, August, 1890, vol. LVuI, pp. 261-270.

490 THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY.

hear of these Pelasgi in Greece as well as in Italy. Those megalithic
structures which still excite our wonder—the walls of Mycene and
Tiryns, as well as those of Cortona and Russella—are called Pelasgie.
Cre and Cortona are said to have been Pelasgic cities prior to the
Etruscan conquest. We must therefore begin by asking who were
these Pelasgi. The modern doctrine, it is hardly needful to say, is that
the word has no ethnological significance, the name Pelasgic being
merely equivalent to ‘ ancient” or “ aboriginal.” The term was a term
of ignorance, like the word “natives” now applied to Polynesians,
Patagonians, Red Indians, or Maoris. We may therefore leave the
Pelasgians out of account; or rather, try and find out what races were
grouped together by ancient writers under this convenient but delusive
appellation.

What we may call “ the ethnological horizon” has wonderfully widened
of late years. For vast periods, for many millenniums, we are able to
trace the history of man in Europe. He is now proved to have been
the contemporary of the great extinct carnivora and pachyderms, and
to have followed northward the retreating ice sheet of the last glacial
epoch. The history of these primeval races has been traced by the
tools and weapons which they have left, and by the shape and charac-
ter of their skulls.

Archologists have distinguished the successive ages of stone, bronze,
and iron. The bronze age in Italy is believed to have commenced
some 4,000 years ago. The stone age, which preceded it, is divided
into two epochs, the Paleolithic age, or age of chipped flints, and the
Neolithic age, when the flint implements were ground or polished. The
Paleolithic people were utter savages, clad in skins, living in caves or
rock shelters, making use of no fixed sepulchers, subsisting on shell
fish or the products of the chase, ignorant of pottery, without bows
and arrows, and armed merely with spears, tipped with flint, horn, or
bone.

Skulls which are believed to be of Paleolithic age have been found
in various parts of Italy—at Olmo, at Isola del Liri, at Mentone, and
in some Sicilian caves. They are all dolichocephalic, or long skulls.
Owing to the presence in their refuse heaps of human bones which
seem to have been broken in order to extract the marrow, it is believed
that these people occasionally practised cannibalism. But their chief
food seems to have consisted of wild horses of a small breed, which
then roamed over Europe in immense herds. Enormous refuse heaps,
consisting mainly of the bones of horses, have been found outside the
caves which were inhabited by this race. In the caves at the foot of
Monte Pellegrino, near Palermo, the floor is formed by a magma of the
bones of wild horses, which were either stalked with spears, driven by
the hunters into pit-falls, or chased over the cliffs. Similar deposits
have been found at the cave of Thiiyngen, in Switzerland, and.in front
of the rock shelter at Solutré, near Macon, where there is a vast de-
THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY. 491

posit, the relics of the feasts of these savages, nearly 10 feet in thick-
ness and more than 300 feet in length, composed entirely of the bones
of horses, and comprising the remains of from 20,000 to 40,000 indi-
viduals.

The Palzolithice period must have lasted for unnumbered millenniums.
Archeologists conjecture that it came to an end some 20,000 years ago,
when it was succeeded by the Neolithic period, which may have lasted
for some 16,000 years. At the beginning of the Neolithic age, when
regular sepulchers were first used, we tind savages, who may probably
be the descendants of the Paleolithic people, spread over western
Kurope. They were clad in skins, stitched together with bone needles.
They wore bracelets of shells, and painted or tattooed their bodies with
red oxide of iron. bBroca considers that this early race is allied to the
North African tribes, their language probably belonging to the Hamitic
class, without inflexions and almost without grammar.

To us the chief interest of these people lies in the fact that their
descendants may probably be traced in the present inhabitants of
Sardinia and of southern Italy, as well as in some parts of the British
Islands and of Spain. They are usually called the Iberian race. In
the early Neolithic period we find skulls of the Iberian type all over
western Europe, in Caithness, Yorkshire, Wales, and Somerset, in the
south of France, in Spain and Italy. This race was swarthy, with olive
complexion and black curly hair; it was orthognathous, leptorhinie,
and highly dolichocephalic, with a low orbital index, and short stature,
averaging about 5 feet 4 inches. Their present descendants are found
in Donegal, Galway, and Kerry, in some of the Hebrides, in Denbigh-
shire, and in the counties bordering on Wales. ‘They are also to be
recognized among the Spanish Basques, the Berbers, the Kabyles, the
Guanches of Teneriffe, the Corsicans, the Sardinians, the Sicilians,
and the people of southern Italy. Pausanius informs us that the Sar-
dinians were Libyans, or what we should now call Berbers. Seneca
says that Corsica was peopled by Iberians and Ligurians. Thucydides
and Ephoros also inform us that the oldest inhabitants of Sicily were
Iberians.

There are several pre-historic skulls of this race in the Kincherian
Museum at Rome, and the Falerian skull in the Villa Papa Giulio
belongs to the same type. These skulls are orthognathous and dolicho-
cephalic, resembling the modern Sardinian skull and ancient Iberian
skulls found in caves at Gibraltar and in Sicily.

This ancient type is still predominant in southern Italy, Sicily, Sar-
dinia, and Corsica. Professor Calori, of Modena, has measured more
than 2,400 skulls in different provinces of Italy. In southern Italy only
36 per cent. are round-headed, with a cephalic index* above 80; whereas

* The cephalic index gives the proportion of the breadth of the head to the length,
and is obtained by dividing the breadth by the length from front to back, and then
multiplying by 100.
492 THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY.

in northern Italy the proportion is 87 per cent. In northern Italy
less than 1 per cent. are of the extreme Sardinian type, with the index
below 74; while in southern Italy 17 per cent. belong to this type.
The difference of race, as Shown by the difference in the shape of the
skull, may account to some extent for the difference in the existing vivi-
lization in the north and south of the peninsula.

Early in the Neolithic age, before the reindeer had withdrawn from
Belgium, another race makes its appearance in Europe. They were a
round-headed people of short stature, with a mean cephalic index of
about 84. We first find their remains in the sepulchral caves of Belgium
and central France, whence they extended to Savoy and to the Rhe-
tian and Maritime Alps. They manufactured rude pottery; their wea-
pons were axes of flint, carefully chipped and roughly polished, and
spears tipped with bone or horn. The skullis of the same shape as that
of the Lapps, whom they'resembled in their short stature. Their original
speech is probably represented by the Basque, and a few of their words
may be preserved in mountain names of the Alpine region, such as
Cima, ‘a hill,” which is seen in the name of Cimiez near Nice, of the
Cima de Jazi, and of the Cevennes. They are designated as the Auvy-
ergnat, Rheetian, or Ligurian race.

In the early Neolithic period we find in Italy only these two races,
the dolichocephalic, or long-headed, Iberian race, who are physically
allied to the North African tribes, and the brachycephalic, or round-
headed, Ligurian race, allied to the Lappsand Finns. These two races
inhabited the same caves, together or in succession. Thus in a Neo-
lithic cave at Monte Tignoso, near Livorno, two skulls were found, one
of the Iberian type, with an index less than 71, and another of the Ligu-
rian type, with an index of 92. In another Neolithic cave, called the
Caverna della Matta, an Iberian skull was found with an index of 68,
and a Ligurian skull with an index of 84. No anthropologist would
admit that these skulls could have belonged to men of the same race.

We now come to the third Italian race, which may be called the
Umbrian or Latin race. They spoke an Aryan language, and must
be regarded as the ancestors of the Romans. They made their
appearance in Europe at a much later time, probably not more than
6,000 or 7,000 years ago. They were taller and more powerful than
either of the earlier races, and were orthocephalic, with an index of from
79 to 81. When we first meet with them, they are no longer mere
savages, living solely by the chase, but are a pastoral people, who had
domesticated the dog, the ox, and the sheep, and who had invented the
canoe, and even the ox-wagon, in which they followed their herds over
central Europe. They no longer, like the two earlier races, sheltered
themselves in caves, but lived in huts made of boughs plastered with
clay, and in winter in pit dwellings roofed with poles and twigs.

We can trace this race all over Central Europe. We find their re-
mains in the round barrows of Britain, but more especially in the pile
THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY. 493

dwellings which they erected in the lakes of Germany, Switzerland,
and northern Italy.

From southern Germany they spread to western Switzerland, where
we find the remains of their settlements in the lakes of Constance,
Neufchatel, Bienne, and Geneva. These Swiss settlements began in
the stone age, but were in many cases continuously inhabited from the
age of stone through the age of bronze, coming down, in a few cases,
to the age of iron. We can trace these people advancing gradually in
civilization, at first subsisting mainly on the chase of the stag and tlie
wild boar, afterwards, as these beasts became scarce, depending more
and more on their domesticated animals, the ox and the sheep, and
gradually taming the goat, the pig, andthe horse. At first we find them
without cereals, and evidently ignorant of the rudest agriculture, lay-
ing up in earthen pipkins stores of acorns, hazel-nuts, and water-chest-
nuts; and then, after a time, growing barley, wheat, and flax, learning
to spin and weave, to tan leather, and even to make boots. They are
identified with the Helvetii, a Celtic people.

This race gradually extended itself to Italy, crossing the Alpine
barrier either through Carniola or by one of the western passes, and
occupying by degrees Venetia, Lombardy, and the Emilia, and finally,
the whole valley of the Po.

When they first appear in Italy they were still in the stone age, and
had domesticated the ox, but were ignorant of agriculture. Now the
bronze age is believed to have begun in Italy not later than 1900 B. ¢.,
and therefore this Umbro Latin Aryan race must have entered Italy
considerably more than two thousand years before the commencement
of our era.

On arriving in Italy they built pile dwellings in the North Italian
lakes, similar to the pile dwellings of Switzerland and southern Ger-
many, and disclosing much the same stage of civilization. We cannot
doubt that they belonged to the same race, and this is confirmed by the
close connection between Celtic and Italic speech.

In Italy, as well as in Switzerland, the pile dwellings began in the
age of stone and lasted down into the age of bronze. Many of the
small lakes have been converted into peat-bogs, and in digging out the
peat the remains of these settlements have been disclosed.

One of the settlements has been discovered in a peat moor at Mer-
curago, near Arona. This moor was formerly a shallow lake, in which
a pile dwelling was built by some of the earliest settlers of the Umbro-
Latin race. They had no knowledge of agriculture, but fed on hazel-
nuts and wild cherries. They had rude pottery, and polished flint im-
plements. A dug-out canoe, adisk of walnut wood, which had evidently
formed the wheel of an ox-cart, and one bronze pin were found, showing
that the settlement was not finally abandoned till the age of bronze had
commenced. ‘

Farther north, in the Lake of Varese, there are seven villages built

.
494 THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY.

on piles, two of them large, with numerous huts, which might almost
be called towns. One of these towns belongs entirely to the stone age,
exhibiting no trace of metal, but with remains of the stag, ox, goat, and
pig. The other was founded in the stone age, but survived into the
age of bronze, a pin, a fish-hook, and two spear-heads, all of bronze,
having been found.

Another large pile dwelling in the Lago de Garda, opposite Peschiera,
was founded in the stone age, and was in continuous occupation through
the age of copper to the age of bronze.

Perhaps the most instructive of these lake settlements is the pile
dwelling in the Lake of Fimon, near Vicenza. It must have been
founded very soon «after the Umbrians first reached Italy, and was
destroyed before they had passed from the pastoral to the agricultural
stage of civilization. There are two successive relic-beds, separated by
an interval, which shows that the earlier town was burned, and then,
after a time, re-built. In the oldest bed there is no trace of agriculture,
even of the rudest kind. The inhabitants lived chiefly by the chase,
but had domesticated the ox and the sheep. The bones of the stag and
the wild boar are extremely numerous, and these animals evidently
formed the chief food of the people, the bones of the ox and the sheep
being rare. There is no grain, and no cereals of any kind, but great
stores of hazel-nuts have been found, together with water-chestnuts
(Trapa natans), wild cherries, and stores of acorns. The acorns were
roasted for food, as is proved by fragments adhering to earthen pipkins.
Flint tools and rude pottery are found, but no trace of metal. The
settlement was burned, and after a time re-built. The newer relic-bed
contains numerous flint chips, and one bronze ax, showing that the
age of metal had commenced. But the notable fact is, that at the time
of this new settlement the people had passed from the hunting to the
pastoral stage. Wild animals had row become scarce, bones of the
stag are absent, and those of the wild boar are rare, but those of the ox
and the sheep have become common. The agricultural stage had not
however been reached when this second settlement was destroyed, the
only farinaceous food being hazel-nuts, cornel, cherries, and acorns.
The dwellings were round huts, built of wattle, and plastered with clay.
The remains of a canoe have been found.

We learn therefore that when the Umbro-Latin people reached Italy
they were ignorant of metals and of agriculture, living mainly by the
chase, and on wild fruits, nuts, and acorns,

After the lakes at the foot of the Alps had been occupied, the popu-
lation increased, and gradually extended itself southward, building
pile dwellings in the marshes in the neighborhood of Mantua. The
race next crossed the Po, erecting on dry land in the plain of the Emilia
similar villages of pile dwellings, the remains of which are very numer-
ous, and go by the name of terre mare. These terre mare, or “ marl
beds,” are small knolls or elevations, rising a few feet above the plain,
THE: PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY. 495

and are most numerous in the provinces of Parma, Reggio, and Modena.
They consist of beds of brownish or dark-colored earth, rich in phos-
phates and nitrates, and which are now used by the peasants for
manuring their fields. They are plainly the refuse heaps or middens
of ancient villages, which were pile dwellings erected on dry land.
They vary from an acre to 3 or 4 acres in extent, and usually rise some
10 feet above the plain, resembling the Arab villages in Heyvpt, each
standing on its fell, raised above the inundation. These knolls are
composed solely of the refuse of habitation, of the bones of animals,
and of broken pottery thrown out from the huts, which were built on
platforms resting on piles. The lower strata of rubbish belong to the
age of stone, while in many cases the upper strata belong to the age of
bronze. They must have been occupied for many centuries, to allow
of such vast accumulations of refuse. They were protected by a square
earthen mound or rampart, surmounted by palisades, like a New
Zealand pah.

These terre mare, of which nearly a hundred are known, disclose
clearly the civilization of the first Aryan settlersin Italy, the ancestors
of the Latin race. They made mats from the bark of the clematis; they
knew how to prepare and to weave flax; they even obtained amber
beads from the Baltic, but they possessed no swords, fibula, or rings.
They had neither iron, gold, silver, nor glass. Bronze was cast, but
not forged. We find strainers for preparing honey, and hand-mills or
querns for grinding grain, but there is no sign of bread having been
baked. The vine was cultivated, but the art of making wine had not
been discovered. No idols of any kind have been found. Certain
earthenware crescents, supposed at one time to have been symbols used
for lunar worship, prove to be neck-rests, used tor sleeping on the
ground, so as to avoid disturbing the elaborate coiffure. The dwellings
were merely huts of wattle and dab, no stone or mortar having been
used in their construction, The people hunted the stag, the roe, and
the wild boar, and kept dogs, oxen, sheep, goats, and pigs. They had
no fowls. The ass was unknown, and it is doubtful whether they had
tamed the horse. They had dishes perforated with holes, which were
probably used for making cheese, but no fish-bones or fish-hooks have
been found. They grew wheat, beans, and flax, and gathered wild
apples, sloes, and cherries. Acorns were carefully preserved in jars for
winter use.

These peaceful people must have inhabited the plain of the Po for at
least a thousand years, probably for a much longer time, two or even
three thousand years. ‘They had advanced to the bronze age, and must
be regarded as the ancestors of the Latins and the other Aryan tribes
of Italy.

At some period in the bronze age they were suddenly overwhelmed
by the invasion of the Etruscans, a fierce and savage race which broke
in on them from the north. All their settlements were destroyed—-not
496 THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY.

one survived to the iron age, which probably commenced in Italy in the
ninth or tenth century B. c. On other grounds it is believed that the
Etrusean invasion was not later than the eleventh century B. c. We
learn from Varro that the Etruscan era began 291 years before the
Roman. The Roman era began in 753 B. C., and therefore the Etruscan
era dates from 1044 8.0. Butitis not likely that the Etruscan era began
before the conquerors had settled down into an organized state—duo-
decim populi Etrurie, or confederation of the twelve Etruscan tribes.
We may therefore, with some probability, place the Etruscan invasion
of Italy in the twelfth century B.c. It may not improbably be con-
nected with the great movement of races about this period, which began
with the conquest of Syria by the Hittites, and of Egypt by the Hyksos,
and ended with the Thessalian and Dorian invasions of Greece, and
that consequent emigration of the older Greek tribes to Asia Minor which
lies at the base of the Homerie Epos. It is possible that the Etruscans
may themselves have been an Asiatic people, akin to the Kheta and the
Hyksos. This supposition derives support from the similarity in the
appearance of the Hittites and the Etruscans as portrayed on their
respective monuments, from the old tradition which connects the Etrus-
cans with Asia Minor, and also from the recent discovery in Lemnos of
inscriptions believed to be in a language of the Etruscan type.

After overwhelming the Umbrian settlements in the valley of the Po,
the Etruscans extended their dominion across the Apennines to the
Arno and the Tiber. It seems probable that the foundation of Rome
was due tothe Umbro-Latin fugitives, who placed the Tiber as a barrier
between themselves and the invaders, establishing themselves on the
Palatine, as their Etruscan foes did at Veii, 11 miles north of Rome.
Just as the foundation of Venice is attributed to the fugitives from the
invasion of Attila and the Huns,so the foundation of Rome may be due
to fugitives from the invasion of the Etruscans. This is supported by
the fact that the terra mare and the palafitte, which are believed to
constitute the primitive settlements of the Umbro-Latin Aryan race, are
not found south of the Apennines beyond the Emilia and the valley of
the Po. The Etruscan dominion and civilization endured for some 709
years. At length it fell before the invasion of the Gauls in 400 B. ¢.,
just as the Umbrian civilization had fallen before the inroad of the
Etruscan hordes. And thus Etruria Cireumpadana, the former Umbrian
land, became cisalpine Gaul, its possession reverting to a people who
in race and language were nearly akin to its former inhabitants,

The settlements of the Gauls are recognized by the torques and the
long iron swords which are found in their graves. At Bologna, in the
cemeteries of the Certosa and Marzabotto, we have the tombs of the
three successive races, Umbrians, Etruscans, and Gauls, all different in
character, and easily to be distinguished.

Thus it appears that the fertile plain of the Pe was oceupied by many
successive races, whose descendants may, with greater or less certainty,
THE PRE-HISTORIC RACES OF ITALY. 497

be recognized in the present population of Italy. We have first the
Paleolithic Iberian savages, mere hunters and probably cannibals, liv-
ing in caves, ignorant of pottery, whose descendants may be traced in
Sardinia and Southern Italy. They were followed, in the early Neo-
lithic period, by the Ligurians, possessed of pottery, but without domes-
tic animals. Their descendants now occupy the Rhetian and Maritime
Alps. They were succeeded towards the close of the Neolithic age by
the Umbro-Latin race, who lived in huts and pile dwellings instead of
caves, who possessed oxen and sheep, canoes and wagons, and who
gradually acquired a knowledge of bronze. In the bronze age, some-
time before the middle of the eleventh century B. C., they were over-
whelmed by the Etruscan inroad, their villages were destroyed, and
they fled southward from the invaders. Then, at the close of the fifth
century B. C., the Etruscan dominion was destroyed by the Boii and
other Gaulisb tribes, who were in the iron stage of civilization. Finally
came the conquest of the Romans, and afterwards those of the Heruls,
Goths, Huns, and Lombards.

The people who lived in the pile dwellings in the valley of the Po,
and who are usually called Umbrians, were clearly of the same race as
the ancient Romans. The skull is of the same shape, the type of civili-
zation was the same, and Latin and Umbrian were merely dialects of
the same language.

Owing to the practice of cremation genuine Roman skulls are rare,
and of skulls ostensibly Roman many turn out to be those of freedmen
or provincials. But, judging from the few we possess, the shape of
the head was almost identical with that of the Umbrians, of the Swiss
lacustrine pecple, and of the Celtic round barrow race of Britain. The
great breadth of the Roman skull is well seen in the portrait busts of
Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Titus, and Marcus Aurelius.

That the Romans were originally in the same pastoral stage of civil-
ization as the Umbrians is shown by the fact that the words for money
and property, pecunia and peculium, are derived from pecus, cattle ;
while the ox, which appears on some early Roman coins, may indicate
the fact that the ox was the standard of pecuniary value. The hut
urns found in the ancient cemetery of Alba Longa show that the Latins
at first lived in huts like those of the Umbrians. The a@des Veste in
the Forum, the most venerable relic of early Rome, was originally a
hut of wickerwork and straw, and so was the casa Romuli on the Pala-
tine.

The population of Italy has now become so mixed that in many prov-
inces it is difficult to detect and separate the original elements. But the
Sardinians and the peasants of Southern Italy still display the primi-
tive Iberian type, and the Greek type survives on the sites of some of
the old Greek colonies. For instance, at Naxos and Syracuse about
24 per cent. of the people have blue eyes, while at Palermo, which was
never a Greek city, the proportion is less than 1 per cent. In some

parts of Lombardy Teutonic village names are numerous, and Teutonic
names, of Gothic or Lombard origin, are common among the nobility.
Filiberto, Humberto, and Garibaldi are genuine Teutonic names; so
also is that of the Italian seaman, Amerigo Vespucci, who bore the
Gothic and Lombardic name of Amaric, which he has given to the New
World.

It is curious that America, the continent which has become the pat-
rimony shared nearly equally by the Teutonic and Latin races, should
itself bear a Teutonic name, whose Latinized form bears indisputable
witness to the Teutonic conquest of the oldest seat of the Latin race
in Italy.
THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.*
BY OSCAR MONTELIUS.

It is generally admitted that bronze was known and made use of in
Egypt from the earliest times of the ancient empire, about 6,000 years
ago:t but authors do not agree so well in respect to iron. The major-
ity affirm that this metal was also known in the valley of the Nile at
an epoch not less remote. Very strong reasons however appear to
me to demonstrate that it was in the second millenium before the
Christian era, that the use of iron possessed in Hgypt an importance
that authorizes us to speak of an age of iron in that country. The
greater part of the time, then, that embraces Egyptian civilization
should be considered as an age of bronze.

Assuredly to the majority of persons this conclusion will appear un-
expected, if not absurd. Egyptian civilization, in fact, during the period
mentioned was eminent to a degree that can scarcely be believed pos-
sible without an acquaintance with iron. But we must not forget that
the Aztecs in Mexico, with their civilization largely developed, were
still living in a pure age of bronze on the first arrival of Europeans.
The most important and almost note-worthy reason that has been
cited to establish the age of iron in Egypt several thousand years be-
fore the Christian era is that at this remote epoch massive edifices
were already erected there in wrought stone, and that this stone is so
hard that it can be cut only with implements of iron, or rather of steel,
The celebrated German Egyptologist, Mr. Lepsius, affirms: “Great
masses of carved granite, certain specimens of which are met with from
the fourth dynasty of Manéthon, do not permit us to question that iron
was known at that era.”+ On the other hand it has been established by

special experiments that metal instruments are not required in order to
carve a stone as hard as that of Egyptian edifices. Stone implements
may be employed, although in this manner the work progresses very
slowly, and requires a great deal of patience.*

But the Egyptians had had cecasion to exercise patience, and every
work can be accelerated by a multiplication of the forces put in opera-
tion. The Kgyptian kings in their enterprises of construction were not
accustomed to spare their laborers. Moreover it must be noted that
Kgyptian granite is so hard that our best steel instruments are soon
ruined when one attempts to work with them. The fine figures which
are foundon Egyptian monuments, and especially the hieroglyphies, may
rather be designated as engraved than carved. ‘It is in no wise im-
probable,” says the English antiquarian, Mr. Wilkinson, who interested
himself very much in the ancient Egyptains, “that they were famil-
iar with the use of emory at the time when that substance, which is
met with in the islands of Archipelago, was accessible to them; and
if this be admitted we can explain the perfection and admirable deli-
cacy of the hieroglyphics upon the monuments of granite and basalt.
We then also comprehend why implements of bronze will be preferred
to those of stecl, which are harder and denser; for it is evident that
emery powder will be incrusted upon the former and that its action on
stone becomes greater in proportion to the quantity fixed on the sharp
edge of the chisel; in our times, with the same view, we prefer soft iron
tools to those of hard steel.”

It is probable that sand—or emery, if they really possessed it—was
used in the sawing of stone. Wecan thus more easily explain why
verdigris has been sometimes observed in the quarries upon places
where fragments of the rock have been detached by much sawing.t

The proof that bronze implements were employed by Egyptians for
stone work is given by a Grecian author, Agatharchides, who lived
about a hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ. He relates
that in his time bronze tools had been found in the gold mines in Egypt
which had formerly been used by the mining laborers. He explains
the utilization of bronze very correctly in stating that iron was entirely
unknown at the time when the first operations in mining were begun.t

Upon the monuments in the time of the ancient empire we sometimes
see representations of men who are carving stone by the instrumentality
of chisels, whose yellow or reddish-brown color shows that they were
of bronze.§

THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT. 5OL

At Thebes, in the midst of the waste from the carving of stones,
Wilkinson found a large bronze chisel which evidently had been for-
gotten by the citizens thousands of years ago.* This chisel, 22 centi-
meters in length, presents at the upper extremity very clear marks of
blows from a hammer, but the edge is so intact that it appears new.
It would soon have been destroyed if workmen little accustomed to
such implements had endeavored to cut with it a stone similar to that
which it shaped in other days.

That the Egyptians, by means of their bronze implements, could
have been able to produce what they have made, undoubtedly does not
depend, as has been supposed, upon the fact that they were in pos-
session of the secret talent, hid for so long a time, of tempering bronze,
but only that they had the skill acquired by long practice of using
their utensils, a skill that we no longer possess, being accustomed to
other instruments. It can not be denied that the manner in which the
stones of Egyptian monuments are cut, presents a great analogy with
the fabrication of pre historic tools of stone and the sockets of their
handles. Even lately it was supposed that these tools and their sockets
could not have been fabricated without the aid of steel instruments.
This view was sustained until experiments had placed beyond all dis-
pute the fact that by using stone, bone, or wood solely, such tools
could be made and perforated, provided that the necessary skill and
time were bestowed on this work.

Imposing edifices of hard stone, richly adorned with reliefs, may be
constructed without iron. Proof of this is furnished by Mexico and
Central America, which are rich in monuments of this kind anterior to
Columbus and to the introduction of iron into those countries by Euro-
peans. One cannot therefore rely upon the fact that the construction
and embellishment of the stately edifices of the ancient empire are
impossible without steel, to maintain that the age of iron commenced
in Egypt at that distant period.

We must then fix the epoch of the introduction of the age of iron
into Egypt by the same method which has so well sueceeded in other
countries. This problem attracted too late the attention of the Egypt-
ologists. The greater portion of the discoveries that are pertinent to
this question were not therefore investigated as they should have been.
It will be seen presently however that the documents are numerous
and clear, and that the paintings especially instruct us with very great
exactitude.

It is necessary to examine the facts by grouping them under four
heads:

(1) What are the objects in iron discovered in Egypt which date from
the most remote era, and of what character are they?

*Wilkinson: ‘‘ Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, vol. 1,” pp. 249,
252, and 253.
502 THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT,

(2) What are the most ancient inscriptions in which iron is mentioned?
Can we be fully enlightened through them in respect to the signification
of the hieroglyphies which are supposed to designate iron?

(3) "What are the most antique monuments representing arms and
instruments of iron?

(4) Up to what epoch did they continue in Egypt to employ arms and
instruments of bronze? Can we perceive upon these objects marks left
as a consequence of long usage, whether in the reparation of the sharp
edges, or otherwise, proving that they were used, and that they were
not fabricated solely for the tomb?

To the first interrogatory it is easy to respond: Fragments of iron
instruments have been found in a few pyramids; and if they date from
the time of these mausoleums they fully establish the great antiquity
of iron in Egypt. The best known of these fragments is the one dis-
covered by an Englishman, Mr. Hill, in 1837, in the great pyramid at
Gizeh, built about 3,000 years before Christ. It is supposed that it was
a fragment of an instrument with which the surface of hewn stone was
polished, but it is also believed that it is not of steel, but of iron. It
may have been discovered near the orifice of one of the narrow atmos-
pherie canals which traverse the body of the pyramid as far as the mor-
tuary cavern, and in articulation of the stones, but not until after the
two layers of exterior blocks forming the cap of the pyramid has been
removed. No fissure was observed or aperture of any description,
through which this iron after the construction of the pyramid might
have been introduced at the point where it was found. For this reason
several persons, having explored this locality immediately after the dis-
covery, have publicly attested their conviction that the fragment of iron
had been left between the stones during the construction of the pyra-
mid, and that it could not have been inserted there after this period.*

Similar discoveries have been made more recently. Thus M.Maspero,
in 1882, collected several parts of iron hoes in the black pyramid at
Aboukir, probably built during the sixth dynasty; that is to say, in the
third millenium before the Christian era. He discovered, moreover, a
few fragments of iron instruments in the mortar between two stones,
in a pyramid in the vicinity of Esneh.t This pyramid is not anterior to
the seventeenth dynasty, and its construction consequently immediately
preceded the inauguration of the New Empire. Mr. Maspero, as I be-
lieve, has given no information more precise in regard to the situation
and the bearing of these fragments of iron.

Reasons that we are about to assign authorize us to doubt the con-
clusions which have been drawn from these discoveries. The presence
of these iron fragments is certain; but are we equally assured that they
date from the erection of the monuments that contained them? The

the International Congress of Orientalists, held in London, 1874, pp. 396-399.

points at which they have been met with—have they not been accessi-
ble to man from time to time during the thousands of years that have
followed the construction ?*

Can it be affirmed that the layers of stone under which they were
lying were intact, and that the blocks had never been displaced and
afterwards restored to their place? In our days these blocks have been
removed without any harm being done to the solidity of the edifice.
The circumstances of the bearings do not extinguish ail possibility of
their introduction at an epoch more or less late, and it does not seem
that we are justified in drawing from these discoveries the conclusion
that iron was already known and employed by the Egyptians 3,000
years B. c.t One has so much the less the right to an opposite con-
clusion, as we are about to see, from all that is known elsewhere con-
cerning the epoch when iron was used, not only in Egypt, but even in
other countries.

Lepsius, who supposes that iron was in use in Egypt from the fourth
century,t is obliged to avow that in Egyptian tombs, until now, few
objects in iron have been found, and that these objects are some of an
uncertain era, others recent. This declaration of one of the most emi-
nent scholars in Egyptian antiquity was made, it is true, 12 years ago,
but, more recently, in the special circle of Egyptologists doubts have
been manifested concerning the antiquity of iron in Egypt. §

Incontestable proofs of the existence of iron before the epoch of the
new empire, that is to say, before the middle of the second millenium,
B. C., have not been produced. Having maintained as evident that
the Egyptians were in possession of iron at an epoch far more remote,
they have meanwhile tried to explain the absence of this metal in the
most ancient Necropolises and Mausoleums by invoking a religious
prejudice.

Iron was regarded as the bone of Typhon, the enemy of Osiris, and
for this reason considered impure; one could not make use of it even
for the most ordinary requirements of life without polluting his soul
in a way that would cause him harm both on earth and in the other
world. Meanwhile, Mr. Maspero, one of the most eminent Egyptolo-
gists, has demonstrated that this explanation is not satisfactory, for

* Vyse says (‘‘ Pyramids of Gizeh,” 1, p. 4) that the mouth of the atmospheric canal
in question is found partly enlarged before he began his labors there.

tThe scruples I have expressed in respect to the discovery of iron in the great
pyramid are not now presented for the first time ; compare the work of Rhind, pub-
lished in 1862, Thebes, its Tombs and their Tenants, p. 227.

${ Lepsius, Les Metaux, p. 54.

§ In the official guide, printed in 1879, for the use of the visitors to the British
Museum (4 Guide to the Egyptian Rooms, p. 40) we read: ‘It is doubtful if the use
of iron was known at avery remote period.” In the same way people expressed
themselves later, in 1884. See Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great
Britain and Ireland, session of March 25, 1884. Compare, also, Perrot and Chipiez,
Histoire dev Art, etc., vol. I (printed 1882), pp. 753, 754, and 830.
5OA THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.

he says (p. 295), ‘‘The religious impurity of an object has never sufficed
to prevent the use of such object. To cite but a single example,
pork also was dedicated to Typhon and considered impure; they were
bred however in droves, and the number of these animals was con-
siderable enough, at least in certain cantons, to allow the good Herod-
itus to relate that they were let loose in the fields after the harvests in
order to press down the earth and bury the grain. Besides, in Egypt
each individual object was not exclusively pure or impure, but some-
times one, Sometimes another, according to circumstances. It is thus
that the boar and the sow, despite their Typhonian character, were
the animals of Isis, and consequently share the Osirien purity. Iron,
which certain traditions call the bone of Typhon, is commonly called
“‘ bonipit,” the substance of heaven; it is hence pure in certain aspects,
and impure in certain others.”

Religious scruples had not placed any obstacle to the employment of
iron in Kgypt at the epoch when this useful metal was really known,
for divers iron instruments have been found in contemporaneous
tombs. Many of these objects have been deposited in the museum of
the Louvre; they are all probably posterior to the fifteenth century B. C.
and very near to that date. The most ancient—if we do not consider
the fragments already mentioned which come from the pyramids—
that are known in Egypt, and the age of which can be established, is
a curved blade resembling a reaping hook, which Belzoni one day put
under one of the Sphinxes at Karnak, but the age of this blade does
not go beyond the seventh century B. c.* Maspero, who supposes the
use of iron in Egypt to be very ancient, has endeavored in twoinstances
to find an explanation of the rarity of this metal. He thinks, in the
first place, that iron utensils which could not be employed have been re-
melted. But this does not explain to us the reason why in Egyptian
museums objects in iron are more rare than objects in bronze. The re-
casting of bronzes out of use was at least practiced as much.

In the second place, Mr. Maspero, and with him many others, have
desired to explain the absence of iron by arguing its destruction by rust.
But it is necessary to recall that Egyptian tombs are so dry that here,
less than anywhere else, could iron have been corroded by oxidation.
Besides, rust has not the consuming activity which is sometimes
believed. A great deal of time is required to accomplish its work of
destruction; and in point of fact this rust could not entirely disappear.

* Day: Prehistoric Use of Ironand Steel, p. 14. Compare Journal of the Anthropolog-
ical Institute,, March 25, 1883. The authenticity of this discovery is questioned by
Rhind ( Thebes, p. 228). Aniron chisel was found under an obelisk at Karnak, which
should date from the eighteenth dynasty (Arcelin, in the Materiaux, 1869, p. 377),
but the determination of the age of the chisel is perhaps questionable. If it were
even correct, the discovery nevertheless is posterior to the beginning of the New
Empire.
THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT. 505

In the tombs the rusted object, or the trace of the rust upon neighbor-
ing objects, would have been discovered.*

Now never in my knowledge has a vestige of iron been found more
or less rusted, never even has the stain of rust been found in the tombs
prior to the fifteenth century B. c.

This is all the more important as among the discoveries of the first
millenium B. C. both in Egypt and elsewhere, numerous iron objects,
among which are several well preserved, have been met with (Rhind,
Thebes, p. 218). Now, if an object made of iron can be preserved almost
intact during two or three thousand years, there is no reason why this
object should have disappeared without leaving any trace if it had
remained a little longer in the earth and under identical conditions.

Inasmuch as to-day almost all the hieroglyphic inseriptions ean be
read without difficulty, it might be supposed that it was easy to respond
to the second inquiry above made and specify the group of characters
that constitute the name of iron. Now, erudite men differ in this par-
ticular; with one it is such a term, with a second another.

It does not appertain to me, who am notan Kgyptologist, to examine
if the various and contradictory opinions do not proceed from the fact
that some have imagined they discovered the word “iron” in inserip-
tions of an epoch when this metal was as yet unknown.

I do not know, further, if the group of hieroglyphies which is reputed
to signify the term iron on a recent occasion referred to has the same
signification in the inscriptions of the New Empire. It does not suftice
that the word exists; it is necessary to prove also that this term at a
remote period did not signify anything else; and for example, that
there was instead of the meaning iron the meaning bronze or some
other metal in general.

A striking example of such a change of signification is the following:
In India in the early era of the Vedas ayas, designated bronze, and then,
after the introduction of iron it was applied to the new metal. The
Latin has preserved the primitive sense of the word as. The problem
is very essentially cleared up if recourse be had to another catagory of
instruction: this is our third standpoint.

Among the mural paintings, so numerous and so often admirably
preserved, there are a great many arms and modelled instruments, the
greater part red or yellow, the rest blue. Surely one will not deny
that the red and the yellow represents copper and bronze and the blue
iron or steel.

In a tomb comparatively modern, that of Rameses III, some arms are
red, others blue. RKhind (Thebes, p. 221) has erroneously drawn from

*Lepsius: Les métauxz,pp. 52 and following. He says (p. 63) that the iron has not
yet been found represented under his name. Perrot and Chipiez: Histoire de Vart,

Demotisches Worterbuch, vol. Vv, p. 418, and following.
506 THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.

this the conclusion that colors are without signification. This fact
demonstrates only that at that epoch some arms of bronze and others of
iron were employed, although the latter metal had then been long
known.

When we examine attentively the paintings of ancient times we ob-
serve that arms and tools are painted there red or yellow, never blue.
Lepsius, who believes in the antiquity of iron in Kgypt, is nevertheless
very much surprised at the fact (p. 57) that red or light brown is em-
ployed in the re-production of axes, arrow barbs, pruning hooks, saws,
chisels razors, and butcher knives.

It is in the paintings of the new empire alone that metallic objects
are painted blue. This can be naturally explained. Bronze, until
towards the fifteenth century B. C., was employed only for the fabrica-
tion of arms and instruments; iron was not as yet in use. Let us ex-
amine, finally, the last aspect of the question. The absence of objects
made of iron in the mortuary furniture of the ancient era could have
no signification or importance if those of bronze were equally wanting.
But it is not thus. Bronzes are met with abundantly in the tombs.

We can now, thanks to the latter, approach the fourth of our queries.
Among the most remarkable discoveries of bronzes anterior to the
new empire, or contemporaneous with the early centuries of that era,
we may cite that of Drah-aboul-Neggah, to the north of Thebes. In
1860, some Arabs exhumed from the sand a coffin, that of Queen A’hho-
tep. This queen had been married to Kamos, a king of the seventeenth
dynasty, and perhaps the mother of King Ahinos I, or of his consort
Nofirtari. King Ahinos was the first of the eighteenth dynasty. A’h-
hotep, consequently was living more than 1,500 years B. c. Her coffin
contained a large number of precious objects and arms, with which the
museum of Boulais enriched and which we are about to describe.*
There was gold, silver, bronze, but no trace of iron.

Arms and bronze instruments were in use at a later period and con-
currently with those of iron. This is proven by numerous bronzes in
the Boulaq Museum and the European museums which bear the name
of Thoutmos III. This king of the eighteenth dynasty lived during the
first half of the seventeenth century B. c. If one has carefully read the
group of hieroglyphies which it is assumed constitutes the term iron,
they were acquainted with that metal at that epoch. There are also
bronzes which bear the name of Queen Hatschopsitu, the sister and
coregent of Thoutmos III. The inscriptions that bear these names are
engraved or written with ink on the bronze itself or on the wooden
handles of the tools (Figs. 29 and 39). It is proper to note that on sev-

*The discovery is described by Mariette in Notice des principaux monuments du
musée Vantiquités égyptiennes @ Boulag. (Second edition, Alexandria, 1868, pp. 257-
267), and by Maspero in his Guide du visiteur aw Musée de Boulaqg, Paris, 1834, pp.
77-83 and 320. Compare Perrot and Chipiez, Histoire de V Art vol. 1, p. 297, and
Erman, -Egyptien, p. 612. The discovery is represented in the Revue de V Architecture,
1860.
THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT. 507

eral of these objects the same inscription is seen, with insignificant
changes “ The gracious God Ra-men-Kheper (prenomen of Thoutmos
III), the beloved of Ammon, when the cord was stretched at Amen-
saraku.” It is supposed that it relates to the foundation of a “ pylon”
which Thoutmos caused to be built at Karnak.*

The fact that upon so many objects we meet with the name of this
king would indicate that this name is of frequent occurrence in Egyp-
tian inscriptions. This however may be the effect of accident which
on a single day exposed an exceptional number of these objects; thus
in a tomb at Thebes were discovered several baskets filled with instru-
ments of this character.

It has been supposed that the arms and tools exhumed from the
tombs had been specially fabricated of bronze to be employed at cere-
monies either solemn—for example, the foundation of a “ pylone,” as
we have just seen—or funereal.i

The bronze from the considerations of religious orders would have
continued to be utilized long after industry might have manufactured
arms Ofiron and tools for ordinary use. But this supposition is contra-
dicted. Sinee a great number of these bronzes bear evident marks of
long use, they were not fabricated, consequently in order simply to be
deposited in the tombs.§ At the close of the second millenium B. Cc.
arms of bronze were not yet entirely replaced by iron arms. The
mural paintings in the tomb of King Ramses III at Thebes, which date
from the twelfth century, prove this; here a great quantity of arms may
be seen, the major part blue, the remainder red. Lance-barbs and
swords with two edges are sometimes red, at others blue.||

The arms represented in this tomb were those which were used in war
at the time of Ramses III. It cannot therefore be assumed that the
red arms were of bronze, because they were especially fabricated for
the tomb. They are painted red because bronze arms were then in

§ The celebrated Swedish Egyptologist, M. Piehl, whose attention I called to the
importance of this question before one of his visits to Egypt, had the kindness to
write me that a considerable number of arms and bronze instruments, preserved in-
the Boulaq museum, had evidently been long in use, as is demonstrated by the fact
that they were used and re-sharpened again and again.

508 THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.

general use. It is very important to establish that bronze arms were
common in the second century, and even that they were ina majority at
this moment, which is already an iron age. Such would not have been
the case if (as many authors suppose) iron had been known and
employed in this country for thousands of years. This is an obser-
vation of which the value will be apprehended. If iron had been in
the service of industry from the early dynasties it would not be found
so rare still towards the second century. Everywhere else it is agreed
that when iron appears, bronze is not long in yielding place to it for
the fabrication of swords, axes, knives, ete. The experience acquired
everywhere on this subject does not permit us to doubt that it would
not have been otherwise on Egyptian soil, or that bronze, in despite of
the presence of iron, would have remained so long alone or almost ex-
clusively utilized.

It seems to result from the discoveries of Schliemann at Mycene and
Tiryns, and which belong to the close of the second millenium B. c.,
that iron was not known in Egypt as early as has been asserted.
Amongst so many objects of every variety which have been collected
in the tombs of Mycene, there is no trace of iron, whilst hundreds of
swords and other arms are of bronze. In the royal palace at Tiryns
there is no iron or trace of iron.*

Now, the antiquities of these two cities testify to a powerful influence
from Egypt, undoubtedly exercised through the agency of the Pheeni-
cians, and it would then be scarcely possible that iron should have been
completely unknown in Greece, if for two thousand years it had already
been known in Egypt.

From what we have just said it follows with great probability that
the Kgyptians, during the whole time of the ancient empire, and prob-
ably until almost fifteen hundred years B. C., were not acquainted with
the use of iron, and employed only bronze for their arms and instru-
ments; that the age of bronze consequently continued in Egypt until
the epoch mentioned, and that iron, as yet, towards the close of the
second millenium B. 6., had not altogether replaced bronze for the con-
struction of arms and edged instruments.

The most remarkable discovery in Egypt of bronze arms is, as we
have already said, that which was made in the coffin of Queen A’bhotep.
Among the great quantity of precious things which this tomb contained

e first mentioned were the following objects, which constitated a part
of the toilet of that princess: Several gold bracelets, ornamented with
precious stones and plates of glass, rings for the legs of gold, a golden
chain, a diade Suh a large collar and a decoration for the breast of gold

and precious stones, the handle of a fan of wood laminated with gold,
an ebony mirror of gold and gilded bronze, ete. But along with these
were found in the tomb of the queen various arms and a small boat of
massive gold mounted upon a wooden chariot with wheels of bronze
and a similar boat of silver. In the golden boat twelve oarsmen are
seen, also of gold, who are rowing under the orders of the helmsman and
pilot in the prow. In the center of the boat a diminutive personage
holds an ax and a baton of authority; a cartouche engraved behind
the helmsman teaches us the death for which he was originally pre-
destined. This boat is King Kamos. The vessel itself is a symbol of
the craft on which the deceased must embark aceording to the creed of
the Egyptians, and be borne to Abydos in order to enter the other
world.

Upon a few other objects found in this tomb may be read the names
of the kings, Kamos, Ahmos, and the prenomen of the latter, Nibpehtiri.

The arms found in the tomb are of great importance to our subject.
They are three poniards with blades of bronze and gold; two axes, one
of gilded bronze, the other of silver; nine small hatchets, three of gold
and six of silver; and a baton of authority, made of black wood and
gold.

The figures that we are about to refer to are grouped upon the plates
apart from the text here subjoined. One of the poniards was originally
sheathed in a scabbard of gold.* The handle is of wood, and orna-
mented with small triangles in cornelian, lapis-lazuli, feldspar and gold
forming the reverse. Tor the pommel, four female heads in pricked
gold; an inverted bull’s head conceals the soldering of the blade to the
handle. The body of the blade is of dark bronze, inlaid with massive
gold and damascened. Upon the upper face above the prenomen
Nibpehtiri a lion is pursuing a bull, in advance of which two locusts
are quietly proceeding. The lower facet bears the name of Ahmos I
and fifteen flowers in full bloom which issue one from another and disap-
pear toward the point of the blade. Another poniard (Fig. 18) has a
gold handle, the blade being of bronze. The third poniard (Fig. 11) is
formed with a very heavy blade, and a disk of silver serving as a handle.
Figure 12 exhibits the poniard from a side point of view.t

One of the large axes is represented in Fig. 26. The handle is of
cedar wood, ornamented with a golden leaf. The name of the king,
Ahmos, is here traced in incrustations of lapis-lazuli, cornelian, tur-
quoise, and green feldspar. The bladeis provided with a simple handle

*The figures which here represent the objects preserved in the museum at Boulaq
are executed after photographs which, through the kind instrumentality of M. Piehl
and M. Brugsch Bey, were executed for me. The description of the sumptuous arms
in the tomb of A’hhotep are taken from the Guide du Visitewr au Musce de Boulaq, by
Maspero, pp. 79-83. Compare Erman, qgypten, p. 612.

of wood and maintained in its socket by a coil of gold thread. It is of
black bronze and has been gilded.

One of its facets bears lotuses on a ground of gold; the other
represents Ahmos threatening with his axe a barbarian, half over-
thrown, whom he is holding by the hairof his head. Above this scene
is represented the god of war, Monton Thebain, under the form of a
griffin with the head of an eagle.*

The other axe is of the same form, the handle being of horn garnished
_with gold, the blade being of silver. Among the bronze axes found
in Egypt with which I am acquainted none is perforated in the same
way as the axesusedinourdays. Allare of the same form as the wedges
of bronze so common during the age of bronze in Europe, and are fast-
ened to the handles by thongs or other bands.

All the Egyptian axes that I have had an opportunity to see at the
Louvre and in other collections have been flat wedges without any
traces of elevation along the borders, “straight borders” +t without
shoulders near the middle portion, to prevent the blade from entering
into the handle when one struck with it.

The blades are either nearly of the same form as the axes of stone
(Fig. 36) or else somewhat enlarged at the edge. The upper portion
of several have a form characteristic of Egyptian axes (Fig. 28). It is
rectilinear and prolonged into a point toward the two extremities.

There were however other forms of bronze axes, besides. Among
the re-productions which date from the early era of the ancient
empire, axes with a half circular blade are to be seen, as in Fig. 31.
This blade is massive; but later on, towards the close of the ancient
empire, the blade has very often the form that is shown in Fig. 32, with
two round holes near the handle.{ The arm represented by Fig. 35
has a similar blade with two holes, only more elongated; the surface of
the handle is of silver. §

Sometimes the axe blades are Breve’ through and through like that

sented which, according to p. 378, should have straight borders, but the designs of
the plate referred to are not sufficiently exact to draw any conclusions. I have writ-
ten to the museum at Boulaq, where the figured axe should have been deposited, to
inquire about it, but have received no reply.

circular apertures are in slightrelief. Similar axes to those of Fig. 33 may be seen
among the reproductions of the twelfth dynasty. Lepsius, les Métaux, vol. 1, Pl. 132

of Fig. 34, and present divers images. Celts, with sockets similar to
those which are so often found in Europe, are unknown in Egypt, but
celts with pinions are met with there which approach in appearance
those with sockets. The pinions, which are folded around the handle,
are found only on one side; Fig. 40 represents such a celt. The latter
is made of iron, but bronze celts of the same form are likewise dis-
covered in Egypt.*

In Egyptian tombs. poniards with double edges have been found of
bronze. The hilt is frequently formed from a bronze plate, the two
sides covered with wood, horn, bone, or ivory.

The hilts of the poniards represented by Figs. 1 and 3-5, which are
of this description, have around them a border in bronze. A like bor-
der may also be seen in the larger part of the hilt of figure 2, but the
pommel is entirely of bone, or rather of ivory fastened by a rivet, par-
allel to the blade.

Upon the handles last mentioned, the hilt properly speaking is, as is
generally the case, much large than the pommel. Such however is
not always the case. A poniard of bronze discovered at Thebes, of the
same type as in Fig. 9, has a pommel almost as large as the hilt.7

In the poniard represented in Fig. 9, the pommel is a little larger than
the hilts.t The latter has two semi-circular holes and is of ivory,
while the restis of horn or hard wood, fastened with bronze rivets. In
Fig. 10, the pommelis very much larger than the handle, in which are not
to be included the long and narrow lobes of the handle, which comprise
the upper extremity of the blade. § Still larger is the pommel of the
poniard which is represented by Fig. 11, and which we have already
described ; the two semi-circular holes which are seen in the pommel
of Fig. 9 are likewise found in Fig. 11, as also in Fig. 10. Hach of these
four poniards have pommels almost circular.

*A similar celt in bronze, the pinions of which do not extend as far as those in
Fig. 40, is deposited in the Leyden museum, Leeman’s Monuments Egyptiens du
Musée de Leide, P|. 80, Fig. 5. Chabas, ’tude sur Vantiquite historique, p. 76.

t The hilt is half horn, half ivory (Prisse d’Avennes Monuments Egypt, P1. 46, Chabas,
Etudes sur Vantiquite historique, p. 92). The work quoted by Prisse d’Avennes as
wellas many other books of importance for this essay, is not at Stockholm,

{ The original of Vig. 9 is deposited in the British Museum. The handle is pro-
longed into a narrow tongue which crosses the hilt. (Kembler Hore ferales P1. 8,
Fig. 3, p. 156.) There another poniard is mentioned deposited in the British Museum,
‘(a bronze or silver hilt which unites the pommel of ivory to the blade.” On the
occasion of a session of the Institate of Archeological Correspondences at Rome, on
the 28th of February, 1879, I saw a magnificent poniard of the same typeasFig. 9. It
belonged to Mr. Alex. Castellani, who had received it from Marietta. The poniard,
with the two usual holes, was of cedar wood, entirely covered with gold. The lower
part of the hilt was of silver, ornamented with gold rivets, symmetrically placed.
Along the middle of the blade was a simple line in relief, the greater part of which
had sharp edges.

§ The original of Fig. 10 constitutes a portion of the collection of Mr. Greenwell at
Durham. I owe the design of the latter and of other Egyptian bronzes deposited 1n
the same collection to my friend Mr. Sven Soderberg, of Lund.
512 THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.

Fig. 8 shows us a poniard of bronze deposited in the museum at
Berlin, the pommel of which is very much larger than the hilt. The
pommel, not round, but elongated, is of ivory; the rest of a dark sub-
stance (horn or rhinocerous hide), fastened with large rivets incrusted
with gold.

Sometimes the whole hilt is of metal, as in the case of one of the
poniards found in the tomb of Queen A’hhotep (Fig. 18), the blade being
of bronze the hilt of gold. Yet more precious is the hilt of the other
poniard discovered in the same tomb (Fig. 15). The mural paintings of
the tomb of King Rameses IIL at Thebes represent a number of arms,
among others long poniards with double blades, as in Fig. 20. The
blades of some are painted red, others blue or green.*

The hilts of these arms are yellow; probably they were made of gold
or were gilded. An arm of similar form (Fig. 19), which must have been
of bronze, since it is painted red, is seen in another mural picture.

Besides these poniards with double edges, a kind of long knife or
short sword with one edge was employed in Egypt. On the Theban
bas-relief, King Rameses II wears an arm of this form, and the god
Ammon is quite often represented with a like armin his hand. <A bas-
relief in a temple at Ibsambul, in Nubia, shows us Ammon and King
Rameses III, the latter raising his hand to strike a multitude of van-
quished enemies. In the hand of the god the arm reproduced in Fig. 13
is seen. It is painted red, and must consequently have been of bronze.
Among the arms of mural paintings already mentioned in the tomb of
Rameses III are several of this character, a few even carved (Fig. 6),
but they are all blue, and consequently were cf iron.

The museum of the Louvre possesses an arm in bronze of this type
(Fig. 14). The blade and the hilt are fused in one piece ; the hilt, whick
ends on the reverse side in a little eye, is ornamented with a dog very
well modeled ; on the blade is seen a legend in hieroglyphies.

Egyptian monuments very often represent poniards rather long (Fig.
20), but veritable swords are not seen during the period we have under
consideration. Neither, as Tam aware, has the discovery of a real
sword in bronze been madein Egypt. Itis true that in the magnificent
collection of Mr. John Evans, at Nash Mill, is deposited a bronze
sword which was discovered at Kawtara during the construction of the
Suez canal, and consequently near the frontier. It is very uncertain
therefore, whether it can be called Egyptian, at least considering that —
it is the sole one of its kind. The blade, 43 centimeters long, ends
above in a tongue slight and curved forward in the form of a hook ; at
the base of the blade are two rivet holes.

The Berlin museum likewise possesses a bronze sword which is
reputed to have been discovered in Lower Egypt.{ But this indication

THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT. 513

is unreliable, and so much the less probable, inasmuch as the blade in
nowise recalls Egyptian poniards, but, on the contrary, resembles many
European swords of bronze.

The Egyptians, like other nations, made use of lances. On Egyptian
monuments these arms are sometimes seen provided with very short
handles.*

Bronze barbs are also found, but not in large numbers, in the collec- .
tion of Egyptian antiquities. One of these is exhibited in Fig. 41; the
long socket is formed by a fold so that a lengthy fissure is seen.t

Bronze lances, the sockets of which are formed in this primitive
manner, have not only been discovered in Egypt, but also in Cypras
and Greece. Some of the lance points of Egyptian bronze have a very
narrow barb, others are of greater width.t

As innumerable representations demonstrate, the bow played a
prominent role among the Egyptians, both in war and in the chase.
Consequently, a large quantity of arrow points of bronze have been
found. A goodly number of them have a stalk, by means of which
they are attached to the staff (Fig. 25). They are often also ornamented
with two long projections from the barb (Fig. 24). Others are pro-
vided with a socket (Fig. 22). Sometimes the sockets of the arrows (Fig.
21) are formed by folding back the edges of the lower portion ; that is,
in the same manner as in the cases of the sockets for the lance barbs.

A large proportion of Egyptian arrow points are made with three
sharp edges. Such barbs are frequent in western Asia and Greece,
where they belong to epochs comparatively recent.

Sometimes upon Egyptian monuments the arrow points have a
transversal edge (Fig. 25), the red color of which makes us apprehend
they were of bronze.

Arrow points of silex with a transversal edge have been found in
Kgypt and in some European countries, such as France and southern
Sweden.

Amongst the bronze implements it is necessary to remark, besides
the axes already mentioned, chisels (Fig. 39), knives (Fig. 42), saws (Fig.
44), drills, awls (Fig. 46), small pincers, hooks (Fig. 45), ete. <A large
number of them have still retained their handles of wood or horn. Just

Customs, p. 291. The points are often painted red, and consequently were of bronze.
(Lepsius, Les Métaur), Pl. u, Figs. 4 and 12.

t The original of Fig. 41 belongs to the museum at Boulaq. The rent is not only to
be seen upon the socket part, which is below the commencement of the blade, but
also above it. A similar lance point of Theban bronze forms a part of the collection
of Mr. Greenwell at Durham. Compare, Mémoires de la Société royale des Antiquaires
du Nord. 1873-74, p. 128, Fig. 3.

{The Louvre possesses an Egyptian lance point of bronze, the blade of which is
not so narrow as that in Fig. 41, nor of an equal width. Still wider is a lance point
which belongs to the Berlin Museum (Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, vol. 1, p.
312, Fig. 34a). A lance point with a blade of unusual length, wide at bottom, but
narrow at the top, is represented in the work last cited, vol. 1, p, 406,

514 THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.

as upon the axes and poniards, are often seen upon these iniplements—
either on the handle or the bronze itself—a legend in hieroglyphies.

The majority of the implements which we have just cited are aiso
represented on Egyptian monuments, and are there usually painted
red* (Figs. 38 and 44). Sickles and needles were also made of bronze;
likewise mirrors, strings for musical instruments resembling harps, not
to cite other examples.t The mirrors, which are round slabs or plates,
with handles, resemble those with which we are acquainted from
Estruscan tombs.

We possess as yet very few Egyptian bronzes of a well determined
age, and these date almost all from ages immediately bordering on the
epoch when they had begun to use iron. Now we can not respond as
completely as we would wish to this important question, What forms
are characteristic to each period of the Egyptian age of bronze ?

It is only very seldom—as, for instance, when hilts of poniards (Figs.
9-11), or handles of axes (Figs. 30-33) are referred to—that we can follow
the typologiec development. Meanwhile that which we know already is
very interesting. The discovery of the tomb of Queen A’hhotep proves
that poniards of the type of Fig. 11 are a little anterior to the year 1500
B. C.

AS a consequence the types (Figs. 9 and 10) belong to a more remote
era.t This is confirmed by the fact that the original of Fig. 9 was
discovered in the same tomb as the ax represented by Fig. 33.

This tomb ought to date from the year 2000 B. Cc. or thereabouts, since
the axes similar to Fig. 15, as we have seen, are represented upon the
monuments of the twelfth dynasty, reigning at that period. Too few
Iievyptian bronzes of the epoch we are examining have been until now
chemically investigated. We can, however, discover that the bronze
then employed in Egypt, as that used in Europe during the age of
bronze, was an alloy of copper and tin, probably without the intentiona-
addition of lead, zine, or other metal. §

An Egyptian poniard analyzed by Vanquelin, containing 85 parts to
100 of copper, 14 parts to 100 of tin, and 1 part to 100 of iron, or of
other metals. ||

Other arms of Egyptian bronze are composed of 94 parts to 100 of cop-
per, 5.9 parts to 100 of tin, and 0.1 part to 100 of iron.4

According to Wilkinson ** the proportion of tin in almost all Egyptian
bronzes analyzed up to the present time is about 12 parts to 100.

were also used for shaving off the hair.

The Egyptians were forced to import the tin necessary for their in
dustries, and this was certainly an enormous quantity. They probably
had recourse to Asia, for this precious metal, even more indispensable
in antiquity than in our own days.* Copper, on the other hand, was
common, if not in their own country, at least in the immediate vicinity.
The peninsula of Sinai possesses considerable mines, mining operations
in which began at a period very remote.

THE AGE OF BRONZE IN EGYPT.
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

By Prof. OT1s T. Mason.

INTRODUCTION.

In the present summary of anthropology it is designed to show the
progress of the science in a somewhat elementary manner, in order to
reach a larger number of readers. The phrase, ‘ natural history of
man” is here taken to mean the employment of the apparatus, pro-
cesses, aad principles of natural history to the study of mankind. This
definition will be subject to constant changes. Just as soon as any set
of phenomena or facts concerning our species may be arranged, classi-
fied, and studied after the manner of the naturalist, only then should
they be admitted into the laboratory of anthropology.

Once admitted, their difficulties will not cease. In order to keep
pace with other natural knowledge, these series of phenomena or facts
must ever be subjected to new forms of scrutiny. Botanists and zo6l-
ogists are constantly inventing better apparatus and refining their
methods, and furthermore, each department of these sciences requires
special machinery and appliances to perfect the delicacy of the senses
and to enable the investigator to hold large masses of facts before his
mind at once.

Anthropology therefore is required to be a most vigorous science,
keeping pace with every improvement in other sciences, both general
and special, and refining its own apparatus and methods perpetually.

The summary which at the close of each year faithfully chronicles
the topics discussed, the organized means of research, the improvement
in apparatus and the results attained, serves as a historical monument
by means of which future students may trace their way backward in
the development of the science.

A complete syllabus of anthropology would include—first, what man
is, and second, what man does. What man is may be denominated
structural anthropology ; what man does, functional anthropology.

Science always deals with phenomena, and the name of each science
is derived from the things observed and studied. Tor instance, we

may arrange the various parts of the subject under consideration in
the order of phenomena.

[t will readily be seen that one man may not be profoundly versed
in anthropology, but everyone who reads the foregoing syllabus care-
fully will at a glance discover that there is some particular branch of
the subject for which he is fitted by his daily occupations.

The resources already in existence for the student, both general and
special, will be noted in the proper order. They may be classified as
follows:

(1) Those relating to the subject as a whole.

(2) The resources of biological studies.

(3) Psycho-physical investigations, that is, the study of psychology
experimentally.

(4) The races of men.

(5) Language.

(6) Arts and archeology.

(7) Sociology.
(8) Philosophy, folk-lore, and mythology.
(9)

9) The relation of nature to man.
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890. — O20

I1.—GENERAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

{it must be remembered in this connection that we have not now to
lay the foundation for a new science, but to bring together the results
of an exceedingly vigorous one. The resources at our command are:

(1) General treatises, like Tylor’s “Anthropology,” courses of lec-
tures, encyclopedias, and classifications.

(2) Societies with their published proceedings and transactions and
periodicals devoted entirely to the study of man.

(3) Assemblies and congresses, national and international, with their:
Comptes-rendus.

(4) Museums and collections, public and private, with catalogues and
books of instructions. Expositions.

(5) Special libraries containing both literature and albums.

(6) Laboratories, as in other sciences, for investigation both in struct-
ural and functional anthropology.

The most noteworthy event in our science for Americans, was the
Congrés International des Ameéricanistes, at Paris. At this meeting
the compte-rendu of the seventh session held in Berlin (1888) was pre-
sented. The list of papers there printed is as follows:

The Section of Anthropology in the American Association for the
Advancement of Science had for its presiding officer Dr. Frank Baker,
the director of the National Zodlogical Park. His address will be no-
ticed in the chapter on Biology. The following are the titles of impor-
tant papers read: Indian origin of maple sugar, H. W. Henshaw;

The sixtieth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science was held in Leeds, September 3-13. The vice presidential
address of Mr. John Evans was devoted mainly to this question: What
is the antiquity of the human race, or, rather, what is the antiquity of
the earliest objects hitherto found which can with safety be assigned
to the handiwork of man? As regards Tertiary man there are three
classes of evidence, to wit: (1) the presumed discovery of parts of the
human skeleton ; (2) that of animal bones said to have been cut and
worked by the hand of man; and (3) that of flints thought to be arti-

ficially fashioned (J. Anthrop. Inst., x11, 565; Tr. Hertsford Nat. Hist.
Soc., 1, 545). In summing up the evidence, Dr. Evans says that the
present verdict as to Tertiary man must be in the form of ‘ not proven.”
The latter part of the address is devoted to the question of the Aryan
language and the Aryan race and to the improved resources of anthro-
pological study. Papers were read upon the following topics: Hered-
itism, F. O. Morris; Religion of the Australian aborigines, J. W. Faw-
cett; The present aspect of the jade question, F. W. Rudler; Is there
a break in mental evolution? Lady Welby; Unidentified peoples in
Britain in pre-Roman times, Dr. Phéné; Yourouks of Asia Minor, T.
Bent; Aryan cradle land, J. Stuart Glennie; Reversions, Nina Layard ;
Physical development, G. W. Hambleton; Archeological remains
bearing on the origin of the Anglo-Saxons in England, Dr. Munro;
Duggleby “ Howe,” E. Maure Cole; Romano-British graveyard in Wet-
wang-with-Fimber, J. &. Mortimer; Minute neolithic implements, H.
C. March; Retrogression in prehistoric civilization in Thames Valley,
H. Stopes; Boring of stone hammers, W. Horne; Stethographic trae-
ings of male and female respiratory movements, Wilberforce Smith;
Human remains at Woodyates, Wittshire, J. G. Garson; Old and
modern excavations of the Wandsdyke at Woodyates, Gen. Pitt
Rivers. ;

The British Association committees form an active part of the
general meetings. Upon anthropological subjects were the Report
upon the new edition of the little haudbook for collectors entitled
Notes and Queries; Report of the committee on anthropometric
laboratory ; On prehistoric inhabitants of Britain; On nomad tribes
of Asia Minor; On northwestern tribes of Canada; On India. The
British Association for the Advancement of Science, codperating with
the Anthropological Institute of London, organized a lecture course on
anthropology, differing from the Paris course not only in being less
technical, but also in the repetition of the lectures before institutions
and before the public in various cities throughout the United Kingdom.
The series was as follows:

(1) Physical anthropology. By Dr. Garson.

(2) The geological history of man. By IF. W. Rudler.

(3) Prehistoric dwellings, tombs, and monuments. By A. L.
Lewis.

(4) Development of the arts of life. By Henry Balfour.

(5) Social institutions. By E. W. Brabrook.

(6) Anthropometry. By G. W. Bloxam.

During the current year the beneficent results of the Paris Exposition
began to appear, especially in the form of reports on the various con-
gresses. Of the tenth session of Congrés international d’ Anthropologie
et @Archéologie préhistoriques, M. Hamy, Membre de l’Lustitut, and
general secretary of the congress, prepared the Compte Rendu, a
pamphlet of 43 pages, The French Association for the Advancement
532 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

of Science met during the current year at Limoges, August 7-15. In
this association is a section devoted exclusively to anthropological
subjects.

The twenty-first meeting of the German Anthropological Association
was held at Munster, Westphalia, August 11-15. At each one of these
annual meetings it is customary to explore thoroughly the anthro-
pological resources of the region. Professor Hosius this year read a
paper on the geognostic structure of Westphalia, the prehistoric sta-
tions and the remains of quaternary animals found there, and Professor
Nordhoft followed up this communication with one upon the urns and
the weapons found in this state.

The German Association of Naturalists and physicians (Versammlung
deutscher Naturforscher und Aertzte) must not be confounded with
the General Anthropological Society of the empire and Austria. The
first named lield its sixty-third meeting in Bremen, 15-20th September.

The Russian Association of Naturalists and physicians held its
eighth meeting in St. Petersburg, January 8-19. In the 70 sessions
2,200 took part and over 400 communications were made. One of the
ten sections was devoted to geography, ethnography, and anthropology.
The subjects discussed were, migrations, history of primitive culture,
anthropometry, local archeology, and the ethnography of Russia.
Upon this last point the opportunities of study are unparalleled and
the Russian ethnographers have not failed to make use of them.

There is no better illustration of the rapidity with which the science
of anthropology has asserted itself than the museo de la Plata, a sketch
of which is here given (Plate I). The capital of the province of Buenos
Ayres, the city of La Plata, was founded in 1882, to replace as a seat of
provincial authority the city of Buenos Ayres declared in 1880 to be the
sapitalof the republic. In the brief space of time intervening, under the
energetic management of Signor Francisco P. Moreno, a fully equipped
museum is completed. The anthropological portion owes its existence
almost entirely to the director. It is especially rich in material illus-
trating the aboriginal life of the republic. (Plate I1.—Ground-plan of
Museum.)

In the summary of last year a brief account was given of the manner
in which the science of man is covered in the institutions of Paris.
Dr. Sophus Miiller contributes the following list for Copenhagen:

(1) Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities. Devoted to early Den-
mark, including the stone, the bronze, the iron, and the historic period,
until 1660.

(2) The Folk Museum, general historic museum, from 1660 to 1800,
Will be united with the Museum of Northern Antiquities under one
direction in a new building.

(3) Rosenburg Castle, the collections to illustrate the life and history
of the present dynasty.

(i) The Fredericksburg Castle Collection, general Danish history
from 1000-1800. .

(5) A new museum for medieval and modern times in other coun-
tries of Hurope.

(6) Ethnographic Museum, arranged to show the civilizations of the
world by tribes. This was probably the first collection in Kurope to
be laid out upon a strictly ethnographic basis.

(7) Royal Museum of classic antiquities in Prinzens Palais.

(8) Royal collection of coins in Prinzens Palais.

No mention is made here of the royal galleries of art nor of the col-
lection of crania and skeletons in the Zodlogical Museum. The visitor
to Copenhagen never fails to spend a day in the Thorwalsden Museum,
into which the affectionate esteem of his fellow citizens has gathered
the works of the great sculptor and his personal effects and displayed
them most attractively.

A work of primary importance, which the director of every other
authropological museum should imitate with great promptness and care,
is Dr. Hamy’s volume entitled Origines du Musée @’Ethnographie du
Trocadero, Paris. The first exotic presents known to have come to
France were the gifts of Haroun al Raschid to Charlemagne, 801 and
807, A.D. From that moment to the present all sorts of treasures,
gotten in many ways, have been in the charge of public keepers. ‘The
modern museum is shown by this volume to have been the growth of
ages, the beginning or germ being the curiosity of the king or some of
the nobility. It would be well if every important museum could have
a volume of history like Dr. Hamy’s * Origines.”

In addition to a thorough history of each public museum, prepared
by its own authorities, the exigencies of intercommunication have led
to the founding of a journal for museum workers, entitled, Znterna-
tionales Archiv fiir Ethnographie (Leyden), and in February, appeared
the first number of the Bulletin des Musées, Paris. It is edited by Mr.
Edward Garnier and Léonce Benedite, aud resembles the Berlin ‘* Year
Book of the Royal Prussian Art Collections,” under the heading of
‘*Mouvement des Musées it gives notes on other national galleries and
collections, and a bibliography.

The standard list of journals remains the same. No anthropologist
can afford to neglect the following list:

The American Anthropologist, Washington; Archiv fiir Anthropologie,
sraunschweig ;'Archivio per V Antropologia, Firenze ; Bulletins de la So-
ciété @ Anthropologie de Paris; Internationales Archiv fiir Ethnographie,
Leyden; Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and
Ireland, London; L’ Anthropologie, Paris; Mittheilungen der Anthropolo-
gischen Gesellschaft in Wien ; Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft
fiir Anthropologie, etc., Berlin; Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie, by the same
society.

Journals of a popular character which can not be neglected are:
Academy, London; The American Naturalist, New York ; Athenceum,
London; Ausland, Stuttgard; Nature, London; Popular Science Monthly,
New York; Rérvue Scientifique, Paris; Science, New York.
534 PROGRESS OF ANTITROPOLOGY IN 1890.
IL.—-BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

This enormous subject, covering practically the whole of the structural
part of anthropology, is amply represented in a few publications. Tor
titles alone the Index Medicus and the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-
General’s library are the best guides accessible to Americans.

In England this part of the subject is most elaborately worked out
in the biological and zoélogical journals. The Paris Bulletins, the
German Archiv and Zeitschrift, the Italian Archivio, and the Austrian
Mittheilungen, though covering the entire science, are specially rich
and full in biological matters. With the original papers, accounts of
meetings, reviews of publications and bibliography there is little more
to be desired either for the beginner or for the advanced student.

Dr. Frank Baker devoted his vice-presidential address before Section H
of the American Association to the organs of the human body that point
to a past condition much lower than the present ;—indications of the
pathway by which humanity has climbed from darkness to light, from
bestiality to civilization. These organs are of two kinds, those that
added or improved and those that are taken away or atrophied. Those
specially mentioned are connected with the modifications of the limbs,
with the erect posture, and with the segmentation of the body.

In the hand the special flexor muscle of the thumb is a new element,
while the palmaris longus is in the category of disappearing muscles.
The torsion of the humerus and the incurvation of its trochlear surface
and the scapular index all show a progressive development both in the
individual and in the race.

The palmar fascia, the epitrochles-anconeus, a process resembling the
supra-condyloid foramen of marsupials, the perforation of the olecranon
fossa remind of primitive conditions. While the region of the hand and
fore arm indicates increase of specialization, the upper part of the limb
generally testifies to a regression. This principle is illustrated by ex-
amples. The hind limbs of apes as compared with the human legs and
the acquisition of the erect posture are closely examined. Upon the
latter point Dr. Baker summarizes the evidences that the adaptation of
man to the erect posture is yet far from complete.

These resemblances with anthropoid apes are held to indicate not
lineal descent, but common ancestry, and the differences in the races of
mankind do not justify our separating them on structural grounds.

In his work on races and peoples Dr. Daniel G. Brinton summarizes
the physical characteristics used in classification of mankind:

On the 15th of March Mr. J. Venn gives in Nature the results of a
series of measurements made upon the students of Cambridge Univer-
sity,in England. The following queries are put, according to Dr. Gal-
ton’s system: (1) The distance of the clearest vision, (2) traction upon
the dynamometer, (3) force of pressure by the hand, (4) volume of the
head, (5) capacity of pulmonary inspiration, (6) stature, (7) weight of
the body. The most interesting result relates to the head, which is
found to be larger in volume in the better students, and in all classes
to increase up to the age of 25. Into comparison with this study may
be brought that of Pauiine Tarnowsky upon 150 prostitutes, 100 female
thieves, 100 peasants, and 50 women of culture:

The vexed qnestion at this moment in the science called criminology
is whether there is an ensemble of characteristics which consign their
possessor to a life of crime, or which may be used to distinguish differ-
ent sorts of criminals. In some form the Italian school are committed
to this doctrine, and are more or less opposed by the Freneh school.

In 1889 Dr. N. Anoutechine, of Moscow, published an elaborate work
on stature of men in Russia compared with that of other nations. An
excellent summary of this monograph is given in L’Anthropologie
(1, 62-74), with chart and map. Every work of importance on human
biology is noted in the Index-Medicus, published by Dr. J. S. Billings
and Dr. Robert Fletcher, of the Surgeon-General’s Office, in Washing-
ton. The permanent record of this literature is to be found in the
Index-Catalogue of the Surgeon-General’s Office. Further important
works are the following: Anthropometric Identification of Criminals,
Bertillon; Anthropometry, Galton, Hurd; Ascent of Man, Baker;
Cerebral Convolutions, Turner; Chest Development in Young Persons,

I1l.—PSYCHOLOGY.

In the science of anthropology, psychology is the application of meas-
ures to the activities of the mind through its matvrial agency, the brain
and the nervous system. The two sets of phenomena, those of the nor-
mal mind and healthy brain and those of the abnormal mind, are in-
eluded. The former find their able organ in the American Journal of
Psychology, Worcester, Massachusetts, and the latter phenomena are
treated in the journals of neurclogy.

Abroad the greatest activity prevails in this department of research.
Wundt’s Studien, Dubois-Reymond’s Archiv, Pfliiger’s Archiv, most of
the physiological journals, Mind, Brain, and even the periodicals de-
voted to criminology, must be consulted.

The American Journal of Psychology furnishes (111, 275-286) a report
on the amount of psychophysical instruction in the following American
institutions of higher learning: University of Wisconsin, University of
Nebraska, New York College for the Training of Teachers, Columbia
College, Harvard University, Yale University, Army Medical Museum,
University of Pennsylvania, Indiana University, Clark University, and
University of Toronto. In each case the instructors’ names are given
and a syllabus of the instruction. It would be well to repeat here, did
space permit, these curricula, to mark the present position of this branch
of anthropology. It will suffice to append Dr. J. McK. Cattell’s account
of work done in the psychological laboratory of the University of Penn-
sylvania.

‘¢ Special courses in psychology were given at the University of Penn-
syivania by Professor Fullerton and Prof. James McKeen Cattell. Pro-
fessor Fullerton delivered two courses—one for undergraduates, the
other for graduate students. In these courses special stress is laid on
psychological analysis and those regions of psychology which border on
the theory of knowledge. Professor Cattell gave three courses extend-
ing through the year—an introductory course in experimental psychol-
ogy, a course beginning with the special study of some psychological
problem and taking up in the second half year comparative, social, and
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN. 1890. 53

abnormal psychology, and an advanced course in physiological and
experimental psychology. ‘These courses include either practical work
or research on the part of the student. A lecturer on philosophy and
an assistant in psychology are about to be appointed, and additional
courses will be given next year.

‘In addition to these special courses, physiological, abnormal, and
comparative psychology may be studied in the medical and biological
departments of the university. These are probably without rival in
America, and offer complete courses of lectures, practical work, and
clinics. Psychology borrows from and lends to all the sciences. Every
one of the large number of advanced courses offered by the university
bears some relation to psychology, and may prove useful to the stu
dent. The asylums and hospitals will be found of special advantage to
the student of psychology.

The new library building of the university is nearly completed. There
is a special endowment for the purchase of philosophical and psycho.
logical books, and any books needed by students for special work will
be obtained. The university press is about to begin the issue of aseries
of monographs representing work done in the fields of philosophy and
psychology. The first number, no w in press, is a psychologieal study
on **Sameness and Identity,” by Professor Fullerton. Following this
number will be aseries of researches from the laboratory of psychology
and an edition of Descartes’ ** Meditations,” with Latin and English
texts and philosophical commentary.”

Professor Cattell makes the following report of work done in the
psychological laboratory. ‘The chief work before experimental psy-
chology is the measurement of mental processes. As experimental
physics is devoted to the measurement of time, space, and mass in the
material world, so experimental psychology may measure time, com-
plexity, and intensity in consciousness. In so far as cases are investi-
gated in which one mental magnitude is the function of another, a
mental mechanics is developed.

‘The laboratory possesses apparatus, which measures mental times
conveniently and accurately. This apparatus has been described in
Mind (No. 42), but since then it has been improved. The chronoseope
has been altered and a new regulator made, so that the mean variation
of the apparatus is now under one-thousandth of a second. New
pieces have been built for the production ot sound, light, and electric
stimuli. Apparatus for measuring the rate of movement and for other
purposes have been added. ‘The observer is placed in a compartment
separated from the experimenter and measuring apparatus. With this
apparatus researches are being carried out in several directions. Pro-
fessor Dolley is measuring the rate at which the nervous impulse trav-
els, using two different methods. In one series ef experiments an
electrical stimulus is applied to different parts of the body, and a reac-
tion is made either with the hand or foot. The rate of transmission in
538 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

the motor and sensory tracts of the spinal cord has thus been deter-
mined. In a second series of experiments two stimuli are given at dif-
ferent parts of the body, and the interval between them adjusted until
the observer seems to perceive them simultaneously. It is thought
that these experiments will throw more light on human physiology
than cases in which the nerve (motor only) of a partly dead frog is
artificially stimulated. The times are also of interest to psychology,
as they are needed in order to determine purely mental times. Mr.
Witmer is measuring the personal difference in reaction-times, and the
work will be extended to different mental processes. These times seem
to vary with age, sex, nationality, education and occupation, and their
study may have practical value as well as theoretic interest. Length
of life should be measured by rate of thought. Experiments are also
being made on the variation in the reaction-time from hour to hour and
day to day. With the co-operation of Dr. Weir Mitchell and other
eminent neurologists the alteration in the time of physiological proc-
esses in diseases of the nervous system is being studied. It is believed
that such tests may be of use in diagnosis. The nervous impulse may
be sent through the system in different directions until a relative delay
discovers the diseased part. Recovery and progression may be studied
by noting the alteration in time.

‘Owing to the introduction of cerebral surgery and the advances
recently made in the treatment of diseases of the nervous system, any
method which may make diagnosis more exact deserves careful study.
In addition to the time of physiological processes in disease, other tests
of loss of sensation, power and intelligence, are made in the labora-
tory. The following ten tests are recommended; the methods, ete.,
are described in an article now in press for Mind: (1) Dynamometer
pressure; (2) rate of movement; (3) sensation-areas; (4) pressure caus-
ing pain; (5) least noticeable difference in weight; (6) reaction-time for
sound; (7) time for naming colors; (8) bisection of 50 centimeters line;
(9) judgment of 10 seconds time; (10) number of letters remembered
on hearing once. These determinations are made not only on those
who are suftering from disease, but also on every one who wishes to
be tested. Itis hoped that the same tests will be made elsewhere, so
that the results of a large number of observations may be compared
and combined. The undergraduate students in experimental psycol-
ogy undertakes a course of laboratory work in which about two hun-
dred tests and measurements are made. It is hoped that when a sufli-
cient mass cf data has been secured, it will have some scientific value.
In the cases of two of the tests given above, the rate of movement
and the pressure causing pain, researches are being carried out in the
laboratory. By altering the distance and nature of the movement, and
the point of the body to which the pressure causing pain is applied,
new quantitative results are obtained.”

Professor Fullerton is carrying on a research to determine the rate

eb aaa Si eM

ee a e
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890. 539

at which a simple sensation fades from memory. A stimulus is allowed
to work on the sense-organ for one second, and after an interval of one
second a stimulus slightly different in intensity is given for one second,
and the least noticeable difference in intensity is determined by the
method of right and wrong cases. The interval between the stimuli is
then altered, and it is determined how much greater the difference be-
tween the stimuli must be in order that it may be noticeable. ‘The rate
of forgetting is thus measured in terms of the stimulus. Intervals vary-
ing from one second to three minutes have been used. For these ex-
periments new apparatus was constructed, and it was discovered that
when sensations of light are excessive and last for one second, the least
noticeable difference in intensity is not about one one-hundredth, as is
supposed, but much the same as for the other senses under like condi-
tions. Other observations, such as the importance of keeping the time
of stimulation constant, the stronger stimulus coming before or after
the weaker, the degree of confidence, the personal and daily variation,
etc., have made a new investigation of the leass noticeable difference
in sensation necessary. ‘This is at present in progress, while further
work on memory must wait for its completion. Mr. De Bow is in the
meanwhile making experiments determining the time of stimulation
giving the greatest accuracy of discrimination.

The rate, extent, and force of movement is the subject of a somewhat
extended investigation, which will not be completed for some time.
The maximum rate of movement has been noticed above. Experiments
on the maximum pressure have been published, as also on extent of
right and left handed movements. But the.least noticeable difference
in the rate, extent, and force of movement has never been studied in
the same way as the least noticeable difference in passive sensation.
Yet it would seem to need such study even more, owing to the impor-
tance and obscurity of the “ sense of effort.”

The laboratory possesses apparatus for studying the time, intensity,
and area of stimulation needed to produce the just noticeable sensation
and a given amount of sensation. These mental magnitudes are cor-
related so that one may be treated as the function of the other. The
results of studying the relation of time to intensity have been published
in Brain (pt. 31), it being found that the time colored light must work
on the retina in order that it may be seen, increases in arithmetical
progression as the intensity of the light decreases in geometrical pro-
gression. The relation of area to intensity and time is now being
studied. Other experiments on the relation of intensity, time, and area
of stimulation, as determined by the length of the reaction-time and
accuracy of discrimination, have been begun.

The laboratory has a valuable collection of Koenig’s apparatus for
the study of hearing and the elements of music, and a spectrophotome-
ter, a perimeter, and other pieces for the study of vision. Work on
hearing and vision has been begun in several directions, but is at pres-
5AO PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

eut delayed for lack of workers. Some progress is, however, being
made in studying the fusion of sensations of light, the laboratory pos-
sessing special apparatus by which colored surfaces of given areas may
in any succession work on the retina for given times. Mr. Newbold, who
has been helping with the experiments on memory, is about to begin a
research on attention, and it is hoped that next year there will be
others ready to undertake original work. Among the subjects for which
apparatus has been secured and preliminary study has been made are:
The building of complex perceptions, exertion, and fatigue, the meas-
urement of contrast, the association of ideas, and subconscious mental
processes.

Dr. Joseph Jastrow has prepared for the series of Fact and Theory
Papers a small volume on thetime-relations of mertal phenomena. ‘The
study of the time-relations of mental phenomena is important from
several points of view. It serves as an index of mental complexity,
giving the sanction of objective demonstration to the results of subjec-
tive observation ; it indicates a mode of analysis of the simpler mental
acts, as well as the relation of these laboratory products to the pro-
cesses of daily life; it demonstrates the close inter-relation of psycho-
logical with physiological facts, an analysis of the former being indis-
pensable to the right comprehension of the latter; it suggests means
of lightening and shortening mental operations, and thus offers a mode of
improving educational methods ; and it promises in various directions to
deepen and widen our knowledge of those processes by the complication
and elaboration of which our mental life isso wonderfully built up. An
excellent bibliography of well selected authorities relating to general psy-
cho-physies, time-reactions, adaptive reactions, and association times
will be found at the end of the volume. The American Journal of

>sychology, edited by President Stanley Hall, and published at Clark
University, Worcester, Massachusetts, is the standard authority on the
physical side of psychology.

Metaphysical psychology, represented in the English publication
Mind, may be said to have fairly entered the arena of anthropology
since the revelations of consciousness are now subjected to experi-
mental examination. The following topics show the range of study on
both sides: Animal Intelligence, Alix, Foveau; Double Conscious-
ness, Binet; Effect of Fatigue on Muscular Contraction, Lombard;
Effect of Music on Animals, Stearns, Weissman; Experimental Psy-
chology, Jastrow ; History of Reflex Action, Hodge’s Hypnotism, Felkin,
Innes, Lays, Moll, St. Clair, Bonjean, and many others; Inhibition in the
Phenomena of Conscience, Beriet; Intelligence of Animals, Corsetti;
Mental Evolution, Varigny; Mental Tests, Cattell; Origin of Mind,
Carus; Origin of Human Faculty, Romanes ; Perception of Length and
Number Among Little Children, Binet; Physiognomy and Expression,
Mantegazza; Principles of Psychology, James; Psychic Life of Micro-

IV.—ETHNOLOGY.,

Since the dividing lines between races have come to be drawn upon
color rather than upon osteology, much ingenuity has been expended in
devising a scheme of colors. Broca’s standards, published in the first
edition of the British Association “Anthropological Notes and Queries,”
are well known. They appear also in the French “ Queries.” Dr. Bed-
doe, president of the London Anthropological Institute, has further
studied these Broea standards and makes the following subdivisions:

(1) Red (including pink) passing through reddish brown towards
black.

(2) Orange, or reddish yellow, passing through brown towards black.

(3) Yellow, passing through yellow brown and olive brown toward
black.

(4) Gray or cendre, darkening to black.

Dr. Beddoe presents an ingenious table, in which the proportions of
these colors are given for people that he has specially examined.

Elements of color—Decads.

This is followed by a more extended table, in which the proportions
of Broca’s numbers entering into each skin color are given. The nota-
ble differences of form existing between the parts of the skeleton and
the other profound portions of the body in different groups of mankind
seem to have been produced antecedent to these migrations aud sep-
arations which have brought about race distinctions at present, such
as color of skin and eyes and texture of the hair.

Dr. Daniel G. Brinton has published a volume on Races and Peoples,
in which he combines the results of a course of lectures before the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This volume supplies a
vacancy previously existing, since there was no good summary of eth-
nology published in English giving the results of modern research.
The peculiar doctrine of the author is the location of man’s origin in
southwestern Europe and the parts of Africa opposite, both on zoblog-
ical and arch:vological grounds. His classifications of mankind, though
agreeing essentially with those of other recent systematists, possess
ee

sufficient intorest to be repvated, since they grow somewhat out of Dr.
Brinton’s theory concerning man’s cradle land. They are reproduced
here in order to enable the reader to compare them with those of
Welcker, Topinard, Hieckel, Miiller, Flower, Quatrefages, and others
in preceding summaries of the Smithsonian Report:

It is not necessary to more than mention the essay at classification
made by Dr. Lombard the preceding year and published in the Bulle-
tins de la Société @Anthropologie, Paris (x11, 129; 185). The author
starts out with the hypothesis that the human species first appeared

ee ee
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890 ete

in the circumpolar region during the Miocene epoch and that it ex-
panded slowly and progressively over all the continents. As soon as
the parts of this original group separated, races were formed which set
up a movement from north to south, the more recent and better per-
fected driving before them the older and more degraded. Three pri-
mary races are demanded by this theory, and their modern representa-
tives are to be seen in Tierra del Fuego, Cape Colony, and Tasmania
or Australia. ’

The best journals on ethnography and ethnology are the organs of
the great societies in England, France, and Germany. The geographic
magazines and publications of all the societies devoted to geography
can not be overlooked. While their ruling motive is the conquest of
the world for civilization they do nof fail to mention and deseribe the
aborigines. The Internationales Archiv fiir Ethnographie, Leyden,
edited by J. D. E. Schmeltz, is designed exclusively for museum directors
who have in charge ethnographic material.

The difficulty still remains of confounding language with blood, in
this area of anthropology, to such an extent that lists of tribes contain
tongues, and vice versa. Trained ethnologists, however, make the proper
distinction, and gradually the error will eliminate itself.

V.—GLOSSOLOGY.

The resources of linguistic studies in the United States are, on the
classical side, represented by the American Journal of Philology, and
on the ethnic side by the studies and publications of the American
Oriental Society, by Dr. Daniel Brinton’s American series, and by the
collections of the Bureau of Ethnology in Washington.

Abroad, the list of philological journals is too long to reproduce;
furthermore, in most of them language is studied quite apart from man
who uses it. Triibners catalogues, not forgetting the Journal of the
Royal Asiatic Society ; Revue de Linguistique; Zeitschrift der Morgen-
landischen Gesellschaft, Lazarus and Steinthal’s Zeitschrift and Fried-
lander’s Catalogues must be consulted for works in special lines. The
following papers may be consulted: Asiatic affinities of Malay
languages, Wake; Blackfeet language, Tims; Category of Moods,
Grasserie; Chinook jargon, Hale; Comparative Grammar, Grasserie ;
Eskimo Vocabularies, Wells; Ethnographic basis of Language, Leit-
ner; Evolution of Language, Murphy; Gothic languages, Balg; indo-

berlain; Manual of Comparative Philology, Schrader; New Linguistic

Dom Pedro; Zulu Dictionary, Manner. -

VI.— TECHNOLOGY.

Klemm’s plan of tracing out the lineage and migrations of human
inventions, perfected later by General Pitt-Rivers, is really the most
productive of scientific results among ethnologic methods. The study
of an art in its historic elaboration may be called technography and the
tracing of an art through the tribes that practice it ethnotechnics, At
any rate, every year some one among thehost of anthropologists gathers
the specimens and the evidence to show how one of our well known

implements, processes, or art products has come to be what itis. The
following is a good example of this: A symposium was held by the
Anthropological Society of Washington to study the arrow-maker’s
art. Six members made communications and their results are published
in the Anthropologist. Each reader was an expert in his field, so
that, practically, there is little more to be said on that subject. Ilus-
trations of some of the methods are to be found in the Reports
of the Smithsonian Institution, but the perfecting of the point is
shown only in the American Anthropologist and is reproduced here to
give the subject a wider circulation. The steps are as follows: (1)

An excellent example of the study of art genealogically is Henry Bal-
four’s description of the old British pibcorn or horn pipe and its affini-
ties. (J. Anthrop. Inst., London, Xx, 142-154,2 pl.) The family tree
would stand thus:

Mr. Walter Hough, of the U.S. National Museum, in a very elabo-
rate manner, worked out the primitive methods of tire-making, so that
he is much better acquainted with the art than any savage ever was.
The geographie distribution of each form is interesting in the light of
ethnography, and the gradual elaboration of this primitive art up to
the last century an instructive chapter in the growth of invention.

Barr Ferree, of the Leonard Scott Publishing Company, wrote a series
of articles on the influence of climate and nature in giving shape and
character to primitive architecture. The subject is one of great inter-
est.

J. E. Watkins, of the U. 8S. National Museum, follows the historie
method in tracing the progress of the carrying industry and the elabo-
ration of modern engineering.

W.H. Holmes publishes in the annual report of the Bureau of Ethnol-
ogy apaper on the evolution of ornament, based on the close study of a
large series of aboriginal pottery, basketry, and other fabrics. It is
shown that many of the patterns which have had the greatest popularity
in the world originated among primitive peoples. <A list of important

VII.— ARCH OLOGY.

The two archeologies, classic and pre-historic, have for their official
organ the American Journal of Archeology and of the History of Fine
Arts. (Boston, Ginn & Co.) It speaks authoritatively for the Arch-
552 ’ PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

ological Institute of America and the American School of Classical
Studies atAthens, whose headquarters are at Cambridge, Massachu-
setts. All branches of archelogy and art, oriental, classical, early
Christian Medieval, and American, find a medium of utterance in the
Journal. The Institute welcomes to its membership all men and women
who desire to aid and share in the advance of knowledge concerning
the past of the human race.

American archelogy has its organs in the American Antiquarian, the
American Anthropologist, the reports of the Peabody Museum, the pub-
lications of the U.S. Smithsonian Institution, and the U. 8. National
Museum, the series of publications issued by Dr. D. G. Brinton, and
the transactions of local societies.

The Museum of American Archeology in connection with the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania perfected its organization by publishing its first
Annual Report, Vol. 1, number 1, containing list of additions to the
library, catalogue of accessions, and the first report of the curator, Dr.
C. C. Abbott.

The subject of archeology has taken on a vigorous growth during
the current year. Professor Putnam, of Harvard University and
Peabody Museum, has carefully studied the prehistoric remains in the
Ohio valley. In two papers in the Century Magazine, especially he has
given in a brief space and in a popular manner the result of his
minute examinations. Professor Putnam also prepared for the World’s
Fair Committee a comprehensive plan for an archeological and ethno-
graphic exhibit. Over this department Professor Putnam will preside.
The researches of the Peabody Museum explorations lead Putnam to
the conclusion that the mound-builder was 2 short-headed South-
erner; that his civilization was broken up by a long-headed Northerner,
and that the Indian is the result of a mixture of these two.

The Hemenway southwest archeological expedition bore its first
fruit in vol. v, of the Papers of Archzological Institute of America,
American series. Mr. A. F. Bandelier contributes in this volume four
papers upon the history of the Southwest, to wit: (1) A sketch of the
knowledge which the Spaniards in Mexico possessed of the countries
north of the province of New Galicia, previous to the return of Cabeza
de Vaca, in the year 1536; (2) Alvar Nuiiez Cabeza de Vaca, and the
importance of his wanderings from the Mexican Gulf to the slope of the

William H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, publishes the result
of an extended exploration in a bowlder quarry near Washington City,
at Piney Branch. This site turns out to be a veritable workshop, and

ra ——"

a careful study of the débris leads the investigator to the conclusion
that the forms occurring here are not implements at all, but failures,
which the savage artisan has thrown away. Mr. Holmes has been
enabled to demonstrate this by learning the stone-chipper’s art and
actually repeating the steps in his processes. The value of this careful
exploration lies in the assistance which it will lend to other archeologists
who visit to review their own work with new light.

Archeologists will be pleased to learn that the Hon. Henry Shirley
found in Pedro Bluff Cave, Jamaica, a cranium belonging to one of
the aborigines who inhabited the island before the European conquest.
It had been artificially detorined during infancy by the depression of
the frontal region, or fronto-occipital compression with eorresponding
lateral expansion. The island of Jamaica has yielded a remarkably
small number of evidences of aboriginal occupation.

Dr. Brinton prepared for his ‘‘ Races and Peoples” a scheme of
geologic time during the age of man in the eastern hemisphere, which
is here re-produced.

The eighth Russian Archeological Congress was held in Moscow,
January 8 to 24. It was the twenty-fifth anniversary of founding the
Royal Archeological Society in Moscow, February 7, 1864. The
55A PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.

occasion was one of great importance both socially and scientifically,
as the following list of topics will show:
(1) Pre-historic antiquities.

(2) Historico-geographic and ethnographic antiquities.
(3) Monuments of fine arts.

(4) Customs and usages in Russia.

) Religious monuments.

) Russo-Slavie linguistic and paleographic monuments.
(7) Classic, Slavo-Byzantine and western antiquities.

) Oriental and heathen antiquities.

. Archeographic monuments.

There is an excellent report of this meeting in the Mittheilungen,
Wien (xx, 148-164).

An event in archeology worthy of record in 1889~90 was the
removal of the National Egyptian Museum from Bilaq on the east
side of the Nile to the spacious Khedivai palace at Gizeh on the west-
ern bank.

The death of Schliemann removed one of the most romantic charac-
ters in the scientific world. The conception of exploring the site of
ancient Troy was formed in his boyhood. His assiduity in amassing a
fortune to this end, and his untiring effort to spend his fortune to
secure that end have held him up to the admiration of two geverations.
That his interpretation of his discoveries may not be in every case
correct, will not detract greatly from his just meed of praise.

Archeological publications of general interest will be found under
the following titles: Aboriginal Monuments in North Dakota, Mont-
gomery; American Antiquities, Peet (under several titles); Antiquity
of Man, White (series of papers on the Warfare of Science in Pop. Se.
Monthly); Antiquities of Tennessee, Thruston ; Archeology, Powell;

VIII.—SOCIOLOGY.

In December of 1889, the American Academy of Political and Social
Science was organized in Philadelphia under the most favorable aus-
pices. The list of subscribing members reached the number of 800 in
the first six months of the Academy. The most distinguished univer-
sity presidents and professors are among the governing body. This co-
Operative action marks an eraina branch of anthropology hitherto diffi-
cult to summarize. The resources of sociolegical study are unlimited.
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN _ 1890. 55D

Census reports, tables of vital statistics, blue books, literature of the
Bureau of Labor, of interstate commerce, of education, Johns Hopkins
tracts on historical and political science; the great reviews, all of
them; the daily press are only a few of the great organs of sociology.
The existence of a national society with an official organ will enable
the specialists to cull from this great mass the publications in his line
of study.

Anthropology comes to the aid of justice in the success of the Bertil-
lon method of measuring and identifying criminals. This has found
favor not only in all France, but in the United States. and even in the
Argentine Republic. To the ordinary police questions of sex, height,
age, and color of the eye are added the cephalic diameters, the length
of the foot, length of the middle finger, length of the ear, length of the
forearm, and personal sears or individual peculiarities. The many
beneficial effects of the certain identification of a criminal, in spite of
all aliases and disguises that have already beén published, the ability
to separate the first offense from the professional villainy, are not the
least among the obligations society owes to anthropology.

The discussion still continues upon the subject whether there are
certain morphological indications of criminal proclivities so marked
that society may use them to protect itself by confining the subject be-
fore the crime may be committed.

The wide range of inquiry in the province of sociology is indicated
in the following titles: Anthropology of Prostitutes, Tamousky; Ar-
tificial Deformation of the Head, Delisle, Nicolucci ; Child Marriage in
India, Brahmin; Chronology of China, Gordon; Communism, Lav-
eleye ; Comparative Criminality, Tarde; Courtesy, Mallery ; Crime and

556 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1890.
IX.—RELIGION AND FOLK-LORE.

One of the remarkable results of codperation in the study of folk-lore
is seen in the possibility of such a work as Professor Frazer’s Golden
Bough. The priest of Diana, near Aricia, took office after killing his
predecessor. Before doing this the candidate was obliged to break a
bough from a sacred tree in the grove, identified with the Golden Bough
plucked at the Sibyl’s bidding by Auneas before entering upon his
journey to the world below. The two questions, why was the priest
obliged to kill his predecessor? and why, before killing him, was he
obliged to pluck the Golden Bough? drive the author to consult the
whole body of knowledge recently accumulated in comparative religion.
The lower forms of animisom are quite familiar to Professor Frazer,
who explored them in the preparation of his well-known work entitled
Totemism.

Sir Monier Williams has placed within the reach of English-speaking
people a study in comparative religion in his work on Buddhism in its
connection with Brahmanism and Hinduism and in its contrast with
Christianity. Tbere is no better example of the amenability of such
matters to scientific treatment than is furnished by Buddhism. At first
it was not @ religion at all. It recognized no spirit world; it had no
ecclesiastical organization, no places of worship, no cult whatever.
Out of itself partly and in its association with surrounding religions it
became, in the north especially, the most complicated and exacting of
cults founded upon spirit worlds of countless number, of every variety
of inhabitants intimately associated in every conceivable way with the
people of the earth. The study of Buddhism is a chapter in the natural
history of religion.

The American Folk-lore Society held its annual meeting in Columbia
College, New York, under the presidency of Dr. Daniel G. Brinton.
The report of the council gaye the most flattering account of the pros-
perity of the organization. A movement was made toward enlarging
the scope of the society’s publications.

The folklorist needs no better guide than the Journal of American
Folk Lore, edited in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by W. W. Newell.
Original papers of great merit fill the body of the numbers, but reviews
of current literature and a list of all publications upon the subject put
the student at once into communication with his colleagues.

In the same manner the Révue de V Histoire des Religions, published
under the auspices of the Musée Guimet, in Paris, takes notice of all
current literature on the natural history of religions. It is a guide
book to this branch of science. During the current year this periodical
enters its twenty-first volume. The Annales du Musée Guimet are
devoted to memoirs too long and technical for the Révue.

Mr. Francis C. Macauley, of Philadelphia, has conceived the idea of
a folklore museum. In pursuance of his suggestions Mr. Culin pub-
lished a paper in the Journal of American Falk-Lore, and organized a

PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN_ 1899. 557

department devoted to this subject in the Museum of Archeology of
the University of Pennsylvania.

Attention is called to the folowing titles: Aryan Cosmogony, Veck-
enstedt; Buddhism, Griffin, Williams; Comparative Religion, Frazer ;
Diabology, Jewett; Evolution of a Sect, MeGee; Folklore, Newell;
Humanities, Powell; Mythology of the Menomoni, Hoffman; Natural
Religion, Miiller; Polytheism in China, Lyall; Prayer Among the Hin-
dus, Roussel; Primitive Religion, Schurtz; Religion of the Semites,
Lloyd; Taoist Religion, Benton.

X.—MAN AND NATURE.

Prof. N.S. Shaler published a series of papers on America in its re-
lation to civilization, including aboriginal life as well as that of the
white race. One of the most interesting chapters in this study is that
which relates to the change from agricultural to hunting life wrought
in the aborigines by the invasion of the buffalo; or, rather, it might
be called the reciprocal action of buffalo and Indian. The burning of
forests encouraged the growth of grass; this invited the buffalos; they
enticed the farmer from his stone hoe and laborious husbandry to take
up the spear and the bow. Meat was easier to procure than corn;
furthermore, the buffalo destroyed the corn and left the farmer nothing
else to do but to pursue the occupation of Nimrod.

M. Marcelin Boule brought together in L’ Anthropologie (1, 89-103) a
series of reviews on quaternary geology in its relation to the antiquity
of man. This list includes Forsyth Major, on the Mammalian fauna of
the Val d’Arno (Quart. J. Geol. Soc., Lond., XLI, p. 1); A. J. Jukes-
Browne, on the Bowlder clays of Lincolnshire (id., 114); Aubrey Stra-
hem, on the Glaciation of South Lancashire, Cheshire, and the Welsh
Border (id., XLII, 369); R. M. Dilley, on the Pleistocene succession in
the Trent Basin (id., XLil, 437); J. Prestwich, on the Date, duration,
and conditions of the glacial period, with reference to the antiquity of
man (?d., XLII, 393); T. Mellard Reade, on An estimate of post-glacial
times (id., XLIV, 291); Rev. O. Fisher, on the Occurrence of elephas
meridionalis at Dewlest, Dorset (id., xLIv, 818); J. R. Kilroe, on Direc-
tion of ice-flow in the north of Ireland (id., xLiv, 827); James Croll,
on Prevailing misconceptions regarding the evidence which we ought
to expect from former glacial periods (id., XLV, 220); J. Prestwich, on
the Occurrence of palzolithic implements in the neighborhood of Ight-
ham, Kent (id., xLv, 270); Henry Hicks, on the Cac Gwyne Cave,
North Wales (id., xLIv, 561).

A PRIMITIVE URN BURIAL.

By Dr. J. F. SNYDER, Virginia, Cass County, Illinois.

On the broad alluvial plain in the southeastern part of the State of
Georgia, through which the Altamaha river takes its course to the sea,
at a point a mileand a half north of that stream and nearly a mile from
the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway, there is a small natural
elevation of the ground rising a few feet above the general level of the
river valley. On the top of this higher ground is one of the numerous
Indian burial mounds of that region, measuring some 25 or 30 feet in
diameter at the base and 8 or 10 feet high at its center. In February
last (1890) in making an excavation in the western edge of this mound—
not for archeological investigation, nor by archzologists,—a few inches
below the surface the spade broke into a hollow, spherical-looking
object that, on inspection, proved to be the round bottom of a large
earthen pot which had been buried there bottom up. The solid, hard-
packed earth in which it was imbedded was then carefully removed and
the vessel was lifted out of its long resting place. Much to the surprise
of the explorers another quaint earthen vessel was discovered within
the larger one. This smaller one was standing upright on the natural
surface of the ground, securely covered and inclosed by the large pot
that had been placed inverted over it, affording it perfect protection
from moisture as well as from the pressure of the earth forming the
mound heaped over it (Fig. 1.) On examining the smaller vase it was
found to be nearly half full of fine white ashes interspersed with calcined
fragments of human bones, comprising the charred teeth and cremated
skeleton of an adult individual. Lying. on the surface of these remains
were a quantity of small perforated bone beads (wampum), among which
I discovered, uniform in size with the beads, several small pearls that
had been pierced through the center for the purpose of stringing, with
the beads, in the form of a necklace or other ornament. Whether the
mound presented any peculiar features inits construction I have been
unable to learn ; and no further exploration of it has, to this time, been
made.

The large pot, which I have succeeded in completely restoring (Fig.
2) is bell-shaped, quite symmetrical in proportions, and measures 153
inches in height and exactly the same in width across the mouth. It

is made of compact clay, unglazed, hard burned, and of the uniform
thickness of a fraction more than the fourth of an inch. About the
bottom, both inside and out, it presents by discoloration unmistakable
evidence of having been subjected repeatedly to the action of fire, prob-
ably for cooking food. Its internal surface is very even and regular
and has the appearance of having been smoothed by the hand, as finger
marks are faintly discerned, particularly about the upper portion. The-
outside is roughened by being ornamented all over with a continuous
repetition of the peculiar design shown in detail in Fig. 3, which doubt-
less was impressed upon the soft clay, before it dried, with a stamp cut
in intaglio, thus leaving the figure on the vessel in relief, or ‘‘ raised.”

The smaller vase, in which the ashes of the dead had been deposited,
is plain, smooth inside and out, glossy black in color, though not glazed;
is thinner and more ¢ )mpact in texture than the large one, looking, at
first glance, as if molded of papier maché. It is free from ornamenta-
tion of any sort, and was burned hard after drying. In Fig. 4 it is rep-
resented, as is also the covering vase (Fig. 2), one-eighth actual size.
Obtusely pointed at the bottom, of conoidal form, it rapidly enlarges to
near the top, and contracts again for an inch and three-fourths to the
mouth; graceful in contour, and almost mathematically true and reg-
ular in every proportion; it is 13 inches broad at the widest part, 114
inches high, and 114 inches across the opening. The fact that in each
of these earthen vessels their height and diameter across the mouth are
exactly equal in measurement may be only an accidental coincidence,
but would seem to indicate that certain definite principles or rules in
the plastic art guided the ancient potters in shaping their vessels.

We are reasonably sure that the wheel and lathe were unknown, as
appliances in the manufacture of pottery, to the primitive American
Indians. But they must have employed adequate substitutes for them ;
for without mechanical aids of some description the wonderful pro-
ficiency attained by some of the tribes in the ceramic art is difficult to
explain. In the early settlement of the country, about the saline
springs in Southern Illinois, Western Virginia, and other localities,
numerous fragments of very large earthen vessels were found scattered
about over extensive areas adjoining, many of them, when entire, 3
or 4 feet in length or in diameter and a foot or more in depth. They
doubtless were made and used by the Indiars as evaporating pans
for cbtaining salt from the salt-impregnated water of the springs.
These rude earthen kettles were plain on the inside, but invariably
bore on the outside the distinct impression of some kind of woven fab-
ric. They excited the curiosity and astonishment of the backwoods-
men; and, at a later time, taxed the ingenuity of the scientist to dis-
cover the method by which the ancient artisan shaped and manipulated
such unwieldy masses of soft clay and supported them in place while
drying. This problem was solved satisfactorily a few years ago by Mr.
George E. Sellers. In his valuable paper on “ Aboriginal Pottery of

the Salt Springs in Illinois,”* he quoted the opinions of the late dis-
tinguished antiquarians, J. W. Foster, LL. D., and Dr. Chas. Rau,
that “the earthenware has evidently been molded in baskets,” an
impracticable method because of the impossibility, as Mr. Sellers points
out, of “ keeping in form and lining with heavy clay fragile baskets of
the large size of these old salt kettles.” He then states, ‘ I discovered
(at the salt springs near the Saline River, in southern Illinois), what
at first I took to be an entire kettie bottom up; but on removing the
earth that covered it, it appeared to be a solid mass of sun-dried clay.
From its position among heaps of clay and shells, its hard, compact,
discolored—I may say almost polished—surface, I became satisfied it
was a mold on which the clay kettles had been formed, precisely as
in loam-molding at the present day.” The soft clay was retained in
proper position on the mold with bandages of coarse textile fabric that
left their impression on the pottery, similar to the imprint that baskets
of the same texture would make if the plastic clay had been pressed
against their inner surface. This very simple method of casting the
large salt kettles—on the outside of the pattern—was probably the
same adopted in making the larger of the two pieces of pottery from
the Georgia burial mound (Fig. 2.). In its construction the clay when
soft must have had firm support on the inner side to resist the pressure
necessary to imprint its exterior surface with the carved type. When
dried sufficiently to retain its form the vessel may then have been
lifted from its mold and smoothed on the inside with water and the
open hand. In shaping the smaller vase the thin sheet of tough clay
was no doubt taken off the molding block while yet pliable and its
upper margin drawn in gradually by careful manipulation. <A slightly
wrinkled appearance of the indrawn margin of the opening bears evi-
dence of this process.

There is no good reason for believing that these two pieces of earth-
enware were made purposely for the inhumation of the incinerated
remains they finally inclosed, though they are in every respect so.
remarkably well adapted for that use. By placing the conical vase
upright on a support a little more than an inch in thickness, and invert-
ing the large pot over it, the receding rim of the vase exactly fits in
the curving side of the pot, as is shown in Fig. 1; the one covering
the other so accurately as to well nigh exclude the passage of air be-
tween the parts in contact. And this, [ have been informed, was their
relative position when recovered from the mound. This vase, though
‘““new” and exhibiting no indications of previous use, is of a type—
Amphora-like—quite common among the earthenware of the pottery-
making pre-Columbian Indians. The large pot, or kettle, as before
stated, bears evident marks of long-continued use in domestic or cul-
inary service.

* Popular Science Monthly, 1877, vol. 11, p. 573, et seq.
612 A PRIMITIVE URN BURIAL.

The exterior ornamentation of this large kettle is shown in detail,
drawn of actual size, by Fig. 3. The dark lines are in relief, standing
out level with the original surface of the clay when molded; the white
spaces show the face of the carving that sunk its impression, the six-
teenth of an inch in depth, in the yielding mass. It will be observed
in this unique design that a well-defined cross appears in each circle
surrounded by the intricate scroll lines. The figure of the cross is by
no means uncommon in the works of art of the ancient races inhabit-
ing America before the historic period. It has been found fashioned
in stone and copper, engraved on shell and bone, and in colors on pot-
tery vases and bottles—not to mention the famous carving at Palenque.
Its presence among the relics of the mounds has occasioned much spec-
ulation and discussion, in the main with no other basis than ludicrous
flights of the imagination. At this late day the fanciful theory of a
pre-Columbian propagation of Christianity in America by the Apostle
Saint Thomas, supported at one time by such distinguished scholars as
Professor Tiedemann, is scarcely worth a passing notice. ‘ It has been
shown by the preceding examples,” remarked Dr. Chas. Rau,* which
could be multiplied, if it were deemed necessary, that the cross was
recognized as a symbol among the more advanced nations of America.”
Gomara says the knowledge of the cross as a religious emblem had
penetrated all Spanish America before its discovery and conquest; and
adds, ‘This veneration of the cross made them (the Indians) more
ready to adopt the Christian symbol.” This rubbish has vanished
before the march of archzcological science, together with the grandeur
and splendor of the “cultured, semi-civilized mound builders.” The
‘sign of the cross,” carved and sketched by the early mound-building
Indians, is now properly considered a meaningless figure of ornamenta-
tion adopted by crude savages because of its simplicity of execution.
This advanced opinion is well expressed by Prof. F. W. Putnam, in
mentioning a copper ornament of cross shape found in an old Indian
grave in Tennessee. He says: ‘I think it must be placed in the same
category with the ‘Tablet of the Cross’ at Palenque, and be regarded
as an ornament made in its present form simply because it was an easy
design to execute, and one of natural conception.”

Known instances of the preservation of cremated human remains in
earthen ware vases, by our prehistoric Indians, are very rare. It was
the custom of some tribes to burn their dead collectively. ‘The practice
of reserving the skeletons,” says Col. ©. C. Jones, LL. D.,t “until they
had multiplied sufficiently to warrant a general cremation or inhumation
seems to have been adopted.” They were then burned all together and
the seething pyre was covered with earth, heaped up into a mound, to
be never again disturbed. ‘ Burial vases,” he adds, ‘inclosing human
bones (not burned) have occasionally been found in the grave mounds of

* The Palenque tablet, p. 42. t Antiquities of Southern Indians, p. 190.
A PRIMITIVE URN BURIAL. 613

Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina.” And
he relates, on pages 455,456 of his valuable work, a very interesting
account of the recovery from a small shell mound on Colonel’s Island,
in Liberty County, Georgia, of a burial urn, inclosed in two others, con-
taining the bones of a young child.

The urn-burial from the Altamaha mound—tbe subject of this paper—
is original indesign and remarkable for its ingenious simplicity. The
pottery-ware is practically imperishable; and sealed almost hermetically,
as were the ashes of the dead they contained, in that region where frost
is scarcely known, they must have endured forever but for some con-
vulsion of nature—or the implements of civilization. The presence, in
the funeral vase, of small pearls with the wampum beads, and the
chalk-like condition of both, attest the antiquity of this singular sepul-
chral deposit. Pearls were worn as personal ornaments in great pro-
fusion by the Indians of eastern Georgia when De Soto came among
them, in 1540. The Gentleman of Elvas says that 14 bushels of them
were found by the Spaniards in one charnel-house at Cofachiqui.
Pickett remarks, in his History of Alabama, ‘‘ There can be no doubt
about the quantity of pearls found in this State of Georgia, in 1540, but
they were of a coarser and less valuable kind than the Spaniards
supposed. The Indians used to perforate them with a heated copper
spindle, and string them round their necks and arms like beads.”

Centuries have pass: d, with their ceaseless changes, since the hands.
of affection placed those venerated ashes of the dead and bead ornaments
in that mound-covered crypt of clay pottery; and they who mourned
on that occasion have, ages ago, been resolved into dust; but in these
simple relics, they left—as legible as though graven in letters on polished
marble—a record of their crude religious feelings, of their child like
faith and reverence, and of their very human yearnings for life ever-
lasting.

Novre.—Since this paper was written the mound in which the pottery
vessels and incinerated human remains were found has been thoroughly
explored; and nothing further was discovered but a bed of ashes and
charcoal on the ground surface in the center of the tumulus.

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE MOHAVES.

By GEORGE A. ALLEN, Colorado River Agency, Colorado.

Although the Mohaves are giving up many of their superstitions,
some of them still cling to the teachings of their ancestors. They cre-
mate their dead, the funeral pyre being made ready for the corpse as
soon as life is extinct, and the body is placed on the pile of wood pre-
pared, while all the friends and relations of the deceased gather around
and set up a pitiful moan. Formerly they burned all the property of
the deceased, and often the mourners would contribute everything
they possessed to the flames, thereby showing the affection and grief
they felt for the dead; but this custom is not much practiced at the
present time. The women usually contributed a portion of their hair
to the flames—that is, those who belonged to the immediate family of
the deceased—and would even sometimes throw themselves on the fire,
such was their grief.

While they have but little reverence, they believe there is a God,
whom they call Mat-o-we-lia, and that He is the maker of all things;
that He has a son, whom they call Mas-zam-ho, who is king of de-
parted spirits. Mat-o-we-lia conducts the movements of the sun, moon,
and stars; sends the rain, sunshine, ete. Mas-zam-ho has full charge
of affairs in heaven, or ‘‘White Mountain,” as they call it.

They believe the spirits of the dead go up to the ‘White Mountain”
in smoke, and that all the property destroyed in the flames with the
deceased will go with him to the ‘ White Mountain,” where pots are
constantly boiling with something to eat. :

They had formerly an annual burning of property, and all would con-
tribute something to the flames in expectation of its going up to their
departed friends. This practice is entirely discontinued on the reser-
vation, but is still kept up by the Yumas at Fort Yuma, and by the
Mohaves at Needles and Fort Mohave, off the reservation.

They also have a belief that all the Mohaves who die and are not
cremated turn into owls, and when they hear an owl hooting at night
they think it is the spirit of some dead Mohave returned. They are
also superstitious about eating any kind of food that they are not ac-
customed to. They will not eat the meat of the beaver, claiming that
if they did their necks would swell. This belief was brought about by

615
616 MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE MOHAVES.

the circumstance of some one having poisoned beaver for their hides,
and the Indians who ate of the flesh were poisoned and died; hence,
they think all beavers are bad.

After one dies the friends do not eat salt nor wash themselves for
four days. But these superstitions are fast disappearing, and in afew
years most of them will have died out altogether. The medicine men are
most instrumental in keeping them alive.

They formerly practiced polygamy, but this is now discontinued.
Their marriage ceremony is a very simple one; they merely agree to
live together as man and wife, seldom separating after such an agree-
ment is formed.

They regard the hieroglyphics found on rocks as being the relics of
some distinct race, of which they have no tradition whatever. Their
animal nature, like that of all aborigines, predominates, and they are
most happy and contented when they have plenty to eat. The children
are rather bright and inclined to learn when their minds are not diverted
by play. When allowed to recreate they play some kind of game from
early morn until bed-time.

Some of the women do very artistic work in beads and pottery; they
also weave matting from cottonwood bark. The mesquite bean is their
principal food in winter; this they gather and put up in large willow
baskets, which they place upon platforms for storage. The screw beans
they put into a kind of kiln, and thus it goes through a sweating
process before they are used. They have the metate for grinding wheat,
corn, beans, ete.

Chief Hook-o-row is the head of the Mohave tribe, and he is a good,
peaceable Indian, but not very progressive, being inclined to take life
rather easy.

Like all Indians they have plenty of dogs, and will divide their last
meal with them. The children are all called ‘‘ Peet,” until they arrive
at about four or five years of age, when they are provided with a name.

They live in sweat-houses in winter and under open sheds in summer.
Those who go to the railroad towns and mining camps soon become
demoralized with whisky and contaminated by tramps.

With proper means of irrigation and instruction as to farming they
would soon become a thriving community.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.*

3y THOMAS WILSON, LL.D.

The First International Congress of Criminal Anthropology was held
at Rome in 1885, It opened a new epoch in the history of crime. It was
proposed to investigate crime scientifically, biologically, fundamentally ;
to investigate it in its origin, its causes; to determine, if possible, what
share or proportion of responsibility therefor belonged to the criminal,
and what to the public. As the causes were to be investigated, so also
were the cures. What effect did punishment have for the prevention
of crine? What good could be done by education ?

I formulate some of the propositions with regard to the commission
and prevention of crime and show the relations of different methods
to the end sought to be attained.

I.—The commission of crime—how induced :
1. By heredity.
2. By education:
a. Environment,
b. Sociologic intluences, chiefly in youth.
c. Economic influences; as poverty, famine, &c.
IIl.—The prevention of crime:
1. By fear of punishment:
a. Execution.
b. Imprisonment.
ce. Fine.
2. By restraint:
a. Imprisonment in reformatory institutions.
b. Education.
III.—For the prevention of crime which had its cause in heredity :
1. Restraint of liberty (of the born criminal) before commission of any crime;
this for the individual and for effect in the present.
2. Restraint of marriage or the prevention of the birth of children who are cer-
tain to become criminals.
1V.—Reformation of criminals :
1. By punishment after the commission of crime.
2. Restraint before the commission of crime. °
3. Education :
a., Religion and morals.
b. At home.
ce. At church.

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 621

The discussions of the congress were opened at its second session,
Monday morning, August 12, by Signor Lombroso, upon the first ques-
tion, ** The Latest Discoveries of Criminal Authropology.” His discus-
sion soon developed the fact that there were two great parties in this
congress. One, which was led by Lombroso, and might be called the
Italian school, for it comprised a great proportion, though not all, of
the Italian delegates; and the other, lead by Dr. Manouvrier, to whom
adhered the majority of the French delegates.

Question 1.—Signor Lombroso said a Greek philosopher in moving,
proved the fact of movement, and it is so to day with the discoveries of
criminal anthropology. These discoveries prove the existence of the
science better than the most rhetorical amplifications. The most impor-
tant problem of the last congress, then only half resolved, has been com-
pleted by the studies of Verga, Brunati, Marro, Batl, Gonzale, Tonnia,
Pinero, and by himself. The number of cases of epilepsy with intervals
of consciousness has been extended by genealogie studies of epileptic
families, by their derivation from criminals, from consumptives, from
aged parents, accompanied with the predominance of awkwardness and
clumsiness, by frequent vertigos, occasional delirium, ete. The occa-
sional cases of epilepsy without absence of moral sense, but with ereth-
ism or exaggerated sensibilities, explains how some persons, criminals
because of their passion, have many times an unconsciousness of their
own criminal acts. The role of epilepsy extended itself into the cate-
gory of the criminal insane, principally among the victims of alcohol-
ism, the hysterics, and other monomaniacs. One has only to take the
chart of Esquirol on the homicidal monomaniaes to find the manifesta-
tion and extent of psychic epilepsy.

The “criminals of occasion,” studied anthropologically, have shown
in themselves (as one can say in the language of bacteriology) attenu-
ated, but nevertheless, distinctly visible, characters of the born crimi-
nal. His sensibility is less obtuse, his reflexes less irregular, the anom-
aly less frequent, especially in the skull, but they have always the
characters of the criminal born in some degree, such as the blackest
hair in the servant who is a thief, awkwardness more frequent among
the swindlers, and that they are all more governed by impulse.

In my study of the photographs taken by Mr. Francis Galton, said
he, I have found in eighteen skulls of condemned persons, two types
which resemble marvelously and with an exaggeration which is evident,
the characters of the criminal and approaching those of the savage.
Frontal sinuses well marked, cheek and jaw bones very large, orbits
large and distant, an unsymmetrical face, the nasal overture of a phe-
leiform type, and lemurian attachment of the under jaw. The other
skulls of the swindlers, thieves, and robbers gave to me a type lesspre-
cise, but the want of symmetry, the great size of the orbits and the
prominence of the cheek bones were well marked, though less than in
the former cases. The anomalies were less marked than in the eighteen
622 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

skulls above mentioned. This discovery appears to me to have an
importance not at first seen, for it serves to increase the signification
and importance of the statistics of anthropometry. In order to obtain
reliable indications we should investigate only homogeneous groups.

Mr. Lemoine has published in the Archives d’Anthropologie Crimi-
nelle of Lyon an anomaly which is perhaps unique: The union of the
frontal lobes found in an ex-member of the commune who died at his
house in Lille.

M. Severi has shown that compared with the normal type the crimi-
nals have a great capacity or size and extent of the fossettes of the cere-
bellum.

Marino has demonstrated the diffusion of the occipital fossette: 22
per cent. among the Papuans and 25 per cent. among the New Zealand-

EEC

ers, While he has confirmed the same proportion that I have found —

among the Europeans and among the criminals.

Joly has confirmed the strange phenomenon that the physiognomy of
criminals loses the stamp or type of their nationality.

Ottolenghi has studied and developed the curious characteristics of
criminals in regard to baldness or gray hair. He has found in them
an enormous retardation, comparable only to the epileptics and idiots.
He also found the wrinkles to be more numerous among criminals, and
above all the one naso labial, which he remarked as a characteristic.

The female criminals differ among each other as much as the men,
and these characters are almost entirely absent.

The criminals have a peculiar gesticulation. They have a jargon or
dialect among themselves, as well as a caligraphy, which latter has been
confirmed by hypnotism.

The peculiarities of criminals extend even to their art. They excel
in mechanics and in their precision of detail, but they lack in ideality.
The study of molecular changes has given some curious results. The
average temperature is much above the normal in criminals. It pre-
sents but slight variation in pyretic maladies. An analysis of the urine
of criminals born gives a greater proportion of phosphoric acid and less
of azote.

Lombroso did not continue his presentation at great length nor with
great detail. Hereferred his audience to his last book, which was pub-
lished with the maps, scales, and tables therein set forth, and he declared
his unwillingness to take away from his colleagues the pleasure which
they might have in presenting some of their own discoveries.

Dr. Manouvrier followed him and disputed his proposition, and
plunged into the discussion of the great question whether criminals
were born or made. He pronounced the theory of his opponents to be
but a recitation of the exploded science of phrenology, which, whatever
good it may have proved, was compelled to fall before the poverty of
its experimental statistics and our certain knowledge. He admitted
the physiologic and anatomic differences mentioned by Lombroso, but
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 623

he declared them to be differences of anatomy and physiology; that
they belonged as much to honest men as to criminals, and that the line
of difference mentioned by Lombroso bore no relation between an hon-
est man and a criminal. These were structural and other differences of
physiology and anatomy, while crime was a matter of sociology.

Baron Garofalo, MM. Drill, Lacassagne, and Benedikt declared their
opposition in whole or in part to the theory of Lombroso. M. Drill)
recalled that the organization of man was far from being simple,
that he was an extremely complex being, made up of many component
parts and that his life depended upon his surroundings, his education,
his training, his companions, and that whatever there might be in the
physical or anatomical characteristics of a man which would point
towards his crime or the possibility of its commission, that each of these
elements entered into and became a factor, and were each and all of
them to be considered in deciding this question.

According to M. Dekterew the surrounding circumstances, the social
condition, of man played the greatest role and had the greatest influence.

M. Pugliese declared crime to be a social anomaly and the consequence
of a failure of the criminal to adapt himsélf to his social surroundings.

M. Benedikt, of Vienna, was of the opinion that criminals were sick
men either in body or spirit; and if one examines the exterior morpho-
logic signs to explain and account for the existence of crime in the con-
duct of a given man, it was equally necessary to investigate the mole-
cular trouble in his cerebral structure. He declared that the physiologic
characteristics were a greater factor than the anatomic, and this it was,
with the favorable social surroundings, that made the assassin or the
robber. The criminal, said he, has no particular stigma or mark by
which he can be known from other men. Sometimes there may be signs
of a defective organization, but these are marks or signs of the epileptic
or of the insane. This was also the view of Tarde. There might be
certain predispositions which were organic or possibly physiologic,
which were more or less easily developed according to the social sur-
roundings of the individual and which might, uuder favorable circum-
stances induce crime.

M. Lacassagne agreed with Tarde that in considering the problem of
criminality it was necessary to take largely into account the social influ-
ences. Because these influences and surroundings might modify the
organic characteristics and thus create these anatomic anomalies which
were relied upon by the Italian school. In order to study the criminal
it is first necessary to consider his surrounding. It is not atavism, but
the social surroundings, the social condition, which make the criminal.
If the condition of the humble and the poor and the young and the
ignorant is ameliorated you will diminish immediately the army of crim-
inals. It is society which makes the criminals. Society has only the
criminals it merits. Criminality was above all a social question. M.
Lacassagne said afactor of crime too much neglected was misery, pov-
624 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

erty, and he declared it to extend backwards, not only throughout this
life, but might have been derived from the parents especially the mother.
rarofalo disputed the assertion of Lacassagne. He said the statistics
would show that crime was committed in equal proportions by the
person who was born and raised, he would not say in affluence, but in
such circumstances as to avoid the charge of poverty or misery, and he
demanded before these assertions should be made or conclusions ac-
cepted that accurate statistics should be furnished. Madame Clemence-
Royer invoked a new factor in the genesis of crime which, in her opinion,
had a greater responsibility than had before ever been attrisuted to it,
to wit, hybridity—the mixture of races, the mixtures of the blood of
different races, one of which was usually if not always an inferior.

M. Moleschott, senator from Italy, thanked M. Tarde and Dr. Bene-
dikt for having spoken of the molecular movements, for, said he, there
is the question. The minute researches into the anatomic conditions
made by Lombroso should not make us to forget the different stages of
life which are presented in each individual according to the different
conditions of his life and that the first false step has been approached
on an infinite scale. A moré or less degree, however small, of irrita-
bility on the part of an individual may resuit in a duel or other crime,
because, according to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, ‘‘ We are all
sinners.”

Dr. Brouardel said that in order to resolve the problem it was neces-
sary to apply clinical methods. We do not say that a sick man has the
typhoid fever because he has the headache, or the diarrhea, or cough,
or fever but we say he has typhoid fever because we have grouped his
symptoms and according to their existence and method and the time
or period of their apparition we determine that he is afflicted with this
malady. Therefore to the anatomic stigmas of an individual it is neces-
sary to add the corresponding psychologic characters. The delirium
of combativeness which is due to a poison produced by belladonna is
not a cerebral localization. It is due to a modification brought by the
presence of the agent in the blood, of the nutrition of the entire cere-
bral mass.

M. Ferri declared crime to be a phenomenon extremely complex.
It was a sort of polyhedron of which each person saw but a special]
side. The different views sustained to-day are equally true and yet
equally incomplete. M. Lombroso, said he, brings to light the bio-
logic side of crime; Drill and Manouvrier showed the social; Pugliese
the legal view; Tarde presented the physiological side, and Moleschott
and Dr. Brouardel declared crime to be a phenomenon at once biologic
and social. M. Lacassagne said in the first Congress at Rome that the
criminal was a microbe which propagates only in a certain condition.
Without doubt the conditions and the surroundings make the criminal,
but like the bouillon without microbes within it, the surroundings with-
out crimes are powerless to bring forth the criminal.

&

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 625

As the bouillon is complementary to and as necessary as the microbe,
so the biologic defects and the favorable social surroundings are the
fundamental aspects of criminality.

Question II.—Do criminals present any peculiar anatomic characters?
If so, how can we discover them ?> Dr. Manouvrier said that, in order
to study the anatomy of criminals, it is necessary to consider their
physiological elements, and to divide and subdivide those elements in
the attempt to attach one or more to each specitic crime or series of
crime. It is necessary first to discover a method by which it can be
determined whether criminals differ anatomically from honest men,
and at the same time whether criminals differ from each other, and
wherein. AS Soon as one can recognize certain special anatomic char-
acters as more frequent or more pronounced among criminals or among
such and such category of criminals, one will thea be in the right path
to make an analysis of the subject. This is called to-day, in a vague
and indefinite manner, the tendency to crime, or the tendency to par-
ticular crimes. These tendencies ought to be resolved into their true
physiologic elements, corresponding to certain elementary anatomic
characters. But the problem is complicated by the intervention of
sociologic elements, so that one becomes lost in a labyrinth of specu-
lation. If one supports the theory that criminals are born, it is but
a return to that ancient but now exploded science of phrenology,
which from an examination of the head, and so of the brain, the expert
could determine from the relative size and value of what he called
organs, the virtuous or the vicious character of the individual, which in
particular cases was called the tendency to crime. Dr. Manouvrier
insisted that this theory was completely exploded, that these charae-
teristics were not confined to criminals nor to criminal classes, for all
the anatomic distinctions and psychologic characteristics quoted by
Signor Lombroso were to be found among honest men as well as among
criminals. And he argued that it was not sufficient that you should
find a greater proportion of them among criminals than among honest
men. If Lambroso’s theory, that the man was born a criminal, was to
be taken as the rule, then it must be universal, and that men thus
born inevitably committed crime. If it be the rule then it must oner-
ate in all cases. That it did not so operate proved that it was not the
rule, and therefore he concluded the proposition of anatomic character-
istics peculiar to criminals did not exist.

Manouvrier asked had any one seen an anatomic character which
would serve to characterize exclusively the criminals of any certain
category, such as robbers, thieves, assassins, burglars, etc. No an-
thropologist believes in the existence of such a character. There are
many epileptics, drunkards, imbeciles, degenerates, and inferiors of all
sorts who have never committed a crime; their action has been such
as that they stand fair to the community, and they have a right to be
classed with honest men; no one has a right to class them with ecrimi-

626 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

nals. If some of them have been criminals, who can say that they
would not have been honest if subjected in early life to favorable edu-
cation and sociologic influences? But, on the contrary, who can say
what may not become of the man who has a sound mind in a sound
body if he be subjected to the continued pressure of adverse sociologic
surroundings. Take as a single illustration the feeble cranium capac-
ity which is not without certain relation to feebleness of mind. The
feebleness of mind may make its owner commit crime under cer-
tain deplorable circumstances, but at the same time this may render
him more inoffensive under other circumstances. His unfortunate ana-
tomic character may itself conspire to make him more peaceable, hon-
est, and virtuous. In any event it would be hard to affirm that there
was a greater proportion of feeble-minded men among honest men than
among dishonest. And as with feeble-mindedness, so with the other
anatomic criminal characteristics.

Some one has used the phrase “all other things being equal,” a man
with such and such anatomic characteristics would be more likely to
become a criminal than a man with other characteristics. Manouvrier
assailed this position, saying that it was founded in error. It was
because “all other things” were not equal that the man became crimi-
inal. He asked what were these things, and suggested the infantile life,
familiarity with vice and crime, the surroundings, the want of moral train-
ing, sociologic conditions; and these, he said, were the conditions which
produce the criminals rather than the anatomic characters. He asserted
that the man with characteristics the opposite of Lombroso’s criminal, if
subjected to the conditions, influences, and temptations which lead to-
wards crime, was as likely to become a criminal as was he who possessed
the characteristics described by Lombroso. He assailed also the idea of
a criminal type who stood for the criminal classes. He declared that, in
his opinion, there was no such type. The criminal, the thief, might
have a head shaped one way in one case, and another way in another
case, with crania or facial anomalies, with deep occipital fassettes, and
so forth. But these did not form a type; they were different charac-
teristics which had no relation to each other, and which he did not
believe had any relation to crime or criminal tendencies. It was as
though a man with a long head commits a crime; according to this
theory, that forms a criminal type. A man with a broad head commits
acrime; that forms a criminal type. And, using different peculiarities
as illustrations, where a man with long arms or long legs, or one with
short arms or short legs, commits a crime, then each of these become
in their turn criminal types. Thus you have as criminal types the
long and the short, the round and the square head, the long and the
short arm, and the long and the short leg. Therefore he declared his
opinion that, properly speaking, there was no such thing as a criminal
type. The criminal type was the man who, having submitted to the
sociologie influence of crime, having been born and raised therein

|

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY, 627

and always submitted to them, finds himself in an atmosphere of crime
to which he adapts himself, and so commits it in the same kind of way
as he breathes the air of the ill-ventilated teuement house or cellar in
which he lives. In order to create a type there must be a continuation
of characteristics, a recurrence in given directions, which is repeated
again and again until it becomes fixed, and the required characteristics
are manifested in every normal individual of each generation. This
forms a type: without this continued re-appearance of characteristics,
no type is formed.

Manouvrier declared that no account had been taken of the different
kinds of crimes, crimes which were different in their motives, requir.

‘ing different kinds of individuals to commit them, and that a type for
one would not stand as a type for the other. He divided these thus:

First: Strange crimes, those inexplicable to the normal man, such
as were committed by the insane, by the epileptic, idiots, and the de-
lirious. This ground belongs to pathology and to teratology.

Second: Crimes committed under the influence of passing troubles
or delirium, such as anger, drunkenness, jealousy, fear, etc. It is nee-
essary to distinguish in these criminais thus deranged whe hor they
be habitual or accidental; that is to say, the irascible, ts tabitual
drunkard, the insanely jealous, ete.

Third: The crimes accomplished in cold blood, af: > ~ertain fash-
ion—deliberate, intentional, with malice aforethougut; and he asserted
that it was to the latter class and to that alone the investigations of this
congress should be confined. To the tw* others it went without say-
ing that they might have had predisp«. ° ons to crime as they had pre-
dispositions to the various maladies which influenced them to crime,
some of which they could possibly avoid, others of which they possibly
could not. In these cases it was the malady that caused the crimes,
for which it was responsible, and that the crime in these categories
was not the deliberate act or intent of the criminal.

The distinction between the normal and the pathological state, based
on a physiological analysis, is indispensable in the study of this sub-
ject. But to do this satisfactorily, how great the difficulty? If this
be difficult, how impossible to classify properly the doubtful and inter-
mediate cases? Without these doubtful and intermediate cases being
fully classified we will have naught but physiological disorder. It is
necessary also to distinguish physiologically and anatomically between
the normal and the abnormal state (this of the same persons?). Physi-
ologically it is abnormal to murder or to rob without motive, or at
least without other motive than the mere pleasure, whether it be the
gratification to the criminal or the pleasure he may receive to see an-
other suffer. But one must be an optimist to believe that it is abnor-
mal to covet the property of another, and so coveting to seek to
appropriate it. It is idle not to recognize, in addition to the imperfec-
tions of human nature, the pernicious influence that is exercised by
628 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

the evil education, the evil examples, the natural or factitious needs,
the seductive occasions, the improper liasons, the repugnance to labor,
the pleasures of idleness, the apparently natural willingness to oat the
bread and enjoy the fruits of another’s labor, or the satisfaction of a
former escapade which brought profit, and went unpunished; and, in
a word, it is useless to refuse to recognize the thousand different socio-
logic conditions which may serve to form a million of combinations,
any of which may lead towards crime. With what care is one not
obliged to guard the child and the young person from the hardening
effect of evil influences or from the corruption of his childish innocence
and innate honesty and virtue by the persuasions and example of evil
associates.

Without doubt theft appears execrable, while murder is horrible, to
those young persons who, thanks to a careful education or the precepts
of a good mother, or the influences of a Christian family and surround-
ings, have acquired the habits and situation of honest people; and,
nevertheless, one can easily imagine a combination of circumstances,
an acquaintance with vice and crime, by which such an individual has
cr may become a criminal.

Vice is a monster of such hideous mien,
That to be hated needs but to be seen ;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.

And there are all sorts. -rimes, and that which might be no tempta-
tion in one case might be ove 2owering in another. With all these
difficulties is it not impossible ~ any system of classification to draw
the line between a normal and au abnormal physiologic state, which
will separate the criminal classes from the honest men ?

We have still to consider that there are many physiologic pecul-
iarities which become good or bad qualities according to the circum-
stances, and these circumstances are simply the surroundings, the envi-
ronment. An amorous temperament might be highly appreciated and
complimented in one case, and yet become extremely dangerous in
another. The audacity and courage which might be a source of pride
in the soldier, would become execrable on the part of a robber. An
excellent salesman, the successful drummer, the best newspaper re-
porter, might, with a change of circumstances, a change in his sur-
roundings, his environment, become a most dangerous swindler, or the
best mechanic may become a most dangerous bank burglar or counter-
feiter; and his eminence in crime is attained because of his apparently
natural excellencies, which might have made him, and which went so
far towards making him, an honest and successful man.

Crime is, therefore, not necessarily bound to physiologic peculiarities,
nor isit produced by abnormal or disadvantageous anatomic characters.

It must be remembered that the man, healthy and normal though he
be, is not a man without faults or without tendency to vice. To seek

veya yee
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 629

for this is to seek for the impossible. All men, however honest or vir-
tuous, will be found to have some defect or some vice, otherwise they
would be perfection, which is not to be expected of human nature.

A defect or a vice, whether anatomic or physiologic, does not become
an anomaly simply because one finds it in a criminal. Anatomically
the same remark is to be made; we do not consider as abnormal or in-
ferior every man who is not perfect.

Dr. Manouvrier proceeded to examine the results of anatomic re-
searches made, up to the present time, upon criminals.

No one has vet accomplished or discovered an anatomie character by
which the criminal can be classified into categories, like robbers, swin-
dlers, burglars, etc. The most one can doininvestigating the tendency
to crime by the examination of the criminal himself is to seek for the
specific characteristics, but even these, if found, do not prove that they
are specifically criminal or special to criminals.

All that can be done in this direction, and it is quite another question
from the former, is to discover if the criminals examined present cer-
tain abnormal anatomic characters more frequent and in a higher de-
gree than honest men. To answer either affirmatively or negatively
as to the whole aggregate, or even to the average, would be a hardy
and even dangerous undertaking. There are honest men who are af-
fected in all the unfortunate and much to be regretted ways suggested
by Signor Lombroso—epileptics, imbeciles, degenerates, and even the
vicious and inferiors of all sorts; while those who have been classed as
honest men are capable of becoming criminals of the darkest dye, and
have no more morality or virtue than the most incorrigible robber and
thief.

Dr. Manouvrier referred again to the saying, ‘All other things being
equal,” the abnormal, the inferior, etc., were more likely to become

_criminals, ete., “ but” he demanded, ‘‘ is it certain that all things are
equal for the criminal?” It is in vain that we have remarked the small
number of individuals becoming criminals out of each hundred persons
snbjected to these defective sociologic circumstances. The conditions
and circumstances which are so difficult to weigh, and above all the
infinitely variable combinations, whether taken by themselves or by
their complex tendencies, have a different effect upon each individual.
Among a hundred individuals thus environed, is it not possible to be-
lieve that the ten or twenty who become criminals are those which have
been subjected to the combinations, sociologic and physio-sociologic,
the most evil, the most powerful, and the most effective in leading them
in the wrong path? It is therefore wiser to permit the facts to decide
each case for itself.

The documents published are numerous, but they are not yet suffi-
cient to convince an incredulous anthropologist who finds himself op-
posed to either view, and who proposes to examine them critically.
Occasionally monstrous criminals have been exhibited, but that does
630 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

not prove that criminals are anatomic monsters, and no more does the
fact that some criminals are epileptics prove that all criminals are
epileptics, nor that epileptics become criminals. The statistics ob-
tained and the averages sought to be established have been based
upon insufficient data. The series have not been sufficiently extended,
the figures have been obtained by defective processes, the observa-
tions have been uncertain and different, and the observers or investi-
gators have been novices in many eases, and in others have proceeded
upon different lines, if not by different processes, each one of them
more uncertain and defective than the other. They have cited insig-
nificant differences which they say exist between honest men and
criminals, but which differences may be found in equal proportion
among honest men, if they were so examined, and might also be found
between criminals. They have compared the series of criminals with
series of soldiers; that is to say, with men who are chosen for their
exemption from infirmities or deformities, and have: calculated the
relative frequency of these deformities in the two series, or in the
series of the two classes without regard to the difference in their con-
dition. They have cited cranial peculiarities observed by different
persons operating in different methods and by different rules, with
different standards. And from all these discordant and inharmonious
elements they have sought to establish averages in the respective
classes whether of criminals or of honest men.

In spite of all this incoherence and erroneous and defective process,
whether of gathering facts and obtaining evidence, or of ratiocination,
they have obtained statistics, which, aided slightly by preconceived
opinion, have almost persuaded some of our wisest and best men that
the criminal classes present in their average a proportion. of abnormal
or inferior characters greater than those belonging to the classes of
honest men. The number of these abnormal or inferior characters .
are multiplying themselves day by day in the estimation of these wise
men, and this is being pushed to such extremes as that soon the man
who is believed to be honest will find himself possessing a half dozen
of these criminal characteristics. Thus the system is in danger of
breaking down of its own weight.

We might with propriety ask, what constitutes a criminal type? If,
in making this examination of criminals, one unites the characters
abnormal, pathologic or inferior, taken in an examination of say a
thousand criminals, without considering and arranging upon the other
side the characters found therein which are incompatible with each
other, it will be apparent that the investigation will be without value
and the conclusion based thereon erroneous. One criminal is plagio-
cephalic, another has long arms, another a vermien fossette, etc. But
it is not any one of these that forms a type whether criminal or other-
wise.

In order to form a type one should unite the common characters, eli-
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 631

minating the anomalous and pathologic manifestations. In order to
obtain an abnormal type, it is necessary to choose for each species of
anomalies or alteration an individual in which this anomaly or altera-
tion is well characterized, and then there will be as many types as
there are sorts of anomalies or alterations. We therefore can not have
a type criminal any more than we ean haveatype of human monsters.

In order to characterize criminals in general, it is necessary to ob-
tain the averages, which can be compared with the averages of other
individuals of the same race, the same sex, the same social class, ete.
These latter individuals must themselves be the average of their respec-
tive race, sex, or class, and their averages thus taken should become
the type or standard.

Honest or virtuous men (a category not less vague than that of
criminals) will then be without doubt the metatypic. But these have
not yet been studied nor their type settled. Nevertheless it is these
metatypes that we should compare anatomically with the criminals
if we would make comparison between the anatomic characters of the
two classes. Who form this class of honest and virtuous men that
furnish the standard by which the criminal classes are to be judged?
They may be idle, vicious, evil disposed, imbecile, passionate, brutal,
and all that, if they have but escaped being declared by the law to be
criminals, In this condition of affairs is it possible that any one can
determine anatomically, or physiologically, or psycho-sociologically
what physical characteristics form a criminal type of man?

What are the results? This is a question to be resolved by anatomic
anthropology, of which the comparative anatomy of criminals is no
more than one chapter. The anatomic study of criminals in order to
become of value has need to be extended to a greater area and in
greater detail even than has been here indicated. —

There was, of course, a large discussion among the members of the
congress over this question. Nearly every one had a different idea
concerning it.

Professor Lombroso responded to Dr. Manouvrier. He demanded
how he would distinguish the criminals. The criminals of occasion has
presented abnormal characters. It was not the occasion that made the
criminal, but it was the occasion which was presented to an individual
predisposed to commit the crime. It has been objected that the woman
criminal had no anatomic characteristics, but they who made that
objection forgot that prostitution was the form of the feminine crimi-
nality. He believed somewhat in the idea emitted by Madame
Clemence-Royer on the relation between crime and hybridity, or mix-
ture of races, one being inferior. If the crime is not an anomaly, what
isit? Is ita virtue? He agreed with Dr. Manouvrier that the cra-
nial capacity is not a characteristic of criminality. Bearing upon the
question of atavism he stated that he had found among criminals a
great number or proportion of hernia. This was a regressive char-
632 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

acter. The role of ptomaines in criminal manifestations appeared to
him certain.

M. Tarde responded to Lombreso apropos of the criminal woman.
He maintained that an honest woman presented the characteristics
ascribed to the criminal woman as described by the Italian school, and
nevertheless, woman is less criminal, or takes to crime less than man.
Prostitution is the occasion and not the offense. He declared there
were no anatomic characters proper or peculiar to the criminal, and,
nevertheless, there were organic and physiologic predispositions to
crime. The function made the organ, and the nerve would model the
bone; as the river determines the valley, so the crime makes the crimi-
nal. If in criminal anthropology one can come to show the localization
of criminal characteristics, as has done Broca for the articulate language,
the base of the scientific edifice might be considered established.

M. Moleschott and Dr. Brouardel complimented these gentlemen
upon the profoundness of their studies. The latter considered the
search for the criminal anomaly in physical or anatomical character-
istics as illusory. He could admit the malformations of the pavillion
of the ear reported by Morel, the occipital fossette and the characters
of the same kind, but these were no cause of criminality in themselves,
but only simple indexes of an abnormal development of which the con-
sequences could be many. The epileptics, the insane, show the presence
of ptomaines in their urine. He recalled the observations of an epilep-
tic woman in bis service. Her urine contained a convulsive ptomaine,
which injected into a frog produced the same physiologic effects as
strychnine. The ptomanie products or the leucomanic toxique found
in the veins of the insane and the melancholy result from troubles in
general nutrition. Are they cause or are they effect? The question
demands to be studied.

Dr. Brouardel responded to M. Tarde that if the function made the
organ, it could only do so in the presence of muscular fiber. A woman
without any calf to her leg could never become a dancer.

’M. Bajenoff, director of the Asylum of Riazanne, Russia, could not
accept everything he had found in the works of Lombroso and his col-
leagues, but his and their methods seemed to be scientific. His own
studies cephalometric had shown to him that honest men had a larger
frontal development, while the criminals were better developed in the
parietal and occipital portions of their brain or skull.

Baron Garofalo said that crime might be considered always the
result of an organic anomaly. In speaking of crimes we should con-
sider only those which were declared so by the public conscience and
not always those declared so by the law. Those, for instance, of great
cruelty or extraordinary improbity. But one could perceive that
criminals always manifested moral anomalies and physical anomalies
that were found less frequently in honest men.

Lombroso insisted upon his fundamental distinction between the

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 633

eriminal born and the criminal of occasion. But he conceded that the
existence of criminal anatomic characteristics might be limited or even
absent in the latter class. He declares woman to be a criminal of
occasion, except with prostitution, wherein she represented the born
criminal. But in the criminal born he insisted upon the existence of
physical signs which he declared to be undeniable, and that while their
number and importance vary from one individual to another, yet when
considered together, had a value and signification ‘* absolument incon-
testable.” While he would not deny the influences sociologic, mesologic,
geographic, and orographic, yet the effect of these influences was only
to intensify the criminal characteristics which existed anatomically
and fundamentally. Thus it will be seen that in the discussion between
these two representatives of the different schools, in spite of the appar-
ent diversity of their opinion they came nearly together by an exchange
of partial and reciprocal concession. Yet this harmony was more ap-
parent than real, for in the subsequent discussions of the Congress,
whenever anything was said favoring the existence of a criminal type,
it immediately precipitated a return to the former discussion.

In the discussion of the seventh question the whole argument was
gone over again. The skull of Charlotte Corday, which belonged, with
all guaranty of authenticity, to the collection of Prince Roland Bona-
parte, was presented as an illustration of a born criminal because of
the depth of the occipital fossettes. This immediately brought out
Lombroso, who returned to the attack with all his ardor and power,
and after him Benedikt, of Vienna, Garofalo, Ferri, Brouardel, and
at last, M. Herbette. The latter, with Dr. Brouardel, seemed to be the
most conservative. They presented, each of them, in calm and consid-
erate but elegant language, the necessity for carefui study and profound
investigation. Festina lenta was their motto. While they recom-
mended the investigation and study to be made with ardor, and pushed
to the extreme, they counseled that the conclusions should not be made
hastily, changes should not be made brusquely, opinions not be an-
nounced dogmatically, or by going too rapidly, this science might com-
promise its force, its authority, or its prestige.

The importance of this question or the value of its discussions in this
congress can not be overestimated, for while the substance may have
been argued pro and con in years past, yet here for almost the first
time the scientific men of the world were assembled in an international
congress for its discussion, with full opportunity for preparation, and
with the knowledge that they were here to be brought face to face with
their opponents or those who held different opinions from themselves,
and here they were to appear with what arguments, reasons, statistics
they might have in defense of the position which they claimed to be
right. Accordingly as this question shall be decided, so should there
be a change in the fabric of our criminal jurisprudence. If men are
born criminals then they are not to be punished as they would be if
634 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

otherwise. If, on the other hand, they are educated to be criminals,
then ought our system of education to be seriously and radically
changed. I repeat my impression of the profound importance of this
science.

Question ITI].—Establishment of. regular rules for investigating the
occupants of our prisons and insane asylums by means of anthropom-
etry, or of psychology, by Dr. Sciammana of Rome, reporter.

The study of the criminal had its origin in the purest love for science
and the greatest desire to obtain the truth. Perhaps those who com-
mence to gather the history of celebrated criminals, to trace their organ-
isms, to study their special physical conditions, the environments in
which they have lived, or to search for the idea or theory that possessed
them at the moment of their crime, or the cause which pushed them to
it, did it for naught but scientific curiosity. But in the study of erim-
inal anthropology in these latter days these things have changed, and
now, thanks to the civilization of our epoch, its truth is sought for its
own sake as well as for the practical benefits which may follow. Every
one has recognized the practical importance of the study of criminal an-
thropology. There are, nevertheless, scientists who deny the fecundity
of the researches and who believe that crimes are nothing but the re-
sult of the free will of the criminal, and that the influence which pushes
him to commit the crime had its origin in the same free but evil and
wicked will. But we are not obliged to occupy ourselves with these
scientists, however wise they may be, because they have confined their
investigations only to the field of theory and have never come down to
test of investigation by means of experiments.

Our scientific academies, our medical congress, the administration of
the prisons, are all now occupying themselves over the questions, what
are the individual characteristics of criminals, whether anatomic, psy-
chologic, physiologic or sociologic? And in studying these questions
they are moved by the highest order of both charity and pride. They
are moved to discover the most rational and satisfactory method for the
prevention of crime and the reformation of criminals. Various scientific
societies and bodies have taken steps in this direction.

The Society of Anthropology of Brussels organized a commission
charged to study the characters of professional criminals, and in the
bulletins of that society the members published their investigations on
the criminals confined at the prisons at Louvain.

In 1885 the Medical Congress at Antwerp following a communication
made by Dr. Semal on the relations of criminality and insanity, voted
unanimously to continue these studies, to extend the commission to in-
clude the magistrates who tried the criminals, the administrators of the
penitentiary and the medical profession.

The International Medical Congress of Barcelona recognized the im-
portance of criminal anthropology and declared that the scientific
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 635

inquests were now sufiiciently advanced to demand their practical ap-
plication.

The scientist who desires seriously to study the psychology of a crim-
inal is fairly well received by the prison authorities in all civilized coun-
tries, and a good opportunity is given him for study, whether it shall
be during the life of the criminals or upon their bodies after death.

In these conditions it is our duty, as we find ourselves representing
one of the principal sciences in the world, to report, each one, to this
Congress of Criminal Anthropology, what he has done, what he can do
in his own country, and thus to gather and unite the largest possible
number of discovered and verified facts. This congress, representing
all countries, may thus agree upon certain facts as the result of a once
separate but now united series, and a law be thus established. That law
it is our duty to formulate and proclaim.

In 1884, in Italy, when the general direction of prisons was con-
fided to M. Beltrani-Scalia, one of our most illustrious savants, the
Government ordained the autopsy of all criminals who die in the prison
of the kingdom. It was thus intended to gather from the cadavers of
criminals, a series of anatomic and physiologic facts, by which their
history relative to crime, aided by the documents of the prison, could
be made known.

Dr. Sciammana said he had been charged to formulate a series of
questions, to which all the doctors of the prisons of the kingdoms would
respond, relative to the exterior examination of the cadavers, but not
including anthropometric researches. To respond conscientiously to
the questions by doctors who were entirely unused to them and whose
time was already engaged, required much labor and the consumption
of much time, and it was concluded by them that the work was too
heavy. Therefore, the scheme has not succeeded as well as was ex-
pected, and we have to renounce hope for the present of obtaining this
scientific material for studies in criminology. To obviate the difficulty, a
new formula of questions has been prepared, which while it has reduced
somewhat our scientific information, has also so far reduced the labor of
answering them, as that the result is even more satisfactory than before.

But there is something to which, in relation to the statistics of
crime, the attention of the congress is particularly called. It is not
difficult to report all the information concerning the crimes found in
the records made by the magistrates or courts who tried the prisoners
and the attorney-general who prosecuted them. Also such notes as
have been made while the criminals were in prison. But these things
are of small utility if there is not also gathered the more precious ma-
terial concerning the personality of the criminal, the material psycho-
logic, anthropologic, teratologic and anatomo-pathologic, which should
be studied by competent medical authorities. To accomplish this it is
necessary to follow a single method of study and investigation by which
the facts gathered can be compared as though they were done by the
636 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

same person. Following this system, those who study the materials of
criminology will be able to note the most valuable observations and
pursue researches which they believe to be the most profitable. It is
one of the important works of this congress, or of its successors, to form-
ulate a code of observation and to establish the common means of record-
ing the results.

These researches, made for the purpose of establishing a system of
comparative international statistics, ought to be made both upon the
criminal while living and upon his cadaver when dead. The first should
be an investigation as to the intellectual capacity of the individual, the
modes and manifestations of his affections and moral sense, and the de-
gree of his vital energy and will power. This psychologic investiga-
tion oxrght to be preceded by an anamnestic interrogation of the individ-
ual or by an examination of the criminal process against him. Every
investigation should include the study of his heredity and neuro-pathol-
ogy. These anthropologic and clinical researches should be made be-
fore the criminal has suffered a prolonged imprisonment; if not, his
peculiarities or characteristics may be effected thereby.

The second of the researches should be upon the cadaver, as to its
conditions anthropologiec and pathologic, so that it can be determined
whether the alterations are due to the pre-eminence of morbid tenden-
cies or whether they are the result of an abnormal development due
to some other cause. These researches should be made both upon the
criminal and the insane, and one can thus see the links which form the
psycho-pathologic chain of human life, at one end of which we may find
insanity and at the other criminality. Many insane asylums are confided
to the care of zealous savants who make these studies and note the
results. Attention is called to the exceptional importance of these
researches that can be made in the houses of correction, not alone in
the interest of science, but that they can serve as a complement to the
observations which one may make later upon the same individual if
found in the prison. They also may serve as a guide for the treatment
and reformation of those who are in the house of correction.

But it is necessary to have a special accord among the savants and
the medical authorities of the prisons, insane asylums, and houses of
correction so that one can obtain the same researches and results
throughout this, whether among the living or upon the cadavers. It
is therefore proposed that a commission should be charged to formulate
the questions and to establish what might be called a national code of
researches, to which it is hoped all nations will accord their favor and
adopt.

Question IV.—The conditions determinative of crime and their rela-
tive value.

M. Ferri, professor of penal law in the university at Rome and deputy
of the Italian Parliament, was the reporter.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 637

The natural genesis of crime obeys a fundamental law by which all
crime is only the result of the simultaneous or indivisible concurrence
of the conditions of the individual, whether they be biologic or of the
surroundings where the individual was born, lived, and acted.

Every crime, no matter who its author, no matter under what cir-
cumstances committed, can be explained in one of two ways—either as
the act or fiat of the individual’s free will or as the natural effect of
natural causes. The first of these explanations being without scientific
value, it is impossible to explain scientifically a crime (like every other
action, human or animal) if it is not considered as the product of an or-
ganic constitution or psychic personality which is called upon to act
under certain conditions, either of physical or social surroundings.

It is therefore inexact to affirm that the school of criminal positivists
can reduce crime to a phenomenon purely and exclusively anthropologic,
for, on the contrary, that school has always maintained from its be-
ginning that crime is the effect of multifarious conditions, anthro-
pological, physical, and social, and that these operate together and may
determine the crime by an action simultaneous and inseparable; and
if the researches into the biologic conditions are more abundant or
more apparent because of their novelty, that does not contradict the
influence of the sociologic condition upon crime.

We are to consider on this occasion the relative value of these three
orders of condition in the natural determination to the commission of ~
crime. A response can not be given absolutely or categorically. Be-
sides, the question is frequently misunderstood and misstated. Those
who think that crime is nothing but a phenomenon, purely and exclu-
sively social, without the concurrence in its determination by the
criminal of his organic and psychic anomalies, misunderstand the uni-
versal union of natural forces and forget that one can not limit in an
absolute fashion the infinity of causes, which far or near, direct or
indirect, may combine or conspire to produce every phenomenon.
This position is as erroneous as to say that the life of a mammal is
the effect of the action of a single organ, whether lungs, heart, or
stomach, or to say that it is maintained alone by food or drink or the
oxygen of the atmosphere, and that each of these produces the entire
effect without the aid of the other. If crime be the exclusive product
of the social surrounding, how is one to explain the fact known
to us every day of our lives, that in the same social status and under
equal circumstances of misery, poverty, and ignorance, out of each
one hundred individvals sixty are not criminal, commit no crime, and
out of the remaining forty, five prefer suicide to crime, five become
insane, five become beggars or vagabonds, and only twenty-five out of
the hundred become criminals; and among the latter the crimes com-
mitted differ in variety,—from those the most bloodthirsty, frightful,
and inexcusable, to those which are the mildest misdemeanor, and for
which the prisoner may be discharged with only a reprimand. The
638 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

secondary differences in social conditions which may be found even
among the members of the same family are evidently not sufficient in
themselves to explain the enormous differences of these resulting
actions.

Itis necessary, therefore, to consider this question in a relative sense
and to discover which of the three orders of natural causes of crime has
the greatest influence in the determination to the commission thereof.

A general or categorie answer can not be given, for the relative influ-
ence of the anthropological, physical, and social conditions, vary with
each criminal action according to the psychologic and social characters
of the individual.

When we consider, for example, the three classes of crimes, those
against persons, those against property, those against morality and
virtue, if is evident that each order of the determining conditions, and,
above all, the biologic conditions and the social conditions, have an in-
fluence altogether different in the determination to the crimes of mur-
der, robbery, or violation. And this can be repeated for all categories
of crime.

The undeniable influence of social condition, and above all—economie
condition in the determination to rob or steal, has much less effect
in the determination to murder or violation. And in each category
of crimes the influence of the determining conditions is much accord-
ing to the special forms of criminality. Certain classes of murders
(those of occasion) are evidently the effect of social conditions, as,
for instance, alcoholism, gambling, public opinion, ete., while cer-
tain other murders are the effect of the ferocity or the moral insensi-
bility of the criminal, or else arising from the psycho-pathologic con-
dition which corresponds to organic abnormal conditions. And it is
the same with certain offenses against good morals which are in a great
part the effect of a social condition which condemns some communities
to live together in habitations more as herds of wild beasts than as
human beings, with a brutal promiscuity of sexes and ages, parents,
chiidren, strangers, boys, girls, etce., which will have the effect to pre-
vent every normal sentiment of virtue or modesty and to efface any
such sentiment already formed.

Other crimes of the same nature, but more brutal, are derived from
the biologic conditions of the criminal, whether they be the result of
a sexual psychopathy or a biologic anomaly. While simple theft or
larceny may be somewhat the effect of social or economic conditions,
yet these influences have but slight effect in comparison with the im-
pulsion given by the individual constitution, whether organic or
psychic, in higher crimes, as robbery with violence, or in murder with
intent to rob or steal, or other crimes committed in cold blood.

The same observation can be applied to the conditions of the phys-
ical surroundings, for example, the augmentation in the number of
crimes against property committed during the cold or winter months,

©
*
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 639

while on the other hand the augmentation of cvimes against the person,
whether those of blood or against morality, during the warm or summer
months. The reason for these things is that we find the individuals
affected, to be in that biologic condition wherein they have the least
resistance against these evil intluences.

The limits of this paper do not permit the proofs, whether anthro-
pologic, psychologic, or statistic, of these conclusions, but these are
only the synthesis of numerous studies and positive investigation made
upon the tendency or inducement to crime, by observing the crimi-
nals and the causes which affect them. It has been said that for
certain crimes and criminals the largest influence ought to be recog-
nized or accorded to the physio-psychie conditions of the individual,
which may go from the anthropologic anomaly, scarcely recognizable,
to the pathologic state, the most accentuated, yet this does not exclude
the possible fact that crime may be a consequence of social con-
dition; that the physio-psychic anomalies of the individual are nothing
but the effect of a deleterious social environment which condemns those
which it surrounds to an organic aud psychic degeneration. This ob-
jection might be good when taken in a relative sense, but is without
foundation if one seeks to give it an absolute value.

First, it is necessary toremember that cause and effect are them-
selves only relative, for each effect isin its turn a cause and vice versa ;
so that if misery, poverty, degradation, etc., whether material or moral,
is a cause of degeneration, the degeneration becomes in its turn a cause
of the misery, poverty, and degradation. And so the discussion be-
comes metaphysical. Investigators into the relations of crime in difter-
ent countries (criminal geographers) have claimed a great value for
their statistics when they have given the quality of the crime and the
number of the criminals in various countries or provinces, and sought
to compare one with the other. Instead of these being the differences
in biologic condition, as of race; or of physical conditions, as of climate,
etc.; they may be governed largely by social or economic conditions ;
that is, those arising from the differences in agriculture, industry, labor,
wages, homes, schools, service in the army, etc.

In the absence of any positive verification, the student of this ques-
tion may with propriety ask if the social conditions of a given province
or country have any real effect upon or relation to its criminality, and
whether the social conditions may not be themselves only the effect of
the ethnic characters of intelligence, energy, etc., of its inhabitants and
the conditions of its climate, soil, ete.

But with more precision one can also aver, even outside the conditions
profoundly pathologic, that there are a great number of cases in which
the bio-psychic anomalies of the criminals may be the effect of an envi-
ronment which is physically and morally mephitic.

In each family of several children, in spite of the same surroundings
and like favorable conditions, with the same methods of instruction and

education, there will be individuals of different intellectuality, to be
remarked from the cradle, as well in the quantity or in the quality of
their talent as in their moral and physiologic constitutions. And
this phenomenon, although it be evident only in a small number of
cases of the most accentuated characteristics, whether normal or ab-
normal, does not cease to be true also in the more numerous class of
cases of mediocre characteristics. The physical and social conditions
may have an influence less patent according as the physio-psychic eon-
stitution of the individual is stronger and healthier.

The practical conclusion of these general observations upon the nat-
ural genesis of crime is this: That each crime is the result of indi-
vidual physical and social conditions; and because these conditions
have an influence preponderating more or less in different crimes or
in different forms of criminality, the most sure and certain means that
society has or should employ in its defense against or for the preven-
tion of crime, is twofold ; and both ought to be employed and developed
simultaneously. On the one hand, the amelioration of social condi-
tions, which will serve as a natural prevention of crime; on the other
hand, the elimination of those biologic conditions which determine
crime; these measures of elimination should be perpetual or temporary,
according as their influence on the biologic conditions are permanent
and radical, or as they are temporary and changeable.

There are, said Ferri, five kinds of criminals, which should be dis-
tinguished each from the other and treated accordingly; the born crimi-
nal, the insane criminal, the criminal of occasion, of passion, of habitude.
To prevent crime the government or society should, on the one hand,
ameliorate the social conditions, and, on the other, eliminate from society
either partially or entirely those with defective characters, according
to the degree of danger and the possibility of cure.

M. Alimena declared the essential causes of crime to be the social
condition and hereditary transmission. According to him the crim-
inal was produced by the same processes as were employed by stock-
raisers to rear new races as an improvement of the present races, and
adopting the words of Dr. Lacassagne at Rome, “soclety has no erimi-
nals except such as it merits.”

Dr. Manouvrier took up the battle. He said they had reduced the
importance of the surroundings. If their theory be true that the occa-
sion makes the criminal, then society will make a criminal of the man
who is the most inoffensive, and an inoffensive man of him who is most
disposed to crime: and he argued his side of the question at length,
and with vigor and eloquence.

M. Tarde said we have the agricultural type of man, the military type,
the sailor type, and why should we not have the criminal type? Lom-
broso took it up by saying that it was undoubted that we had among
the criminals the type of the assassin, the type of the robber and bur-
glar, and the type of the thief and swindler, M. Moleschott, senator
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 641

of Italy, mentioned an influence towards crime that had not been no-
ticed, to wit, the heredity social influence; that is, the tradition which
is instilled into the mind of every child, before he knows the difference
between right and wrong, that by which he obtains the rudiments of
his knowledge of right and wrong. Whether it be correct or not, it is
the child’s standard. He gets it not from any knowledge or theory of
justice, but from the tradition of his own neighborhood, as it is taught
by his parents and associates, by the people, and as it is believed by
them.

Dr. Manouvrier responded: The argument of M. Ferri on the pre-dis-
posing importance of the anatomic characters proves nothing, because
he has taken account of only the general sociologie influences, and not
enough of the daily events of infinite details which happen to every
man continually from his birth, and while each one of them was of the
minimum in itself, yet aggregated made a sociologic surrounding in the
life of the man to such extent as to change its form, and make him be-
come what he is. The study of criminality among animals proves that
education can change him to be contrary to all his hereditary in-
stincts, even contrary to his essential anatomic organization. M. Ra-
bourdin succeeded in rendering bis wolf an honest and respectable
animal, so that it would not attack or devour sheep, but would content
himself with his regular meals duly served. The regular meal to the
wolf played the same role that the daily income does to man, by the
grace of which many persons who might easily become criminais pass
their days with high heads in society and enjoy the confidence of their
neighborhoods with a reputation all their lives of being honest men.
He elaborated the necessity of consideration in this matter, not only of
the number of the conditions and circumstances which had an influence
upon us, but still further the arrangement and position relative to these
conditions. The possible combinations became infinite and not to be
measured, and the realization of two cases apparently alike, theoretic-
ally alike, might be practically unlike, and what became in one indi-
vidual entirely possible became in the other entirely impossible. As _ to
his illustration of the wolf, he said that this was introduced to show
how difficult it was to educate any animal to disobey his instincts, but
still the illustration proved that it could be done.

Question V.—The infancy of children in its relation to a predisposi-
tion to crime. Dr. Romeo Taverni, professor of the University of
Catania, Italy, and Dr. Magnan, director of the insane asylum at
Sainte Anne, Paris, reporters.

First part by Dr. Romeo Taverni. The science of anatomy can not
alone tell us the genesis of crime in an individual man, and it never
will, because the moral lite of humanity, the most simple phenomenon,
will carry us to many causes for its explanation, and must be searched
for among many sciences, and will never be found in a single cause
nor by a single method. The problem is to search the brain of the

criminal, and find if there be any anomalies which would authorize
the idea of a degradation or physical degeneration predominating
among that class of men. This problem remains yet an object of
study. The results which have come to us up to the present are not
ecnelusive. Among those who make these studies, some have observed
too small a number of cases, and others have occupied themselves
solely upon the cranial anomalies without interesting themselves with
the anomalies of the brain, or vice versa, and the researches have not
always been exempt from influence or conception @ priort. They have
supposed their task to be to establish imaginary relations between pat-
ticular dispositions, altogether accidental, of the cerebral convolutions
of criminals, and certain normal dispositions of the same convolu-
tions among other persons. The observers have been rare who have
sought among criminals for the peculiarities which the surface of the
cerebral hemispheres present, and their relation with the type of skull
corresponding, and whether these things are or not the same which the
anatomist has already found to exist among individuals not criminals.
Nevertheless, the observation of several scientific anatomists appear to
affirm that there does not exist any special type of skull or of brain in
criminals, and this invites us to consider whether there exists any nor-
mal type of skull or brain of non-criminals, honest men.

In the skull and brain of criminals the degenerate characters appear
with greater frequency than in those not criminals. But the precise
value of this comparative frequency is yet insufficiently determined as
well as the manner in which these degenerative characters are proven,
so that their full power to cause crime or to create a pre-disposition to
crime, does not appear as yet established by any law that can be called
invariable. No order of somatic anomaly encountered among crimi-
nals possesses by itself any signification of a material cause of the delin-
quency nor a physical pre-disposition to delinquency. Taken together
they indicate only the existence of, (1) a degeneration, (2) an organism
by which their development has been arrested, or (3) the return of a
regressive atavism.

But the physical degradation which is recognized by every fact can
not, according to our experience, be found separated from a moral deg-
radation. Observation has taught us that the brain sous-micro-cephalic
is perhaps not apt in its function to conceive principles of which the
presence in the understanding is a force necessary to the existence of
moral life. So that we have learned that a human skull which recalls
by its structure the animal form which it resembles, approaches more
to the ancestral form than another in which the archaic forms have
been effaced.

The moral degradation which physical degradation teaches, belongs
exclusively to the general operation of the moral life. We do not pos-
sess sufficient experimental knowledge of the anatomic structure of
any individual to enable us to say, from this, that he had any determin-
ing tendency towards crime, nor thatit hadin,any way a bearing upon

bp Ra

his moral sense. ‘There is no scientific method by which the relation-
ship between his physical structure and his moral sense can be deter-
mined, whether the study be made during his life or by autopsy.

(2) The first principle.ot the science of criminal anthropology, as
taught in modern times, is to study the criminal rather than the crime.
We have lived among criminals in the prisons of several of the cities
as much of the time as was possible. During several years we have
kept anamnestic observations and have recorded everything which had
relation to the past life of the criminal; but weare not occupied solely
in determining, according to the physiognomy of their crime, whether
there is any such thing as criminals by instinct. We have never omit-
ted an occasion to interrogate the criminal concerning his parents,
his tutors, his friends, his master, his nurses, doctor, all that could give
testimony concerning the infancy and youth of our criminals. One
hundred and twenty-three of these numerous anamnestic tables have
been recorded and give an abundance, an exactitude, a minutia of
historic information of such nature as to cause us truly to believe that
future researches upon this point can do no more. ‘The tables are of
persons condemned for those grave crimes which have been effected by
destruetive means, whether against the person or of property, or one or
both. The sex, age, origin, etat civil, profession, the economic condition,
religion, intellectual culture of criminals have all been investigated
and recorded. There is much variation according to our observation,
but we have considered all descriptions and classes of these criminals
and have formulated this interesting scientific conclusion: That there
is an inaptitude for education in infancy that is evidence of a natural
pre-disposition to crime. We have met with cases and occasions where
we could base a veritable scientific prognosis which has confirmed the
truth of this experimental doctrine.

A methodical investigation has shown to us seventeen children hay-
ing this inaptitude for education, that we have foreseen with assur-
ance they would become criminals. And they became criminals con-
trary to the expectation and belief of a number of savants who were
obstinate in their opinion that these infants were only backward in
their education, and who prophesied that they would succeed if their
pedagogy was appropriate. In order to resolve the grand question
as to the natural predisposition to crime, the science of criminology
ought to demand critical experience of the pedagogic biology. We
deeply regret that the general bureau of criminal statistics can not
give official information in answer to the two questions: How many
children and young people already gathered in the houses of correction
become criminal adults? Andits complement: How many condemned
adults had in their youth been placed in houses of correction ?

(3) Our modern civilization has so improved, that it exceeds the nat-
ural capacity of many individuals who live in our midst. Modern civ-
ilization represents the last and final effort of the individuals who are
644 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

the best equipped. Many persons who now might be regarded as more
or less criminal would have been esteemed honest if they had been
destined to live in the primitive condition of man at the origin of civil-
ization, or, at least, in the civilization of ancient times when our ances-
tors formed the barbaric races of Europe. Each political government
is a vast organism for the social education of all its citizens. Never-
theless there are persons who, by virtue of an instinctive and invin-
cible opposition, reject the possibility of modification by the adapting
efficacy of political government. Out of this opposition grows instinet
ive criminality. Because of it, criminals perform their actions without
being conscious of evil. Giving free course to their instinets, they
have only the consciousness of the good of their own individuality.
Their selfishness seeks only their own good, and if they are not to be
charged with the evil which their acts cause, no more are they entitled
to credit for the good. The family is a small copy of society. The
historic evolution of the family is that of society in general. There
is a law which gives the highest importance to the good order of gen-
eral society. There is also another law, only second to this, the good
order of the family. The law of general society is the same in a
greater sense as is the law of the family. The law of good. order
in the family is intended for the adaptation of the individual to the
social law. It is easy to recognize by observation and experiment that
there are some individuals, however small the number, who present
an insensible, instinctive, and obstinate resistance to the law of the
family. This repugnance to family government is sometimes revealed
during their infancy. These are the individuals who rebel against edu-
cation and good order, whether of the family or of the State. The ini-
tial adaptation of these individuals to the social law, on which are to be
found all ulterior adaptations to law and order, are in a great part
achieved by these individuals during their infancy. We ask,in what
consists this opposition of the individual, the student, the infant, to
the good order, whether of the family or society? How is it explained ?
It appears to consist in the physical impossibility of the individual to
bring into subjection certain of his nervous centers, and his inability
to require them to accommodate themselves in their structure so that
they can execute with facility all those molecular movements on which
depend the acts of obedience to the domestic law, whether of the family
or of society. These should be repeated and executed with so little
friction as to become habitual, and they can be taught by-the ordi-
nary pedagogic process. This want of power in the nervous center
brings about in the young person a default in the impressions neces-
sary, by which the moral life of the individual is made to correspond to
that of society. As a consequence of this default all idealization which
leads to this end, is absent in the student without possible substitu-
tion, nor can he effect it by any spontaneous appreciation of his intel-
ligence.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 645

The sentiments of these individuals not only are closed against every
civilizing action which educative objects commonly exercise, but the
presence of these civilizing influences in the world, and in society or in
the family, excites their opposition. They repulse with great efforts their
educators and teachers when they would direct them toward their moral
teaching, the object of the educators being to prevent this development
of antagonism to the laws of society. The efforts even of the educators
and teachers to prevent this opposition itself begets an opposition and
increases the antagonism of the scholar. The inaptitude for education
onthe part of the individual arises because of a natural and irremediable
defect or a physiologic inaptitude to the social laws of the family that
one observes among some children, sometimes without regard to their
life or surroundings, education, or example. This constitutes their pre-
disposition to crime, and thus has grown up the saying used by many
people without knowing thatit is true science, sometimes expressed
concerning an incorrigible infant, “Ce fils est né pour la guillotine,” * He
was born to be hung.”

Dr. Magnan, the head of the insane asylum at Sainte-Anne, Paris,
was a joint reporter with Monsieur Taverni upon the foregoing ques-
tion. Dr. Magnan differed largely from Taverni. He said the question
as thus presented seems to admit as an accepted fact an infantile pre-
disposition to crime. That, he said, is an assertion maintained by many
criminalists, but one to which he refused his adhesion. He said that
the opinion that attributes to the most of the criminals an ancestral
origin, Which considers the criminal born and raised as a savage sur-
viving our present actual civilization, which contends that the infant
criminality is only a prolonged example of savagery ;—this opinion, he
says, has always broughtforth contradictions, and he cites certain recent
publications :

Tarde, “La criminalité comparée,” Paris, 1886. Topinard, “ L’an-
thropologie criminelle—Revue d’anthropologie, No. 6,” November, 1887.
Ch. Féré, ‘‘ Dégenérescence et criminalite,” Paris, 1888. H. Joly, “Le
crime, Etude sociale,” Paris, 1888.

Continuing his discussion concerning this supposed pre-disposition to
crime, he asked, ‘Can any one dare to say that there are primordial
forms of crime and that they, with the germs of crime, are natural attri-
butes; in other terms, that the infant is naturally disposed to crime
and that the criminal is a man deprived of moral sense?” We think
this to be an erroneous determination of observed phenomena.

At the moment of birth and for some days after, the infant has noth-
ing more than a vegetative life. It cama into the world where it has to
live finding itself surrounded by elements which conflict with its organ-
ism and provoke re-action. These are only the instinctive expressions
of its emotions. All acts of the respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and
other organs are a reflex order and do not demand the intervention of
either mind or brain; mere life is sufficient for their accomplishment
646 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

But soon the acquisitions of the new being begin, and the functions of
the brain increase. The door opens to an exterior world; the sight, the
hearing, the taste, the smell, the sensations within the periphery of the
body permits relations more intimate and complete with the outside
world. These new operations bring into play that region in which
experimental physiology and pathological anatomy have demonstrated
reside the brain centers perceptive and sensitive. This is the organic
substratum of our remembrances. In these differences are deposited
the lingering images of all our sensorial impressions and itis thence that
the centers of ideality draw the necessary material for intellectual
elaboration in the formation of ideas. The images passing first to the
frontal region, become the representative signs of thought and furnish
the elements of our determinations.

The excellent work of Meynert on the structure of the brain has
taught us the system of the fibers of association and of projection which
are the evidence of this functional evolution. If nothing abnormal in-
tervenes, if none of the wheels of the cerebral mechanism are broken
and nothing interferes with the activity of the sensori-motrice of infancy
then the intervention of the center moderators substitute the active
ideo-motrice which, under the influence of the attention, based on ex-
perience, gives place to, or is followed by, the volitional act of reason.
At avery early day in its life the infant begins to obtain or assume
control of itself, say of its hands first, which produce the phenomenon
of attention and of those conflicting motives, agreeable, or the reverse,
which preside over the acts of volition. A chart given in the psychiatry
of Meynert shows the succession of phenomona in one of these simple
mental operations; the image of the flame of the candle thrown by the
apparatus of vision on the center cortical posterior, transmits its repre-
sentation into the frontal region and provokes immediately an involun-
tary movement of the arms and hands towards the brilliant object. A
painful impression, such as a burnt finger however, following an analo-
gous act, acts in an inverse sense upon the psycho-motrice region, and
a movement of shrinking is apparent. The two sensations, the one
pleasurable, the other painful, are compared, the attention is attracted,
the education of the moderate center is affected, recognition and memory
are called into play, and in what before was only an act of impulse be-
comes in fact, or at least has the aspect of, deliberation. From the
simple vegetative life of the first few days of the infant (simple reflex) it
soon passes to the instinctive life (activité sensori-motrice) thence to the
intellectual life (activité ideo-motrice). These three different estates are
but three stages of the evolution of one and the same function. The dif-
ferent modes of cerebral activity, the sentiments, will, attention, memory,
judgment, reason, ete., that constitute the psychologic faculty develop
themselves and become perfected successively by the harmonious action
of all parts of the brain. There is a progressive evolution of the mental
faculties, until they arrive at that state of conscience which enables us to

ee ery:
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 647

discern the true from the false, and the good from the evil; that secret
testimony of the soul which gives approbation for good actions,
which makes reproaches for evil actions, and is a characteristic of moral
sense. The normal individual is not naturally disposed to crime. If
he becomes a criminal (criminal of occasion as well as a criminal of
habit), he does so under the influence of passion, or of vicious education.
The influence of education is well marked in the infant and it takes an
exceptional importance in the categories of these unhappy little ones
of whom Monsieur Theophile Roussel has taught us so much in his re-
markable report made to the Senate on the subjects of abandoned or
mal-treated infants, and his project of a law for their protection.

Many of these unfortunate criminals fall under the influence of de-
plorable surroundings and examples because they are the subjects of a
heredity, which may be only nervous or may be the result of alcoholism
ot their ancestors. This is not a natural pre-disposition for crime, but
is a pathologic tare, adegeneration that troubles the cerebral function.
Sometimes the center moderators of the brain are not sufficiently strong
to repress the unhealthy appetite and curb the improper instinct. Some-
times the center moderators are too feeble to repress the appetites and
refuse the unholy demands of these other centers which are in a state
of erethism; sometimes, on the contrary, the center moderators are out
of equilibrium with themselves and have not that ponderation which, in
their normal state will regulate these instinctive phenomona. But this
is a pathologic state, and this study of the degenerates of these sick
people belongs exclusively to the medical profession and should be sub-
mitted to a clinical investigation.

With this-preliminary discussion the question is separated from theory
and gains in precision and in certainty. Itis now reduced to a question
of diagnosis. The examination still belongs to the dector. That these
individuals will commit offenses and crimes is of small consequence.
The investigation of the doctor goes beyond the commission of the act
which is charged as a crime and the inquest should embrace the life of
the subject, his atavisms, his physical troubles, as well as the intellec-
tual, moral, and affective modification which they have produced. This
detailed analysis and attentive research into the past life of the sub-
ject will serve to clear the question and will furnish the best of elements
of appreciation upon which the doctor can have his judgment.

We now pass. to the discussion proper of the question. The degen-
erate hereditaries are born with the mark of their origin. Their phys-
ical stamps are well known and we do not stop to investigate them.
They are here questions of but secondary importance. We pursue at
present the study of the anomalies of cerebral development. According
to the seat and generalization of the lesions, according to the locality
of the functional troubles, the clinical types will be variable, but in
spite of their diversity the insensible transitions conduct from one
648 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

extremity of the scale to the other, from the degraded idiot to the
degenerated superior, intelligent though out of equilibrium.

We have but little here to say of the idiot who lives after a fashion
purely vegetative, occasionally even only by instinet. The peripheric
or surrounding excitation provoke the cerebral or medullary reflexes ;
but they are naught but simple reflexes and the center moderators do
notintervene. Irom the time the frontal regions become free the sub-
ject commences to penetrate the dominion of realization and of control.
He ceases then to de an idigt and is elevated to the dignity of an im-
becile. The localization of the lesions in such and such a perceptive
center, or of more or less extent in the anterior region, explains to us
that such and sach faculties have survived the general destruction and
thus there exists the partial genius, the learued idiot. The study of
the dis-equilibriums, which as a class furnish the delinquents, belongs
to mental pathology; and there is in them no great anatomic lesions,
but rather the functional troubles on which depend the modification of
the activity of the cerebro-spinal axis. The predominating trouble in
this class is the want of harmony, the failure of equilibrium, not solely
between the mental and intellectual faculties upon one part, and the
sentiments and desires upon the other part, but there is a want of har-
mony of the intellectual faculties between themselves. The want of
equilibrium extends to the moral character. A degenerate hereditaire
may possibly become a Savant, a distinguished magistrate, an eminent
mathematician, a sagacious politician, an efficient administrator, and yet
he may present from the moral point of view those profound defects,
those strange and unaccountable actions; and as on our moral side our
sentiments and desires are the basis of our determination, it, follows that
the brilliant faculties of this individual may be put at the service of an
evil cause, that is, at the service of instinct, appetite, unhealthy senti-
ments, etc., which, owing to the feebleness of the will, pusk him to acts
the most extravagant and sometimes the most dangerous.

The abnormal action of the cerebral and spinal centers gives rise to
curious functional troubles which are of the psychic kind. The syn-
dromiec episodes, the extreme manifestations of dis-equilibrium, bring
to light by their exaggeration, the false psychic mechanism which is
found, though in less degree, among these degenerates. For example:
The illustrations of the effect of the dis-equilibrium are many, and in
their manifestations are different, yet they are all referable and trace-
able to the one cause—disturbance of mental and moral equilibrium, An
individual affected with some malady or just recovered from a spell of
sickness, who becomes haunted, tormented till he shall have recalled
the desired word, or fixed in its proper place the face of a passing
stranger he has somewhere seen before, is conscious that it is only a
phantom, yet is unable to throw off the spell, to banish the image which
possesses his cortical center; or another case a person is driven as by
power, uncontrollable as it is unexplainable, to make an attack upon an
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 649

inoffensive and possibly unknown person whom he may find within
reach of his fist or weapon; or one torn with a desire for drink; all these
are phenomona of the same features and are illustrations of disturbed
equilibriums.

In these cases a conflict is engendered between the posterior brain (of
which this particular center is in a state of erethism), and the moderat-
ing centers. The facts which show these unhealthy impulsions of syn-
dromatic degenerates are analogous to those of other degenerates
whose acts are criminal, while in the preceding similar cases the center
moderators, in spite of their decreased energy, can, for a time at least,
interpose and hold a check or counterbalance on this impulsion. Upon
the contrary, among degeneraie criminals these centers are scarcely
represented. They have small energy, are content to remain idle, will
not carry on the contest, and their feeble compulsion leaves the indi-
vidual without any protest from the anterior region. He is then ruled
by his instinct alone, and this without any counterbalance or govern-
ment.

Conclusion: The infinite changes under which are presented the
mental differences of those who are hereditarily degenerate, though
they may appear much varied, can be definitely classed as follows:

A. Predominance of intellectual faculty, but moral state defective,—
degenerate criminals.

B. Moral state preponderate, but intellectual faculties and aptitudes
inactive or wanting.

C. Apparent equilibrium of the faculties, but prominent defect in
bringing them into usage, as in application, effort, emotion, ete.

Having gotten this conception of the degenerates, it is not astonish-
ing that cerebral anomalies should manifest themselves in their infancy.
These are the original tares which manifest themselves in the psychic
life. From the age of 4 or 5 years, even before avicious education has
had time to influence or modify them, these young subjects will present
characters of impulsiveness, phenomena of mental arrest, intellectual
and moral anomalies, their strange decisions and uncertain actions as
though possessed of an evil spirit and by which they can be segregated
from their fellows and established into a separate class. These are ex-
amples of perverse instinct, cruel impulses, cruelty to animals. Usually
these strange anomalies belong only to a special part of the brain which
may have been gravely affected by cerebral lesions, or thrown com-
pletely out of equilibrium by functional troubles which may provoke in
certain centers a great excitement and in others a diminution of their
activity. In these children one sometimes encounters a hereditary
pathology which may explain the troubles of their cerebral develop-
ment. The individual cases which serve as illustrations of these propo-
Sitions are to be found in great number. They are set forth in medical
journals and are given by the standard medical authors. In each of
these cases and in all others known, it is remarkable that in spite of
650 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

these moral monstrosities one does not find any physical modification,
or, if so, they are almost imperceptible. Neither is there to be found
any physical brand of hereditary or ancestral degeneracy. But a
scrutiny of their pathologic life will reveal that from their infaney they
have been marked by the breaking out of anomalies of character, of in-
stinetive perversion, by affective sentiments which show themselves in
numberless ways. From the very beginning of their psychic life they
have been subject to cerebral anomalies. The history of the infancy of
a degenerate adult will show the evident defective side of a mental
organization from its earliest years and in the case of degenerate infants
we know well what signification to attach to the precocious manifesta-
tions of a morbid heredity.

Dr. Mangan presented several cases and showed the photographs of
many, many more which he said were the hereditary degenerates.
Curious enough the most of them were girls, mainly infants from 7 or
9 years old, to 12 and 14. Their conduct as depicted by him was most
vileand abominable. It was unnecessarily and unprofitably wicked.
Only a few can be given as samples of the best, the worst can not be
presented :

Marguerite V., of 12 years, of good physique, and without any apparent
mark of physical degeneration, rather good looking, intelligent, but
full of vanity, of turbulent and variable humor, subject to violent fits of
anger when she broke anything, beat her mother, stole what she could

lay her hands upon, and excited her brother to steal. She would bite ~

her little brother without motive and without cause, would take a pin
within ber mouth and then invite him to kiss her that she might wound
him. Her memory was fairly good, but it was sexual troubles which
dominated her. - - -

Emile M. would laugh and ery easily and without reason. She had
frequent and violent bursts of temper, stole upon every occasion, stole
the money from the pockets of her father, took whatever lay about of
personal property, would hide in the ashes and cinders the bread, sugar,
etc., destroyed the tools and merchandise in her father’s shop, declaring
she would like to ruin him; she tried to poison him, and on her starting
for school in a gay and laughing manner, left a cup of coffee for her
father in which she had deposited phosphorus. She tried to kill her
twin brother, declaring she would like to kill herseif. Then followed
the sexual troubles. - - -

Louise ©., 9 years old, was the daughter of an insane father. She
lived in a state of continual excitement. Her intelligence was debili-
tated, the evil instincts were highly developed, but nevertheless there
was no evidence of malformation, no physical stigma. She was inea-
pable of attention, turbulent, was discharged from several schools. The
tendency to steal manifested itself at the age of 3 years, and she in-
dulged it upon every occasion and against the property of every per-
son. At 5 years she was arrested after a most violent resistance. She

was a vagabond, would cry without reason, her memory was feeble, she
could read and write, but did not understand arithmetic. She seemed
to have no moral sense, was without modesty and knew not virtue. Her
actions and conduct was such as not to be described.

Augustine L. was 14 years old. She entered St. Anne at 10 years.
Her family back to her grandparents had been seriously affected with
epilepsy, alcoholism, delirium, ete. Her physiognomy was agreeable
and there were no signs of physical degeneration. She had an excita-
ble disposition, her humors were unequal, sometimes she worked with
facility, other times she was incapable of attention. She had alterna-
tions of excitement and depression, was unstable, passionate, idle, liar
to an extreme degree, was tormented by sexual pre-occupation, was
without any moral sense, without modesty, pity, or affection. Never-
theless was not un-intelligent, although her memory had been neglected.
Upon oceasions she was a good worker, but usually she engaged in all
sorts of vagabond, idle, evil life and conduct. - - -

Gorgette J. was 12 years of age. Her physiognomy was agreea-
ble, without any physical stain or stigma that would give the idea that
she was a degenerate. The contrast between her physical appearance
and her moral state presented a series of deformities unbelievable. She
was undisciplined and so could scarcely read or write. Evil practices
commenced at 5 years of age and were frightful. Their relations are
shocking and impossible to relate.

And so there were others: Jeanne D., Lizzie X., and others again
and again quoted by Dr. Magnan, many of whose photographs he ex-
hibited tome. He said those were cited simply as illustrations. The
numbers which had come within his observation were many, but even
this frequency does not cause us only to accord a secondary impor-
tance to these physical signs which are inconstant, and even with the
aid of all they seem very difficult to form or constitute a type.

It is not the general contestable characters as yet undetermined, that
can be used to clear the conscience of the magistrate. Medical juris-
prudence demands from the medical faculty greater certainty. The
medical expert can not attain to that necessary degree of precision
without complete clinical examination in each particular case. Each
case, he said, requires a positive diagnosis in order to respond to the
enigmas of the case or the demands of medico-legal inquest.

Dr. Motet presented some statistics and with them general consider-
ations in order to complete the communication of Dr. Magnan. Of the
cbildren brought to the house of correction during the 10 years from
1874 to 1884, there were 2,524 children admitted; 680 were illiterate ;
1,119 had been abandoned. He was in favor of a strong organization
which would give to these unfortunates an education which was at
once physical, intellectual, and moral. The agricultural penitentiary
colonies were not his ideal when it concerned a child of the large cities.
He declared that the State alone ought to have charge and direction
652 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

of the education of these unfortunates, and to organize a school of in-
dustry where they would be taught proper trades, which trades, he
said, could easily be arranged for what is known in commerce as the
“ articles de Paris,” and the needed knowledge taught to the abandoned
and illiterate child. He gave as his opinion that this was the duty of
the State to provide and care for these children and to so rear them as
they should become honest, respectable, and industrious men and
women instead of the ignorant, illiterate, degenerate criminals, to be-
come which they were now on the high road.

This report gave rise to a great discussion. MM. Motet, Dalifol, Rous-
sel, and Herbette deplored the condition of the law that placed in the
houses of correction—children at an age from 10 to 15 years. If not
already criminals, they soon become perverted and ready to become
criminals. A more humanitarian law would have sent them to school
and to church.

Lombroso said that the perverse instinct of human nature appears
even in the first years of the life of the infant. The infant in his first
months is likely to be vain, proud, selfish, cruel, without moral sense,
without honesty or truth, without knowledge or care for the rights of
others, and without affection; and this, said he, is a criminal embry-
onnaire. He thanked Dr. Magnan for having explained many ob-
secure things found in Meynert. Lombroso explained the origin of
his studies upon the criminality of infants, and said he had done
nothing else than to copy the observers Perez, Spencer, and Tain. In
the cases submitted by Dr. Magnan which he had described and many
more of which he had exhibited the photographs, Lombroso declared
that he could recognize in them the physical characteristics of true
criminals. Those which Dr. Magnan declared to be the evidences of a
general paralysis, were to his (Lombroso’s) mind naught but those of
the criminal born. He could see in the degenerates the criminal epi-
leptic, the imbecile, with their stigmas each peculiar to itself. Of the
seventy-eight photographs in Dr. Bronardel’s album he had found but
two who had not the criminal traits.

MM. Moleschott and Van Hamel came to the defense of the infant
and invoked its inability of discernment. They declared there were no
such things as innate ideas, nor yet was there either criminality or
virtue innate. The infant was born unconscious of either. In its early
infancy it is not chaste because it is unconscious of shame. It has no
respect for the truth, because it does not know the difference between
the truth and a lie. The instinct of destruction is very strong, and it
destroys with pleasure and satisfaction. M. Moleschott called to mind
a trick of Goethe, recounted by himself, in which he described his de-
light in a scene ia his infancy when in the absence of his mother he
committed an absolute carnage among the glass and pottery ware. But
the sentiment of honesty and virtue and truth developed with age.
It is the law of evolution, but it is necessary that we do not confound
this phase of evolution with physiologic malady or with criminality.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 6535

This view was emphasized by M. Roulet, who said he depended largely
upon the physiognomy of the child, to which was added the reports of
its conduct. But he declared that during the early infancy there was
almost always an absence of discernment. He pleaded for precise
detail, close and accurate investigation, and report among the doctors
in order to determine the exact nature and degree of capability; and
this, he said, was the mission of the anthropologist, who was destined
to establish the differential diagnosis of the infant and determine
whether it was a natural-born criminal or not, so as to apply the proper
measures, whether it be the house of correction, or a simple education.

M. Roulet was a lawyer before the court of appeals of Paris, was
secretary of the French union for the defense and the tutelage of infants
in moral danger. He said that he had defended during the month of
October more than four hundred infants before the tribunal of Seine;
infants who were arrested in Paris for insignificant offenses, as vaga-
bondage, begging, and little thefts. He had always pleaded that they
were without discernment; that they should be acquitted of the crime,
but that the state should have charge of their education. If the infant
was acquitted, he demanded that it should be confided to the French
Union for the Saving of Infants. Under the operation of this society,
the infant was placed in the country and watched over by charitable
ladies. If the infant was still evilly disposed, he demanded of the
tribunal that he should be sent to the house of correction until he was
20 years of age, where he became the veritable ward of the state-
The society of the French Union for the Saving of Infants had been
organized in 1887. It was in close relation with the police and with the
magistrates and courts: it had sought and obtained their confidence,
and there were now remitted into its care a great many children who
otherwise must be sent to prison, there to be swallowed up for all time
in the everlasting whirlpool of crime. He asked the aid of some
anthropologist, who was at the same time an anthropometrician, to visit
the Palais de Justice each morning, and go with him through the crowd
of arrested children and make the necessary scientific examination
that could be perpetuated in the form of statistics ; and to this response
Dr. Manouvrier promised his assistance by making that appointment
for each morning. Their rendezvous would be at the anthropometric
laboratory of M. Bertillon.

M. Eschaneur, a Protestant pastor, declared the problem of saving
and regeneration of the infant could be brought about only by love.

Dr. Brouardel gave an interesting description of the physical and
mental state of the gamins of Paris, so bright and intelligent during
their infancy, but which, as has been observed by Lorraine and Tarde,
early present the phenomena of a singular degradation. Near their
fifteenth year their development was arrested, and a sort of physical
decay was produced which led to sexual debasement and perversion,
although it did not exclude certain intellectual aptitudes. Some
654 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

became musicians, poets, and painters. These indicated troubles of
development, which in certain cases produced subjects degraded and
debauched, and who, under favoring circumstances, were disposed to
the genesis of crime.

M. Theophile Roussel, senator, declared that to properly discuss this
question it was necessary to occupy an entire conference. The legis-
lation, however incomplete it might be, had already done much for the
protection of infants. The state, which was the head of the grand
family, assumes more and more of guardianship over the abandoned or
neglected. And he quoted a proposed law which corresponded exactly
to the present preoccupation of this congress.

M. Herbette pursued the same course. How should the infant be
treated by the state? If it is deprived of the care and protection of its
family, the state should become its guardian, its protector, its educator,
its father. The state is now largely the protector of infants, whether
they be deprived of family or not. It protects the infants in the family
against the stupidity, immorality, or crime of the parents; it protects
the unfortunate, whether criminal or not, in the house of correction ; it
protects him before the tribunal and it protects him against himself,
because it refuses to give up its guardianship until he shall have
arrived at majority. The state endeavors to preserve the infant from
ignorance, vice, or crime. While man lives physically, no one has a
right to say that he is morally dead. M. Herbette exhibited a chart of the
penitentiaries of the country. He insisted that the rdle of education
was prevention of the evil in its course, and, without rejecting the inter-
vention of the societies of charity and protection, he demanded above
all the surveillance and control of the state.

Question VI.—The organs and functions of sense among criminals.
Dr. Frigerio and Dr. Ottelinghi, of Turin, were the reporters.
First part by Dr. Frigerio.

I.—The eye of criminals.—(1) The color of the iris: I have examined
the color of the iris of 700 persons normal and 1,500 criminals. I have
encountered a predominance of the chestnut-colored iris amoung the
criminals, a considerable proportion of blue among the violators,
offenders against public morals.

(2) The chromatic sense: This has been examined in 460 criminals
with the method of Holingren. I have encountered but 0.86 per cent.
of daltonism, a proportion which is feeble compared with the obser-
vations made upon Italians, which has usually given from 1 to 3 per
cent. of dischromatopsy.

(3) Visual acuteness: Observations were made upon 100 criminals
with the method of Smellen. For refraction we have met with an ap-
parent predominant emmetropie. This visual acuteness is much more
developed than among other Italians in the corresponding conditions
of life though not criminal.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 655

IT.—The skeletons and the form of the nose among criminals.—My ob-
servations upon the skeletons have been based upon 609 skulls, among
which 397 belong to the normal man, 129 to criminals (75 women and 54
men), 50 were insane, 13 epileptics, and 20 idiots.

The nose of the living person has been studied in 830 persons normal
and 392 criminals, of which latter 193 were thieves, 37 swindlers, 28
robbers, 40 murderers, 22 violators. We also examined 60 insane, 40
epileptics, and 10 idiots.

For the observations made upon the skeleton I have encountered the
anomaly of the nasai echancrure, that furnishes a new abnormal char-
acter of the criminal man, and which I believe to be atavic. ‘To this
must be added frequent irregularity of the nasal overture, osynchie,
and deviation of the nasal bone.

Among the living the larger number of criminals show a nose square
or wavy, of average length, but rather large and often twisted. The
robber has often the broken nose; not large, short, wide, mashed, and
twisted: the assassin straight, long, excessively large, wide, nearly
always protuberant and twisted.

ITI.—The sense of smell among criminals.—I have examined 80 crim-
inals (50 men and 30 wemen) and 50 normal persons, 30 men, the most
part the guards at the prisons, and 20 women of average culture. I com-
posed for that purpose an osmometre made by twelve aqueous solutions
of the essence of giroflée in order of increasing concentration from = 255
to ;35, of which 50 cubic centimetres were each placed in a glass bottle
with ground stopper. The following were my conclusions:

(1) An inferior sense of smell among criminals as compared with nor-
mal persons.

(2) The sense of smell more feeble among women than among men.

(3) The sense of smell more feeble among criminal women than among
normal women.

IV.—The sense of taste among criminals.—I examined 60 habitual erim-
inals, born criminals, 20 criminals of occasion, those which yielded to
passion, sudden impulse, ete., 20 normal men of the inferior classes, 50
professors and students, 20 women of average intellectual culture, 2
criminal women. All were between 20 and 50 years of age.

Observations were made of the taste bitter, taste sweet, and the taste
salty. It was accomplished by a delicate solution of strychnine gohoo3
of sugar zp5a505, and salt, =3,. The tables are omitted but the conclu-
sions are given as follows:

(1) The taste is less developed among criminals than among normal

persons of the same class.
(2) The taste is less developed among those who are criminals born

than among the criminals of occasion.
(3) The sense of taste is slightly less among women than among men.
656 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

(4) The sense of taste among criminal women is inferior to that of
normal women, but is more delicate than among criminal men.
(5) Several cases of partial failure of taste among criminal men.

V.—The sense of hearing among criminals.—Second part by Dr. Otte-
linghi, of Turin.

No organ of sense comes to such perfection in criminals as that of
hearing. We have come to this conclusion both from our direct exam-
ination and from the information received from the prison guards, It
is without doubt true that the disuse of one sense will serve to sharpen
another. As is the sense of touch among the blind, so is the sense of
hearing among those prisoners who are condemned to silence. In our
prisons where silence is required the prisoners have succeeded in es-
tablishing means of communication which might rival the telegraphic
apparatus. The cells are divided by a corridor along which constantly
passes one of the guards, so that the prisoners have no opportunity of
communication with each other. It has come to be known definitely
and certainly that they communicate with each other by means of a
tapping or striking upon the wall or other substance. This sort of tel-
egraphic communication may be likened unto the old Morse alphabet ;
one stroke for a, two for b, and other changes and variations for the
other letters. They did not use the letter h: no reason was given for
the omission. Thus it happens that a prisoner will continue his work
even in the presence of the guard who is watching him, yet by the
strokes which he may make in his work he can communicate with the
other prisoners who may be within earshot, and it does not seem to
make much difference to them whether the surroundings are in silence
or amidst a deafening noise. In case of the latter they seem to be able
by their fineness of hearing to pick out the taps or strokes which form
the letters, as one would read a book or paper silently, while around
him was such a noise as that if he spoke aloud he could scarcely hear
his own voice.

Although the guardians wore slippers shod with cloth or felt, in-
tended to enable them to walk noiselessly, yet every criminal detects
the difference in the step of the various guards so as to tell which one
was approaching.

These examinations were made upon 280 criminals in the prisons.
For the most part the sense of hearing was in excellent condition.
With their eyes bandaged, standing at a distance of 1 or 2 metres, they
could hear the ticktack of a watch. We attempted an experience with
the transmission of sound by the aid of the os craniens, but without
any conclusion. Our examination of insane criminals was also without
conclusion. In the number of autopsies which we made upon insane
criminals we have always found the convolution temporo-sphenoidal in
a proportionate normal state, and have never found that among the
criminals condemned to silence, there seemed to be any difference in
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 657

the convolution of that portion of the brain, which would tend to show
any other than a normal condition or normal activity. If the sharp-
ness of hearing among eriminals is engendered by the inertia or disuse
of the other senses we were unable to find any physiological or anatom-
ical evidence of it in the brains of those whose autopsies we made.

Question VII.—Vhe determination by means of criminal anthropol-
ogy of the class of delinquents to which a given criminal may belong.
Baron Garofalo, vice-president of the civil tribunal of Naples, reporter.

For the determination of this question a psychological study of the
criminal is indispensable, and this is possibly the principal branch of
criminal anthropology. The anatomic characters can only furnish in-
dication, and itis necessary to complete the moral figure of the criminal
by the investigation of his psychic anomaly.

(1) In order to recognize this psychic anomaly the kind of offense will
suffice sometimes. But itis necessary that the phrase “kind of offense”
should be employed distinct from the language of the penal code or the
judicial theory. Thus, for example, in the case of murder the word pre-
meditation may be insufficient to authorize us to class the offender
along with murderers, for one can kill,even with premeditation, the
murderer of his father or the seducer of his sister without being thereby
classed among the criminals born. All the vengeances of blocd, the
vendettas, are of the same kind, because there is not a seeking for that
egotistic satisfaction which compels the man to murder or makes him
criminal born. These offenses are oftener the effect of an altruism,
such as amour propre or case of honor. On the other hand a man may
have the most monstrous criminal nature and yet be a simple murderer
without being an assassin; nor is if any better to determine the assas-
sination from the motive, for either murder or assassination may take
place without any of the motives which influence the average man.
Men in all the enjoyment of their psychic faculties will kill sometimes
as though they were savages; sometimes from vanity, sometimes to
show their force, their address; sometimes to acquire notoriety. And
again, the murder with an apparently sufficient motive, may be nothing
more after all than the work of a maniac, epileptic, hysteric, ete. Even
in the case of brigandage one can not be sure of the nature of the crim-
inal without having examined him physically and morally. Where
brigandage is endemic a son follows his father or his older brother on
an expedition which has no other end than to rob the passing travellers
and to kill them if they should resist, still he is not to be elassed by
anthropologists among the born criminals. It may happen that the brig-
and who, if investigated anthropologically, ethnologically, or morally,
would pass the whole examination with high credit marks, would yet in
the cases cited follow his father or older brother in his trade or profes-
sion and be a brigand.

H, Mis, 129——-42
658 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

A classification of the penal code might make no differences between
these offenses, while anthropologic and psychologic investigations would
have to také account of them.

In order to place a criminal in the degenerate classes of monstrous
criminals it is necessary that he should exhibit an innate or instinctive
cruelty, such as is found in certain savage peoples. In that case the
murder is committed with a purely egotistic aim, that is to say, that
the criminal has been moved by a desire of some individual satisfac-
tion; when there has been on the part of the victim an absence of what
would constitute provocation on the part of a normal man; when the
murder has been accompanied by brutality made with intent to prolong
the agony, that it may give pleasure to the fiendish character of the
eriminal. It is in these terrible crimes, by which the monstroas nature
of the criminal is to be recognized. After this be once established there
is still to distinguish between the born assassin and the insane or
epileptic individual, who is either impelled by an imaginary superior
force or else from want of perception of the nature of crime is held to
be not responsible. :

(2) The cases cited are confessed to be of extreme anomaly. Some-
times the circumstances themselves in which the crime has been com-
mitted are sufficient to show the nature of the criminal. In cases
where this is in doubt and it is desired to determine to which class he
belongs, there should be the examination psychologic and anthropo-
logic. The anthropologic characters are of an importance and often-
times decisive when taken from the diagnosis of infants or young crim-
inals. There are those who are recognized as having this taint of born
criminality by their light offenses, their fighting, lying, cruelty, wan-
tonness, truancy, theft, ete., and those bad boys, incorrigible young-
sters, always doing things not simply mischievous, but things which
they know to be wrong, though they may not be high crimes. But
these individuals, being examined by anthropology, may present at the
same time the characters of moral insanity and of innate criminality.
The sanguinary instinct manifests itself frequently from the first in-
fancy by a series of acts just described as slight offenses, but which are
unjustifiable, frequently repeated, yet of which the parent or teacher
in authority takes no notice, because of the youth or feebleness of the
child. Arrived at manhoed, when he has finished his evil career by
assassination, murder, and the higher crimes, then is remembered these
minor offenses in his infancy which were the fore-runners of graver and
more hideous crimes. In these and similar cases one can find the typ-
ical physiognomy of the assassin, the cold regard, the fixed eye, the
marked cranial deformation, an excessive length of the lower part of the
face, the forehead narrow and retreating, and other regressive signs ;
or, perhaps, such atypie anomalies as plagiocephaly and scaphocephaly
and among those who commit rape the thickness and grossness of the
—_

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 659

lips. And as for the moral sentiment, there may be shown a complete
indifference for the victim. Apathy and egotism may be shown by the
preoccupation of the criminal as to the possible duration of his punish-
ment and the pleasures of which it will deprive him. If the anthropo-
logic student will charge up against the delinquent the kind and the
frequency of these small offenses in his extreme infancy, will note his
psychologic and anthropologic characters, and take into account the
heredity of vice, of insanity, or of crime, he can prophesy that the infant
or young person with these mental and moral characteristics will, if the
provocation or opportunity arise, become an assassin. It is not rare
for the psychopathic form to manifest itself in subsequent time, and
then one may fairly conclude it to be a case of either insanity, epilepsy,
or a born criminal.

(3) The physical observation of the delinquent should be continued,
to the end that one may distinguish the impulsive characters; that is
to say, those characters which impede or prevent moral resistance to
the passions which excite to crime, principally anger, vengeance, alco-
holism, insanity, epilepsy, and certain other characteristics which de-
scend by heredity. ‘This class of delinquents are midway between the
malefactors by instinct and those of occasion. Although this tendency
to erime is a germ in their individual organisms, which becomes semi-
pathologic, yet the geri will rest latent and unproductive, if there is
not added to it an impulsion from the exterior world. This impulsion
is required in order to cause them to commit crime which leads us to
class them as criminals of occasion. As soon as this exterior impulsion
is fuund to be not necessary, or, if the crime is immoderate as compared
with the impulsion, then the delinquent is to be classed as a criminal
born.

The regressive anomalies of the skull and of the physiognomic type
of inferior races that has been so frequently remarked in the criminal
born are nearly always absent from the impulsive criminal. But on the
other hand these latter are characterized by nervous anomalies, and by
other striking maladies. It follows as a result of this theory that in
murders or assaults arising from a quarrel or riot, one Can easily under-
stand how there can be two classes of criminals—the criminal impul-
sive, and the criminal by chance. The first, which are partially crim-
inals born, are much more dangerous to society than the latter. They
may commit crime from disease as much as from instinct and ought to
be made objects of particular treatment, as much by the medical man
in the hospital as the policeman in the prison.

(4) The terms used in jurisprudence for the description of a great
number of crimes signifies nearly nothing for the anthropologist. In
the science of criminal anthropology the author of a given crime may
be ranged under different classes of criminals. He may be a criminal
born; he may be a criminal impulsive, or only a criminal of occasion.
660 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

According to the penal law there are but two terms: the criminal and
the punishment, while criminal anthropology, the new science, has three
terms: (1) the crime, (2) the criminal, and (3) the punishment or the
adapted repressive measures. These repressive measures are to be
again divided according as they are applied to the different classes of
criminals.

(5) In classing as criminals those who commit offenses against prop-
erty, such as robbers, thieves, swindlers, forgers, ete., psychology
plays a rdle even more important than anthropology. The sentiment
of probity is less instinctive than that of charity or pity and is not de-
pendent upon the organism because it is more recent and less trans-
missible by heredity. It happens that exterior causes, such as the
surroundings, conditions, examples, education, and economie conditions
may have a greater effect upon this species of criminality. In the case
of the robber or thief, along with the morbid form, kleptomania, there
is an instinct to steal caused by heredity or atavism, which is often
manifested by anthropologic signs and above all by special physiognomy.
The most striking characters are those mentioned by Lombroso of the
extreme mobility of the face and hands, small and bright eye, heavy
and continuous eyebrows, the camus nose, small and retreating fore-
head, ete.

When these characteristics are found upon the recidivist, that is,
the incorrigible criminal, one can be sure that he has to do with acrim-
inal born. It is frequent that among vagabonds, robbers, thieves,
and other criminals against property there is a physical and moral
neurastheny, a term coined by Benedikt, of Vienna; that is to say, an
aversion to labor and to every moral combat for the right, derived from
a nervous constitution, and which is combined with, or perhaps has
produced a desire to enjoy the pleasures of life and to indulge in its
luxuries quite beyond his means. When the circumstances of life are
hard upon such an individual, and he is subjected to an economic or
social crisis, he is more likely to become a criminal, because crime may
aid him in the satisfaction of his desires. To this neurasthenic class
belong the vagabonds, thieves, and swindlers, whose improbity may
have commenced by unfortunate circumstances, such as being out of
work, loss of place, evil company, bad example, and improper moral
education, and which ends in his becoming an instinctive criminal.
The neurasthenic and the habitual or instinctive criminai ought there-
fore to be grouped together, because they are equally incorrigible,
until at least the social and economie situation of the former shall be-
come so changed as to offer them the enjoyment of all pleasures and
luxuries which they desire without the need to work. It is necessary,
however, to make exceptions for young persons who are driven into

vagabondage and are thieves by bad examples, and evil surroundings
and associations. Although they may have become habitual criminals,
|

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 661

yet they may not be incorrigible, certainly not until they shall have
arrived at the age when the character is fixed.

(6) It follows as a necessary conclusion that as each of these classes
of delinquents may be determined with anything approaching pre.
cision an enlightened legislature should adopt a special treatment. It
is not astonishing that the legislators and magistrates who make and

’ deal with the criminal laws should repulse the services and the aid of

psychology and anthropology, and should persist in their @ priori per-
ceptions and in uniform precepts, without giving consideration to the
infinite variety in criminals produced by so many different causes and
infiuenced so differently by surroundings, all of which goin such supreme
degree to form the guilty and reprehensible intent with which the crime
was committed, or which on the other hand may take away that in-
tent and form either a justification or excuse.

M. Puglia gave his unqualified assent and support to the propositions
advanced by Baron Garofalo.

M. Alimena, on the contrary, assailed the entire classification. <Ac-
cording to him the examination, whether anthropological, physical, or
psychological, was insutficient to more than raise presumptions and
invent theories, while certainty was required in dealing with judicial
questions and eases. If exterior and physical anomalies are appreci-
ated, why not apply the same rule to internal anomalies? What, he
demanded, did it signify as to the depth or size, more or less, of the
occipital fossette in the skull of Charlotte Corday which we now saw
in the collection of Prince Roland Bonaparte? If it indicates, as is
claimed, that she was a born criminal, then instead of being a heroine
who rid the world of a mouster, she was naught but a common, vulgar,
impulsive murderess.

The difference should be recognized between a purely scientific treat-
ment of criminals and the practical treatment which they must receive
under the law. If science advances so does the law. But they go at
different rates. Science flies on wings of the mind, while the law
marches along in stately and dignified tread with leaden sandals.
Scientific errors are easily corrected. They do no harm. They come
down upon us and envelop us as does the fog the earth, but like the
mists of the morning which fade away before the sunlight of heaven,
so do they under the light of investigation ; while the jurisprudence of
the country, solid and enduring, and, more like the earth which has been
hidden, remains after the fog has been dissolved into a few drops of
dew.

He expressed his opinion that of al) these sciences, psychology
would be most productive in results, and he much regretted that the
schools of law and of medicine did not teach this science.

Lombroso responded that his works or his opinions were not opposed
to nor contradicted by any psychologic diagnosis. He returned to the
skull of Charlotte Corday, which he said demonstrated anatomic char-
662 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

acters of the criminal born, such as platycephalic, the occipital fossette,
and other characters of the viril skull.

Dr. Topinard responded to him by affirming that the skull of Char-
lotte Corday was normal, and that it presents all the proper characters
of the skull of a woman. The platycephalic was a normal character
and the vermicular fossette was not an anomaly, and there was nothing
irregular in the skull unless it should be its platycephalic, and he said
it was rare or never that a skull was the same in all its parts and on
beth its sides. Nearly all skulls showed a difference or distinction on
the one side or the other.

M. Benedikt opposed this theory of the craniometrie methods and
also the psychologic characteristics enumerated by Baron Garofalo,
which, he said, would belong equally to the dyspepties and the neural-
itics. It was easy to make hypotheses, and according to his belief one
had as much right to say that the occipital fossette was an indication
of a pre-disposition to hemorrhoids as much as it was to crime.

Ferri and Lombroso replied vigorously to Dr. Benedikt, while Sen-
ator Moleschott came to his aid.

Dr. Brouardel recalled the speakers to the discussion of the report of
Baron Garofalo. The problem proposed by him was a classification of
criminals. The crime itself is insufficient to class the criminal. The
decision must be upon all the evidence. One insane act is not suffi-
cient to characterize an insane person. It must be established by the
antecedents of the subject, his former life, his peculiarities, and his
physical signs. This was the only true system to be pursued, and any
purely physical or purely psychologic examination wouid be insuffi-
cient and was to be repulsed entirely. Suppose the theories of Baron
Garofalo to prevail, then a criminal born, according to his views, should
be arrested at once and confined in some special establishment.

M. Herbette took up the discussion and enumerated the results ob-
tained by the administration of the penitentiaries. We have, said he,
at one time the prisoners and the sick people. The prison is not a hos-
pital. The hospital is an association for the good of the sick and where
they may furnish a subject of study and experience. In the most of
them the entry is free, and in all the departure equally free. In the
prison the situation is entirely different. The prisoner is imprisoned as
a result of the penal right of society to protect itself.

M. Lacassagne protested that for the sake of science, for the sake of
society, for the sake of investigation into crime and its causes, the law
should give to the prison authorities the right to investigate the biology
of the criminal and the sole control of the cadaver of the criminal,
whether his death was inflicted by the law or came from other causes.

But M. Herbette declared he would not go so far, and he counseled
patience, study, careful investigation, great conservatism, regard for
the feelings of the public, so to the end there should be no revulsion on
their part, for the reforms which were forced might bring great risks to.
science and compromise its success. "
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 663

Question VITI.—The conditional liberation of criminals. Dr. Semal,
director of the insane asylum of the state at Mons, Belgium, reporter.

(1) In studying the right of society to punish a criminal, one is
struck with the insistance of the law upon the characters and circum-
stances of the offense, without the slightest examination into the per-
sonalities or conditions of the delinquent. Dr. Semal advocated a
psycho-nmoral examination of the delinquent in order to determine his
condition, whether he was a confirmed criminal or only a criminal on
oceasion; and whether he might not in the one ease be given a condi-
tional liberation, and in the other be continued indefinitely in confine-
ment. One of the theories of the penal code which forms a foundation
for the right to punish, is the possible reformation of the delinquent;
but the idea of a fixed term of imprisonment as a punishment for one
class, and another term for another class of offenders, is opposed to
the theory of possible reformation. To give this idea of reformation
full effect, there should be a conditional liberation which should take
effect sooner in one proper case, and later, or not at all, in an improper
case. He declared a scheme of conditional liberation could be provided
which would be more rational, more humane, and more successful in
the reformation of criminals.

The jurist, in writing on this subject, contents himself to remain
within the limits of the written law, and declares himself satisfied by
the uniform and inflexible application of formulas which have been ecrys-
tallized in the codes. The decay of these doctrines will appear where
to the safety of the public or society is added the desire to reform the
criminal. But their destruction will not be complete until crime is re-
garded as a natural phenomenon which can be prevented by a study of
the social and individual causes which lead up to it. From this there
are to be made two deductions: (1) If the punishment is the principal
object of the repressive system, why should it be prolonged when it has
contributed all it can to the reformation of the condemned? This is the
foundation of conditional liberation. (2) If the penal condemnation is
sufficient to awaken in the heart of the delinquent his heretofore smoth-
ered sentiments of right and justice, and if the moral effect of his offense
is complete by the fact of his condemnation, why should he be com-
pelled to serve, or even enter upon, a term of imprisonment? And
from this has sprung the theory of conditional sentence. These two
propositions contain the germs of the radical reform of the repressive
system. They tend to give to the convicted criminal the opportunity to
determine by his conduct if he will have his sentence postponed indefi-
nitely, and his liberation made at once, even though it be on probation
and under surveillance, he to be returned to prison on his first move-
ment towards a return to his former criminal life.

(2) The proposed law of conditional liberation would operate upon
the sentiments of the condemned person, of which we can suppose the
664 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

existence; and in order to establish witb certainty this proposition, it
is proposed to give him a scientific psychologic examination.

Man can be judged only by his acts. There may be a sort of latent
criminality always ready to explode under the shock of propitious ecir-
cumstances, as an expression of a diathesic stage dominated by hered-
ity, and of which biologic science can enumerate the signs. A psycho-
logic analysis is indispensablein order to determine these questions. The
necessity of a psychologic examination of the delinquent is imposed
because it is tbe only method by which one can determine the existence
of such sentiments as will authorize the conditional liberation or ought
to postpone the punishment.

(3) As to the practicability of this we have to remark that the pres-
ent theory and past experience has only resulted in a multiplication of
punishment without having reduced the extent of criminality; and
this, whether in the number of the crimes, their frequency, or their
grades. Bythe old system neither the genesis or evolution of crime
has been studied ; neither the legislator nor the jurist seem to have
ever considered why an evil-minded minority should persevere in the
commission of crime while the majority of people are honest, well dis-
posed, and of good repute. It is therefore towards the modern school
of positivists that we must turn for a solution of this matter, because
it alone seems to have studied crime as a natural phenomenon arising
from multiple causes.

(4) The principle of the reformation of the criminal by the opera-
tion of the penal system is in contradiction with the fixation in ad-
vance of the duration of the cure to which the delinquent has to sub-
mit. The new theory of jurisprudence will permit whoever or what-
ever criminal shall show himself to be repentant and inoffensive to be
conditionally liberated, and this offer should be made or the opportu-
nity given even to those who refuse or those who find themselves in
the impossibility to reform. The reformation of the delinquent, or at
least his resignation to and respect for social laws, is the essence ot
this theory of conditional liberation. But, as one can count to a cer-
tain extent upon the vitality of the criminal instinct, and with the per-
sistence of the social conditions which nourished it, it is necessary to
prepare for the eventuality of a prolonged incarceration which may be
regarded as the result of incurability on the part of the criminal. The
idea is to proportion the length of the imprisonment according to the
nature of the delinquent, to the degree of his perversity, and the dan-
ger of his return to society before his evil tendencies shall have become
enfeebled or neutralized, It is evident that this is more rational than
to fix a time certain for his imprisonment according to the condition
of his offense, which may furnish only an isolated system of the moral
malady with whieh he has been attacked and which was the cause of
the commission of his crime. The proposed law of conditional libera-
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 665

tion ean correct any erroneous verdict or judgment or work any reduc-
tion of the term of imprisonment.

(5) The proposed law of conditional condemnation is upon the same
principle as that of conditional liberation. It corresponds somewhat
to the practice prevailing in some States of the United States of sus-.
pension of sentence during the indefinite period of good behavior.
It is a measure generous and wise, is addressed to delinquents of
tender years,—those who have been arrested for the first time, who may
be the victims of circumstances, who are without criminal intent, and
who, if the sentence be suspended, would probably never be guilty of
the offense again, while, if their sentence should now be earried into
execution, it would almost certainly result in the loss to society of one
who might become an honest and respected member thereof, and gain
in his place he who might easily become a hardened criminal. But the
application of this principle is or will be surronnded by researches ex-
tremely delicate, which ought to be highly scientific and so length-
ened as to include the antecedents of the delinquent, his life, his
raising, his surroundings, and to get if possible into the interior of his
soul. The word delicate” has been used, and truly this is necessary,
for the responsibility is great, for as the judge may by refusal to sus-
peud sentence lose a member of good society, so also he may by a sus-
pension of sentence grant indulgence to unworthy subjects and be
deceived by hypocritical pretenses and promises, crocodile tears manu-
factured for the occasion and practiced upon him by a hardened and
instinctive criminal.

(6) The instinctive delinquency of the young criminal is not abso-
lutely in relation with the enormity of the crime. This imposes upon
the jurist the necessity of @ proper selection from amoung the arrested
as well as among those imprisoned as to whom, in justice, to apply the
different systems of treatment. The operation of these two systems,
the one of which operates upon those subjects which can possibly be
reformed, the other with the prolonged and continued punishment and
incarceration, even in solitary confinement, of incorrigible subjects, who,
if allowed their liberty in the least degree, will use it only for the con-
tamination of their fellow-prisoners and the preparation and arrange-
ment for themselves to enter into a wider sphere of crime upon their
release. These are the foundations of the two systems.

(7) Individualization is necessary in order to recognize and class the
delinquents, and to determine whether the medicine to be administered
to him for his cure should be of inearceration or liberation. Sometimes
it might be better to adopt the plan of solitary confinement in order to
conduct properly this individualization. An antbropologic examina-
tion or a psychologic analysis may not be sufficient to determine to
which class he should belong, and therefore he should be tried under
different conditions, always bringing out his real and heartfelt senti-
ment, thus enabling one to determine to which class he belongs and
666 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

whether he should be conditionaliy liberated or continued in solitary
confinement. To this end an opportunity must be given both by re-
straining his liberty until he shall bein solitary confinement or extend-
ing it until he shall be conditionally liberated. His actions and the
psychologic effect which this has upon him must determine the future
course to be pursued with him. In doubtful cases the conditional liber-
ation is the most rational, as it is the most humane. It gives the
delinquent an opportunity to reclaim himself, and gives him a guaranty
that his attempts at reformation will be well seconded.

(8) After having returned to society those of whom we have nothing
more to fear in the way of criminal offenses, after having taken all
necessary precautions for those who are to remain under surveillance
and possible return, it is necessary to take steps for those individuals
who are by nature rebels and refractory, who reject all ordinary means
of reformation, who are delinquents by habitude, and: are instinctive
criminals. For these individuals their detention, even to solitary con-
finement, with severe and hard labor, should be kept up until they give
proof of their repentance. If this is refused then we in France and on
the continent can only relegate them to a penal colony in a distant
ocean or else to solitary confinement in one of our home penitentiaries.
The relegation of a recidivist or an incorrigible to a penal colony, soli-
tary confinement, or some other form of severe punishment, or else
treating him as sick or insane and sending of him to a prison asylum ;
these are the logical corollaries of the propositions for conditional lib-
eration.

The criminal, conditionally liberated, should be required to report
for examination whenever needed, and thus the prisoners who are under
condemnation of the law would become physical subjects for the study
of crime in its psychologic as well as anthropologic phases, and the
prison become as well an asylum and a hospital, affording a elinie for
the lawyer, for the doctor, the judge, and the lawmaker.

M. Alimena called the attention of the congress to the fact that this
question had been discussed for a long time and in many places by
legislators and jurists, and he referred to the first congress of the Inter-
national Union of Criminal Law, held at Brussels, in 1889, where the
discussion took place upon the thesis presented by Senator Michaud
on the lawof pardon. He said three methods had been proposed—the
conditional sentence, which was enforced in Belgium; the suspension of
judgment, which was practiced in England, America, and Australia;
and finally that of blame, set forth in the German code, the Russian,
Spanish, Portugese, and in some of the cantons of Switzerland and
provinees of Italy.

M. Drill remarked that the system of conditional liberation required
the exercise of two tunctions—that of the judgment of the court passing
upon the guilt of the criminal, and the ulterior or subsequent treatment of
the criminal, and that these were functions entirely different and ought

—-+- eee ee
CRIMINAL ANTITROPOLOGY. 667

to be separated. The first belonged to the judge and the court, and the
second belonged to the administration of the penitentiary. He thought
these ought to be kept separate, and it was clearly his opinion that the
judge or the court alone should decide upon the culpability of the in-
dividual and the application of the penal law. The administration of
the penitentiary should be composed of, or should eall to its aid, the
most competent scientific gentlemen, who would be able to pass upon
any question concerning the physical, physiological, or psychological
characteristics of the individual, and this, taking in consideration his
antecedents, his social condition and surroundings, his education, com-
panions, ete., together with his conduct while in prison, would enable
them to decide upon the application of the conditional liberation.*

M. Bertillon, while giving all credit to the scientific investigations
mentioned, begged the congress not to forget that the final end was
primarily for the safety and well-being of society, and the reformation
or well-being of the criminal only secondary.

(Question 1X.—Crime in its relation with ethnography. Dr. Alvarez
Taladriz, of Valladalid, reporter.

M. Ferri had already described the ethnic influence upon crime, so
Dr. Taladriz sought to establish a tendency towards crime on the part
of a whole people; the criminality of a nation or of races. He sought
to show how the crimes in the Northern, Middle, and Southern Spain,
were different, and also the difference in criminals. He declared this
difference to be due to the advent of Charles I and Philip II, as Kings,
and that it was but an exposition of the ferocious instinet of the primi-
tive inhabitants of the forests of Germany.

The mesologic influences are confirmed by history in such manner as
that it ought to recall to the student of sociologic influence the statis-
tics of offenses committed in the cold and warm countries, those be-
tween the region of the North and the region of the South. These ques-
tions have not been studied from a geographic or ethnie point of view.
It is proper that they should be. There probably is no place in which
this ethnic influence upon crime could be studied with greater success
and accuracy than in Spain, where there are such ethnic differences
between the people of the different parts of that country, and where
one will find a corresponding difference in the crimes committed. In
the north of Spain offenses are of a character distinet from those of
the center and south, Crimes against person and property are rare.
Those which exist are the result of inherited, primitive usages and cus-
toms like in the vast mountainous Basque provinees of Catalonia, the
kingdoms of Galicia, the Asturias, and Leon, where assassination and
homicide show the terrible characters of the sediment of population

deposited by the preceding races of Germany during the grand period
of invasion of the tribes of the north who occupied these regions more
than any other part of the peninsula.

The miners of the center of Spain do not present those characters of
ferocity, because their elements are a concourse of varied and multiplied
antecedents of the successive dominations which have come to pass in
the peninsula.

In the kingdoms of Valencia and the Andulasian provinces, the crimi-
nal customs of the Arab race were handed down as a souvenir of the
Kabyles, where the inhabitants organized themselves into a band of
malefactors. The crimes of homicide, assassination, in the majority of
cases were only the result of the passion of jealousy coupled with a
hate truly African and which considerably augments the number of
offenses against persons and property. Nevertheless, we recall certain
acts of nobility, the Arab hospitality, ete. True, there may be excep-
tions found, as there will always be, to general rules, but the conclu-
sions are:

(1) The physiologic characters of the criminal type manifest them-
selves in a constant and uniform manner in all epochs and in all races,
and without other variations than those imposed by accidental and
external circumstances from these epochs and races.

(2) The conditions of race, climate, geography have their influences
upon the senses and passions of mankind and upon the development of
crime, as well as upon sociology, religion, economics, or politics.

(3) The grand offenses committed by races and nations ought to be
an object of an international penal code by which they could be pun-
ished with a certainty and uniformity that would bring them to an end ;
while in the same code could be declared the sacred right of nations
and of individuals, which should be recognized by all the world.

Question (37).—Medico-psychologic observations upon Russian crimi-
nals. M. J. Orchanski, of Charkow, Russia, reporter.

M. Orechanski is professor of the university at Charkow. He was
not present to read his paper, and it was presented by Dr. Brouardel
in connection with Question IX. Only the conclusions were read and
they were in opposition to the Italian school. The paper consisted of
arguments and deductions, and did not deal in testimony or statistics.

Dr. Topinard took the opportunity to present his opposition to the
title “Criminal Anthropology” and thought it should be replaced by
that of ‘‘Criminology,” as being shorter, easier, better understood,
having a clearer meaning, and with everything to recommend the
change.

Dr. Manouvrier preferred the the term “Anthropologie Juridique.”

Question X.—The ancient and new theories of moral responsibility.
M. Tarde, juge @instruction at Sarlet, Dordogne, reporter.
This was a long and learned disquisition upon moral responsibility.
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 669

The opening paragraph declared that moral responsibility depended
upon free will, which, at least, in its relation to crime, was a hypothesis
without foundation in truth or justification in law. The discussion
became more philosophical and metaphysical than practical. The most
careful report would fail to do it justice or render satisfaction to its
author, and it is therefore deemed wise to omit it.

Question XI.—The criminal process considered from a point of view
of sociology. M. A. Pugliese, of Trani, reporter,

The moment appears opportune to make the criminal process an ob-
ject of the study of penal sociology.

(1) The criminal process is an institution of State established in the
social interest, having for its end the search for and repression of crime.
The general rules of its formation provide for the discovery and appre-
ciation of crime, the punishment of the author, and the conciliation of
the social and individual interest. To do this properly requires a
magistrate who has technical as well as general knowledge. It is not
sufficient in these times of the discovery and investigations of anthro-
pology that he should be simply a judge or even ajurist. it is necessary
that he should be acquainted with the studies of anthropology and
sociology ; that he should understand the social surroundings in which
the crime is committed as well as the men who commit it. Whether
the State should found the necessary institutions of learning for the
training of these magistrates was a question for discussion, but it is
indisputable that they should have a special training. Prosecutors are
charged with the trial of criminal offenses. In western Europe these
things are not satisfactory ; a juge @ instruction, or prosecuting officer,
scarcely possesses any special training or had any special qualification to
fit him for his position. Perhaps he has never written a criminal process,
never seen a cadaver, or attended an autopsy. He knows nothing of
anthropology nor of penal sociology, and yet he is called upon to exer-
cise tunctions the most delicate, most difficult, on which depends the
safety of the citizens and their social surety. He obtains his experience
in corpore vivo; he learns at the expense of society. In doing black-
smith’s work he becomes a blacksmith, and when he shall have become
habituated to his position, and qualified in even a mediocre manner, he
will be changed to another place with another duty, and another person
will replace him to begin again this new life of study and _ practice.
This is not a system but is only education. The faults, and the scandal
are enormous. Sixty per cent. of criminal processes fail. The real
culpables have a good chance of escape, while the innocent run the
danger of losing their honor, their liberty, and, possibly, their life.

It is evident that the criminal process should not, as at present, be
limited to the gathering of the proofs pell mell. On the contrary, the
prosecutor ought to study the evil and secret causes of the criminal
actions, and from them deduce the true reason of punishment. They
670 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

ought to seek also for the precedents somatic, psychic, and social, and
discover the conditions, surroundings, environments, not only of this
particular criminal but of all that have gone to produce such criminal
phenomena. It is now time to search for such indications as can be
furnished by anthropology and by criminal statistics, not only for iden-
tity, as given by the works of Bertillon, Voisin, and Herbette, but also
the biology of crime as has been investigated by Ferri, Garofalo, and
Righini. .

(2) The investigation and trial should be confided to those who
have been technically educated, experts of special training, one for
the prosecution and another chosen by the defense. The defense ought
to be admitted to take measures, to ask questions of medical juris-
prudence, such as he may need in the interest of his client, and upon
these questions the debate should take piace and the judgment
rendered. This would not be a mere opinion, but would be a true de-
cision of a technical commission, which would settle at once and for-
ever all debate upon that question. It would be a trial before a tech-
nical jury as to the questions of medicine or medical jurisprudence or
psychiatvy. It would also raise the professional dignity of the medical
jury, and would assure the world that, cost what it might, the research
would be in the interest of truth. The right of the judge to demand
the decision of science, and along with it the right and the power to
trample the decision under his feet is a manifest contradiction. We
who have always maintained that it is not reasonable to submit toa
common jury questions of medical jurisprudence, think it time to over-
turn the ancient maxim that the judge is the expert of experts. The
maxim may flatter the vanity of the judge, but itis not true. Each one
to his place is the truth. When a question of medical jurisprudence
arises the medical jurist ought to be the judge.

This question was brought up at the session of the congress at
Rome. Drs. Tamassia and Laccasagne presented it. There was an
important debate thereon, and the principle here laid down was ap-
proved with a single exception We propose that questions of medical
jurisprudence, of psychiatry, should be tried before a technical jury,
and that they should be authorized not simply to make a suggestion
and give an opinion, but to render that which is a real decision and a
final judgment. We believe the proposition laid down in the Holy
Scriptures to be the true one, to give to Christ that which belongs to
Christ and to Cesar that which belongs to Cesar.

(3) There should be established a system of preventive detention,
that is to say, there should be a detention for the purpose of preventing
crime by means of imprisonment of the individual before he has com-
mitted it, rather than to imprison him after as a punishment for having
committed it. The penal process or code in the Latin countries consists
of the two steps, one of instruction and the other accusation. In the
first the presumption of innocence prevails, and there the preventive
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 671

detention should be the exception, but in the second it ought to be the
rule. But these things are to be determined by the psychic condition
of the delinquent and the nature of the causes which impelled him to
erime. If the psychic conditions have been verified there should be no
further hesitation, but the imprisonment or detention should be en-
forced with rigor.

(4) The judge gives his judgment in three forms: Condemnation,—
acquittal for inexistence of the crime or of his innocence ;—acquittal
for insufficiency of proof. This corresponds to the ancient formula:
Condemno, absolvo, non liquet. The jury, on the contrary, except in
Scotland, have only two formulas: Yes, no; guilty or not guilty. If
they are in doubt as to his guilt, they respond not guilty. This does
not appear just. The jury should have a formula of non liquet—not
proven: the laws would then be equal for all.

(5) There should be an appeal in criminal cases as well in acquittals
as inconvictions. This question was treated by Garofalo, Ferri, Maino,
and by Pugliese in the Revue de Jurisprudence in 1885. It has been
argued in the affirmative by Mittermaier in his Die Gesetzgebung und
Rechtsbildung.

In this principle it has received its first legislative recognition in
paragraph 3838 of the Austrian code and paragraph 399 of the Ger-
manic code. But in these cases it is confined only to corruption or
false testimony. It is time, however, that the principle of appeal in
the social interest should be recognized without restriction and ap-
peals be taken as easily by the prosecution as by the defense. The law
ought to be equal for all. The interest for the one and of the other are
the same. No reason in justice can be given why one should have an
appeal and the other not. It would serve to correct many erroneous,
not to say corrupt, judgments and prevent many scandals upon the
law.

Dr. Brouardel accepted much said by M. Pugliese, but he combatted
some positions. He denied the propriety of making an expert to be a
judge or making judges only of experts. The responsibility was too
great and the result would be unsatisfactory.

M. Benedikt agreed with Dr. Brouardel and said that while the edu-
cation of the magistrature should inelude certain prescribed medical
studies, they should be always auxiliary to jurisprudence and never
above or beyond it. This was in accordance with the opinion of M.
Lacassagne.

Question X VI.—Instruction in medical jurisprudence in the Jaw
schools. Professor Lacassagne, of Lyous, reporter.

In the presentation of this paper M. Lacassagne repeated largely the
ideas which he had put before the congress at Rome upon the necessity
of instruction in medical jurisprudence in the law school. There was a
large discussion over this question, but it was confined to the details,
672 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOI.OGY.

all the speakers, Brouardel, Moleschott, Van Hainel, Ploix, Féré, Tarde,
Soutzo, Ferri, and Madame Clemence-Royer, were in accord with the
proposition. It was finally agreed to recommend the examples of the
universities of Holland and Belgium, to which might have been added
Trinity College, Dublin, all of which have a special course of medicine
in their law schools. It was reeemmended that even in these courses
should be extended to include a large proportion of anthropology, for
Madame Clemence-Royer recalled that according to Socrates the first
study of man should be man himself.

M. Soutzo insisted that to teach criminal anthropology was to teach
medical jurisprudence, and he cited examples among the insane. A
paralytic by virtue of his delirium becomes a robber or a thief. In his
perverted senses he falls into dipsomania. Another, which, attacked
by the mania of persecution, becomes a murderer or a suicide. Another
category of individuals who are on the frontiers of insanity may be
found in the degenerates, the morally perverted, the drunkards, and
all that train of individuals capable of committing crime according to
their conditions and surroundings, and among which are to be found
the stigmas, physical, moral, and intellectual, that have been taught to
us by the professors of criminal anthropology before us. These indi-
viduals are not, like the first, absolutely irresponsible, but they are
partially or conditionally so. Therefore, said he, the great necessity
for the teaching of criminal anthropology, not by the side of, but in-
cluding medical jurisprudence, and that this should be carried on in all
the schools of law, and taught to all those who would become lawyers
or judges, or who would have dealings with criminals or insane before
the courts or under the law.

ANTHROPOMETRY.

There were two papers before the congress on this subject: No. XVI,
‘Anthropometry as applied to persons from 15 to 20 years of age,”
Alphonse Bertillon, reporter; and No. xvitt, “The employment of the
methods of criminal anthropology in aid of the police and for the arrest
of criminals,” MM. Avocat Anfosso, of Turin, and Professor Romiti,
reporters.

Anthropometry is a branch of the science of anthropology by which
the physical characteristics of man are studied, the investigation being
made by measurement.

The application of anthropometry is twofold. One, the more exten-
sive and more scientific, was largely the result of the investigations of
Broca, though there were others who practised the science independent
of and even before him. Quetelet of Belgium, Vircbow of Germany,
Roberts, Francis, Galton, and Dr. John Beddoe of England, and our
own doctors Morton and Baxter have all practised anthropometry in-
dependently of Broca. In France Drs. Topinard and Mancuvrier have
taken up the science where Broca left it at his death. The former has
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 673

been pursuing his investigations into the races of men found in France
as determined by color, and he investigates and studies that of the
eyes and hair as well as that of the skin. The latter succeeded Broca
in the Labratoire d’Anthropologie, and is professor and lecturer upon
this subject before the School of Anthropology.

The second use of anthropometry has been more practical, for, while
it is conducted scientifically, it is employed in Europe, principally in
France, as a means of identification of individuals, whether required
in the army, by the law, by the police, or for private and scientific uses.
It was with regard to the second application of anthropometry that the
congress of criminal anthropology occupied itself in the two papers set
forth at the head of this chapter.

The discovery of the use of anthropometry for identification is due
to Dr. Adolph Bertillon, himself a professor in the school of anthropol-
ogy, who died in 1883 at the age of 62 years, leaving his two sons to
follow in his footsteps, with prospects of becoming equally as eminent.
as their father. It was the son, Alphonse, who presented question
XVU, in which he was assisted by MM. Anfosso and Romiti, the report-
ers of question XVIII, both of whom were aided in the discussion by M.
Cantilo, advocat from the Argentine Republic.

M. Herbette, chief of the penitentiary system of France, early per-
ceived the benefits of this system and adopted it. It is now in use
throughout France, thanks to his initiation. He was its ardent advo-
cate at the congress in Rome, and there made it the subject of an
address, which was translated by Mr. Edward R. Spearman, a portion
of which was adapted and published in the Fortnightly Review of
March, 1890.

M. Alphonse Bertillon is attached to the department of justice and
assigned to duty with M. Herbette at police headquarters in Paris,
there to use his talent and knowledge in the identification of such per-
sons as may be brought before him. ‘Chis, of course, means the identi-
fication of criminals, or persons arrested.

The morning of Friday, August 16, was devoted to a visit by the
congress to tlie establishment in charge of M. Bertillon to witness the
operations of his methods and to hear his explanations. We, how-
ever, were favored with a private view on the day before, by the means
of which we were better enabled to understand the operations.

The establishment to which we were introduced would correspond to
and probably be known in most cities of the United States as the
rogue’s gallery. In our country a criminal once arrested, whom they
may desire to recognize at some future time, is marched down toa
photographic establishment and has his photograph taken by a single
negative, carte de visite size, of more or less front view, from which a
print is made, which in due time is delivered to the detective corps at
police headquarters, where it is placed in a rack for public inspection.
It is by comparison with this photograph, and the recognition of wit-

nesses, that the individual criminal will be identified in future, if he
should be again arrested. It goes without saying that these methods
are extremely unreliable—unreliable at best, but in Paris impracticable
and valueless, for there they have no less than 100,000 photographs of
criminals who have passed through the police headquarters within the
past 10 years. It will be recognized as practically impossible to search
through a pile of 100,000 photographs to find one which shall bear a
likeness to the individual under investigation. It would be impracti-
cable, if the photograph, when found, should prove te be the picture of
the identical criminal whose case was being investigated, but when we
consider the differences of appearance of the same individual, and the
similarity of different individuals, as shown by the photograph, the im-
possibility of successful identification becomes indisputable. To be of
any value as means of identification, there should be two photographs
taken of each person, one full face, the other a profile. If this
be done with the small size, 2? by 35 inches, it would require 10,600
square feet surface measure for 100,000 photographs. These dis-
played on a wall in a strip 5 feet in height would require a space
2,120 feet in length. A search through such a dreary extent of pho-
tographs in order to find the particular one to compare with the crim-
inal, whom the officer leads around, and thus be able to identify him,
would be like a search among the sands upon the seashore, or the leaves
in the forest, and its impossibility, or, at least, impracticability is dem-
onstrated.

M. Bertillon has so arranged his system of anthropometry, and classi-
fied it—together with the photographs—as that his usual search does
not extend beyond twenty, and rarely above ten, and can easily be re-
duced as occasion demands, and be accomplished in a few minutes.
Upon the occasion of my visit he gave to Professor Mason and myself
a descriptive card of a given criminal, who was brought and measured
in our presence—upon the visit of the congress M. Moleschott, senateur
from Italy, was given a like chart; and we were instructed to make the
search for ourselves and so understand the classification and find and
identify the criminal. The system proved so perfect that we three,
strangers, making our first visit to the establishment, hearing the de-
scription for the first time, were enabled to understand the classifica-
tion and find the box in which his description belonged, with no more
than ten cards in it, and so identify the man in question, and this we
did within two minutes time. I will deseribe the method of procedure
and the system of classification :

The instruments.—These are few and simple. Their cost is about $25.
A series of them were displayed by their maker, M. Colas, at the Expo-
sition in the department of anthropology, and I have described them
in the chapter on Anthropology at the Exposition.

different lengths for other parts of the body, and the necessary stands,
stools, etc. These will all be understood as the operation proceeds.

The batch of “arrests” have been brought in for measurement and
identification ; under the necessary guard they are conducted toa room
divided around its walls into open lockers after the fashion of public
bath houses. The individual is stripped to his shirt and pantaloons
and these lockers are provided with hooks on which to hang the cloth-
ing, and a bench with a drawer. Thence he is marched into the meas-
uring room. The services of two men are required; one to take the
measurements, the other to write them on the’ appropriate card. The
subject may have already been examined, or he may be exainined here
as to his name, residence, place of birth, and former convictions, if any.
If he be a hardened criminal, an incorrigible, called in French, « recidi-
vist, he will probably give a false name and declare this is his first arrest.

The report of the bureau at Paris shows the following list of persons
who did this and were recognized by this system and their descriptive
cards found in the boxes as hereafter explained :

All measures of anthropometry should be taken by the metric system
and reported in millimetres. By common consent among the principal
nations the metric system has been adopted for anthropometry. Com-
parisons are made much easier and more correctly from a single and
universal standard, and therefore it becomes the duty of the United
States to fall into line with her sister nations.

To measure the height of the individual.—By a simple mechanical con-
trivance the operation can be done rapidly, accurately, and without risk
of deception. The subject is barefoot and placed with his back against
the wall; a strip of wood has been fastened upon the wall so as to fur-
nish a perpendicular edge ; a door or window jamb may serve the pur-
pose equally well. The wooden right angle spoken of can be placed
against this edge and moved up and down, the broad bottom of which
can rest lightly upon the head of the individual. Lines painted upon
the wall, or stripes with the necessary measures of height marked upon
them, will show with accuracy the height of the individual,
676 - CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

Maximum length of the head (skull),—The subject being seated, for
convenience, one point of the calipers is placed in the hollow above the
bridge of the nose, together while the other point is used to find the
greatest length at the back of the head. This should be done with
accuracy, and so that the length will be given exactly. If done with
care the true length can be obtained within 1 millimetre, which is about
one twenty-fifth part of aninch. It is admitted that the skull of man
developes but little, if any, after his maturity, 21 years of age. No
one possesses any power to alter or in any way change the size or con-
formation of his skull. The same thing is true with regard to the length
of bones in the human body, and this had afforded the key to the sys-
tem of anthropometry adopted by M. Bertillon, as he has chosen for
his identification those portions of the body over which the individual
has no control, and in which it is impossible for him to make any

change in their size or length. The length of the head thus taken isa |

measurement at once accurate, unchangeable, and beyond the control
of the individual or the possibility of deception.

Maximum breadth of head.—This is measured from one parietal bone
to the other in the same manner as the length of the head is measured.

Maximum length of arms, extended.—This is a measurement which is
popularly supposed to be always equal to the height, but in reality it
may vary from 5 to 20 centimetres. It assists therefore in classifying
even after the height.

Length of middle finger of left hand.—This is the best of our indications,
for it can be measured to a millimetre, provided care is taken that the
finger is bent at an exact right angle with the back of the hand; there
can be no cheating with this and it undergoes no alteration from adult
to old age. Notice must, however, be taken of any unusual length of
nail in the person being measured.

Maximum length of left foot.—In taking this measurement the subject
must, of course, be barefoot, and in order to avoid any chance of cheat-
jug the subject should stand on the left foot only, with the left knee
bent. This is not quite so good a measurement for our purposes as that
of the middle finger, and can only be measured to within 2 millimetres.

Color of the eyes.—A special table has been framed for the color of the
eyes, Which gives seven categories. These are based on the intensity
of the pigmentation of the iris. Firstly, we note the exact shade of
the pigment when it exists, and secondly, the approximate shade of
the deep stratum of the periphery of the iris.

Hence the seven divisions:

(1) Iris azure blue and slaty blue with aureole concentric pupillary
aureole more or less pale but destitute of yellowish pigment.

(2) Iris inclining more or less to blue or slate color, but with a light
yellowish aureole.

(3) Same shade but with a further aureole, approaching orange.

— ee ee eee ee

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 66

(4) Iris reflection more or less greenish and with a chestnut aureole.

(5) Same shade with brown aureole.

(6) In this class the chestnut is no longer clustered in an aureole
around the pupil, but spread on the whole surface of the iris and only |
shows some greenish yellow irisations.

(7) Eye entirely brown.

This grouping enables us to pass by almost imperceptible transitions
from the light blue eye to the pure brown eye. To examine the eyes
the operator should place himself in the angle of a window, his back to
the light,—avoid using tbe word gray. For further details read the
Revue Scientifique of July 18, 1885; also, Annales de Démographie,
1881-82, “ La couleur de V Iris en lanthropologie,” by Alphonse Bertillon.

This procedure gives six measures of each individual, but upon neces-
sity they can be increased indefinitely. The effect is twofold. One is
to procure areliable means of identification of the individual by means
of an accurate measurement of certain portions, the bony structure of
his body, which in the case of the adults does not change. Fatness or
leanness, well or ill condition, has no effect upon these measurements.
They are and always will be (except the height) the same, and neither
by will or trick can any one make them different. The other effect is

to provide an arrangement by which the cards may be segregated and

classified so that the individual can easily be found.

The cards on which these measurements are recorded are of a regular
size and pattern, with printed forms, so as to always give the same indi-
cation. The size used by M. Bertillon is 53 inches square. Both sides
are utilized for description, and on the one are placed the two photo-
graphs—front and profile view-—the full face on the right, profile on the
left.

These cards are then arranged in boxes or drawers after the manner
of cali cards in the U.S. National Museum; that is, on edge, the face
to the front, the depth of the box being not more than half the height
of the card so that it can easily be seen and read during examination
without being taken out.

The classification of these cards and photographs in their boxes is
such that the descriptive card of any individual will fall into a subdi-
vision of not more than ten or twenty other cards, and can be found, as
was done by Signor Moleschott, Professor Mason, and myself within a
space of 2 minutes.

M. Bertillon has at Paris 100,000 photographs of criminals and
arrested persons, and these are increasing at a wonderfully rapid rate.
The proportion of 40.000 may be excluded from our present consider-
ation, being those of women and children. Sixty thousand are of men
of mature age, and as we have already seen the measurements were
made of those portions of the body of the bony structures, the size of
which or length of which can not be changed.
678 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

The principle of the classification of M. Bertillon is to divide each one
of these measurements into three classes: the large, the small, and the
medium. This classification, beginning with the length of the head,
then toits width, extends through all the measurements indicated, and
ends in a division containing about ten cards, but which must not ex-
ceed twenty. The lines of demarcation between these divisions are
made arbitrarily and with the sole intent to make each division ap-
proximately equal in point of numbers. So he has found the numbers
for line of division for the length of skull to be at 184 and 189 millime-
tres. All heads the length of which fell between these two numbers
inclusive, constituted the middle division; all of 183 and less formed
the division of short heads, while all of 190 and more constituted the
division of long heads.

For the breadth of the skull the two dividing figures were 153 to 156,
and these formed the middle division. Those 152 and less formed the
shortest, and those 159 and over formed the broadest division; and this
system was continued throughout all other measurements.

It was found in practice that this slight difference of 5 millimetres,
being only about one-fifth part of an inch, taken, as it were, out of the
middle of head measurements, would contain about an equal number
with those in the other two divisions.

The divisions made by the measurement of the middle finger of the
left hand established for the medium class from 110 to 115; all middle
fingers from 109 and under are classed with the short; from 110 to 115
with the medium, and 116 and over with the long fingers. So also with
the length of the foot, the spread of the arms, and, as I have said, by
the color of the eyes.

In practice the 60,000 photographs would be first divided according
to the length of the head, large, medium, and small; and this would
separate them into three divisions of 20,000 each, in the case of
drawers. The width of the head would again divide each one of these
20,000 into large, small, and medium, which would give practically
6,000. The three divisions arising from the spread of the arms and the
length of the middle finger will reduce it to 600. The length of the
foot will again reduce it to 63, and the further reduction by the color of
the eyes of seven classes to 9 photographs in each division. The prin-
cipal divisions are made in the cases of drawers, while the smaller are
made within the drawers themselves.

The anthropometric establishment under M. Bertillon does not abolish
the use of photography. The photographs are taken in double, a full
face and a profile, and this should always be done. The change of face
arising either from accident or intention on the part of the subject is
much less easily controlled by him in profile view than of the full face.
He can at best only change the lower part of his face, and in making
comparisons by photographs, where such a change is suspected, it is
well to cover the lower part of the face on the photograph by a spot of
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 679

paper and make comparisons of the contour of the head, the shape of
the face, the position of the ear and its appearance, and thus one is
enabled to make much better and more satisfactory investigation. If
one would rely upon the photograph there should also be added the other
position of a full-length standing portrait.

At Paris the studio for taking the photographs of criminals is at-
tached to the establishment of M. Bertillon and is over his office of
measuring. Another suggestion which he makes concerning photo.
graphs and their benefit and advantage concerning identification is
the necessity of having them the same proportion, the same relative
size, and so he insists that the instruments and the subjects shall always
be at the same distance. Therefore he has the chair in which the sub-
ject sits, and also the stand for the camera fastened firmly to the floor
so that they give the same proportionate size of the subject.

M. Bertillon also remarked the importance of ineluding in the pho-
tograph a view of the bust. Ifthe head only be shown it gives it an
enlarged appearance and so is deceiving, and besides the setting of the
head upon the shoulders is as much a means of identification as is the
head itself. He said also to throw back the hair off the ears of the
subject when taking the profile view, for it is an organ unchangeable
upon its owner and with its characteristics may serve aS a means for
identification. But with all this M. Bertillon uses the photograph more
as an auxiliary, and depends principally upon the measurements.

How to make a search.—Our man, whose photograph and measure-
ment is given on the card, is supposed to have just arrived, the meas-
urement made, and his photograph taken. We desire to know if he
has ever before passed through the depot and whether his card of
measurement is here to be found. The length of his head is 191, there-
fore we find it in the highest division; that is, with the longest heads,
and we know it will be in this row of drawers. The width of his head
is 157. That falls within the medium class, and we therefore know it
will fall within this row of drawers. We have now, by exclusion,
reduced the number of cards to be examined from 60,000 to 6,000. The
length of his middle finger is 127, which throws it into the highest of
that division, and that has reduced it to 2,000. The like investigations
with regard to his foot, which is 278, and the spread of his arms, which
are 151, reduces it, as we have said, to an average division of 63 cards.
These are divided among the seven distinctive colors of the eyes, and so
the package of cards within which his description will be found, if at
all, is reduced to an average of 9, and in practice is never to exceed 20.
And this by depending solely upon the measurement and without con-
sulting the photograph.

As a precaution additional to the normal sizes of the various portions
of the body which were selected for measurement, there would be natur-
ally employed any abnormal marks which might be found. If these were
agreed in the two descriptions we would declare the identification com-
680 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

plete. Every person has on his body some particular marks, such as
moles, scars from cuts, boils, etc. Three or four of these corresponding
would be quite enough to identify a man out of a million provided
always that the nature, ete., of the marks has been accurately recorded.

It is very seldom that one finds on an individual identically the same
mark and in the same place that has been previously noticed on another,
but that two persons should be found bearing three or four sears pre-
cisely similar would be a co incidence which appears impossible, and we
have certainly never met with such a case.

These marks and cicatrice are set forth under the appropriate head
on the back on the card of Feillier.

I will not attempt to translate that description. It is too intricate
and with too many abbreviations and private marks for me to do so
with certainty. But as an illustration | may quote those which were
presented by M. Bertillon to the congress at Rome, and which had
been translated by Mr. Spearman:

(1) Oblique outward scar between second and third joint middle of
first finger left hand.

(2) Sear oblique inward of 5 centimetres, left palm, 3 centimetres
above third finger.

(3) Mole 8 centimetres below left nipple, and at 10 centimetres from
center of body.

(4) Mole 4 centimetres left of spinal column, 20 below prominent
vertebra of neck.

If this series of private marks be found to correspond on the two
cards, one would say they were both made from the same individual
and that the identification was perfect.

It is not to be expected that an inexperienced person will be able to
do this work of anthropometry without error. In the beginnings of
the system there were fewer identifications of former criminals and
more failures, but as time has progressed and a certain expertness with
regard to measuring and accuracy in making and keeping the records,
these errors and failures have been so far eliminated as that Monsieur
Bertillon claims it to be practically perfect.

The anthropometric service in the penitentiary and police system
of France was established in 1882. The annual examinations were as
follows: In 1882, 225; 1883, 7,336; 1884, 10,398; 1885, 14,965; 1886,
15,703 ; 1887, 19,150. Up to this time the service was considered more
or less experimental, and only certain classes were subject to measure-
ment.

In the year 1888 the application of the system was extended to in-
clude all persons arrested for any except the lower grades of offenses,
and the number in this year who passed through the depot at Paris was
increased to 51,849. This gives an average of about 100 measurements
per day. M. Bertillon told me that in practice it took the two men, one
to measure the other to record, about 7 minutes to each prisoner, or 8
CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 68i

prisoners per hour. As it is important that prisoners should be exam-
ined in court without delay the entire day is not at their disposal, and
so they have four squads of operators, who endeavor to conclude their
measurements each day before breakfast, as they call it; that is, before
12 m., the afternoon being devoted to the routine business at the office.

Of the 51,849 offenders or suspects measured in 1888 615 were recog-
nized as having been measured before, but who sought to conceal their
identity by giving false names and reporting falsely the number of their
arrests. There were only four failures of identification. Four failures
out of 51,849 measurements was considered by M. Bertillon to be prac-
tically perfection.

This system of M. Bertillon for identification of individuals by means
of anthropometry is having much success. The most superficial exam-
ination seems to convince every one of its efficacy and superiority.
M. Cantilo, Procuretr General at Buenos Ayres, the delegate from the
Argentine Republic, bore his testimony before the congress of the mar-
velous results obtained in the determination of individual identity. He
said that the method had been adopted by several of the States of the
United States of North America, and also by his own country, the Ar-
gentine Republic, the capital, Buenos Ayres, already possessing an in-
stallation of the anthropometric system of Bertillon. He spoke of the
necessity for its adoption by all civilized countries, and he proposed to
the congress a resolution inviting all governments to adopt it whenever
they might have need for the identification of any considerable number
of their citizens, which resolution was unanimously adopted.

M. Bertillon stated that after France the Argentine Republic was the
first government to adopt the anthropometric system by law or official
decree. He complimented the admirable application made in the State
of Illinois, principally at the penitentiary of Joliet, by the private
efforts of MM. Mac-Claughry, Gallas, Muller, Porteous, of Chicago, ete.

Monsieur Herbette, in his presentation of this matter at the congress
of Rome, following the communication of M. Bertillon,* pointed out
how this verifying of the physical personality and the indisputable
identity of people of adult age should in modern society fulfill real
requirements and under the most varied services. If-it were a ques-
tion, for instance, of identifying the soldiers of an army, or travellers
going to distant lands, they could have personal cards having recog-
nizable signs enabling them always to prove who they are; if it were
a question of completing the records of the etat civil by sure indica-
tions to prevent error or substitution of persons; if it were a question
of recording the distinctive marks of an individual in documents, titles,
contracts so that his identity could be established either for his own
interest, for the interest of third parties, or for that of the state, the
fuli benefit of the anthropometric system would be realized. If there
should arise a question of identity in a life certificate, a life insurance

contract or proof of death, or to certify the identity of a dead person,
or one badly wounded or disfigured, the body having been partially
destroyed or had become difficult to recognize in case of a sudden or
violent death, the result of a crime, an accident, a shipwreck, a battle,
how great would be the advantage of being able to trace these charac-
ters, unchangeable in each individual, infinitely variably as between
one individual and another, indelible, in great part, even in death.

There is still more cause to occupy oneself with it if it is a question
of identifying distant persons or after the lapse of a considerable time
when the general appearance, the look, the features, and the physical
habits have changed naturally or artificially, and that without moving
or expense, by the simple exchange of a few notes or figures sent from
one country to another, from one continent to another, to be able to
know in America what sort of a man it is who has just arrived from
France, and to show clearly whether a certain traveler one finds in
Rome is the same person that one measured in Stockholm 10 years
before.

In one word to fix the human personality, give to each human being
an identity, an individuality lasting, unchangeable, always recogniz-
able, easily proved, this appears to be the extended aim of the new
method.

It may consequently be said that the extent of the problem, as well
as the importance of its solution, far exceeds the limits of penitentiary
work, and the interest, not inconsiderable, which final action has exer-
cised amongst various nations. These are the motives for giving to the |
labors of M. Bertillon and their practical utilization, the publicity they
merit.

Question XI X.—Correctional education—reforms in accordance with
our knowledge of biology and of sociology and their relations to crime.
Dr. Motet, reporter.

Dr. Motet, in accordance with M. Dalifol, presented the necessity for
a considerable development in moral education as well as professional.
Especially should this be so in the agricultural schools, and M. Van
Hamel came to their aid in showing the success which had attended
the moral education in his country of Holland.

Question X XI.—The relation between mental degeneration and sim-
ulation of insanity. Dr. Paul Garnier, reporter.

The boundary between crime and insanity is very narrow and one
which gives to the medical jurist sometimes the greatest difficulty. It
is here that the real criminal will simulate insanity before the courts
in order to escape the responsibility of his acts, and here is to be found
the greatest number of the simulators. The degenerate individual, he
who has come to be of a lower scale, whether mentally or psychologic-
ally, is closely related to and liable to become either epileptic or hys-
teric. If he shall simulate either one of these or the insanity growing
7

CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 683

out of them, he may be his own dupe, and finish by becoming the insane
person that he at first only pretended to be. The simulation, even when
successful, dues not necessarily give evidence of intellectual ability.
It does not in these cases require a high order of intellectual ability to
deceive; deceit is not intelligence. It is many times difficult to detect
insanity in a given individual, but it is much more difficult to detect
the simulation of insanity. To do this with certainty requires the most
skillful and best trained scientist. A moment’s consideration of the
proposition will serve to confirm the opinions so many times expressed
by members of this Congress as to the necessity for an anthropological
education and training on the part of the judges and law officers deal-
ing with criminals. ;

Question X XII.—The influence of professional life upon criminality.
Dr. Henri Coutagne, of Lyon, reporter.

The object of this memoir was to present the importance of those
studies which had for their object a research into what the reporter
called “professional psychology,” or the psychology of professional life.
He said the psychic functions of the individual were greatly influenced
by the profession he chose to exercise among his fellows. That the vo-
cation or profession showed the tendency of races or of individuals. He
spoke of the special aptitude of the Hebrew race for financial affairs,
His memoir was as much graphic as written, and showed nine classes
of professions, and the criminals which had belonged to each. This
had been continued and kept up by him and his predecessor since the
year 1829, and was devoted largely to statistics as well as enforcing their
value and importance. These statistics showed that much the larger
proportion of criminals is to be found among the agricultural and indus-
trial population. He enlarged upon the necessity for statistics, and
invoked the various societies, as the bar associations, the medical soci-
eties, and those representing other trades and professions, to gather
with thoroughness and detail the number of criminals, the habit of
life of the various individuals, and especially this with regard to their
course in crime. The congress drifted into a discussion as to the im-
portance of statistics, those to be gathered as well by the state as by
the different societies and organizations mentioned.

M. Herbette enlarged upon the necessity for complete and accurate
statistics gathered by the penitentiaries and prisons, and spoke of the
necessity of what he called ‘a bulletin official individual,” which should
show every act in crime and in life and in the surroundings of the indi-
vidual, his temptations, opportunities, his first tendencies to crime, and
his criminal life both in and out of prison, so far as possible, and to this
should be added the anthropologic and ps7chologic investigations.

Dr. Wilson, from the United States of America, after noticing the
necessity for a general plan of gathering statistics with accuracy and
detail, and making a collation and classification of reports for purposes
of comparison, and the fact that thus defined there were scarcely any
684 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

statistics in the United States in relation to crime and criminals, went
on to say that only in some of the States were records kept so that
Statistics could be obtained.

New York and Massachusetts are the most prominent. But their
records are kept, each on its own plan and without relation to the plan
of the other, and therefore they lose the benefit of comparison with
each other. In most of the States of the Union there has been only a
slight attempt to keep vital statistics. Marriages, births, deaths, con-
viction for crime, are intended to be made a matter of record, but the
penalty provided by law for the neglect is so slight and so rarely en-
forced as to be ineffectual. Ours is a new country; our people have
never been accustomed to strictness in making or keeping such rec-
ords. The population in many localities is sparse, the people change
their residence often, they go and come at will, there is no military
service demanded of them, and it is exceedingly rare for a pauper to be
returned to the place of his original domicil that he.may be supported
at public expense. So the needs which exist in Europe for such records
fail in the United States. The only necessity for such statistics is be-
lieved by our people to be for historic or sociologic purposes. This
has not yet been sufficiently appreciated by them to overcome the diffi-
culties. There are also more difficulties than exist in European coun-
tries. Our country is large; compared with European countriesit has
a vast extent. It was also as compared with these countries, dis-
covered only a few yearsago. It has had only about 100 years of life.
One hundred years ago it had but 3,000,000 souls ; it extends from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, a distance of nigh 5,000 miles, and its center of
- population remained, until within 50 years, practically on the Atlantic
coast, and even now has not gone beyond 600 miles to the westward.
Our country had to be rescued from the possession of the barbarian,
and a people thus engaged have but little time and less inclination to
keep records and statistics which in their opinion have only a senti
mental utility. So it has as yet been scarcely attempted. We may
accomplish it after a time; not at present. The difficulties are in-
creased by our form of government. We have that anomaly of two
sovereignties within one country, two governments over one people;
and I explained the difference between our State and national govern-
ments, each of which has its ewn jurisdiction over crime, and yet each
is independent of the other. So I said the United States Census is de-
pendent: largely for its statistics of crime upon information obtained
from the State authorities. If, on the other hand, it be a State census,
each will be separate and distinct, and may be different from any other.
So it was that in the State of Pennsylvania the statistics of crime
showed the number of convictions to be 2,930, while the State of New
York, with but a slightly increased population returned 58,670 convic-
tions; twenty times more than that of Pennsylvania. The explana-
tion given was, that in the former State convictions only in the courts of

kind, whether for small or great offenses.

Question XX VI.— Political offenses from the point of view of anthro-
pology.

This study, written by M. Laschi, an avocat from Verona, was made
with the assistance of M, Lombroso. It dealt with race, genius, and the
density of the population in the older and better settled countries. The
author distinguished revolution from revolt. The first he called psy cho-
logic manifestations, and the latter pathologic. Hespoke of the influ-
ences of climate and orography, not to mention those social and polit-
ical, upon the race which might belong to or inhabit a country. He gave
as his opinion, derived from his investigation and the statisties, that the
short-headed races, brachycephalics, were conservative, while the long-
headed, dolicocephalics, were revolutionists ; that the mixture of these
races could modify their character and so change them as a nation, but
that occasionally, by reason of atavism, or something similar, peculiar
circumstances, changes in social conditions as well as in political, the
dolicocephalic individual of modern times and in modern countries might
break out in revolution, which was naught else on his part than the
return, through heredity, to the original revolutionary characters of
some remote ancestor. He said the most revolutionary cities of Eu-
rope, like Paris, Florence, Geneva, were those which manifested the
greatest genius and the most vivacity of thought.

Drs. Brouardel and Motet believed, on the contrary, that the influ-
ence of political crimes was to show the inferiority of intelligence, the
686 CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

fanatism, the impressionability, and the exaltation of the individual
These, said they, were particular factors in political crimes.

Professor Lombroso cited M. Taine, and said that these political
crimes were what the anthropological historian might well call political

epilepsy.

Question XX VI[.—Jurisprudence applied to criminal sociology. M.
Pierre Sarraute, judge of the tribunal at Perigueux, Dordogne, reporter.

The punishment for crime ought to be against the individual. The
particular individual criminal should be made to feel that he received
the punishment for his offense. To accomplish this with satisfaction
the juge @instruction should be able to investigate the anthropologic
and social factors which have entered into or operated upon the mind
of the criminal in causing him to commit the offense. The juge d’in-
struction must himself be educated, and it must be remitted into his
hands entirely to judge of the utility, and extent of the examination,
and to control the results. To do this successfully it will be necessary
to open a course of lectures upon criminal anthropology and medical
jurisprudence in the various schools of law, and to educate the students
in these sciences. The reporter proposed as a remedy for some of the
lapses in the law, and the miscarriages of justice, an indeterminate
sentence by the judge; he proposed profound modifications in the jury
system, requiring of them in particular cases, special aptitude, special
preparations or educations, enabling them to deal properly with the
subject in hand. He would reduce the number of the jurors and would
require them to give their answers to the questions submitted to them
by the court, which answers should establish the facts in the case with
which they as jurors alone had to deal, leaving the questions of law to
the judge of the court; leaving the anthropologic questions, those of
psychology and physiology, to the trained scientist, who should be a
criminal anthropologist. With a training of the lawyers and judges in
these various sciences, and then a division of their various duties and
responsibilities, with higher courts which should combine in them these
various branches of scientific knowledge, the right of the criminal would
be guarded, while crime would be lessened and society protected.

Question XX X.—The moral and criminal responsibility of deaf-mutes
in their relations to legislation. M. Giampietro, of Naples, reporter.

He argued the defective physical organization of deaf mutes, and
seemed to say that there was a corresponding want of responsibility
which should be recognized by the law and the court. The important
part of his paper, which can not be here followed, was the scientific
portion, the physiologic investigations into the conditions of deaf-mutes
and the formation of articulate language. He described certain brain
centers which were possessed of such functions in this regard. He
called them the centers auditif, phonique, volitif, mnemonique, ideosym-
bolique, and moteur.
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS,*

By R. BRUDENELL CARTER.

/

It is a matter of familiar knowledge that the sense of vision is called
into activity by the formation, on the retina or internal nervous expan-
sion of the eye, of an inverted optical image of external objects—an
image precisely analogous to that of the photographic camera. The
retina iines the interior of the eyeball over somewhat more than its
posterior hemisphere. It is a very delicate transparent membrane,
about one-fifth of a millimetre in thickness at its thickest part, near the
entrance of the optic nerve, and it gradually diminishes to less than
half that thickness at its periphery. It isresolvable by the microscope
into ten layers, which are united together by a web of connective tissue,
which also carries blood vessels to minister to the maintenance of the
structure. I need only refer to two of these layers: the anterior or
fiber-layer, mainly composed of the fibers of the optic nerve, which
spread out radially from their point of entrance in every direction,
except where they curve around the central portion of the membrane;
and the perceptive layer, which—as viewed from the interior of the eye-
ball, may be likened to an extremely fine mosaic, each individual piece
of which is in communication with a nerve fiber, by which the impres-
sions made upon it are conducted to the brain. The terminals of the
perceptive layer are of two kinds, called respectively rods and cones;
the former, as the name implies, being cylindrical in shape, and the
latter conical. The bases of the cones are directed towards the interior
of the eye, so as to receive the light; and it is probable that each cone
may be regarded as a collecting a} paratus, calculated to gather together
the light which it receives, and to concentrate this light upon its deeper
and more slender portion, or posterior limb, which is believed to be the
portion of the whole structure which is really sensitive to luminous
impressions. The distribution of the two elements differs greatly in
different animals; and the differences point to corresponding differ-
ences in function. The cones are more sensitive than the rods, and
minister toa higher acuteness of vision. In the human eye there is a
small central region in which the perceptive layer consists of cones

only, a region which the fibers avoid by curving round it, and in which
the other layers of the retina are much thinner than elsewhere, so as
to leave a depression, and are stained of a lemon-yellow color. In a
zoue immediately around this yellow spot each cone is surrounded by
a single circle of rods; and as we proceed outwards towards the
periphery of the retina, the circle of rods around each cone becomes
successively double, triple, quadruple, or even more numerous. The
yellow spot receives the image of the object to which the eye is actually
directed, while the images of surrounding objects fall upon zones which
surround the yellow spot; and the result of this arrangement is that
generally speaking, the distinctness of vision diminishes in proportion
to the distance of the image of the object from the retinal center. The
consequent effect has been well described by saying that what we see
resembles a picture, the central part of which is exquisitely finished,
while the parts around the center are only roughly sketched in. We
are conscious that these outer parts are there; but if we desire to see
them accurateiy, they must be made the objects of direct vision in their

turn,
The indistinctness with which we see lateral objects is so completely

neutralized by the quick mobility of the eyes, and by the manner in
which they range almost unconsciously over the whole field of vision,
that it seldom or never forces itself upon the attention. It may be
conveniently displayed by means of an instrument called a perimeter,
which enables the observer to look steadily at a central spot, while a
second spot, or other object, is moved along an arc, in any meridian,
from the circumference of the field of view towards the center, or vice
versa. Slight differences will be found between individuals; but, speak-
ing generally, a capital letter one-third of an inch high, which is legi-
ble by direct vision at a distance of 16 feet, and is recognizable as a
dark object at 40° or 50° from the fixing point, will net become legible
at a distance of 1 foot, until it arrives within about 109°.

The image formed upon the retina is rendered visible by two differeut
conditions,—that is to say, by differences in the amount of light which
enters into the formation of its different parts, and by differences in the
quality of this light, that is, in its color. The former conditions are
fulfilled by an engraving, the latter by apainting. Itis with the latter
conditions only, and with the power of perceiving them, that we are
concerned this evening.

Before such an audience as that which I have the henor to address,
it is unnecessary to say more about color than that it depends upon the
power possessed by the objects which we describe as colored, to absorb
and retain certain portions of white or other mixed light, and to reflect
or transmit other portions. The resulting effect of color is the impres-
sion produced uponthe eye or upon the brain by the waves of light
which are left, after the process of selective absorption has been accom-
plished, Some substances absorb two of the three fundamental colors

~—
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 689

of the solar spectrum, others absorb one only, others absorb portions of
one or more. Whatever remains is transmitted through the media of
the eye, and in the great majority of tbe human race, suffices to excite
the retina to a characteristic kind of activity. Few things are more
curious than the multitude of different color sensations which may be
produced by the varying combinations of the three simple elements,
red, green, and violet; but this is a part of the subject into which it
would be impossible for me now to enter, and with which most of those
who hear me must already be perfectly familiar.

Apart from the effect of color as one of the chief sources of beauty
in the world, it is manifest that the power of distinguishing it adds
greatly to the acuteness of vision. Objects which differ from their sur-
roundings by differences of color are far more conspicuous than those
which differ only by differences of light and shade. Flowers are
much indebted to their brilliant coloring for the visits of the insects by
which they are fertilized ; and creatures which are the prey of others
find their best protection in a resemblance to the colors of their envi-
ronment. It is probably a universal truth that the organs of color
perception are more highly specialized and that the sense of color is
more developed in all animals in precise proportion to the general
acuteness of vision of each.

From a variety of considerations, into which time will not allow me
to enter, it has been concluded that the sense of color is an endowment
of the retinal cones, and that the rods are sensitive only to differences
in the quantity of the incident light, without regard to its quality.
Nocturnal mammals, such as mice, bats, and hedgehogs, have no cones ;
and cones are less developed in nocturnal birds than in diurnal ones.
Certain limitations of the human color sense may almost be inferred
from the anatomy of the retina. It is found, as that anatomy would
lead us to suppose, that complete color sense exists only in the retinal
center, or in and immediately around the yellow spot region, and that
it diminishes as we pass away from this center towards the periphery.
The precise facts are more difficult to ascertain than might be supposed ;
for although it is easy to bring colored objects from the circumference
to the center of the field of vision on the perimeter, it is by no means
easy to be quite sure of the point at which the true color of the ad-
vancing object can first be said to be distinctly seen. Much depends,
moreover, on the size of this advancing object, because the larger it
is the sooner will its image fall upon some of the more sparsely distrib-
uted cones of the peripheral portion of the retina. Testing the mat-
ter upon myself with colored cards of the size of a man’s visiting card
I find that [am conscious of red or blue at about 40° from the fixing
point, but not of green until it comes within about 30° ; while, if I take
three spots, respectively of bright red, bright green, and bright blue,
each half a centimetre in diameter and separated from its neighbor on
either side by an interval of half a centimetre, spots which would be

690 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

visible as distinct and separate objects at 8 metres, I can not fairly and
distinctly see all three colors until they come within 10° of the center.
Beyond 40°, albeit with slight differences between individuals and on
different meridians for the same individual, colors are only seen by the
degree of their luminosity ; that is, they appear as light spots if upon
a dark ground and as dark spots if upon a light ground. Speaking
generally therefore, it may be said that human vision is only tri-chro-
matic, or complete for the three fundamental colors of the solar spec-
trum, over a small central area, which certainly does not cover more
than 30° of the field; that it is bi-chromatic, or limited to red and vio-
let, over an annulus outside this central area; and that it is limited to
light and shade from thence to the outermost limits of the field.

The nature and imitations of the color sense in man long ago sug-
gested to Thomas Young that the retina might contain three sets of
fibers, each set capable of responding to only one of the fundamental
colors; or in other words, that there are special nerve fibers for red,
special nerve fibers for green, and special nerve fibers for violet. It has
also been assumed that the differences between these fibers might essen-
tially consist in the ability of each set to respond only to light vibra-
tions of a certain wave length, much as a tuned string will only respond
to a note with which it is in unison. In the human subject, so far as
has yet been ascertained, no optical differences between the cones are
discoverable; but the analogy of the ear and the facts which have been
supplied by comparative anatomy combine to render Young’s hypothesis
exceedingly probable, and it is generally accepted, at least provision-
ally, as the only one which furnishes an explanation of the facts. It
implies that elements of all three varieties are present in the central
portion of the retina; that elements sensitive to green are absent from
an annulus around the center; and that the peripheral portions are
destitute of any elements by which color sense can be called into ac.
tivity.

According to the observation already made, that the highest degree
of acuteness of vision is necessarily attended by a corresponding acute-
ness of color sense, we should naturally expect to find such a highly
devcloped color sense in birds, many of which appear, as regards visual
power, to surpass all other creatures. I need not dwell upon the often-
described acuteness of vision of vultures or upon the vision of fishing
birds, but may pass on to remark that the acuteness of their vision ap-
pears not only to be unquestionable, but also to be much more widely
diffused over the retina than is the case with man. If we watch domes-
tic poultry or pigeons feeding we shall frequently see a bird, when
busily picking up food immediately in front of its beak, suddenly make
a lateral dart to some grain lying sidewise to its line of sight, which
would have been practically invisible to a human eye looking in the
same direction as that of the fowl. When we examine the retina the
explanation both of the acuteness of vision and of its distribution be-
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 691

comes at once apparent. In birds, in some reptiles, and in fishes not
only are cones distributed over the retina much more abundantly and
more evenly than in man, but the cones are provided with colored
globules, droplets of colored oil, at their apices, through which the light
entering them must pass before it can excite sensation and which are
practically impervious to any color but their own. Each globule is so
placed as to intervene between what is regarded as the collecting por-
tion of the cone and what is regarded as its perceptive portion in such
a way that the latter can only receive color which is capable of passing
through the globule. The retin of many birds, especially of the fineh,
the pigeon, and the domestic fowl, have been carefully examined by
Dr. Waelchli, who finds that near the center, green is the predominant
color of the cones, while among the green cones, red and orange ones
are somewhat sparingly interspersed and are nearly always arranged
alternately, a red cone between two orange ones, and vice versa. In a
surrounding portion, called by Dr. Waelchli the red zone, the red and
orange cones are arranged in chains and are larger and more numerous
than near the yellow spot. The green ones are of smaller size and fill
up the inter-spaces. Near the periphery the cones are scattered, the
three colors about equally numerous and of equal size, while a few
colorless cones are also seen. Dr. Waelchli examined the optical prop-
erties of the colored cones by means of the micro-spectroscope and found,
as the colors would lead us to suppose, that they transmitted only the
corresponding portions of the spectrum, and it would almost seem, ex-
cepting for the few colorless cones at the peripheral part of the retina,
that the birds examined must have been unable to see blue, the whole
of which would be absorbed by their color globuies. It would be neces-
sary to be thoroughly acquainted with their food in order to understand
any advantage which the birds in question may derivo from the pre-
dominance of green, red, and orange globules over others, but it is im-
possible to consider the structure thus described without coming to the
conclusion that the birds in which it exists must have a very acute sense
of the colors corresponding to the globules with which they are so
abundantly provided and that this color sense, instead of being localized
in the center, as in the human eye, must be diffused over a very largo
portion of the retina. Dr. Waelchli points out that the coloration of
the yellow spot in man must, to a certain extent, exclude blue from the
central and most sensitive portion of his retina.

It is hardly necessary to mention how completely the high differen-
tiation of the cones in the creatures referred to-—tends to support the_
hypothesis of Young, that a similar differentiation, although not equally
manifest, exists also in man. If this be so, we must conclude that the
region of the yellow spot contains cones, some of which are capable of
being called into activity by red, others by green, and others by violet ;
that a surrounding annulus contains no cones sensitive to green, but
such as are sensitive to red or to violet only ; and that, beyond and around
692 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

this latter region, such cones as may exist are not sensitive to any color,
but, like the rods, only to differences in the amount of light. When
cones of only one kind are called into activity the sensation produced
is named red, green, or violet, and when all three varieties are stimu-
lated in about an equal degree the sensation produced is called white.
In the same way the innumerable intermediate color sensations, of
which the normal eye is susceptible, must be ascribed to stimulation of
the three varieties of cones in unequal degrees.

The conditions of color-sense which in the human race (or at least in
civilized man) exist normally in outer zones of the retina, are found in
a few individuals, to exist alsoin the center. There are persons in whom
the region of the yellow spot is absolutely insensitive to color, and
recognizes only differences in the amount or quantity of light. To such
persons the term ‘color-bdlind” ought perhaps in strictness to be limited;
but the individuals in question are so rare that they are hardly entitled
to a monopoly of an appellation which is conveniently applied also to
others. The totally color-blind would see a colored picture as if it were
an engraving, or a drawing in black and white, and would perceive dif-
ferences between its parts only in the degree in which they differed in
brightness.

A more common condition is the existence, in the center of the retina,
of a kind of vision like that which normally exists in the zone next sur-
rounding it; that is, a blindness to green. Persons who are blind to
green appear to see violet and yellow much as these are seen by the
normal-sighted, and they can see red, but they can not distinguish it
from green. Others, and this form is more common than the preceding,
are blind to red, and a very small number of persons are blind to violet.
Such blindness to one of the fundamental colors may be either coin-
plete or incomplete; that is to say, the power of the color in question
to excite its proper sensation may be either absent or feeble. In some
cases the defect is so moderate in degree as to be adequately described
by the phrase ‘“ defective color-sense.”

The experiments of Helmholtz upon color led him tosuppiement the
original hypothesis of Young by the supposition that the special nerve
elements excited by any one color are also excited in some degree by
each of the other two, but that they respond by the sensation appropri-
ate to themselves, and not by that appropriate to the color by which
they are thus feebly excited. This, which is often called the Young-
Helmholtz hypothesis, assumes that the pure red of the spectrum,
while it mainly stimulates the fibers sensitive to red, stimulates in a
less degree those which are sensitive to green, and in a still less degree
those which are sensitive to violet, the resulting sensation being red.
Pure green stimulates strongly the green-perceptive fibers, and stimu-
lates slightly both the red-perceptive and the violet-perceptive—result-
ing sensation, green. Pure violet stimulates strongly the violet-percep-
tive fibers, less strongly the green-perceptive, least strongly the red-
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 693

perceptive—resulting sensation, violet. When all three sets of fibers
are stimulated at once the resulting sensation is white, and when a
normal eye is directed to the spectrum the region of greatest luminos-
ity is in the middle of the yellow; because, while here both the green-
perceptive and the red-perceptive fibers are stimulated ina high degree,
the violet-perceptive are also stimulated in some degree.

According to this view of the case the person who is red-blind, or in
whom the red-preceptive fibers are wanting or paralyzed, has only two
fundamental colors in the spectrum instead of three. Spectral red
nevertheless is not invisible to him, because it feebly excites his green-
preceptive fibers, and hence appears as a saturated green of feeble
luminosity; saturated, because it scarcely at all excites the violet-
preceptive fibers. The brightest part of the spectrum instead of being
in the yellow is in the blue-green, because here both sets of sensitive
fibers are stimulated. In the case of the green-blind, in whom the
fibers preceptive of green are supposed to be wanting or paralyzed, the
only stimulation produced by spectral green is that of the red-precep-
tive and of the violet-perceptive fibers; and where these are equally stim-
ulated we obtain the white of the green-blind, which, to ordinary eyes,
is a Sort of rose color, a mixture of red and violet. In like manner the
white of the red-blind is a mixture of green and violet, and if we con-
sider the facts we shali see that spectral red, which somewhat feebly
stimulates the green-perceptive fibers of the normal eye, and spectral
green, Which somewhat feebly stimulates the red-perceptive fibers of
the normal and also of the green-blind eye, must appear to the green-
blind to be one and the same color, differing only in luminosity, and
that in an opposite sense to the preception of the red-blind. In other
words, red and green are undistinguishable from each other as colors
alike to the red-blind and to the green-blind ; but to the former the red
and to the latter the green appears, as compared with the other, to be
of feeble luminosity. In either case the two are only lighter and darker
shades of the same color. The conditions of violet-blindness are analo-
gous, but the defect itself is very rare; and as it is of small industrial
importance it has attracted but a small degree of attention.

Very extensive investigations, conducted during the last few years
both in Europe and in America, have shown that those which may be
called the common forms of color-blindness, the blindness to red and to
green, exist in about 4 per cent. of the male population and in perhaps
1 per thousand of females. Among the rest there are slight differences
of color-sense, partly due to differences of habit and training, but of
little or no practical importance. One such difference, to which Lord
Rayleigh was the first to direct attention, has reference to yellow. The
pure yellow of the spectrum may, as is generally known, be precisely
matched by a mixture of spectral red with spectral green; but the pro-
portions in which the mixture should be made differ within certain
limits for different people. The difference must, I think, depend upon
694 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

differences in the pigmentation of the yellow spot rather than upon
any defectin the nervous apparatus of the color-sense. There is a very
ingenious instrument, invented by Mr. Lovibond and called by him the
‘‘tintometer,” which allows the color of any object to be accurately
matched by combinations of colored glass, and to be expressed in terms
of the combination. In using this instrument we not only find slight
differences in the combinations required by different people, but also
in the combinations required by the two eyes of the same person. Here
again, I think the differences must be due either to differences in the
pigmentation of the yellow spot, or possibly also to differences in the
color of the internal lenses of the several eyes, the lens, as it is well
known, being usually somewhat yellow after middle age. The differ-
ences are plainly manifest in comparing persons all of whom possess
tri-chromatic vision, and are not sufficient in degree to be of any prac-
tical importance.

Taking the ordinary case of a red-blind or of a green-blind person,
it is interesting to speculate upon the appearance which the world
must present to him. Being insensible to one of the fundamental
colors of the spectrum, he must lose (roughly speaking) one-third of
the luminosity of nature; unless, as is possible, the deficiency is made
good to him by increased acuteness of perception to the colors which
he sees. Whether he sees white as we see it, or aS we see the mix-
tures of red and violet, or of green and violet, which they make to
match with it, we can only conjecture, on account of the inadequacy of
language to convey an accurate idea of sensation. We have all heard
of the blind man who concluded, from the attempts made to describe
scarlet to him, that it was like the sound of a trumpet. If we take a
heap of colored wools, and look at them first through a glass of pea-
cock blue, by which the red rays are filtered out, and next through a
purple glass, by which a large proportion of the green will be filtered
out, we may presume that, under the first condition, the wools will ap-

pear much as they would do to the red blind; and under the second,

much as they would do to the green blind. It will be observed that the
appearances differ in the two conditions, but that in both, red and
green are practically undistinguishable from each other, and appear as
the same color, but of different luminosity.

Prior to reflection, and still more, prior to experience, we should be
apt to conjecture that the existence of color-blindness in any individual
could not remain concealed, either from himself or from those around
him; but such a conjecture would be directly at variance with the
truth. Just as it was reserved for Mariotte, in the reign of Charles II,
to discover that there is, in the field of vision of every eye, a lacuna or
blind spot, corresponding with the entrance of the optic nerve, so it
was reserved for a still later generation to discover the existence of so
common a defect as color-blindness. The first recorded case was de-
scribed to Dr. Priestley by Mr. Huddart, in 1777, and was that of a man
—_—~-:Y *

named Harris, a shoemaker at Maryport, Cumberland, who had also a
color-blind brother, @ mariner. Soon afterwards, the case of Dalton,
the chemist, was fully deseribed, and led to the discovery of other ex-
amples of a similar kind. The condition was still however looked upon
aS avery exceptional one; insomuch that the name of “ Daltonism”
was proposed for it, and is still generally used in France as a synonym
for color-blindness. Such use is objectionable, not only because it is
undesirable thus to perpetuate the memory of the physical infirmity of
an eminent philosopher, but also because Dalton was red-blind, so
that the name could only be correctly applied to his particular form of
defect.

Color-blindness often escapes detection on account of the use of color
names by the color-blind in the same manner as that in which they hear
them used by other people. Children learn from the talk of those
around them, that it is proper to describe grass as green, and bricks or
cherries as red; and they follow this usage, although the difference
may appear to them so slight that their interpretation of either color-
name may be simply as a lighter or darker shade of the other. When
they make mistakes, they are laughed at, and thought careless, or to be
merely using color names incorrectly ; and a common result is that they
rather avoid such names, and shrink from committing themselves to
statements about color. Dr. Joy Jefferies gives an interesting descrip-
tion of the almost unconscious devices practiced by the color-blind in
this way. He says:

“The color-blind, who are quick-witted enough to discover early that
something is wrong with their vision by the smiles of their listeners
when they mention this or that object by color, are equally quick-witted
in avoiding so doing. They have found that there are names of certain
attributes they can not comprehend, and hence must let alone. They
learn also what we forget, that so many objects of every-day life
always have the same color, as red tiles or bricks, and the color names
of these they use with freedom ; whilst they often, even unconsciously,
are cautious not to name the color of a new object till they have heard
it applied, after which it is a mere matter of memory stimulated by a
consciousness of defect. I have often recalled to the color-blind their
own acts and words, and surprised them by an exposure of the mental
jugglery they employed to escape detection, and of which they were
almost unaware, so much had it become matter of habit. Another im-
portant point is, that as violet blindness is very rare, the vast majority
of defective eyes are red or green blind. These persons see violet and
yellow as the normal-eyed, and they naturally apply these color names
correctly. When therefore they fail in red or green, a casual observer
attributes it to simple carelessness,—hence a very ready avoidance of
detection. It does not seem possible that any one who sees so much
correctly, and whose ideas of color so correspond with our own, can
not be equally correct throughout, if they will but take the pains to
notice and learn.”
696 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS,

When the color-blind are placed in positions which compel them to
Select colors for themselves and others, or when as sometimes happens,
they are not sensitive with regard to their defect, but rather find
amusement in the astonishment which it produces among the color-
seeing, the results which occasionally follow are apt to be curious.
They have often been rendered still more curious, by having been the
unconscious work of members of the Society of Friends. Color-blind-
nessisa structural peculiarity, constituting what may be called a variety
of the human race; and like other varieties, it is liable to be handed
down to posterity. Hence, if the variety occurs in a person belonging
to a community which is small by comparison with the nation, and
among whose members there is frequent inter-marriage, it has an in-
creased probability of being reproduced; and thus, while many of the
best known of the early examples of color bindness, including that of
Dalton himself, were furnished by the Society of Friends, the examina-
tions of large pumbers of scholars and others, conducted during the last
few years have shown that in this country, color blindness is more com-
mon among Jews than among the general population. The Jews
have no peculiarities of costume; but the spectacle, which has more
than once been witnessed, of a venerable Quaker who had clothed him-
selfin bright green or vivid scarlet, could scarcely fail to excite the de-
rision of the unreflecting. Time does not allow me to relate the many
errors of the color-blind which have been recorded ; but there is an in-
stance of a clerk in a Government office, whose duty it was to cbeck cer-
tain entries, in relation to their subject-matter, with ink of one or of an-
other color, and whose accuracy was dependent upon the order in which
his ink bottles were ranged in front of him. This order having been
accidentally disturbed, great confusion was produced by his mistakes,
and it was a long time before these were satisfactorily accounted for.
An official of the Prussian post-office, again, who was accustomed to
sell stamps of different values and colors, was frequently wrong in his
cash, his errors being as often against himself as in his favor, so as to
exclude any suspicion of dishonesty. His seeming carelessness was at
last explained by the discovery of his color-blindness, and he was re-
lieved of a duty which it was impossible for him to discharge without
falling into error.

The color mistakes of former years were however of little moment
when compared with those now liable to be committed by engine driv-
ers and mariners. The avoidance of collisions at sea and on railways
depends largely on the power promptly to recognize the colors of sig-
nals; and the colors most available for signaling purposes are red and
green, or precisely those between which the sufferers from the two
most common forms of color-blindness are unable with any certainty
to discriminate. About 13 years ago there was a serious railway acci-
dent in Sweden, and in the investigation subsequent to this accident,
there were some remarkable discrepancies in the evidence given with

Eee

eee ee
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 697

regard to the color of the signals which had been displayed. Professor
Holmgren, of the University of Upsala, had his attention called to
this discrepancy, and he found, on further examination, that the wit-
ness whose assertions about the signals differed from those of other
people was actually color-blind. From this incident arose Professor
Holmgren’s great interest in the subject, and he did not rest until he
had obtained the enactment of a law under which no one ean be taken
into the employment of a Swedish railway until his color-vision has
been tested, and has been found to be sufficient for the duties he
will be called upon to perform, The example thus set by Sweden has
been followed, more or less, by other countries, and especially, thanks
to the untiring labors of Dr. Joy Jeffries, of Boston, by several of the
United States; while at the same time much evidence has been col-
lected to show the connection between railway and marine accidents
and the defect.

It has been found, by very extensive and carefully conducted exam-
inations of large bodies of men, soldiers, policemen, the workers in great
industrial establishments, and so forth, as well as of children in many
schools, that color-blindness exists in a noticeable degree, as I have
already said, in about 4 per cent. of the male industrial population in
civilized countries, and in about one per thousand of females. Among
the males of the more highly educated classes, taking Eton boys as an
example, the color-blind are only between 2 and 3 per cent., and per-
haps nearer to2 than to3. Whether asimilar difference exists between
females of different classes, we have no statistics to establish. The
condition of color-blindness is absolutely incurable, absolutely incapa-
ble of modification by training or exercise, in the case of the individual;
although the comparative immunity of the female sex justifies the sug-
gestion that if may possibly be due to training throughout successive
generations, on account of the more habitual occupation of the female
eyes about color in relation to costume. However this may be, in the
individual, as I have said, the detect is unalterable; and if the difference
between red and green is uncertain at 8 years of age, it will be equally
uncertain at 80. Hence the existence of color-blindness among those
who have to control the movements of ships or of railway trains con-
stitutes the real danger to the public; and it is highly important that
the color-blind, in their own interests as well as in those of others,
should be excluded from employments the duties of which they are
unfit to discharge.

The attempts hitherto made in this country to exclude the color-
blind from raiiway and marine employment have not been by any means
successful. As far as the merchant navy is concerned, so-called exami-
nations have been conducted by the board of trade, with results which
can only be described as ludicrous. Candidates have been “ plucked ”
in color at one examination, aid permitted to pass at a subsequent one;
as if correct color-vision were something which could be acquired.
698 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

Such candidates were either improperly rejected on the first occasion,
or improperly accepted on the second. On English railways there has
been no uniformity in the methods of testing ; except (inso far as I am
acquainted with them) thatthey have been almost uniformly misleading,
caleulated to give rise to the imputation of color-blindness where it did
not exist, and to leave it undiscovered where it did. In these cireum-
stances it is not surprising that great discontent should have arisen
among railway men in relation to the subject; and this discontent has
led, indirectly, to the appointment of a committee by the Royal Society,
with the sanction of the board of trade, for the purpose of investigating
the whole question as completely as may be possible.

It is perhaps worth while, before proceeding to describe the manner in
which the color sense of large bodies of men should be tested for indus-
trial purposes, to say something as to the amount of danger which
color-blindness produces. A locomotive, as we all know, is under the
charge of two men, the driver and the fireman. In a staff of 1,000 of
each, allotted to 1,000 locomotives, we should expect, in the absence of
any efficient method of examination, to find 40 color-blind drivers and
40 color-blind firemen. The chances would be 1 in 25 that either the
driver or the fireman on any particular engine would be color blind ;
they would be 1 in 625 that both would be color-blind. These figures
appear to show a greater risk of accident than we find realized in actual
working, and it is manifest that there are compensations to be taken
into account. In the first place, the term “ color-blind ” is itself in some
degree misleading ; for it must be remembered that the signals to which
the color-blind person is said to be “blind” are not invisible to him.
To the red-blind, the red light is a lessluminous green; to the green-
blind, the green light is a less luminous red. The danger arises because
the apparent differences are not sufficiently characteristic to lead to cer-
tain and prompt identification in all states of illumination and of atmos-
phere. It must be admitted therefore that a color-blind driver may be
at work for a long time without mistakes; and it is probable, knowing,
as he must, that the differences between different signal lights appear
to him to be only trivial, that he will exercise extreme caution. Then
it must be remembered that lights never appear to an engine driver in
unexpected places. Before being intrusted with a train he is taken over
the line, and is shown the precise position of every light. If a light
did not appear where it was due, he would naturally ask his fireman to
aid in the lookout. It must be also remembered that to over-run a
danger signa] does not of necessity imply a collision. A driver may
over-run the signal, and after doing so may see a train or other obstruc-
tion on the line, and may stop in time to avoid an accident. In sucha
case he would probably be reported and fined for over-running the sig-
nal; and if the same thing occurred again, he would be dismissed for
his assumed carelessness, probably with no suspicion of his defect.
Color-blind firemen are unquestionably thus driven out of the service

ay So .
Lg eee Pte
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 699

by the complaints of their drivers; and none but railway officials know
how many cases of over-running signals, followed by disputes as to
what the signals actually were, occur in the course of a year’s work. I
have never heard of an instance in this country, in which, after a rail-
way accident, the color vision of the driver concerned or of his fireman
has been tested by an expert on the part either of the board of trade or
of the company, but a fireman in the United States has recently recov-
ered heavy damages from the company for the loss of one of his legs
in a collision which was proved to have been occasioned by the color-
blindness of the driver. Looking at the whole question, I feel that the
danger on railways is a real one, but that it is minimized by the several
considerations to which I have referred, and that it is much smaller
than the frequency of the defect migbt lead us to think likely.

At sea, the danger is much more formidable. The lights appear at
all sorts of times and places, and there may be only one responsible
person on the lookout. Mr. Bickerton, of Liverpool, has lately pub-
lished accounts of three cases in which the color-blindness of officers of
the mercantile marine, all of whom had passed the board of trade ex-
amination, was accidentally discovered by the captain being on deck
when the officers in question gave wrong orders consequent upon mis-
taking the light shown by an approaching vessel. The loss of the Ville
du Havre was almost certainly due to color-blindness ; and a very fatal
collision in American waters, some years ago, between the Jsaac Bell
and the Lumberman, was traced, long after the event, to the color-
blindness of a pilot, who had been unjustly accused of being drunk at
the time of the occurrence. In how many instances color-blindness
has been the unsuspected cause of wrecks and other calamities at sea,
it is impossible to do more than conjecture.

It is necessary then, alike in the public interest and in the -interest
of the color-blind, wio have doubtiess often suffered in the misfortunes
which their defects have produced, to detect them in time to prevent
them from entering into the marine and railway services; and the next
question is, how this detection should be accomplished. We have to
distinguish the color-blind from the color-sighted ; but we must be care-
ful not to confound color-blindness with the much more common con-
dition of color-ignorance.

It would surprise many people, more especially many ladies, to dis-
cover the extent to which sheer ignorance of color prevails among boys
and men of the laboring classes. Many who ean see colors perfectly,
and who would never be in the least danger of mistaking a railway
signal, are quite unable to name colors or to describe them, and they are
sometimes unable 1o perceive for want of education of a faculty which
they notwithstanding possess, anything like fine shades of difference.
Mr. Gladstone once published a paper on the scanty and uncertain
color-nomenclature of the Homeric poems, and he might have found
very similar examples among his own contemporaries and in his own
(O00 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

country. I have lately seen a pattern card of colored silks issued by a
Lyons manufacturer, which contains samples of two thousand different
colors, each with its more or less appropriate name. There is here a
larger color vocabulary than the entire vocabulary for the expression
of all his knowledge and of all his ideas, which is possessed by an aver-
age engine driver or fireman, and just as most of us would be igno-
rant of the names of the immense majority of the colors displayed on
that card, so hundreds of men and boys among the laboring classes,
especially in large towns where the opportunities of education by the
colors of flowers and insects are very limited, are ignorant of the names
of colors which persons of ordinary cultivation mention constantly in
their daily talk and expect their children to pick up and to understand
unconsciously. It is among people thus ignorant that the officials of
the board of trade and of railways have been most suecessful in find-
ing their supposed color-blind persons, and these persons who would
never have been pronounced color-blind by an expert have been able,
as soon as they have paid a little attention to the observation and
naming of color, to pass an official examination triumphantly. The
sense of color presents many analogies to that of hearing. Some peo-
ple can hear a higher or a lower note than others, the difference de-
pending upon structure, and being incapable of alteration. No one
who cannot hear a note of a certain pitch can ever be trained to do so;
but within the original auditory limits of each individual the sense of
hearing may be greatly improved by cultivation. In like manner a
person who is blind to red or green must remain so, but one whose
color sense is merely undeveloped by want of cultivation may have its
acuteness for fine differences very considerably increased. —

In order to test color-vision for railway and marine purposes, the first
suggestion which would occur to many people would be to employ as
objects the flags and signal lanterns which are used in actual working.
I have heard apparently sensible people use, with reference to such a
procedure, the phrase upon which Faraday was wont to pour ridicule,
and to say that the fitness of the suggested method * stands to reason.”
To be effectual, such a test must be applied in different states of atmos-
phere, with colored glasses of various tints, with various degrees of
illumination, and with the objects at various distances; so that much
time would be required in order to exhaust all the conditions under
which railway signals may present themselves. ‘his being done, the
examinee must be either right or wrong each time. He has always an
even chance of being right; and it would be an insoluble problem to
discover how many correct answers were due to accident, or how many
incorrect ones might be attributed to nervousness or to confusion of
names.

We must remember that what is required is to detect a color-blind
person against his will; and to ascertain, not whether he describes a
given signal rightly or wrongly on a particular occasion, but whether

;
§

COLOR: VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS. 701

he can safely be trusted to distinguish correctly between signals on all
occasions. We want, in short, to ascertain the state of bis color-vision
generally; and hence to infer his fitness or unfitness to discharge the
duties of a particular occupation.

For the accomplishment of this object, we do not in the least want
to know what the examinee calls colors, but only how he sees them,
what colors appear to him to be alike and what appear to be unlike;
and the only way of attaining this knowledge with certainty is to cause
him to make matches between colored objects, to put those together
which appear to him to be essentially the same, and to separate those
which appear to him to be essentially different. This principle of test-
ing was first laid down by Seebeck, who required from examinees a
complete arrangement of a large number of colored objects; but it has
been greatly simplified and improved by Professor Holmgren, who
pointed out that such a complete arrangement was superfluous, and
that the only thing required was to cause the examinee to make matches
to certain test colors, and, for this purpose, to select from a heap which
contained not only such matches but also the colors which the color-
biind were liable to confuse with them.

After many trials, Holmgren finally selected skeins of Berlin wool as
the material best suited for this purpose; and his set of wools com-
prises about 150 skeins. The advantages of his method over every
other are that the wool is very cheap, very portable, and always to be
obtained in every conceivable color and shade. The skeins are not
lustrous, so that light reflected from the surfaces does not interfere
with the accuracy of the observation, and they are very easily picked
up and manipulated, much more easily than colored paper or colored
glass. The person to be tested is placed before a table in good day-
light, the table is covered by a white coth, and the skeins are thrown
upon it in a loosely arranged heap. The examiner then selects a skein
of pale green, much diluted with white, and throws it down by itself
to the left of the heap. The examinee is directed to look at this pat-
tern skein and at the heap, and to pick out from the latter and to place
beside the pattern as many skeins as he can find which are of the same
color. He is not to be particular about lighter or darker shades, and
is not to compare narrowly, or to rummage much amongst the heap,
but to select by his eyes, and to use his hands chiefly to change the po-
sition of the selected material.

In such circumstances a person with normal color sight will select
the greens rapidly and without hesitation, will select nothing else, and
will select with a certain readiness and confidence easily recognized by
an experienced examiner, and which may even be carried to the extent
of neglecting the minute accuracy which a person who distrusts his
own color sight will frequently endeavor to display. Some normal
sighted people will complete their seletions by taking greens which
incline to yellow, and greens which incline to blue, while others will
702 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

reject both; but this is a difference depending sometimes upon imper-
tect color education, sometimes upon the interpretation placed upon
the directions of the examiner, but the person who so selects sees the
green element in the yellow greens and in the blue greens, and is not
color-blind. The completely color-blind, whether to red or to green,
will proceed with almost as much speed and confidence as the color
sighted; and will rapidly pick out a number of drabs, fawns, stone
colors, pinks, or yellows. Between the foregoing classes we meet with
a few people who declare the imperfection of their color sense by the
extreme care with which they select, by their slowness, by their hesi-
tation, and by their desire to compare this or that skein with the pat-
tern more narrowly than the conditions of the trial permit. They may
or may not ultimately add one or two more of the confusion colors to
the green, but they have a manifest tendency to do so, and a general
uncertainty in their choice. One of the great advantages of Holmgren’s
method over every other is the way in which the examiner is able to
judge, not only by the final choice of matches, but also by the manner
in which the choice is made, by the action of the hands, and by the ges-
tures and general deportment of the examinee.

When confusion colors have been selected, or when an unnatural
slowness and hesitation have been shown in selecting, the examinee
must be regarded as either completely or incompletely color-blind. In
order to determine which, and also to which color be is defective, he is
subjected to the second test. For this, the wool is mixed again, and the
pattern this time is a skein of light purple—that is, of a mixture of red
and violet, much diluted with white. To match this, the color-blind
always selects deeper colors, If he puts only deeper purples, he is in-
completely color-blind. If he takes blue or violet, either with or with-
out purple, he is completely red blind. If he takes green or gray, or
one alone, with or without purple, he is completely green blind. If
he takes red or orange, with or without purple, be is violet blind. If
there be any doubt, the examinee may be subjected to a third test, which
is not necessary for the satisfaction of an expert, but which sometimes
strengthens the proof in the eyes of a bystander. ‘The pattern for this
third test is a skein of bright red, to be used in the same way as the
green and the purple. The red blind selects for this dark greens and
browns, which are much darker than the pattern; while the green blind
selects greens and browns which are lighter than the pattern.

The method of examination thus described is, I believe, absolutely
trust-worthy. Itrequires no apparatns beyond the bundle of skeins of
wool, no arrangements beyond a room with a good window, and a table
with a white cloth. In examining large numbers of men, they may be ad-
mitted into the room fifty or so ata time, may all receive theirinstructions
together, and may then make their selections one by one, all not yet
examined watching the actions of those who come up in their turn, and
thus learning how to proceed. The time required for large numbers

————
COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS, 703

averages about a minute a person. I have heard and read of instances
of color-blind people who had passed the wool test satisfactorily, and
had afterwards been detected by other methods, but I confess that I do
not believe in them. I do not believe that in such cases the wool test

was applied properly, or in accordance with Holmgren’s very precise in-

structions; and I know that it is often applied in a way which can lead
to nothing but erroneous results. Railway foremen, for example, re-
ceive out of a store a Small collectiou of colored wools selected on no
principle, and they use it by pulling outa single thread, and by asking
the examinee, “ What color do you call that?” Men of greater scien-
tific pretensions than railway foremen have not always selected their
pattern colors accurately, and have allowed those whom they examined
and passed to make narrow comparisons between the skeins in all sorts
of lights in a way which should of itself have afforded sufficient evi-
dence of defect.

Although however the expert may be fully satisfied by the wool test
that the examinee is not capable of distinguishing with certainty
between red and green flags or lights in all the circumstances in which
they can be displayed, it may still remain for him to satisfy the employer
who is not an expert, the railway manager, or the shipowner, and to
convince him that the color-blind person is unfit for certain kinds of
employment. It may be equally necessary to convince other workmen
that the examinee has been fairly and rightly dealt with. Both these
objects may be easily attained by the use of slight modifications of the
lights which are employed. Lanterns for this special purpose were
contrived sume years ago by Holmgren himself and by the late Pro-
fessor Donders, of Utrecht, and what are substantially their contriv-
ances have been brought forward within the last few months as novel-
ties by gentlemen in this country who have re-invented them. The prin-
ciple of all is the same, namely, that light of varying intensity may be
displayed through apertures of varying magnitude and through colored
glass of varying tints, so as to imitate the appearances of signal lamps
at different distances and under different conditions of illumination, of
weather, and of atmosphere. ‘To the color-blind the difference between
a red light and a green one is not a difference of color, but of luminos-
ity, the color to which he is blind appearing the less luminous of the
two. He may therefore be correct in his guess as to which of the two
is exhibited on any given occasion, and he is by no means certain to
mistake one for the other when they are exhibited in immediate suc-
cession. His liability to error is chiefly conspicuous when he sees one
light only and when the conditions which govern its luminosity depart
in any degree from those to which he is most accustomed. With the
lanterns of which I have spoken it is always possible to deceive a color-
blind person by altering the luminosity of a light without altering its
color, This may be done by diminishing the light behind the glass, by
ncreasing the thickness of the red or green glass, or by placing a piece
704 COLOR-VISION AND COLOR-BLINDNESS.

of neutral tint, more or less dark, in front of either. The most incred-
ulous employer may be convinced by expedients of this kind that the
color-blind are not to be relied upon for the safe control of ships or of
locomotives. With regard to the whole questionthere are many points
of great interest, both physical and physiological, which are still more
or less uncertain, but the practical elements have, I think, been well-
nigh exhausted, and the means of securing safety are fully in the hands
of those who choose to master and to employ them. The lanterns in
their various forms are useful for the purpose of thoroughly exposing
the color-blind and for bringing home the character of their incapacity
to unskilled spectators ; but they are both cumbrous and superfluous
for the detection of the defect, which may be accomplished with far
greater ease and with equal certainty by the wool test alone.

I have already mentioned that the examinations which have been
conducted in the United States, thanks to the indefatigable labors of
Dr. Joy Jeffries, have Ied to the discovery of an enormous and pre-
viously quite unsuspected amount of color ignorance, the condition
which is frequently mistaken for eolor-blindness by the methods of
examination which are in favor with railway companies and with the
board of trade; and this color ignorance has been justly regarded as a
blot on the American system of national education. It has therefore,
in some of the States, led to the adoption of systematic color-teaching
in the schools; and for this purpose Dr. Joy Jeffries bas introduced a
wall chart and colored cards. The children are taught, in the first
instance, to match the colors in the chart with those of the cards dis-
tributed to them, and whet they are tolerably expert at matching they
are further taught the names of the colors. It must nevertheless

TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.*

By F. REULEAUX.

From the present status of the world’s culture, one can not fail to
discern thesignificant influence of our scientific technology in qualifying
us for greater achievements than the past centuries have yet witnessed,
whether in connection with rapid transit by land or sea, tunneling
mountains, piercing the air, making the lightning our message-bearer
from pole to pole or sending our voices across the land; or whether,
indeéd, from another point of view we bring into our service the mighty
mechanical powers, or adapt and make use of those intangible contriv-
ances usually unnoticed by the world at large.

Everywhere in modern life, about us, in us, with us, beside us, is felt
the influence of scientific art acting as an agent and as companion,
whose ceaseless service we never realize until for a moment it fails us.

Commonplace though this be, still it seems to me that in the cultured
world and perhaps in the narrower circles of scientific men, this truth
is too slightly valued. The value of scientific technology in its true
character as producer and promoter of civilization, is too little recog-
nized.

This may result from a confusion of the so-called technical with the
unscientific; or on the other hand, from concealment of its results under
a preponderating mass of idealism, its development being cramped by
ambition for gain and trammeled by social evils, which go hand in hand
with industrial labor. But I will not here consider this side of the
question. I would attempt a nearer approach to the inner sanctuary
of technology to certain weighty questions, which appear especially
deserving of present notice, as :

What place, particularly in associate working, the technology of our
day takes in civilization? A place not so well defined, it appears to me,
as is chat we assign to less important social, political, and scientific
events.

Again, @ question oceurs as to the chief features of the method fol-
lowed by technology to attain its ends, and concerning the plan which

706 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

must more or less underlie device and invention; a question which
(especially for patent legislation) has long employed and must long
continue to employ the scientist as well as the administrative practi-
tioner.

If we will compare our civilization with that of other nations we must
understandingly glance at the people and their pursuits, which we find
upon the lowest stratum; for example, those who, lacking a knowl-
edge of writing, that wondrous thought transmitter, have, of course,
no care for science. In this comparison one will soon encounter peoples
whom a high culture has for centuries, yes, thousands of centuries,
been a part. These are the peoples of eastern and southern Asia, the
Chinese, Japanese, people of India, the Persians, and Arabians. Noting
without prejudice their culture, we must concede them to be in a state
of high development, indeed to have been highly developed, when mid-
dle Europe still remained deep in barbarism. Even then science and
art flourished among them, and is still advancing.

For 3,000 years the Indian Vedas have devoutly proclaimed the
Deity ; 2,000 years ago the Indian poets produced their odyssey the
‘“ Mahabharata”—the great Bharata, the forerunner of many dramas,
among them the tender “ Sakuntala,” the charm of which is still potent
since its sentiments found their origin in the heart of man. Philosophy
flourished likewise, and the science of language in so great degree that
the Indian grammarians of to-day can look back upon an unbroken line
of predecessors, the vista terminating in Panini, whom they reverence
like a god. Mathematics, too, were fostered, and to-day we write our
numbers in Indian characters. In parts of India and in eastern Asia
the commercial arts progressed then as now. Persia, too, was laurel-
crowned among the world’s poets. Following the great Firdousi came
the ‘‘ Horaz” of Schiras, and in his footsteps Hafis sung his immortal
songs, all of which have become a part of our literary treasure through
the sesame of translation. And the Arabian literature, to which we
have not yet had access in its entirety, how has it laid under tribute
the Grecian inheritance, and so perfected astronomy that at the pres-
ent time we name half the heavens after them. How, under the patient
and studious princes of the time of Charles, did they foster the growth
of arithmetical and still deeper science! How too have they surpassed
our knowledge of chemistry in various substances and essences!

What is then the spiritual difference which sunders their path from
ours? Are we in certain arts still behind them? They are brave sol-
diers, gentle and industrious citizens, wise statesmen and scholars ;
honor and justice hold high rank among them. Where then, considered
as men, lie the points of difference ?

Or, on the other hand, do we question whether the spiritual bounda-
ries lead to the good, and would we fain know whence springs our
superiority over them ?

How is it possible, for example, that England with a few thousand of
TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION. 407

her own troops, rules the two hundred millions of India; how was it
possible for her to remain victor in opposition to their terrific and fanat-
ical revolt in 1857? How does 1t happen that we, Europeans or (not
particularly to mention the European-settled America,) that the At-
lantic nations alone compass the earth with railroads, surround it with
telegraph lines, traverse its water girdle with mighty ships, and that
to all this the other five-sixths of the earth’s inhabitants have not added
a span—the same five-sixths which still, for the greater part, are
grandly organized and highly cultivated ?

There are different ways of explaining this astonishing fact, or rather,
of at least attempting to determine it comprehensively. Klemm, the
industrious Leipsie collector, who was a pre-historian long before the
discovery of pile habitations, has propounded the distinction between
“active” and “ passive” peoples; and many to-day follow him therein.
To him the Atlantic nations are the active; all others, down tothe utterly
uncultivated, the passive. According to this theory we make history,
they suffer it. Although this discrimination appears to have so much
in its favor it does not hold. Nations can (as history teaches) be a
long time active, then passive, and later again active. Activity and
passivity are not to nations indwelling characteristics, but cireum-
stances into which and out of which they can fall without changing
their spiritual, essential position. One proof of reality the Klemm
theory does not stand. Europe could, to-morrow, unyoked from Asia,
be made passive without losing the character which: makes railroads,
steamships and telegraphs belong to her as her spiritual possession.
The Arabian, on the contrary, could destroy the products of scientific
technology as the pretended Omar the books, but would not be able to
re-produce them, as has many times been done in case of the books.

Others have supposed, and still believe, that it is Christianity that
establishes the distinction.

This however does not stand the test. Of course a considerable part
ot the thinking which resulted in metamorphosed inventions and
discoveries was done in the Christian empire, but by no means all.
What an innovation was made by the art of printing, and yet we
know that 1,000 years earlier the Chinese had found a way to this art.
Gunpowder, too, that marks so decisive a step in the progress of our
civilization, was used by the Arabians long before the time of the
Freiburg monks. Then in mechanics we find those important power
machines, the water wheels, are very old and of Asiatic origin.

But passing from these examples to a genuine offspring of Kurope,
the steam-engine, watching its gradual development up to its actual
use—the time of the Renaissance—in Italy, Germany, France, and
England, but never outside of Christendom, even this, we find, does
not encounter progress, but on the contrary, its adherents often oppose
it up to the last.

We look further and do we not find to-day Christians living in the
708 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

East, for example, in Armenia and in Abyssinia, entirely outside the
contemplation of our victorious modern technology? In the past they
have added naught thereto and to-day they are not its contributors.

It can not be the things themselves, the inventions, but the engen-
dering thought which must have produced the change, the innovation.
In fact we can but ascribe this to a peculiar progress in thought
precedence, a difficult, dangerous ascent to a higher, freer comprehen-
sion of nature.

The spell which bound us was broken by our understanding when we
found the forces of nature following in their operations no capricious
will—a Godly will—but working according to steadfast, unchangeable
laws—the laws of nature; never otherwise.

According to laws mighty, fixed, eternal,
Must we complete our being’s circle

breathe Goethe’s words from out the terrors of nature’s inexorable
power. But according to “laws mighty, fixed, eternal” roll the worlds,
the stars pursue their course, a tile falls from the roof or a drop from
its cloud height.

Suns wander up and down,

Worlds go and come again,
And this no wish can alter.

In this grand poetical form is seized the same uplifting knowledge
that not the bodily but the spiritual force incloses within itself the pre-
sentiment of God, that even the world’s creation consists in the immu-
tability of itslaws. That it might win the knowledge, thought broke
through the oid barriers, but immediately drew from real life con-
clusions such as these, if we may utter them quite free from secondary
considerations.

If we bring lifeless bodies into such circumstances that their working
of natural laws answers our purposes, we may permit them instead of
this labor to work for living beings.

This began to be carried out with intelligence, and thereby was created
our present technology. Scientific technology I must name it. When
the spirit entertained the idea which sought to make natural laws a con-
scious power, scarcely anything was known of these laws and they must
first be wooed. Through hard battle indeed must they be won, for
the learned world believed itself to have them in its possession. The
reformer had therefore not simply to make the discovery, but to
accomplish the gigantic task of overcoming antagonistic convictions
and at the same time to support a spiritual campaign up to the heights
of freer knowledge, for this march found weighty opposition in the
decrees of the church, which had demanded its sacrifice. The victory

was won, and therewith our present technology gained the command, —

skirmishers exist as a reserve, and this more from stubbornness than
conviction. At all events they do not in the least retard the chief move-
ment.

What had happened had the reaction of that time prevailed—for it
was a reaction begun in Germany more than 100 years before, Coper-
nicus having lain more than 90 years in the grave when Galileo was
unwillingly compelled to witness against him—what had happened in
such an event is difficult to conceive; and yet not so, for we may see it
exemplified in the great Arabian nation. Among this people the reac-
tion had, in truth, conquered. Their Galileos, their Averrhoés, and
numberless others, were defeated, together with their free convictions ;
with them their entire sect, and therewith the Arabian culture, which
already had lifted the hand to grasp the palm of victory of free knowl-
edge, was paralyzed by the fanatical victors, and paralyzed they still le
low, already half a thousand years. Allah aalam! ‘‘God alone knows,”
therefore shalt thou not desire to know! So sounds it since then for
the pure Mohammedan; all investigation is cut off from him, forbidden
and declared sinful. A noble and refined disciple of the Prophet has
given expression tothe hope that the Moslem may yet be called to take
up the lost leadership. Who may believe him? However, it appears
certain that the overthrow of free thought in the Arabian language
has become decisive for the remaining Asiatic culture. Like adam lies
the spiritual-slain mass between them and us, and so has it come that
we alone have entered into the development to which the pictured
progress of thought led the way. The powers of nature which she has
taught us to make useful are the mechanical, physical, and chemical ;
to permit them to work for us requires a great outfit of mathematical
and natural science. From this entire equipment we exercise a portion
as a privilege.

It seems necessary, in order to briefly distinguish the two directions
of development, to call them by particular names. The Greeks named
an artistic mechanism, an arrangement through which the unusual could
be conducted, a manganon, which word goes back, according to some, to
the name of the eminent race of magicians. Al! kinds of definite tangi-
ble things which were considered skillfully and wisely thought out were
so titled ; among others, a catapult for projectiles for purposes of war,
With this the word comes into the Middle Ages. Then, early in the sev-
enteenth century, a great machine was invented for rolling and smooth-
ing the washing, and since this contrivance bore a remarkable outward
resemblance to the catapult, it was also given its name, whereupon the
word wandered further into the remaining European tongues, as every
house-wife knows, or perhaps does not know, if she send her washing
to a “mangle.”

Again, for our purpose, I would generalize that old word and name,
on the one hand, that something by means of which the forces of na-
ture are known in her laws, manganism, and on the other, that which
710 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

seems to stand as nature’s defender, mysteriously guarding her ways,
naturism.

Employing for the present these terms, we shall see the peoples of
the earth divided into manganistical and naturistical, and shall notice
that, on account of their full understanding of their material equipment,
the former have a powerful advantage over the latter. Indeed, we dare
go much further and hesitate not to assert that to the manganistical
nations belongs the domination of the earth, although now, as ever, it
must be battled for. Still the observer may confidently predict the vic-
tory of the manganists and that resistance can but mean either gradual
overthrow or destruction.

That unyielding determination makes possible the unprecedented
step from naturism to manganism is shown in our time, a time so rich
in culture, by the example of Japan.

The chief men of this nation, having recognized the necessity, have
also gained the political power for the purpose, and so transpires before
our eyes the intelligent effort, towards which all their strength is
directed, of systematically changing their scheme of instruction. Diffi-
cult as is the attempt its beginning promises success, consisting as it
does in nothing else than learning, learning, learning.

Very gently in India the English have commenced to work towards
manganistical education, and although all is yet in the beginning,
great results are possible.

It is unnecessary however to stray into distant lands to find natur-
ism; in Europe itis at hand, and indeed in every human being lurks a
portion of naturism. The first touch with manganism must be through
education, the surrender of the uncultured mass of intellect to kind na-
ture, but subject to a firm control which shall so hold her in check as
to prevent the ruin which would otherwise threaten in the full contact
with fate.

In Spain manganism has developed but slightly. The Iberian Penin-
sula has not contributed to the great metamorphosing inventions ;
naturally the repression of thought advancement would occur more
readily there, as at that period the new-discovered world held attention.
The loss to Spain is, however, incalculable.

Greece, once leading the world in arts and sciences, was at the time
of the blossoming of scientific technology, so entangled in the result of
her fall that the movement did not seize her. Now as a nation she
seeks to raise herself out of naturism in order to resume the transmis-
sion of the old spiritual activity, and we may watch with interest the
experiment made upon the classical soil of this beautiful land. With-
out manganism the effort must fail.

Italy furnishes us with a striking illustration. For a long time de-
voted thoroughly to naturism, and also desiring her share in the great
scientific discoveries of the Renaissance, this highly-gifted people more
or less neglected manganism, but preserved her flowers of art, and has

>
TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION. conta

therein sought and found her glory; this neglect her new form of gov-
ernment has caused her to recognize, as well as the necessity for its
avoidance; consequently we see the Italians exerting themselves with
astonishing energy to spread among themselves manganistical indus-
tries and qualities. That their rapid and significant progress in useful
industries weakens their achievements in art industry can not be
doubted.

Like a shadow this fact flits over us, until it seems as if between the
two directions must exist an opposition to which one will fall a sacrifice.
But not so; art and scientific technology are not at variance; it only
requires great effort for both to be developed; great firmness and
spiritual insight into eesthetical laws to counterbalance the disturbing
grasp of the machine.

That both may develop side by side is shown by the present move-
ment in Austria and Germany.

Turning now to the consideration of the inner method of manganism,
J pass over an entire line of preparatory grades, but desire to note that
which is common to different actions, but which seems to the outside
world contradictory. Such generalizing shortens, but is necessary in
order to make clearer the influx of new appearances in the technical
kingdom. For the purpose of making these certain, efficient and intel-
ligent, it may be permitted to employ a few simple examples:

Fig. 1.

The cog-wheel a, Fig. 1, catching in the usual manner in the cogs of
the bar at 2, is rotated at 1 in the stationary frame ¢c, in which also at
3, the cog-bar b slides, this bar, a very long one, being pulled down by
a weight B.

Imagining the wheel a so turned as to raise the weight Bb, or in such
manner as to lower it, we have before us an efficient machine of a defi-
nite kind, viz, one of continuous direction of motion whether forward
or backward. We will call it, because of this continuous motion, a
running work (Laufwerke). As is well known, there are many running
works; among them friction wheels, cog-wheels, beltings, turbines,
(12 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

ete., in many different combinations. Opposed to this mechanism is
another of a different motion; of this Fig. 2 furnishes an example.
The wheel a turns 1, in a fixed frame and has saw or similar shaped
teeth in which, at 2,a ratchet catches. This ratchet hinders the wheel
from following the pulling of the weight A at the margin of the wheel
a. But if the wheel be turned as we wind a cord, 4, on which hangs the
weight, the ratchet permits the wheel to go forward but retards it again
as soon as the compelling force subsides.

This arrangement is known as “ obstruction” (Gesperre.)

In the use just described we would call it obstructing work (Sperrwerk);
its backward and forward motion varying, thus requiring it to be com-
pletely discriminated from running work (Laufwerke).

From the given groups of mechanisms, five others are possible.

If we next imagine the ratchet to be raised, through pressure upon
the button at 5, the obstruction being released, the weight A falls down,
taking or drawing with it the wheel a. The resulting motion can be
utilized in many ways: quickly, as through a push with a ram, slowly,
gradually, as by a clock; also m the running work of the telegraph,
changing always according to supply.

Through winding on spokes, the mechanical labor can always be use-
fully changed. Instead of lifting a weight A, one can also place an
elastic body, @. e., a spring in a condition of tension. We will there-
fore name the produced mechanism tension work (Spannwerk). The
crossbow was a spring tension work; there are.millions of spring
tension works in practical use in flint-locks.

We procure a third mechanism through a slight change of the man-
agement, namely, by allowing the ratchet that was previously released
to be again caught. This then catches up the wheel @ and with it the
fallen weight A. <A sufficiently strong structure pre-supposed, one can
also make the mechanism serve for catching up heavy masses, and we
name it accordingly catch work (Fangwerke). The mechanisms used in
mines and also in elevators for the catching of the propellers in case of
rope-break, are such catch work. If one considers that the wheel teeth
can be made so fine as to be invisible, whereby the circumference of the
wheel a will be smooth and the obstructing ratchet simply a friction
body, the obstruction changes into a friction obstruction, as one per-
ceives in the brake of the railroad train. he applications of catch work
are also very useful and numerous.

A fourth mechanism one would secure out of the groups in question,
if one attached, but on a moving arm, perhaps a second similar ratchet
to the nearer one, fastened to it, the last having a swinging motion.
Through this motion one can then, intermittingly, move the wheel with
the intention of lifting the weight, since the first ratchet always catches
the wheel when it begins to let the weight sink. The thus formed and
driven mechanism is called leap work (Schaltwerk). Applications of
the same are known and many. A fifth manner of conversion of the
TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION. ‘ils

groups results, if one uses perhaps a narrow, corner-shaped segment of
a wheel and forms with it an obstruction for the passage between the
points 1 and 2, in the fashion, I will say, of a door. Then through clos-
ing the obstruetion at 2, the passage can be retarded or stopped ;
through loosening, it will be opened. We will name the mechanism in
this form, closing work (Schliesswerk). It exists in closing doors, win-
dows, closets, chests, in the form of locks, and so on in known and
numerouschanges. We see here the wide domains of the lock, which
offers millions, yes millionfold variations of closing work.

The sixth, and perhaps from the standpoint of the mechanic the most
remarkable change of the obstruction, is the checking or check work
(Hemmwerk), as we will say. It exists if we set free the obstruction
by light touches upon the button at 5 and immediately closing it again.
If this occur regularly the progress of the wheel a@ may serve, among
other purposes, for measuring time. In clocks this check work is largely
used. The regular release of the obstruction takes place by means of
an even-timed body, the pendulum. Variations of check work exist
in many other machines.

Thus we see there are many examples of obstruction works (Gesperr-
werken), aS we may call them collectively, 7. e., works in which the ob-
structing ratchet plays a part. But let us look still farther. It often
occurs that obstruction works are combined and the action of one trans-
mitted to the other. A fine example is furnished by the set-trigger of
target rifles. This. trigger is nothing else than a little tension work,
very easily loosened, in consequence of which the firmer held tension
work of the cock is loosened, one thus working upon the other. Such
a combination we may call a tension work of a higher order, or, in case
of a similar combining of obstruction works we speak of an obstrue-
tion work of a higher order. An illustration is furnished by the mo-
tive work of a clock, where the weight and spring tension work
(Gewichts-und Fedderspannwerk) drives the obstruction work (das
Hemmwerk), thus working in the second order. Clearly, we have here
a principle, for the transmission of motion can occur between obstrue-
tion work and wheel work, and so on. For example, there is attached
to the check work of the clock a cog-wheel work which moves the
hands. Naming motive works in general, several examples of which
we have noticed drive works (Treibwerken), the wheel work of a clock
must bea drive work of the third order, consisting of tension work,
check work, and wheel-running work arranged the one over the other.

Having taken so broad a view in this field of observation, we turn to
another quite different in aspect.

If we notice our machines in practical use we find among them a
number in which fluidity serves as force and motion transmitter, as the
hydraulic press, the pump, spouting machines, water wheels, the tur-
bines, ete. But not only liquid but gaseous fluids we similarly convert
into gas motors, air machines, and especially into steam-engines. Close
714 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

observation shows that we have subjected all these cases, in consequence
of the suitable inclosing of the liquids in channels, pipes, and vessels,
to such a forced way of motion—I at one time proposed to name it
‘‘ forced-running ”—that they are able to work in mechanisms as do firm
bodies, but have this advancage of conforming themselves always to
their surroundings.

If we introdnce something of this kind in our running work (Fig. 1),
replacing the cog bar by a stream of water, then our running work
becomes a water wheel, mediocre indeed, if the water is taken as the
driving force. It becomes a dipping wheel or spray wheel when the
wheel a is propelling and the water } is the propelled body.

The practice in machines leads to the same thought concerning ob-
struction work. The obstructing ratchets are named valves when either
the wheel a or its substitute—a section of the wheel, cog bar, ete.—
have been converted to liquids. The valves are in reality in every
way, try them or examine them as we will, the obstructing ratchets of
the liquid. One observes immediately what a new, great, yes, even
grand, enlargement has been gained by the putting into use of these
drive works, Examples surround us, I should say crowd around us.
Our common water-pump, with the butt of the valves and the sucking
valve, is a water leap work prepared exactly in accordance with the
scheme mentioned before, viz, of that leap work found in Fig. 2, Also
in check work we find fluids, liquids, and gates taking the place of an
ascending wheel or its substitute, as in water throwing machines and
not less in steam-engines.

In fact, regarding these machines as drive works, they correspond to
clocks which I have taken as illustrations of obstraction works, the
difference being solely that in clocks a harmful resistance, in the other
machines a useful resistance, is overcome. Had I more time I would
prove their similarity in all points.

The valves, for instance, often single, but sometimes a combination
of two or more in one machine, correspond to the so-called anchor of
the clock check work, to the eccentric (muschelschieber) of the steam
engine, the pendulum of the clock being represented by the vibrating
butt, ete.

Thus the great and powerful steam-engine legitimately and with
perfect ease falls in the line, taking there its rightful place. And so
must it be with scientific perception which will have to do with true,
logical connection only (not with sensational), performing wonders.
But in dealing with this principle we must gain one more ascent in
order to attain the full theoretical horizon. Let us not regret the
trifling exertion which must bring abundant reward.

Noting, from the common standpoint, the source of power in our
steam-engine, we find within the collected mass of stored-up steam an
active, communicating atom force, which is an expansive power or ten-
sion work. The boiler, too, with its valves and contrivance for letting
TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION. (5

off steam, is but a tension work, differing from that previously noticed
in that it lodges in a physical manuer the called forth tension, making
it, in truth,a physical tension work. This observation carries us further,
draws us on, as it were, to the casual connection by which heat is com-
municated to the boiler water. This connecting link is the fire, the
glowing, flaming coal which gave up chemically, in combustion, the
energy stored therein. Thus fire is a chemical tension work made
active through kindling, but holding latent, if we consider it in the
form of coal, a heat energy stored within by nature’s slow process dur-
ing millions of years and now eagerly yielded to our simple expedient.

Thus we have our steam-engine complete; in the boiler fire a liberated
chemical tension work; in the boiler itself a physical tension work
made active by the fire; in the engine proper, consisting of stop-cocks,-
cylinder, and piston-work, a mechanical check work, with motive power
previously supplied; consequently, as a whole, a general drive work of
the third order whereby we slight all secondary mechanisms of per-
mitted masses.

But if instead of the simple steam engine with its alternate motion
we consider a crank-engine, we have attached to the check work, in the
form of the crank-motor, a running work, which we can and do use, in
thousands of forms; but the machine thus becomes in this, its most-
used variety, a general drive-work of the fourth order.

Permit me to call attention to still another example taken from steam
industry upon the railroad.

In the locomotive just developed we have before us a drive work of
the fourth order. Next come the drive wheels of the engine as run-
ning work, friction-wheel work (Reibriider werk), and joining this loco-
motive the train gliding over the rails, a self-moving second running
work, making, as a whole, a drive work of the sixth order.

But let our train be of modern form and it will have a Westinghouse
brake. The reason of the great favor in which this brake is held and
of its great importance our theory explains as follows:

The brake itself is a catch work formed from a friction obstruction
work which we formerly set in motion with the hand,

Now we manage otherwise. Wehave with Westinghouse in the form
of the air battery on the train, indeed on every car, a strong, readily-
placed tension work which we can at all times easily release through a
stop cock in the form of an obstructing ratchet, which the brake con-
tracts. Beginning from above, if we follow the brake apparatus, we
have before us: The little steam-engiue, a check work ; the air pressure
pump, a leap work; the mentioned crank mechanism, a check work ;
and the side brake itself, a catch work ; together a drive work and in-
deed a mechanism of the fifth order; and if we add thereto, as we
must, steam-boiler and fire, the whole results as a general drive work
of the seventh order. Higher numbers of orders certainly do not be-
long to usual contrivances.
716 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION.

We may now turn, without anxiety lest we sacrifice clearness, to the
side of the most modern of all technical novelties, the electro-mechan-
ical. Here we recognize in the Galvanic battery, or chain, a chemical
running work, which expression can well be conceded, as it depends upon
motion excitement, although it be atomical; the induced physical-elec-
trical stream, the valves of which are the obstruction ratchet, the con-
tact, polishing springs, ete., is used in various arts; in telegraphy it
works in leap work of the second order, provides by relay for release
and making fast again, and a mechanical running arrangement of writ-
ing work ; it results, according to circumstances, from the third to the
fourth order.

The usual sound-contrivances of the railroad work in the fifth order,
chemically in current producers, physically leaping in the anchor pull-
ing through which a mechanical tension work, that is one bent by the
hand, is released ; the same drives a check work which again the little
hammer tension work (Hammerspannwerke) springs, makes taut, and
then releases.

Among chemical drive work, we notice that the tension works take
a prominent place. Those placed here will be of the number so artis-
tically prepared by chemists that they give up their tension, or expan-
sive force, slowly or rapidly. Gunpowder is the most powerful tension
work, which the naturistical groping Middle Age set in the place of the
mechanical tension work stretched by the hand of man out of netting,
bows, and sinews in large and small throwing machines. The purpose
remaining exactly the same, the kind of tension work was changed.
The fuse releasing the new tension work was in itself a slow running,
chemical tension work, entirely separated from the larger. Later we
got so far as to take the two together in a single contrivance, at first
in flint-locks, then in percussion locks. There one entered the third
order. The percussion cap, a chemical tension work rather easily liber-
ated, is set free by a mechanical tension work attached to the guncock.
The ball is thrown by a tension work of the third order, as occurs in
the set-trigger in the fourth order.

Allow me to say a word concerning a petty example, the match. Not
two generations have we possessed it, and previous to this brief period
we manganists, in point of fire kindling, were very nearly on a par with
the lowest naturists.

In a natural state, as we know, people, through laboriously acquired
skill, kindle a fire by rubbing together two pieces of wood; in other
words, they set free that tension work, heat. The old Greeks used for
the purpose the pyreion, the under piece of which, called the eschara,
contained a bore, in which the rubbing piece, the trypanon or borer,
was inserted and then turned by twisting the hands.

Ought not in some hidden corner of the Grecian mountains the pyr-
eion stillto be found? It would be very serviceable to bring it to light.

The little fire-chests containing flint, steel, tinder, and threads dipped

in sulphur, which in my earliest childhood I saw used in my home, are
examples which have kept their places in spite of the all-conquering
match ; it would be well to have specimens of these preserved in ethno-
graphical museums.

Later came steel and flint, a physical tension work used for itself.
With their help one kindled—and many still do it to-day—the tinder,
an easily freed tension work, especially prepared for the purpose and
consisting at that time of burnt linen.

On the tinder as soon as it glimmered, was set free a chemical ten-
sion work rather difficult to release, the thread dipped in sulphur, and
finally with this, a thin piece of wood, but not for a time a coal. For
the kindling of the wood alone one used, in succession, four distinct
tension works, one physical, stone and steel, and three chemical, tinder,
sulphur, and wood.

We now see the match fully in the domain of the former developed
principle. The little important fire tool was made by combining three,
but soon after four tension works, and is a chemical tension work of the
fourth order, formed from the tension works phosphorous, chloracid
kali, sulphur, and wood. For the sulphur, as is known, was later sub-
stituted in many ways wax or paraffine. But the principle is very
plainly recognized; each one of tze tension works following one upon
another, is more difficult to set free than its predecessor, but was freed
definitely, and then through a very easy mechanical action upon the
little tension work most highly sensitive, the hair-trigger, brought about
the deliverance, as it were, of each of the four obstructions which had
caused such trouble, demanding the entire force of one and frequently
of two men. That the combination of the four tension works was so
recently attained proves that the fundamental principle of the train of
thought must have been quite difficult.

We have now, at last, the manganistical principle fully before us, in a
common form as well as in the greatest, the examples embracing the
most powerful forces, down to the finest and smallest, and we ean de-
clare that the method consists: In the cultivation depending upon a sci-
entific knowledge of the laws of nature, and the resulting higher orders,
and those standing side by side, of mechanical, physical, and chemical drive
work,

If the foregoing is developed essentially with a consideration of me-
chanical technical aims, it permits itself to turn without any compul-
sion upon the precedency of chemical technology and may, therefore,
be found to embrace in itself the entire problem. One has only, for ex-
ample, to think of a chemical manufactory, ete., and how sulphurie acid
enters as a physical and mechanical medium in the colors. As in the
above both of the others are side by side with the mechanical.

From the standpoint now gained, if we again consider scientific tech-
nology, we shall see how its results are closely bound with our life
habits, indeed, with our entire eulture. We may overlook the fact that
718 TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION,

we are directly surrounded in our dwellings by thousands of obstruc-
tion works which have made our rooms safe, comfortable, and conven-
ient for light, air, and warmth. We may overlook this because natur-
istical labor is able to produce similar, although less perfect, results.
But let us notice other things whereby our dwellings have received their
character. There is the gas-light in the house, on the street, in the
public building. We may thank for it a chemical tension work of the
fourth order—fire, retort, gasometer, conduction by stop-cocks, passing
by all intermediate works—all of them important, all ramifying through
the city pipes. The water for house and street necessity, when taken
from a river-water conduit, furnishes a drive work of at least the sixth
order. Upon the railroad we move by drive work of a higher order,
regulate the powerful service with another, by means of drive works
permit freight to be carried on the rails from place to place, from land
to land, from one part of the earth to another, a thousand-fold more than
a person could carry. Throughout the earth by means of physical drive
work we have the messenger service, both written and spoken.

How fare we in war? In millions of chemical tension works, large
and small, generally of higher order, we carry the driving force to the
distant battlefield and there set it free by means of a high order of drive
works.

Upon the ocean we are carried hundreds of miles from land, for weeks
and months, by means of tension-work activity.

Rich productions, such as coal, we have gained from nature. The
naturistical man early found upon the high mountain range the water
course, that running work subordinated to tension work, and very
likely the future will bring to light other products, such as petroleum,
which we may say was discovered three decades ago. This productis a
highly elastic chemical tension work fitted to play its part under a clear
flame. In reality it is a combination of two or more chemical tension
works, each under such slight restraint as to free itself invisibly.

We had, therefore, to submit this product of nature to a process of
separation, according to the manganistical principle, into groups of
small parts easily liberated and on which the tension work was first
transmissible and generally applicable. Police directions required
that if the product were made an article of trade the obstruction (sper-
rung) should be a safe one; but how favorable has been the result.
This fluid tension work discovered, as it were, ‘‘ ready made” in nature
for purposes of illumination, has displaced those products which, by
the aid of noticeable manganistical implements had previously been
obtained from the seeds of plants. Let us turn to another phase of
tension work. The conflagration is but an invisible liberating of a chem-
ical tension work, as is well proved. The obstruction ratchet is raised in
opposition to our will with ever-increasing rapidity and the powerful,
liberated tension work often overleaps our control, but we bring to bear
upon it for the. purpose of its capture, another drive work, formerly
operated by main strength only, but now usually by chemical tension-

—
TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION. 719

work under the application of drive works of a still higher order. We
also turn a chemical tension work, the gas or chemical engine, as the
Americans callit, which acts instantaneously upon the water being used.
In the last case the drive work connected with the water is of a very
low order; this furnishes an example of the manner in which drive
works contest for the same intended motion and seek each to gain for
itself the palm in lessening the number of drive works, that is, the
height of the order number. Everywhere it is the manganistical
thought, the manganistical principle whereby we in part preserve, in
part make easier, in part defend our life, and whereby we also advance
annihilatingly against others.

Our industries, finally, which produce as well the necessities as the
manganistical mechanisms, what have they not brought about for cul-
ture advancement by means of this same manganistical principle? Here
let us venture a little nearer by attempting to apply a measure.

Coalserves us as an essential assistantin manganistical labor. Thisis
now obtained in an abundance of over 400,000,000 tons, the greater part
annually converted toindustrial purposes. Thesurplus above 400,000,000
tons suffices to cover heating necessities. So we have for each of the
300 working days of the year one and one-third million tons of coal,
which are used for chemical, mechanical, and physical-technical pur-
poses. If we sum up the entire labor arrived at therewith for the sake
of the survey of dynamical execution, the results under this acceptation
of uses of coal show 1} kilograms for horse-power in a working day of
12 hours, 7. e., 44 tons per hour during the year, together with the horse.
A horse-power, in round numbers, of 90,000,000, statistical numbers and
taxes, in fact, would in dynamics yield 20,000,000, For every horse-
power must be reckoned the working force of six strong men, which
results in 540,000,000 active man-power during a day of 12 hours. It
is this powerful executive force which the 250,000,000 of Atlantic na-
tions entirely alone (since the other 1,250,000,000 of naturists have
added nothing to it) have accomplished by man through the mangan-
istical principle! When we consider that every tenth one of the
1,250,000,000 men exerts daily such labor as before contemplated, prob-
ably a much too high estimate, there results an execution of 125,000,000
man-power. We Atlantic peoples, a sixth of the earth’s inhabitants,
perform by our manganistic labor more than four times as much as
those can execute. The superiority of the manganist over the naturist
is attained and reimbursed through usefal labor, and thereby also
reaches, taken only humanly, its right. This so much the more as our
labor execution is transmitted to each of them. I speak of the great,
entire development, and not perhaps of its still existing deficiencies, to
the extension and under the extension of culture and civilization.

So, then, has scientific technology become the bearer of culture, the
powerful, tireless laborer in the service of civilization and cultivation
of the races of men, and promises for a long future to add a line of
greater results than is at present attained,

THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.*

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator, Section of Transportation and
Engineering, U.S. National Museum.

The circle is @ figure that has always been found in nature.

Although this simple geometrical figure has been used in inscrip-
tions and for decoration from time immemorial, I have been able to dis-
cover only one very early reference to a pair of compasses, or dividers.

In referring to the graven images, the worship of which was forbid-
den by the Jewish law, the Prophet Isaiah, in chapter 44, verses 12, 13,
old version, describes the manner in which these idols were constructed,
as follows:

‘The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth
it with hammers - - -.” ‘The carpenter stretcheth out his rule;
he marketh it out withaline; he fitteth it with planes and he marketh
it out with a compass and maketh it after the figure of man.”

In the revised version the phrase is translated—

‘The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pen-
cil; he shapeth it with planes and he marketh it out with the com-
passes and sbapeth it after the figure of a man.”

The Hebrew word which is here translated ‘‘ compass” or “com-
passess,” is mehugah, from hug, a circle—mehug something to make a
circle.

There can, therefore, be little doubt that an instrument for drawing
circles and probably similar to what is now known as the ** compasses ”
was used by the Hebrew mechanics. Even if we accept the theory of a
deutero Isaiah, this instrument can certainly claim the respectable an-
tiquity of the sixth century B, ¢.

The circle was associated with the measurement of time and the ob-
servation of the positions of the heavenly bodies many centuries before
the Christian era.

THE SUN-DIAL AND GNOMON.

The sun-dial of Ahaz, is thus alluded to in [saiah, chapter 38, verse 8,

old version, “ Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees,

which is gone down in the sun-dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down.”

Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey.

722 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

By recent Biblical critics* this dial is supposed to have been an obelisk,
whose shadow fell upon the steps of the palace of Ahaz, each step eae
called a degree.

It is by no means improbable however that these degrees were
marked on a plane of stone or metal.

The simple records made by the Chaldean shepherds and herdsmen
of the observations by which they determined the seasons and by which
they were governed in the different operations of husbandry, led the
early cultivators of science to devise instruments (doubtless crude in the
beginning) by which they could obtain data for more accurately ascer-
taining the lengths of the solar and lunar periods.

Astrology and astronomy bore the closest relationship to each other
at that remote period.

“Tn the valley of the Euphrates there were in those days observa-
tories t in most of the large cities, and professional astronomers regu-
larly took observations of the heavens, copies of which were sent to
the king, as each movement or appearance in the heaven was supposed
to portend some evil or good to the kingdom.”

Among the first instruments of which there is record is the gnomon,t
with which the Babylonians were familiar,and from whom Herodotus
states (11, 109) ‘the Greeks learned the use of it, together with the
pole.” The comparison of the perpendicular height of the gnomon, with
the length of its meridian shadow projected on a horizontal plane on
the days of the summer and winter solstices, afforded the early astron-
omer an opportunity to calculate the difference of the sun’s meridian
altitudes on those days.

ANCIENT ASTROLABES.

Ptolemy, in his “ Almagest,” written 145 A. D., describes an astrolabe
or circular instrument for making celestial observations (which he calls
astpokattroy opyavov) Which consisted of a heavy cirele of metal arranged
so that when it was suspended the divisions which we now call 0° and
180° would come to rest in the same horizontal plane.

A diametrical bar suspended in the center of the circle and turning
on a pin was furnished with disks containing slits through which any
heavenly body could be seen and its altitude determined in degrees or
parts thereof.

Other astrolabes were constructed in early times, consisting of two
graduated circles set exactly at right angles.

Sounnece Teanit 38: 8, revised version: ‘‘I will cause fe Alenees on Wine steps,
which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps,
so the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down,”

t George Smith, ‘‘Assyrian Discoveries,” p. 408.

t Vitruvius, who wrote in the first century B. C., gives in Book 1, chap. 6, direc-
tions for using the gnomon to ascertain the north and south line in laying out the
streets of a city, thus indicating that the Romans were not familiar with the magnetic
needle.
THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE. 723
BABYLONIAN SYSTEM OF DIVIDING THE CIRCLE.

In a paper upon “Babylonian Astronomy,” by Sayce and Bosanquet
(Monthly Notices Royal Astronomical Society, 1880, vol. XL, No. 3, ), relat-
ing to the tablets of the millennial period, from 2,000 B. c. to 1,000 B. ¢.,
I find this statement: ‘The divisions which we find employed are 8,
12, 120, 240, 480 parts. It has been assumed that the division of the
circle into 360 parts was made by this ancient people. There is how-
ever no authority in the inscriptions for this assumption. It seems to
have been derived originally from Achilles Tatius, and the pre-con-
ceived idea thus incroduced appears to have caused even those most
conversant with the inscriptions to see the divisions of the circle into
360 in matters which do not involve it.

THE MODERN DIVISION AN OUTGROWTH OF THE SEXAGESIMAL
SYSTEM.

‘“Ttis hardly doubtful that the Givision of the circle as practiced by
Ptolemy and in modern times was an outgrowth of the sexagesimal
system, but the latter does not contain the former. The numeration of
the inscriptions is by two methods, the sexagesimal and the decimal.

‘The decimal method is in all respects comparable with our own and
was used by preference in the Assyrian period.

‘‘Tn it words and signs were used which were precisely equivalent to
our *“ hundreds” and * thousands.”

‘In the sexagesimal method the reckoning was the same as in the
decimal up to 60; 60 was 1soss. The counting went on by multiples of
60 + number over, up to Lner = 600. Then by ners + sosses + nuin-
ber over, up to 1 saru = 3,000.

‘“The numbers used are always taken in this way. There is no in-
stance of counting by 60, 360, 3,600. The foundation of the number
360 was not, therefore, a natural stepin the sexagesimal arithmetic of
the inscriptions.

TABLET FROM THE PALACE OF SENNACHERIB.

‘The division of the circle into 480 parts is illustrated by a tablet
from the palace of Sennacherib (668-626 B. Cc.) in the British Museum,
written in Accadian, which treats of the moon’s position during a
month. The numbers of them or many of them are unintelligible or cor-
rupt. This is partly due to the fact that the tablet is a copy of an ancient
one, probably the date before 2,000 B. c.; but there is amply sufficient
left to show that there was a real division of 480 parts, the moon’s
mean daily motion being 16°, as it should be roughly, throughout the
intelligible portions.”

726 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

The late George Smith proposed to read 150 for 140, and 75 for 70.*
Sayce and Bosanquet assert that “There is no foundation for this, ex-
cept the pre-conceived idea that the circle ought to be divided into 360°.
The numbers are imprinted on the clay with great clearness according
to the sexagesimal notation.” (Monthly Notices, R. A. S., 1880.)

REASONS FOR DIVIDING THE CIRCLE INTO 360 DEGREES.

On the other hand, we have the generally accepted statement that
the Egyptians divided the circle into 360° from the sun’s annual course
or according to the number of days, dividing the year into 12 months,
and each month into 30 days and allotting 1° to each day with an inter-
calary month every 6 years.

The Greeks divided each month into three periods of ten days each.

It will be remembered that the Jewish year contained only 354 days.

It is not definitely known how theastrolabes of Hipparchus (second
century B. Cc.) and Ptolemy (second century A. D.) were divided; prob-
ably these graduated circles contained 360°. It is stated that the par-
allactical instrument used by Copernicus (1473-1543), and by which he
measured altitudes, had its limb divided by equal divisions that were
the subtenses of 3/ 49/’.137 each. If an error of only 4/’.l was made in
measuring this instrument, and if 3/.45’ was the correct reading it
would indicate that each quarter of the circle was divided into 1,440,
or each sixth of the circle into 960 equal parts.

Many writers believe that the number 360 was selected from the fact
that it admits of a great many aliquot parts, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,
and 9.

It has oecurred to me as not an unreasonable conjecture that the
origin of the sexagesimal system may have resulted in some way from
the fact that the circumference of the circle is divided into six equal parts
by chords exactly equal to the radius in length. I do not remember to
have seen this theory advanced by any previous writer.

The earliest records indicate that each day was divided into six parts.

In a recent paper on ‘‘ Chaldean Astronomy,” by Dr. Christopher
Johnson, of Johns Hopkins University (p. 141), he asserts that ‘‘in the
earliest tablets the day is divided (at least for astronomical purposes)
into six watches—three day watches and three night watches.” ‘In
the later tablets, however, we find a division of the day into 12 kaspu
or double hours, each kaspu being divided into 60 degrees or minutes.”

There is mention of an inscription on a tablet in ‘* Western Asiatic
Inscriptions” (published by the British Museum, 11 51, 1), a translation
of which reads: ‘‘The sixth day of Nisan, day and the night were
balanced there were 6 kaspu of day and 6 kaspu of night.”

*<T amof opinion that the numbers under the month of Marchesvan, 140° and 70°
are errors in the Assyrian copy and should be 150° and 75°.” (George Smith’s ‘‘Assy-
rian Discoveries,” p. 407.)
THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE. C24

DECIMAL DIVISION OF THE CIRCLE ADVOCATED IN THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.

Whatever may have been the origin of the division of the circle
into 360° the system has been condemned from time to time by many
eminent mathematicians, among them Stevinus (1548-1620), who, in
his “ Cosmography” (lib. 1, def. 6), states that “the decimal division
of the circle (which he contends for) prevailed in Scculo sapienti.”*

Henry Briggs (1556-1630), Oughtred (1574-1660), and Sir Isaac
Newton (1642-1727) constructed large tables of sines, the plan being to
divide each degree into 100 minutes of 100 seconds each.

Dr. Charles Hutton, in the early part of this century, published
extensive tables giving real lengths of ares of various decimal degrees
in terms of the radius. Some of the French mathematicians divided
the quadrant into 100 degrees and then into decimals of degrees. Wil-
liam Crabtree, Gascoigne,t and Jeremiah Horrocks ¢ (1619-1641) pro-
jected tables with complete decimal divisions, the whole are of the
circle being divided into 1,000,000 parts. (Philosophical Transactions,
vol. XXVII, p. 230.)

DECIMAL SYSTEM FREQUENTLY USED BY THE HEBREWS.

I have taken some pains to find, if possible, some trace of the employ-
ment of a sexagesimal numerical system by the Hebrews in the meas-
urement of straight lines.

In the description of the city and temple seen by Ezekiel in his vision
and described in the fortieth and forty-second chapters, the measuring
reed (qana) § of 6 great cubits, corresponding somewhat with our 10-foot
rod, is mentioned in ten places.

The decimal system however was more frequently used than the sexa-
gesimal in noting the dimensions of the walls and courts described in
these chapters. Thus the number 500 is- found three times, 100 eleven
times, 90 one time, 70 one time, 60 one time, 50 nine times, 30 two times,
25 five times, 20 six times, 10 three times, 5 seven times. It would seem
reasonable to assume that in describing an imaginary structure the

*The decimal method is in all respects comparable with our own and was used by
preference in the Assyrian period. In it words and signs were used which were pre-
cisely equivalent to our ‘‘ hundreds” and ‘‘thousands.” (Sayee and Bosanquet, vol.
40, Monthly Notices, Royal Astronomical Society.)

t Gascoigne is said to have invented a micrometer about 1640.

t Horrocks observed the first transit of Venus that was carefully noticed November
24, 0. Ss. 1639, that predicted by Kepler in 1631 being invisible in Europe.

§ Ezekiel 40: 3, revised version: ‘‘And he brought me thither, and behold there
was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in
his hand, and a measuring reed.”’ Same chapter, verse 5: ‘And behold, a wall on the
outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of 6 cubits
long of acubit and an handbreadth each; so he measured the thickness of the building
one reed; and the height one reed.”
728 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

dimensions given would be according to the method of enumeration in
general use.

In noting measurements of length in other portions of the Scrip-
tures three-score is used three times:

1 Kings, 6:2: “And the house which King Solomon built for the
Lord, the length thereof was three-score cubits, and the breadth thereof
twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.”

Kizra, 6:3: ‘+ Let the house be builded, the place where they offer sac-
rifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
thereof three-score cubits, and the breadth thereof three-score cubits.”

Daniel, 3:1: ‘Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold,
whose height was three-score cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits.”

The numbers 6 and 12 are used elsewhere as follows:

Ezekiel, 41:1, revised version: “And he brought me to the temple,
and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side and six cubits
broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.”

Ezekiel, 43.16, revised version: “And the altar hearth shall be
twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.”

METHODS OF DIVIDING THE CIRLE BY HAND.

The most ancient figure with graduated divisions of a circle dis-
covered in England, was a quadrant, marked with Roman characters,
which was found on a chimney piece at Helmdon, in Northampton-
shire, with the date M°133 (meaning A. D. 1133) marked upon it.

Different methods of dividing a metallic or wooden circle into degrees
and their subdivisons were successfully practiced by the early astrono-
mers, notably by Tycho Brahe* (1546-1601), of Sweden; Johann
Hevelius? (1611-1687), of Dantzic, in Poland; Dr. Robert Hooke (1635-
1705), while curator of experiments of the Royal Society; Ole Roemer
(1644-1710), the Danish astronomer, of whom it is said that he may be
considered “the inventor of nearly all our modern instruments of pre-
cision,” and many of whose ideas were adopted by astronomers a cen-
tury later.

In attempting to engrave and divide correctly the circles used for
mathematical purposes, all of these early laborers in the field of science
were compelled to depend entirely upon manual skill.

The first notable example of the division of cireular ares of which ~
I have found record is the mural are, of 8 feet radius, which George
Graham graduated for the English National Observatory in 1725, The

* An electro replica of Tycho Brahe’s quadrant, from the original in the British
Museum, is deposited in the Smithsonian Institution. Triangular diagonals are not
found in this instrument. Tycho Brahe’s instruments had the advantage of long
radii, which rendered any inequalities that might occur in his divisions of less value
than instruments of short radii; the smallest subdivisions into which he professed to
mark his spaces were 10’ each.

+ The errors of Hevelius’ large sextant for 6’ radius used about 1650, amounted to
15” or 20’.

manner in which it was accomplished is described substantially as
follows (see p. 332, Smith’s Opties, 1738) :

“Two concentric ares of radii 96.85’ and 95.8” respectively were
first described by the beam compass. On the inner of these ares 90° was
to be divided into degrees and twelfth parts of a degree, while the same
on the outer was to be divided into 96 equal parts, and these again into
sixteenth parts. The reason for adopting the latter was that 96 and 16
both being powers of 2, the divisions will be got at by continual bisec-
tion alone, which, in Graham’s opinion, who first employed it, is the
only accurate method, and would thus serve as a check upon the accu.
racy of the divisions of the outer arc. With the same distance on the
beam compass as was used to describe the inner are, laid off from 0°,
the point 60° was at once determined.

‘With the points 0° and 60° as centers successively, and a distance
on the beam compass very nearly bisecting the arc of 60°, two slight
marks were made on the are; the distance between these marks was
carefully divided by the hand, aided by a lens, and this gives the point
30°. The chord of 60° laid off from the point 30° gave the point 909°,
and the quadrant was now divided into three equal parts. Hach of
these parts was similarly bisected, and the resulting divisions again
triseeted, giving 18 parts of 5° each. Each of the quinquesected gave
degrees, the twelfth parts of which were were arrived at by bisecting
and trisecting as before. The outer are was divided by continual
bisection alone, anda table was constructed by which the readings of
the one are could be converted into those of the other. After the dots
indicating the required divisions were obtained, either straight strokes,
all directed towards the center, were drawn through them by the divid-
ing knife, or sometimes: small ares were drawn through them by the
beam compass having its fixed point somewhere on the line which was
a tangent to the quadrantal are at the point where a division was to
be marked.”

In 1767 John Bird, an English mathematical-instrument maker,
graduated a quadrant of 8 feet radius. His method was that of con-
tinual bisection, and is described in a pamphlet published by order of
the commissioners of longitude, 1767, entitled “The Method of Divid-
ing Astronomical Instruments,” by John Bird, mathematical-instrument
maker in the Strand.

The exact radius which he used was 95,835, inches. The radius laid
off from the point 0° gave the point 60°. This are of 60° was care-
fully bisected, giving the point 30°, from which the radius, that had
remained undisturbed on the original beam compasses, was laid off,
giving the point 90°.

The chords of 30°, 15°, 10° 20/ 4° 40’, and 42° 40’ were computed and
carefully laid off, each on a separate pair of beam compasses. Bird
used an exact scale of equal parts, which by the aid of a magnifying
glass he was able to read to one one-thousandth of an inch.
730 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

Having marked the four points 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°, the mode of pro-
cedure was as follows: The chord of 15° laid off backward from 90°
gave 75°. From 75° the chord of 10° 20’ was laid off forward, giving
85° 20’, and from 90° the chord of 4° 40’ laid off backward gave the
same point.

85° 20/= 5,120’ or 1,024 chords of 5’ each, and 1,024=—2” (2 carried to
the tenth power), so that by continual bisections the ares of 5’ were ac-
curately marked.

In order to divide the circle beyond the 85° 20’ into ares of 5’ each,
an are of 40/ (or eight 5’ divisions) was laid off backwards to 84° 40’,
thus leaving an are of 320/ or 64 ares of 5’ each between these two
points. These 5/ ares were laid off by continual bisections. Thus Bird
was able to check accurately the original ares of 15°, 30°, 60°, 75°,
and 90°.

ORIGIN OF THE DIVIDING ENGINE—CUTTING ENGINES FOR CLOCK
WHEELS.

To the clock-maker, more than any other mechanic, we are indebted
for the origin of the dividing engine.

“ While the art of clock-making was in its rude state the dividing of
a wheel into a number of parts and cutting away notches of spaces was
done by manual operation with a file. This was not only a tedious but
a very imperfect way of obtaining a desired result, since the unequal
lines in the size and shape of the tools prevented it from transmitting
applied force in an equable manner.

“To facilitate the manual operation of cutting wheels by a file the
sample platform was invented (described by Father Alexander in his
book on clock-making), which was a circular plate of brass from 10 inches
to a foot or more in diameter, with as many concentric circles thereon
as the usual number of teeth in the wheels and pinions of clockwork
required to be divided into corresponding parts ofacircle. In the center
of this platform was fixed a stem or fast arbor, around which an alidade,
ruler, or index, with a straight edge pointing to the center, turned freely
into any given point of a required circle, by means of which the divisions
of any given circle were transferred to a wheel placed on the side stem
under the side index by a marking point. At length a little frame was
mounted on the index, which was contrived to direct and confine the
file in such a way as to cut the notches of a wheel placed over the in-
dex with less deviation from the truth than could be managed by mere
manual dexterity. This addition, no doubt, led to the adoption of a
circular file, or cutter, and of such other appendages as completed the
construction of the simple cutting machine.” *

It is asserted in “ Htrennes Chronometriques” par M. Julian le Roy,
“that Dr. Hooke was the first person who contrived, about 1675, such
an arrangement as could merit the name of a cutting engine (machine 4

fendre). The doctor’s invention, which, like many of his inventions, has
proved to be of permanent and great utility in mechanics, consists of
an entire transmutation of the old stationary platform, with its mova-
ble appendages, into a movable platform inserted into a strong metallic¢
frame, with stationary and additional appendages; the machine thus
converted into an engine or self-acting piece of mechanism consisted of
a strong frame; the sliding supporting bars of the platform or plate
with a horizontal screw of adjustment for distance from the circular
file; the dividing plate with a revolving arbor to receive the wheel to
be cut; and the alidade fixed to the great frame in the position of a
tangent line to any of the dividing circles and applying its bent and
rounded point to the punched marks of division on the circle succes-
sively as the plate revolving in the act of cutting the successive teeth
of a wheel.”

In the year 1716, Henry Sully brought to England from France a
cutting engine, made by M. de la Faudriere, which has been mentioned
by Julien le Roy and described by Thiout in his “ Traite @ Horlogerie.”

In 1730, M. Taillemard made further improvements in the cutting
engine, particularly by introducing a tubed arbor instead of an arbor
with a square hole, which had been used before.

After Taillemard, his apprentice Hulot continued toconstruct engines
in a superior way in France, and was succeeded by his son, whose exe-
cution was deemed equal to that of his father’s.

EARLY DIVIDING ENGINES.

Smeaton, in a paper entitled “The graduation of astronomical in-
struments,” read before the Royal Society at London, November 17,
1785, mentions an engine made in 1741, by Henry Hindley, of York,
England, which indented the edge of any circle in such a way that
a screw with fifteen threads acting at once would, by means of a
micrometer, read off any given number of divisions, so as to answer
the purpose of subdividing the circle.

It would appear that this engine was better adapted for cutting
toothed wheels for clock-work than for graduating circles with exact-
ness.

The Duc de Chaulnes, in a memoir to the Royal Academy of Science,
at Paris, published 1765, referred to the difficulties in obtaining perfec-
tion of the screw and notches of the rack “so that they be rendered
perfectly equal, notwithstanding the unequal density and hardness of
different portions of the metal so racked.” He ealls his method ‘ the
explication of the new way of dividing.”

It is said that he constructed an engine which he claimed to be his
original invention, but unfortunately the want of “a perfect screw with
intervals exactly proportioned to the effective radius of his quadrant,
was a source of error that posterior contrivances were required to
remedy.”
Ta2 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

Ramsden’s machine for cutting the screws of his dividing engine ac-
curately (which will be referred to below), reduced these errors to a
minimum.

JESSE RAMSDEN’S DIVIDING ENGINES.

Jesse Ramsden was the son of an innkeeper, and was born near Hali-
fax, in Yorkshire, in 1735. While at school in his native county his
fondness for mathematics was observed. Although he served as an
apprentice to a cloth maker in Halifax for some time, yet at the age of
twenty-four he had become skillful in making mathematical and philo-
sophical instruments, and his success was so great that he was soon
able to open an extensive establishment in London.

It is stated that Ramsden first had his attention called to the subject
of dividing engines in 1760, by the reward which was offered by the
English board of longitude to John Bird for his method of dividing.

Ramsden was doubtless acquainted with what Hooke, the Due de
Chaulnes, Hindley, and others had previously done, and before the
spring of 1768 he completed his first engine, having in 1760 constructed
a very superior sextant.

This first engine had an indented plate 30 inches in diameter, and
was used to divide theodolites and other common instruments, and did
so with sufficient accuracy, but it was not satisfactory to Mr. Ramsden,
who, in 177475, constructed the engine, with a plate 45 inches in diame-
ter, which is now in the U.S. National Museum. (See Plate I, from a
recent photograph.)

This dividing engine, together with the cutting gear with which the
screws of this machine was made, were sold by the heirs of Ramsden
to Messrs. Knox and Shain, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from whom
Prof. Henry Morton, president of the Stevens Institute of Technology,
Hoboken, New Jersey, purchased them about 10 years ago. Dr. Mor-
ton has recently deposited these machines in the U. S. National
Museum.

The test of this, Ramsden’s second engine, which divided a sextant.

for Mr. Bird’s examination accurately, was so satisfactory ‘that the
board of longitude, ever ready to remunerate any successful endeavor,
and to promote the lunar method of determining longitude at sea,” con-
ferred a handsome reward on the inventor on condition that the engine
should be at the service of instrument makers, and that Mr. Ramsden
would publish an explanation of his method of making and using it.
This he did in a quarto pamphlet in 1777, the preface to which was pre-
pared by Nevil Maskeline, astronomer royal, dated Greenwich, Novem-
ber 28,1776. In the following extract from it the reasons for publish-
ing the pamphlet are given:

‘Mr. Ramsden, mathematical instrument maker in Piccadilly, was
paid the sum of £615, by certificate from the commissioners of longitude,
upon delivering to them, upon oath, a full and complete written explana-

tion and description of his engine for dividing mathematical instruments
(accompanied with proper drawings) and of the manner of using the
same, and also of the engine by which the endless screw, being a prin-
cipal part of the said dividing engine, was made, and upon agreeing
and entering into articles with them for assigning over the right and
property of the said engine to them for the use of the public, and
engaging himself to give to the said commissioners and such other per-
sons, being mathematical instrument makers, not exceeding ten, as
shall be appointed by them during the space of 2 years, from the 28th of
October, 1775, to the 28th of October, 1777, such instruction and informa-
tion with regard to the making and using of the said engine, as may be
fully sufficient to enable any intelligent workman to construct and use
other engines of the same kind, and also binding himself to divide all
octants and sextants by the said engine which shall be brought to him
by any mathematical instrument makers for that purpose at the rate of
3 shillings for each octant and at the rate of 6 shillings for each brass
sextant, with nonius divisions to half minutes, for so long a time as the
said commissioners shall think proper to permit the said engine to re-
main in his possession. Of which sum of £615 paid to the said Mr.
Ramsden, £300 was given him as a reward for the improvement made
by him in the art of dividing instruments by means of the said dividing
engine and for discovering the same, and the remaing £315 in considera-
tion of his making over the property in the said engine to the commis-
sioners of longitude, for the use of the public, and for the other consid-
erations before mentioned.

-“ Tn order to render this instrument more extensively useful, the com-
missioners of longitude ordered the written explanations, with drawings,
of the dividing engine to be prepared for publication, and it is now pub-
lished accordingly.”

Plate ILis from a lithograph in Ramsden’s publication, and illustrates
the machine as originally constructed.

Mr. Ramsden states in his pamphlet that “ the teeth on the cireum-
ference of the wheel were cut by the following method:

‘*Having considered what number of teeth on the circumference
would be the most convenient, which in this engine is 2,160, or 360 multi-
plied by 6, I made two screws of the same dimensions of tempered steel,
in the manner hereafter described, the interval between the threads being
such as I knew by calculation would come within the limits of what
might be turned off the circumference of the wheel. One of these screws,
which was intended for ratching or cutting the teeth, was notched
across the threads, so that the screw, when pressed against the edge of
the wheel and turned round, cut in the manner of asaw. Then, having
a segment of a circle a little greater than 60 degrees, of about the same
radius with the wheel, and the circumference made true, from a very
fine center, I described an arch near the edge, and set off the chord of
60 degrees on this arch, This segment was put in the place of the
734 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

wheel, the edge of it was ratched, and the number of revolutions and
parts of the screw contained between the interval of the 60 degrees were
counted. The radius was corrected in the proportion of 360 revolu-
tions, which ought to have been in 60 degrees, to the number actually
found, and the radius, so corrected, was taken in a pair of beam com-
passes while the wheel was on the lath, one foot of the compasses was
put in the center and with the other a circle was described on the ring ;
then half the depth of the threads of the screw being taken in dividers
was set from this circle outwards and another circle was described, cut-
ting this point; a hollow was then turned on the edge of the wheel of
the same curvature as that of the screw at the bottom of the threads ;
the bottom of this hollow was turned to the same radius or distance
from the center of the wheel as the outward of the two circles before
mentioned.

“The wheel was now taken off the lathe, the bell-metal piece (D) was
screwed on as before directed, which after this ought not to be removed.

‘‘From a very exact centera circle was described on the ring C, about
four-tenths of an inch within where the bottom of the teeth would
come. This circle was divided with the greatest exactness I was capa-
ble of, first into 5 parts and each of these into 3. These parts were
then bisected 4 times, that is to say, supposing the whole circumfer-
ence of the wheel to contain 2,160 teeth, this being divided into 3 parts,
each of them would contain 144, and this space bisected 4 times would
give 72, 36, 18, and 9; therefore each of the last divisions would con-
tain 9 teeth. But, as I was apprehensive some error might arise from
quinquesection and trisection, in order to examine the accuracy of the
divisions I described another circle on the ring C,one-tenth inch within
the former, and divided it by continual bisections, as 2,160, 1,080, 540,
270, 135, 674, and 333; and, as the fixed wire (to be described presently)
crossed both the circles, | could examine their agreement at every 135
revolutions (after ratching could examine it at every 333); but not
finding any sensible difference between the two sets of divisions, I, for
ratching, made choice of the former; and, as the coincidence of the
fixed wire with an intersection could be more exactly determined than
with a dot or division, I therefore made use of intersections in both
circles before described.

‘‘The arms of the frame were connected by a thin piece of brass of
three-fourths of an inch broad, having a hole in the middle of four-tenths
of an inch in diameter; across this hole a silver wire was fixed exactly
in a line to the center of the wheel; the coincidence of this wire with
the intersections was examined by a lens seven-tenths inch focus, fixed
in a tube which was attached to one of the arms.

‘* Now a handle or winch being fixed on the end of the screw, the
division marked 10 on the circle was set to its index, and, by means
of a clamp and adjusting screw for that purpose, the intersection
was set exactly to coincide with the fixed wire; the screw was then
THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE. _ 735

carefully pressed against the circumference of the wheel by turning
the finger-screw; then, removing the clamp, I turned the screw by its
handle 9 revolutions, till the intersection marked 240 came nearly to
the wire; then, unturning the finger-screw, I released the screw from the
wheel and turned the wheel back till the intersection marked 2 exactly
coincided with the wire, and by means of the clamp before mentioned,
the division 10 on the circle being set to its index, the screw was pressed
against the edge of the wheel by the finger-screw; the clamps were re-
moved, and the screw turned 9 revolutions till the intersection marked 1
nearly coincided with the fixed wire; the screw was pressed, as before, the
wheel was turned back till the intersection 3 coincided with the fixed wire;
the division 10 on the circle being set to its index, the screw was pressed
against the wheel as before, and the screw turaed 9 revolutions till the
intersection 2 nearly coincided with the fixed wire, and the screw was
released; and I proceeded in this manner till the teeth were marked
round the whole circumference of the wheel. This was repeated three
times round, to make the impression of the screw deeper. I then
ratched the wheel round continually in the same direction without
ever disengaging the screw, and in ratching the wheel about 300 times
round the teeth were finished.

‘Now it is evident, if the circumference of the wheel was even one
tooth or ten minutes greater than the screw would require, this error
would in the first instance be reduced to one-two-hundred-and-fortieth
part of a revolution or two seconds and a half; and these errors or in-
equalities of the teeth were equally distributed round the wheel at the
distance of 9 teeth from each other. Now, as the screw in ratching had
continually hold of several teeth at the same time, and these con-
stantly changing, the above-mentioned inequalities soon corrected
themselves and the teeth were reduced to a perfect equality.

‘The piece of brass which carries the wire was now taken away and
the cutting screw was also removed and a plain one (hereafter described)
putin its place. On one end of the screw is asmall brass circle, having
itsedge divided into 60 equal parts and numbered at every sixth division,
as before mentioned. On the other end of the screw is a ratchet-wheel
having 60 teeth, covered by the hollowed circle, which carries two
clicks that catch upon the opposite sides of the ratchet when the screw
is to be moved forward.

‘The cylinder turns on a strong steel arbor, which passes through
and is firmly screwed to the piece Y. This piece, for greater firmness,
is attached to the screw-frame by braces ; a spiral groove or thread is
cut on the outside of thecylinder, which serves both for holding the
string and also giving motion to the lever on its center by means of a
steel tooth that works between the threads of the spiral. To the lever
is attached a strong steel pin on which a brass socket turns. This
socket passes through a slit in the piece, and may be tightened in any
part of the slit by the finger-nut. This piece serves to regulate the
number of revolutions of the screw for each tread of the treadle.
736 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

‘Several different arbors of tempered steel are truly ground into the
socket in the center of the wheel. The upper parts of the arbors that
stand above the plane are turned of various sizes, to suit the centers of
different pieces of work to be divided.

‘¢ When any instrument is to be divided, the center of it is very exactly
fitted on one of these arbors, and the instrument is fixed down to the
plane of the dividing wheel by means of screws, which ‘fit into holes
made in the radii of the wheel for that purpose.

‘‘The instruments being thus fitted on the plane of the wheel, the
frame which carries the dividing point is connected at one end by finger
screws with the frame which carries the endless screw; while the other
end embraces that part of the steel arbor which stands above the instru-
ment to be divided by an angular notch in apiece of hardened steel ;
by this means both ends of the frame are kept perfectly steady and
free from any shake.

‘‘ The frame carrying the dividing point or tracer is made to slide on
the frame which carries the endless screw to any distance from the cen-
ter of the wheel as the radius of the instrument to be divided may re-
quire, and may be there fastened by tightening two clamps, and the
dividing point or tracer being connected with the clamps by the double-
jointed frame admits a free and easy motion towards or from the center
for cutting the divisions without any lateral shake.”

ENGINE BY WHICH THE ENDLESS SCREW OF THE DIVIDING ENGINE
WAS CU.

The machine constructed by Ramsden for cutting the screw, and
used to cut the 2,160 teeth in the circumference of the circle of his
dividing engine, is of the greatest interest, for it is one of the earliest
applications of the principle of changing the lateral speed of the tool
in cutting a screw by differential wheels;—the method now used in the
slide rest of a lathe.

Plate IIL is from a photograph of this machine deposited in the U.S.
National Museum by Dr. Morton.

It has not been found practicable to letter the various parts of this
machine to correspond with those referred to in Ramsden’s description.

it is believed however that the reader will find more interest in
following the original description in the words of the celebrated
mechanician than in reading an explanation of the construction of the
machine couched in modern terms,

Ramsden describes his machine thus:

A represents a triangular bar of .steel, to which the triangular holes
in the piece B and C are accurately fitted, and may be fixed on any
part of the bar by the screws D.

E is a piece of steel whereon the screw is intended to be cut,
which, after being hardened and tempered, has its pivots turned in
the form of two frustrums of cones, as represented in the drawings of
the dividing engine (foot-note Fig. 5). ‘These pivots were very exactly

fitted to the half holes # and 7, which were kept together by the
screws Z.

H represents a screw of untempered steel, having a pivot, 7, which
runs in the hole A. At the other end of the screw is a hollow center,
which receives the hardened conical point of the steel pin 1. When
this point is sufficiently pressed against the screw to prevent its shak-
ing the steel pin may be fixed by tightening the screws Y.

Nisa cylindrie nut. movable on the screw H, which, to prevent any
shake, may be tightened by the screws 0, This nut is connected with
the saddle piece P by means of the intermediate universal joint W,
through which the arbor of the screw H passes. A front view of this
piece, with a section across the screw arbor is represented at XY. This
joint is connected with the nut by means of two steel slips, S, which
turn on pins between the cheeks 7 on the nut NV. ‘The other ends of
these slips, S, turn in like manner on pins (@). One axis of this joint
turns in a hole in the cock (b), which is fixed to the saddle piece, and
the other turns in a hole, (d), made for that purpose in the same piece
on which the cock (bd) is fixed. By this means, when the screw is
turned round, the saddle piece will slide uniformly along the triangu-
lar bar A.

Having measured the circumference of the dividing wheel, I found
it would require a screw about one thread in a hundred coarser than
the guide screw H. The wheels on the guide-screw arbor H, and that
on the steel #, on which the screw was to be cut, were proportioned to
each other to produce that effect by giving the wheel (LZ) 198 teeth and
the wheel (Q) 200. These wheels communicated with each other by
means of the intermediate cogwheel #, which also served to give the
threads on the two screws the same direction.

K is asmall triangular bar of well-tempered steel, which slides in a
groove of the same form on the saddle piece P. The point of this bar
or cutter is formed to the shape of the thread intended to be cut on the
endless screw. When the cutter is set to take proper hold of the
intended screw it may be fixed by tightening ‘the screws (e), which
press the two pieces of brass, G, upon it.

The saddle piece P is confined on the bar A by means of the pieces
(g), aud may be made to slide with a proper degree of rightness by the
SCreWS (2).

RAMSDEN GRADUATES THE GREAT THEODOLITE NOW A'T GREENWICH.

In 1785 Mr. Ramsden was requested “to make an instrument for meas-
uring horizontal angles with more precision than the ordinary theodo-
lite.” It was with this dividing engine that Ramsden graduated this
instrument known as *‘ the great, theodolite,” still preserved at Green-
wich, for the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain, described in Vol.
80, Philosophical Transactions.

One of the first projects of the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain

H. Mis. 129—-—47
138 THE RAMSDEN DIVIDING ENGINE.

was to measure the exact linear distance between the observatory at
yreenwich and the observatory at Paris, which was satisfactorily
accomplished under the direction of General Roy.

Ip January, 1788, Jesse Ramsden, who had twice before undertaken
the task of constructing an astronomical circle, began the one which
he completed August, 1789.

His death occurred in 1800, at which time he was a member of the

THE DIVIDING ENGINES OF TROUGHTON, SIMS AND OTHERS.

Kighteen years after the completion of Ramsden’s engine (1793), Ed-
ward Troughton completed a circular dividing engine, somewhat similar
in detail, with a plate smaller than Ramsden’s. And in 1843, William
Sims, Troughton’s successor, completed his engine, which has for nearly
50 years been in constant use at Charlton, near London.

Sims claimed that the merit of this engine consisted in making the axis
of the plate a hollow tube into which the axis of the circle to be divided
could be slipped, not making it necessary to detach the plate while it
was being graduated, and obviating the necessity of re-setting the cir-
cle on the axle, which is always liable to create error.

Reichenbach, in Germany, and Gambey, in Paris, and Adie, in Edin-
burgh, also constructed dividing engines of merit. Reichenbach’s was
for a long time unsurpassed in accuracy. Gambey’s is now at Hotel
Cluny, Paris.

The German method which admits of great accuracy under skillful
management, is performed by copying from a large circle, originally
divided with extreme precision; over this circle the copy to be made is
fixed concentrically ; the degrees and minutes are cut into the copy by
the aid of the micrometer microscope fixed independently over the
divided circle.

In 1818, Repsold erected a circle at Géttengen and in 1819 Reichen-
bach erected one at Koénigsberg. Pistor and Martins of Berlin, con-
structed cireles for Copenhagen, Albany, Leyden, Leipsic, Berlin, Wash-
ington Naval Observatory, and Dublin. Since the death of Martins,
Repsold constructed circles for Strasburg, Bonn, Williamstown, Mas-
sachusetts, and Madison, Wisconsin; Troughton and Sims doing the
work for Greenwich, Harvard, and Cambridge. zs

The Altazimuth, 8 feet in diameter, now (1890) at Palermo Observa-
tory, was divided by hand by Ramsden

In 1806, Troughton constructed the first modern circle for the observa-
tory at Blackheath.

In the Philosophical Transactions, for 1809, in a paper by Trough-
ton on dividing instruments, p. 140, he states:

I am informed by recent travellers in China and Japan that the eircles
for astronomical and other instruments are still divided by hand, un-
aided by machinery.

The dividing engine at the Coast Survey, Washington, made by
Troughton, was made automatie by Joseph Saxton about 1855; it was
re-constructed about 10 years ago by Fauth & Co., of Washington,
who have at their establishment a dividing engine for which they claim
great accuracy.

Thus have the mechanicians for a century kept pace with the ce-
mands for accurate instruments.

A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.*

By H. A. NEWTON.

The President and Fellows of Yale College have requested that in
this public place and manner, I should give an account of the life,
scientific activity, and publie services of our late colleague, Prof.
Elias Loomis. It is a pleasure to perform the duty thus laid upon me.
The hours of intercourse I have had with him, and his generous conti-
dences, are precious treasures of my life. And I hope you will find it
worth your while to have turned away from other thoughts for a single
hour, to listen to the account of what, during near three score years of
mature life, our colleague was doing for science, and through science
for man.

Elias Loomis was born in the little hamlet of Willington, Connecti-
eut, August 7, 1811. His father, the Rev. Hubbell Loomis, was pastor
in that country parish from 1804 to 1828. He was a man possessed of
considerable scholarship, of positive convictions, and of a willingness
to follow at all hazards wherever truth and duty, as he conceived them,
might lead. He had studied at Union College, in the class of 1799,
though apparently he did not finish the college course with his class.
He is enrolled with that class in Union College, and he also received,
in 1812, the honorary degree of Master of Arts from Yale College. At
a later date he went to Illinois, and there was instrumental in founding
the institution which afterwards became Shurtleff College.

Although the boy inherited from his father a mathematical taste, yet
his love for the languages also was shown at a very early age. At an
age at which many bright boys are still struggling with the reading of
English, he is reported to have been reading with ease the New Testa-
ment in the original Greek. He prepared for college almost entirely
under the instruction of his father. He was, for a single winter only,
at the Academy at Monson, Massachusetts. Owing in part to feeble
health he was more disposed, in those early years, to keep to his books
than to roam with other boys over the Willington hills. In later life

necticut), April 11, 1590. (From the American Journal of Science, June, 1890, vol.

T42 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS,

he frequently said that in his early days he never had a thought of
asking what subjects he was most fond of, but studied what he was told
to study.

At the age of 14 he was examined and was admitted to Yale College,
but owing to feeble health he waited another year before actually en-
tering a class. In college he appears to have been about equaliy pro-
ficient in all of the studies, taking a good rank as a scholar, and main-
taining it through his college course. President Porter remembers well
the retiring demeanor of the young student, and his concise and often
monosyllabic expressions, peculiarities which he retained through life.
During his junior and senior years he roomed with Alfred I. Perkins,
whose bequest was the first large endowment of the college library.
He graduated in 1830.

A few weeks before graduation he left New Haven and entered a
school, Mount Hope Institute, near Baltimore, to teach mathematics,
and he remained there fora yearandaterm. Oneof his classmates, the
late Mr. Cone of Hartford, said that Mr. Lcomis had intended to spend
his lifein teaching, and that it surprised him when he heard that his
purpose was abandoned, and that Mr. Loomis had gone, in the autumn
of 1831, to the Andover theological seminary with the distinct expecta-
tion of becoming a preacher. This new purpose was however again
changed, when a year later, he was appointed tutor in Yale College. A
vacancy in the tutorship in the May following (1833), and while not yet
22 years of age he returned to New Haven and entered upon the duties
of the office. Here he remained for 3 years and ove term. In the
spring of 1836 he received the appointment to the chair of mathematics
and natural philosophy in Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio.
He was allowed to spend the first year in Europe. He was therefore
during the larger part of the year 183637 in Paris attending the lec-
tures of Biot, Poisson, Arago, Dulong, Pouillet, and others. He did
not visit Germany because of want of money. A long series of letters
written by him at this time appeared in the Ohio Observer, and the con-
trast between England and France as he saw them, and the same
places as seen by the tourist to day is decidedly interesting.

He-purchased in London and Paris apparatus for his professorship
and the outfit for a small observatory, and in the autumn of 1837 began
his labors at Hudson. Here he remained for 7 years, maintaining with
unflagging perseverance both his work in teaching and his scientific
labors. In judging of this work at Hudson we must remember that he
was not with perfect surroundings. He was without an assistant and
without the counseland encouragement of associates in his own branches
of science. The financial troubles which culminated in this country in
1837 were peculiarly severe upon the young and struggling college.
Money was almost unknown in business circles in Ohio, trade being
almost entirelyin barter. In this way principally was paid so much of
the promised salary of $600 per annum as was not in arrears. In one
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 743

of his letters he congratulates himself that all of his bills that were
more than 2 years old had been paid. In another he says that there
was not enozgh money in the college treasury to take him out of the
state. When heleft Hudson the college cftered to pay at once the arrears
of his salary by deeding to him some of its unimproved lands.

In 1844 he was offered, and he accepted, the office of professor of
mathematics and natural philosophy in the university of New York.
In this new position he undertook the preparation of a series of text
books in the mathematics, and for some years a large part of the time
which he could spare from his regular college work was given to the
preparation of these books.

When Professor Henry resigned his professorship at Princeton in
order to accept the office of Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
Professor Loomis was offered the vacant chair. He went to Princeton
and remained there during 1 year, at the end of which he was induced
to return again to his old place in the university of New York. Here
he, continued until 1860, when he was elected to the professorship in
Yale College made vacant by the death of Professor Olmsted. For the
last 29 years of his life he here Jabored for the college and for science,
passing away on the 15th of August, 1889.

Let us look now in succession at the different lines of his activity dur-
ing these 56 years,—4 here in the tutorship and in Europe, 7 at Hud-
son, Olio, 16 in New York City and Piinceton, and 29 in New Haven.

For the first year on returning from Andover to New Haven he was
tutor in Latin, although it seems that he might, had he chosen it, have
been tutor of mathematics. I believe that at the beginning his mind
was not yet definitely turned toward the exact sciences. In his child-
hood he had taken specially to Greek. In college he was equally pro-
ficient in all of hisstudies. Heis represented to have led his ciass at
Andover in Hebrew, and now on entering the tutorship he chose to
teach the Latin language and literature. During the second year he
taught mathematics and the third year natural philosophy. His later
success in scientific work was, I believe, in no small measure due to his
earlier broad and thorough study of language.

I have made some inquiry in order to learn what it was that turned
his attention and tastes toward science. One of his colleagues in the
tutorship, the Rev. Dr. Davenport, says that he reecollects very dis-
tinctly the first indication to his own mind that Tutor Loomis was turn-
ing his thoughts in this direction. The great meteoric shower of 1833
came early in the period of his tutorship, and the views of Professor
Twining and Professor Olmsted about the astronomical character and:
origin of these interesting and mysterious bodies were a common topic
of conversation among scientific men in the college, especially when-
ever Professor Olmsted was present. The tutors were accustomed to
meet as a club from time to time in the tutors’ rooms in turn,and Dr.
Davenport well recollects the occasion when Tutor Loomis brought in
744 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

a globe and discussed before the club the new theories about these
bodies. Up to this time Tutor Loomis had seemed to him to have given
his thoughts and study to language rather than to science.

In January, 1834, there were constituted in the Connecticut Academy
of Arts and Sciences twelve committees representing the several de-
partments of knowledge, and Tutor Loomis was put on the committee
on mathematics and natural philosophy. These are the only signs of
scientific taste or activity which I have detected earlier than the
autumn of 1834, after he had been a year and a term in the tutorship.
From this time on to the end of his life he gave his time and energies
to several subjects that are enough distinct one from the other to make
it convenient to disregard a strictly chronological account of his labors
and consider his work in each subject by itself.

A subject of which he early undertcok the investigation was terres-
trial magnetism. We often use the rhetorical phrase “True as the
needle to the pole,” but looked at carefully, the magnetic needle is any-
thing but constant in direction. Like the weather vane on the steeple
it is ever in motion, swinging back and forth, in motions minute and
slow it is true, but still always swinging. it has fitfully irregular mo-
tions; it has motions with a daily period; motions with an annual
period ; and motions whose oscillations require centuries for comple-
tion.

The daily motions of the magnetic needle were those which Tutor
Loomis first studied. At the beginning of the second year of his tutor-
ship he set up by the north window of his room in North College a
heavy wooden block, and on it the variation compass that belongs to
the college. Here for over thirteen months he observed the position
of the needle at hourly intervals in the daytime, his observations
usually being for seventeen successive hours of each day.

The results of these observations, together with a special discussion
of the extraordinary cases of disturbance, were published in the Amer-
ican Journal of Science in 1836. No similar observations of the kind
made in this country had at that time been published. So far as Lam
aware, none made before 1834 have since been published, except ten
days’ observations made by Professor Bache in 1832. In fact I know
of only one or two like series of hourly observations made in Kurope
earlier than these by Tutor Loomis. He also at this time formed the
purpose of collecting all the observations of magnetic declination that
had been hitherto made in the United States and of constructing from
them a magnetic chart of the country. He appealed successfully to the
Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences for its sympathy and aid.
The work of collecting facts was so far advanced before leaving New
Haven that when he had been a few months professor at Hudson he
forwarded to the American Journal of Science a discussion of the ob-
servations thus far obtained, and with them a map of the United States,
with the lines of equal deviation of the needle drawn upon it. Two

A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 745

years later he published additional observations and a revised edition
of this map.

These were the first published magnetic charts of the United States.
and though the materials for their construction were not numerous, and
in many cases those obtainable were not entirely trustworthy, yet 16
years later, when @ map was made by the United States Coast Survey
from later and more numerous data, Professor Bache declared that be-
tween his own new map and that of Professor Looniis, when proper
allowance had been made for the secuiar changes, the “ agreement was
remarkable.”

The northern end of a perfectly balanced magnetic needle turns down-
ward, and the angle it makes with the horizon is called the magnetic
dip. This angle is an important one, and is observed with accuracy
only by using an expensive instrument, and taking unusual pains in
observing. Hence only a few observations of this element were found
by Professor Loomis. From these however he ventured to put on his
first magnetic map a few lines that exhibited the amount of the dip.

While he was in Europe he purchased a first-class dipping needle for
Western Reserve College, and at Hudson and the neighborhoed in term
time, and at other places in vacation, he made observations with tbis
needle. Some of these observations were made before his second mag-
netic chart was published, and upon this map were now given tolerably
good positions of the lines of equal magnetie dip. But he continued
his observations for several years, determining the dip at over seventy
stations, spread over thirteen States, each determination being the mean
of from 160 to over 4,000 readings. ‘These observations were published
in several successive papers in the transactions of the American Phil-
osophical Society at Philadelphia.

Various papers on terrestrial magnetism, in continuation of his earlier
investigations, appeared in 1842, in 1844, in 1847, and in 1859, but
movements in Germany, England, and Russia had meanwhile been
inaugurated, which led to the establishment by governments of a score
of well-equipped magnetic observatories, and this subject passed largely
out of private hands.

Closely connected with terrestrial magnetism, and to be considered
with it, is the aurora borealis. In the week that covered the end of
August and the beginning of September, 1859, there occurred an exceed-
ingly brilliant display of the northern lights. Believing that an exhaust-
ive discussion of a single aurora promised to do more for the promo-
tion of science than an imperfect study of an indefinite number of them,
Professor Loomis undertook at once to collect and to collate accounts
of this display. A large number of such accounts were secured from
North America, from Europe, from Asia, and from places in the South-
ern Hemisphere ; especially all the reports from the Smithsonian observ-
ers and correspondents were placed in his hands by the secretary,
Professor Henry.
746 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

These observations and the discussions of them were given to the
public during the following 2 years in a series of nine papers in the
American Journal of Science.

Few (if any) displays on record were so remarkable as was this one
for brilliancy and for geographical extent. Certainly about no aurora
have there been collected so many facts. The display continued for a
week. The luminous region entirely encircled the north pole of the
earth. It extended on this continent on the 2d of September as far
south as Cuba and to an unknown distance to the north. In altitude
the bases of the columns of light were about 50 miles above the earth’s
surface, and the streamers shot up at times to a height of 500 miles.
Thus over a broad belt on both continents this large region above the
lower atmosphere was filled with masses of luminous material. A dis-
play similar to this, and possibly of equal brilliancy, was at the same
time witnessed in the Southern Hemisphere.

The nine papers were mainly devoted to the statements of observers.
Professor Loomis however went on to collect facts about other -
auroras, and to make inductions from the whole of the material thus
brought together. He showed that there was good reason for believing
that not only was this display represented by a corresponding one in
the Southern Hemisphere, but that all remarkable displays in either
hemisphere are accompanied by corresponding ones in the other.

He showed also that all the principal phenomena of electricity were
developed during the auroral display of 1859; that light was developed
in passing from one conductor to another, that heat in poor conductors,
that the peculiar electric shock to the animal system, the excitement of
magnetism in irons, the deflection of the magnetic needle, the decom-
position of chemical solutions, each and all were produced during the
auroral storm, and evidently by its agency. There were also in Amer-
ica effects upon the telegraph that were entirely consistent with the
assumption previously made by Walker for England, that currents of
electricity moved from northeast to southwest across the country,
From the observations of the motion of auroral beams, he showed that
they also moved from north northeast to sonth-southeast, there being
thus a general correspondence in motion between the electrical currents
and the motion of the beams.

When there is a special magnetic disturbance at any place, there is
usually a similar one at all other neighboring places. But these dis-
turbances do not occur at the several places at the same instant of time.
Professor Loomis showed that in the United States they take place in
succession as we go from northeast to southeast, the velocity of the
wave of disturbance being over 100 miles per minute. The waves of
magnetic irregularities were thus connected with the electrical current
and with the drifting motions of the streamers in the auroral display.

As incident to this discussion, he collected all available observations
of auroras, and he deduced from them the annual number of auroras
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. TAT

visible at each place of observation. These numbers, when written
upon a chart of the Northern Hemisphere, showed that auroras were
by no means equally distributed over the earth’s surface. It was found
that the region in which they occurred most frequently was a belt or
zone of moderate breadth and of oval form, inclosing the North Pole of
the earth, and also the North Magnetic Pole. It was therefore much
farther south in the Western Hemisphere than in the Eastern. Along
the central line of this belt there are more than eighty auroras annually,
but on going either north or south from the central line of that belt
the number diminishes.

In 1870, Professor Loomis published a paper of importance relating to
terrestrial magnetism, in which he showed its connection and that of
the aurora with spots on the sun. That the spots on the sun had peri-
ods of maximum and minimum development had long been known.
Lamont had noticed a periodicity in the magnetic diurnal variations.
Sabine and Wolf and Gauthier had noticed that the two periodicities
were allied. The connection of the period of solar spots with conjunc-
tion and opposition of certain planets had been shown by De La Rue
and Stewart. Professor Loomis undertook an exhaustive examination
of the facts that tended to confirm or refute the propositions that had
been advanced. He confirmed and added to the conclusions of Messrs.
De La Rue and Stewart. He also brought together such facts as were
relevant to the question, and he showed that the regular diurnal vari-
ation of the magnetic needle was entirely independent of the solar
spots, but that those disturbances that were excessive in amount were
almost exactly proportional to the spotted surface of the sun. He also
showed that great disturbances of the earth’s magnetism are accom-
panied by unusual disturbances on the sun’s surface on the very day of
the storm.

Various forms of periodicity in the aurora have frequently been sug-
gested. Professor Loomis, from all available accounts of the aurora,
was able to show that while in the center of the zone of greatest auro-
ral frequency auroras might be visible nearly every night, and hence
that periodicity could not easily be shown by means of numbers of
auroras recorded in such places, yet that such periodicity was distinetly
traceable at places where the average number seen was about twenty
or twenty-five a year. The times of maxima and minima of the solar
spots were seen to correspond in a remarkable manner with the max-
ima and minima in the frequency of auroral displays in these middle
latitudes. Also from the daily observations made by Messrs. Herrick
and Bradley at New Haven during 17 years, he concluded that auroral
displays in the middle latitudes of America are generally accompanied
by an unusual disturbance of the sun’s surface on the very day of the
aurora. The magnetism of the earth, the aurora borealis, and the
spots on the sun, have thus all three a casual connection, and appar-
ently that connection is closely related to the conjunctions and opposi-
tions of certain planets.
T48 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

Shortly after the publication of this memoir, Professor Lovering pub-
lished his extensive catalogue of auroras. A further discussion of the
periodicity of the auroras was undertaken by Professor Loomis and
published in 1873. In this he made use of all the auroras recorded in
Professor Lovering’s catalogue. They confirmed his previous conclu-
sions, only slight modifications being required by the new facts pre-
sented, and by their more systematic collation.

In these papers, as in most of his papers upon other subjects, Profes-
sor Loomis was ever intent upon answering the questions: What are
the laws of nature? What do the phenomena teach us? To establish
laws which had been already formulated by others, but which still
needed confirmation, was to him equally important with the formulation
and proof of laws entirely new.

Let us now turn to another important line of Professor Loomis’s
work—astronomy. As I have said, he was early interested in the
shooting stars. In October, 1831, he read a paper before the Connect-
icut Academy of Arts and Sciences upon this subject, prooably in sub-
stance that which was shortly afterward published in the American
Journal of Science. The published paper is principally a re-statement
of the observations made in Germany in 1823, by Brandes in concert
with his pupils for determining the paths of the stars through the atmos-
phere, together with methods of computation. From the results of
Brandes’s observations, however, he deduces an argument for the cos-
mie character of the shooting stars. One month after reading this
paper to the Connecticut Academy he engaged in similar concerted
observations with Professor Twining, who was then residing near West
Point, New York. These were only moderately successful, but they
were the first observations of the kind undertaken in America.

During the senior year of his college course there arrived at New
Haven the 5-inch telescope, given to the college by Mr. Sheldon Clark,
constructed by Dolland. This instrument was much larger than any
telescope then in the country. It was temporarily placed in the Athe-
neum tower, where it was mounted on castors and wheeled to the win-
dows for use. This temporary abode it occupied however for over 30
years. In spite of its miserable location it was, in the decade follow-
ing its installment, a power in the development of the study of astron-
omy in the college. The lives and works of Barnard, and Loomis, and
Mason, and Herrick, and Lyman, and Chauvenet, and Hubbard, and of
other graduates of the college prove this. What rich returns for Mr.
Sheldon Clark’s $1,200 investment !

In 1835, the return of Halley’s comet had been predicted, and its ap-
pearance was eagerly expected by astronomers and the public; Pro-
fessor Olmsted and Tutor Loomis first in this country caught sight of
the stranger, and throughout its course they noted its physical appear-
ances. With such means as he had at command, Mr. Loomis observed
the body’s place, and computed from his observations the orbit.
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 749

The latitude and longitude of an observatory are constants to be early
determined. These were measured by President Day for Yale College
in18l1. In the summer of 1835, Tutor Loomis, with such instruments
as the college possessed, a sextant and a small portable transit, made
numerous observations of Polaris for latitude, and several moon culmi-
nations for longitude. From these he computed the latitude and longi-
tude of the Atheneum tower. The longitude from Greenwich, though
obtained from a small number of observations, differs less than 2
seconds of time from our best determinations to-day.

While in Europe in 183637, Professor Loomis, as I have said, bought
for Western Reserve College the instruments for an observatory. These
were a 4-inch equatorial, a transit instrument, and an astronomical
clock. On his return he erected, in 1837, asmall observatory at Hudson,
and in September, 1838, began to use the instruments. He had no
assistant, and by day had a full allotment of college work. Two hun-
dred and sixty moon culminations and sixteen occultations observed
for longitude, sixty-nine culminations of Polaris for latitude, along with
observations on five comets sufficiently extended for a computation of
their orbits; these attested his activity outside of his required duties.
Some years later, when the corresponding European observations were
made public, he prepared an elaborate discussion of these longitude ob-
servations, and published in it Goulds Astronomical Journal. A sixth
comet was observed by him at Hudson in 1850.

It may not seem a very large output of work in six years’ time to have
determined the location of the observatory, and to have observed five
comets. But we must recollect that the telegraph had not then been in-
vented, that the exact determination of the longitude of a single point
in the western country had a higher value then than it can have now,
and that it could be obtained only by slow and tedious methods. These
were moreover days of small things in astronomy in this country. At
Yale College we had a telescope but not an observatory. At Williams.
town an observatory had been constructed, but it was used for instrue-
tion, not for original work. At Washington Lieutenant Gilliss, and at
Dorchester Mr. Bond, were commissioned by the Government in 1838 to
observe moon culminations in correspondence with the observers in the
Wilkes exploring expedition for determining their longitude. These
two prospective sets of observations, both of them under Government
auspices and pay, were the only signs of systematic astronomical
activity in the United States outside of Hudson, when in 1838 Professor
Loomis began his observing there. In his inaugural address he asks:
‘* Where now is our American observatory? Where throughout this
rich and powerful nation do you find @ single spot where astronomical
observations are regularly and systematically made? There is no such
spot.” When he left Hudson in 1844, the situation was not largely
changed. Mr. Bond had removed his instruments and work to Cam-
bridge. The High School Observatory at Philadelphia had been erected
750 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

and Messrs. Walker and Kendall were using its instruments. Profes-
sor Bartlett had built the observatory at West Point, and had begun
to observe there. Lieutenant Gilliss after years of excellent work in
the little establishment on Capitol Hill had just finished the present
Naval Observatory building at Washington, Professor Mitchell had
begun to build the Cincinnati Observatory, and the Georgetown obser-
vatory building had been erected. Professor Loomis’s work at Hudson
should be measured by what others were doing at the time, rather than
by the larger performance of to-day.

In the summer of 1844, the year in which Professor Loomis came to
New York, a new method in astronomy had its first beginnings. The
telegraph line had just been built between Baltimore and Washington,
and Captain Wilkes at Baltimore compared his chronometer by tele-
graph with one at Washington, and so determined the difference of
longitude of the two places.

Professor Bach was now Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and he
determined at once to use the new method for the purposes of the sur-
vey. To Mr. Sears C. Walker was committed the direction of the work,
but scarcely less important were the services of Professor Loomis, who
for three campaigns had charge of the end of the lines in Jersey City
and New York. Their first partially successful efforts were made in
1846, but the practical difficulties were overcome and entire success
was obtained by them in 1847 and 1848. In these years the differ-
ences of longitude of Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and
Cambridge were thus determined with an accuracy far greater than
any previous similar determination whatsoever.

The next summer, that of 1849, Professor Loomis assisted in a like
work to connect Hudson, Ohio, with the eastern stations. His obser-
vations of moon culminations at Hudson were thus available equally
with those made at Philadelphia, Washington, Dorchester, and Cam-
bridge for determining the absolute longitudes of Atlantic stations
from Greenwich. It was not until 1852, that Europeon astronomers
began to use these telegraphic methods in measuring longitudes.

In 1850, Professor Loomis published a volume on the ‘Recent prog-
ress of astronomy, especially in the United States.” A first and a
second edition was soon exhausted, and in 1856, the volume was entirely
re-written and very much enlarged. Some of the topics in these volumes
were the subjects of articles communicated from time to time to the
public in the American Journal of Science, Harper's Magazine and other
periodicals. Another important contribution to astronomy appeared
in 1865, that is, his “ Introduction to practical astronomy.” Eminent
astronomers in England and America have expressed in the highest
terms their praise of this book. Though it is now 35 years since its
first appearance, and many treatises on the same subject, some elab-
orate and some elementary, have since been published, yet for an in-
troduction to practical work I believe that a student will find this vol-
ume better than any other for his uses at the beginning of his course.

A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 151

The increase of our knowledge in astronomy was, from first to last,
an object of special interest to Professor Loomis. Before he left New
York, the income from his text books enabled him to make to Yale Col-
lege the generous offer of coming to New Haven and working in an
observatory at his own charges, provided a suitable observatory should
be constructed and equipped for him. Unfortunately, the college was
not able, although it was greatly desirous of doing it, to avail itself of
his generous offer. Near the same time he joined with public spirited
citizens of New York in an effort to establish an astronomical observa-
tory in or near that city, and for that purpose an act of incorporation
was obtained from the New York State legislature. After coming to
New Haven, he always took the warmest interest in the plans of Mr.
Winchester for the establishment of an observatory in connection with

‘Yale University. His counsel and assistance have been instrumental,

more than the public could know, in producing and preserving what-
ever of value has been developed in that observatory.

The science of meteorology has however been that in which Professor
Loomis has made the most important contributions to human knowl-
edge.

Shortly after his graduation in 1830, and before he entered upon the
tutorship, there appeared the first of a long series of papers by Mr.
Redfield, of New York City, upon the theory of storms. In the last
year of his tutorship there appeared also the first of a like remarkable
series of papers on the same subject by Professor Espy, of Philadel-
phia. Two rival theories were advocated by these two men, and these
theories became the subject of no little discussion in scientific meetings,
and in scientific journals, for along period of years. Professor Loomis
had, from their very inception, taken a warm interest in these discus-
sions, and the subject of meteorology, and in particular its centra
problem the theory of storms, held in his thought and work the first
place from that time to the day of his death.

In his visit to Hurope (the year before he went to Hudson), he pur-
chased a set of meteorological instruments, and for several years in
Hudson he steadily performed the naturally irksome task of making
twice each day a complete set of meteorological observations. A few
weeks after he entered upon his professorship in Hudson a tornado
passed 5 miles from that place, and he went out immediately to exam-
ine the track and learn what facts he could that should bear upon the
theory of the tornado. The results were valuable, but he was not alto-
gether satisfied with them. ‘They led him however to undertake the
discussiou of one of the large storms that covered the whole United
States.

For this purpose he selected the storm which had occurred near the
20th of December, 1836. Sir John Herschel had recommended that
hourly observations be taken by all meteorological observers on four
term days in the year, that is, observations for thirty-six successive
752 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

hours at each equinox and each solstice. This storm fell partly upon
one of these term days. Professor Loomis set to work to collect all the
meteorological observations made during the week of the storm that he
could obtain from all parts of the United States, and from some stations
in Canada. The discussion resulting therefrom was read in March,
1840, before the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia.

Let us for a little while consider the amount of knowledge of the facts
about storms in our possession in 1840, the date when this memoir was
read and an abstract of it published in Philadelphia. Franklin had
noted the motion of storms from southwest to northeast. He said :*
‘¢ Our northeast storms in North America begin first in point of time in
the southwest parts, that is to say, the air in Georgia, the farthest of
our colonies to the southwest, begins to move southwesterly before the
air of Carolina, which is the next colony northeastward; the air of
Carolina bas the same motion before the air of Virginia, which lies still
more northeastward; and so on northeasterly through Pennsylvania,
New York, New England, ete., quite to Newfoundland.” Redfield had
traced several storms along the West India Islands northwesterly un-
til about in the latitude of 30° their course was turned quite abruptly
and they swept off northeasterly along the Atlantic coast toward and
even past Newfoundland. Espy found some storms moving easterly or
south of east from the Mississippi to the Atlantic.

Brandes had announced as a law that the wind in storms blows
inward toward a center, but his Jaw was an induction from a small
number of observations. Dove had contended for a whirling motion.
Redfield advanced facts to show that the winds blew in circles anti-
clockwise around a center that advanced in the direction of the preva-
lent winds, and with him agreed Reid, Piddington, and others. Hspy,
agreeing with Brandes, claimed that the observations in the various
storms showed a centripetal motion of the winds toward a ce iter if the
region covered by the storm was round, and toward a central line if
the storm region was longer in one direction than in another. Espy’s
conclusions were intimately conneeted with his theory that in the center
of the storm there was an upward motion of the air, and that the con-
densation of vapor into rain furnished the energy needed for the con-
tinuation of the storm. The rival theories of Redfield and Espy were in
sharp contest on several points, but the main contention was around
this central question: Do the winds blow in circular whirls or do they
blow in toward a center? New York State was collecting observations
from the academies. The American Philosophical Society and the
Franklin Institute, aided by an appropriation from the State of Penn-
sylvania, had united in an effort to learn the facts and the true theory
of storms.

Under such circumstances the thorough discussion of a single violent
storm was likely to add materially to our knowledge. The treatment

“*Letter to Alexander Small, May 12, 1760.
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 153

of this storm by Professor Loomis was probably more complete than
that of any previous one, and the methods which he employed were
better fitted to elicit the truth than any earlier methods. But the storm
was a very large one, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to an unknown
distance north, and having its center apparently to the north of all the
observers. The results which he was able to secure did not sustain
either of the two rival theories, but rather tended to prove some fea-
tures in each of them. Professor Loomis was not himself satisfied
with them, and he therefore waited for another storm that should be
better fitted for examination.

In the month of February, 1242, a second tornado passed over north-
eastern Ohio, and Professor Loomis with one of his colleagues again
started out for the examination of the track. The tornado passed over
a piece of woods, and hence the positions of the prostrate trees showed
clearly the motion of the wiud in the passing tornado and threw much
light upon the character of this kind of storm. But the tornado was a
single feature of a large storm that covered the whole country, and a
second storm of great intensity was also experienced in the same
month.

The discussion of these two storms was now undertaken by him, The
paper giving the results of that discussion was sent to Professor Bache
and read by him at the centennial meeting of the American Philosoph-
ical Society in May, 1843, and created, as Professor Bache wrote, a great
sensation. It was at the time important for the hght which it threw
upon the rival contending theories of Espy and of Redfield, but it was
more important by far by reason of the new method of investigation
then for the first time employed.

In the paper upon the storm of 1836, Professor Loomis had made some
advance upon previous methods of representing the facts about storms.
But even the method he then used was entirely unfitted to give an-
swers to the questions which meteorologists were asking. Some of
those questions were stated in circulars issued by the joint committee
of the American Philosophical Society and the Franklin Institute:
What are the phases of the great storms of rain and snow that traverse
our continent; what their shape and size; in what direction and with
what velocity do their centers move along the surface of the earth; are
they round or oblong or irregular in shape; do they move in different
directions in different seasons of the year ?

The graphic representation by Professor Loomis on the map of the
United States of the storm of 1836, had been a series of lines drawn
joining the places where at a given hour the barometer was at its low-
est point. That line would, so far as the barometer was concerned,
mark for that hour the central line of the storm. ‘The progress of the
line from hour to hour on the map showed, quite imperfectly, how the
storm had traveled. Some arrows added showed to the eye also cer-
tain facts about the movements of the air.

H. Mis. 129-——48
754 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

Professor Espy adopted—and thereafter adhered to—a modification of
this method of representing storm phenomena, and I think meteorolo-
gists will agree with me in my opinion that Professor Espy’s four reports
from 1842 to 1854, though they contained an immense accumulation of
facts, were because of this radical defect of presentation almost useless
to meteorological science.

In the discussion of the storms of 1842, instead of the line of minimum
depression of the barometer, Professor Loomis drew on the map a series
of lines of equal barometric pressure, or rather of equal deviations
from the normal average pressure for each place. A series of maps rep-
resenting the storm at successive intervals of twelve hours were thus
constructed, upon each of which was drawn a line through all places
where the barometer stood at its normal or average height. A second
line was drawn through all places where the barometer stood 0.2 of
an inch below the normal, and other lines through points where the
barometer was 0.4 below, 0.6 below, 0.8 below, etc.; also lines were
drawn through those points where the barometer stood 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, ete.,
above its normal height. The deviations of the barometric pressure
from the normal were thus made prominent, and all other phenomena of
the storm weve regarded as related to those barometric lines. A series
of colors represented respectively the places where the sky was clear,
where the sky was overcast, and where rain or snow was falling. A
series of lines represented the places at which the temperature was at
the normal, or was 10 or 20 or 30 degrees above the normal, or below
the normal. Arrows of proper direction and length represented the
direction and the intensity of the winds at the different stations. These
successive maps for the three or four days of the storm furnisbed to the
eye all its phenomena in a simple and most effective manner.

You have no doubt, most of you, already recognized in this desecrip-
tion the charts, which to-day are so common, issued by the United States
Signal Service, and by weather-service bureaus in other countries.
The method seems so natural, that it should occur to any person who
has the subject of a storm under consideration. But the greatest in-
ventions are oft-times the simplest, and I am inclined to believe that the
introduction of this single method of representing and discussing the
phenomena of a storm was the greatest of the services which our col-
league rendered to science. ‘This method is at the foundation of what
jS Sometimes called *‘the new meteorology,” and the paper which con-
tains its first preseutation stands forth, I am convineed, as the most
important paper in the history of that science. I regret that I can not
aid my memory by quoting the exact words, but I remember distinctly
what seemed to me an almost despairing expression made many years
ago by one who had high responsibility in the matter of meteorological
work, as he looked out upon the confused mass of observations already
made, and felt unable to say in what direction progress was to be ex-
pected. With this I contrast the buoyant expressions of another officer
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 7155

charged with like responsibility, as he showed me, one or two decades
later (in 1869), charts constructed like those of Professor Loomis, and
said, ‘* I care not for the mass of observations made in the usual form.
What I want is the power and the material for making such charts as
these.” These two expressions of Sir George Airy and of LeVerrier
mark the progress and the direction of progress in meteorology devel-
oped by Professor Loomis’s memoir.

What was his own judgment of the method at the time of its publi-
cation and its value in meteorology can be seen from his words at the
close of the memoir, which I beg permission to quote :

‘‘Tt appears to me that if the course of investigations adopted with
respect to the two storms of February, 1842, was systematically pursued
we should soon have some settled principles in meteorology. If we could
be furnished with two meteorological charts of the United States daily
for one year, charts showing the state of the barometer, thermometer,
winds, sky, ete., for every part of the country it would settle forever the
laws of storms. No false theory could stand against such an array of
testimony. Such aset of maps would be worth more than all which has
been hitherto done in meteorology. Moreover the subject would be
well-nigh exhausted. But one year’s observation would be needed.
The storms of one year are probably but a repetition of those of the
preceding. Instead then of the guerrilla warfare, which has been main-
tained for centuries with indifferent success, although at the expense
of great self-devotion on the part of individual chiefs, is it not time to
embark in a general meteorological crusade? A well-arranged system of
observations spread over the country weuld accomplish more in one
year than observations at a few isolated posts, however accurate and
complete, continued to the end of time. The United States are favor-
ably situated for such an enterprise. Observations spread over a smaller
territory would be inadequate, as they would not show the extent of
any large storm. If we take asurvey of the entire globe we shall search
in vain for-more than one equal area which could be occupied by the
same number of trusty observers. In Europe there is opportunity for
a like organization, but with this incumbrance, that it must needs em-
brace several nations of different languages and governments. The
United States then afford decidedly the most hopeful field fur such an
enterprise. Shall we hesitate to embark in it; or shall we . cope tim-
idly along as in former years? There are but few questions vf science
which can be prosecuted in this country to the same advantage as in
Europe. Here is ove where the advantage is in our favor. Would it
not be wise to devote our main strength to the reduction of this for-
tress? We need observers spread over the entire country at distances
from each other not more than 50 miles. This would require five or six
hundred observers for the United States. About half this number of
registers are now kept in one shape or another, and the number by suit-
able efforts might probably be doubled. Supervision is needed to in-
756 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

troduce uniformity throughout and to render some of the registers more
complete. Is not such an enterprise worthy of the American Philo-
sophical Society ?. The General Government has for more than 20 years
done something and has lately manifested a disposition to do more for
this object. If private zeal could be more generally enlisted the war
might soon be ended and men would cease to ridicule the idea of our
being able to predict an approaching storm.”

This plan of a systematic meteorological campaign was cordially
seconded by Professors Bache and Peirce. At a somewhat later date
the American Academy of Sciences, of Boston, appointed a committee,
of which Professor Loomis was chairman, to urge upon the proper au-
thorities the execution of the plan. The American Philosophical So-
ciety, of Philadelphia, united its voice with that of the Academy. About
this time Professor Henry waS made Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution. He determined to make American meteorology one of the
leading subjects of investigation to be aided by the Institution. At
Professor Henry’s request, Professor Loomis prepared a report upon
the meteorology of the United States, in which he showed what ad-
vantages society might expect from the study of the phenomena of
storms; what had been done in this country toward making the neces-
sary observations and toward deducing from them general laws; and
finally, what encouragement there was to a further prosecution of the
same researches. He then presented in detail a practicable plan for
securing the hoped-for advantages in their fullest extent.

This plan looked to a unifying of all the work done by existing ob-
servers, a systematic supervision, a supplementing of it by new ob-
servers at needed points, a securing of the codperation of the British
Government and the Hudson’s Bay Company in the regions to the north
of us, and finally a thorough discussion of the observations collected.
A siege of 3 years was contemplated. In the history of the several
steps that finally led to the establishment of the United States Signal
Service this report has an important place.

The scheme laid down by Professor Loomis was in part followed out
by the Institution, but the fragmentary character of the observations,
the want of systematic distribution of the piaces of the observers, and
the imperfections of the barometers made the material collected difficult
of discussion. Professor Loomis waited in hopes of some better system.

In 1854, Professor Loomis undertook a re-discussion of the storm of
1836, using the new methods introduced for treating the storms of 1842.
A visit to Europe shortly after enabled him to collect a large number
of observations upon a storm or series of storms that occurred in Eu-
rope about a week later than that American storm. He had long been
anxious to connect, if possible, these two storms, as he said, ‘stepping
across the Atlantic.” The European and the American storms how-
ever not only proved to be distinct one from the other, but the discus-
sion showed clearly that many of the laws of American storms were
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 157

radically different from those of the European storms. The results of
the whole discussion were published in 1859, by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution.

Upon coming to New Haven, in 1860, he commenced the collection of
all the meteorological observations that had been made in New Haven
and the immediate vicinity, and succeeded in finding sets which, when
brought together, made upa nearly continuous record through 86 years.
The results of these observations formed the subject of a memoir pub-
lished by the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1866,

It became part of his duties in.college to deliver a course of lectures
upon the subject of meteorology. In preparation for these he caused
to be printed in very limited numbers the outlines of a treatise upon
meteorology, to be used as the basis of his series of lectures. In 1868
he developed this outline into a treatise suited to use in college classes
andin private study. This treatise, notwithstanding the rapid advances
of the science during more than 20 years, is still indispensable to the
student of meteorology.

The better system of observing for which Professor Loomis had been
long waiting came when the United States Signal Service was estab-
lished in 1871. The daily maps of the weather published by the Bureau
were constructed essentially after the plan which Professor Loomis had,
50 years before, invented for the treatment of the storms of 1842, As
soon as these maps had been published for the two years 1872 and 1873,
Professor Loomis commenced in earnest to deduce from them the lessons
which they taught us respecting the nature and the phenomena of
United States storms. To this investigation he gave nearly all his en-
ergies during the remaining 15 years of his life.

lor several years he employed and paid for the services of assistants
whose time was given to the preparation of material for use in his
studies. The aggregate cost of this assistance was of itself a very
large contribution to science. Beginning in April, 1874, he presented
regularly at eighteen successive meetings of the National Academy of
Sciences in April and in October of each year, a paper entitled “Con-
tributions to Meteorology.” These were at first based upon the publi-
cations ofthe Signal Service alone, but as years went by, like publications
appeared in Europe that were useful for his work. These papers were
published in July and January following the Academy meeting, and
they regularly formed the first and leading article in eighteen successive
volumes of the American Journal of Science. Gradually one after
another of his college duties were committed to others that he might
give his whole strength to these investigations.

An attack of malaria interrupted the regularity of the series. His
advancing years and diminishing strength warned him that the end of
his investigations could not be far distant. The number of hours in
which he could work each day was slowly diminishing. Five more
papers followed at somewhat less regular intervals.
758 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

In 1884, he began a revision of the whole series of papers. They had
been. presented without much regard to systematic order in the subjects
investigated, and new material had accumulated from time to time, so
that a thorough, systematic revison seemed absolutely unecessary.

In 1885, he presented to the Academy of Sciences the first chapter of
this revision, in which he discussed the areas of low pressure—their
form, their size, their motions, and the phenomena attending them.
Two years later, in 1887, the second chapter of the revision appeared,
in which he discussed the areas of high pressure, their form, magnitude,
direction, and velocity of movement, and their relation to areas of low
pressure. Gradually his physical strength was failing, though his
mind was as bright and clear as ever. To this work, the only work
which he was now doing, he was able to give 2 or 3 hours a day. Anx-
iously he husbanded his strength, slowly and painfully preparing the
diagrams and the table for the third chapter upon rain areas, the phe-
nomena of rain-fall in its connection with areas of low pressure, and the
varied phenomena of unusual rain-fall. ‘‘ I see,” he said to a friend,
“not the end of this subject, but where I must stop. 1 hope I shall
have strength to finish this work, and then I shall be ready to die.”

This third and finishing chapter was finally passed through the print-
er’s hands, and some advance copies distributed to correspondents
abroad in the summer months of 1889. His work upon the theory of
storms he felt was finished. As he paid the bill of the printer, he said
to him: * When I return at the close of the vacation I expect to put
into your hands for printing a new edition of the Loomis Genealogy.”
Before the close of the vacation he died.

These three chapters of his revised edition of ‘* Contributions to Met-
eorology,” constitute the full and ripe fruitage of his work in his favorite
science. They will for a long time to come be the basis of facts by
which writers in theoretical meteorology must test their formulas.
They cover all the important points taken up in the twenty-three ear-
lier memoirs with one important exception,—the relation of mountain
observations to those made on the plains below. The laws connecting
these two are not yet clearly indicated; much remains to be learned
about them, and they are of the utmost importance in theoretical mete-
orology. He felt most deeply the backward steps taken by the United
States Signal Service when mountain observations and the publication
of the International Bulletin were discontinued. ‘The National Acad-
emy of Sciences,” he said, ‘ought at once to take up the subject and
use all its influence to secure the restoration of these two services.

Professor Loomis at various times studied certain other questions
in physics and astronomy that were more or less allied with the sub-
jects to which he gave the principal part of his time, and he pub-
lished the results of his studies. He made a series of experiments
on currents of electricity generated by a plate of zine buried in the
earth. He examined the electrical phenomena in certain houses in
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. 159

New York; the curious phenomena of optical moving figures; the
vibrations sent out from waterfalls as the water flows over certain
dams; the orbits of the satellites of Uranus; the temperature of the
planets; the variations of light of the stars 7 Argus and Algol; and
the comet of 1861.

The subject of family genealogy has a peculiar fascination to many
minds. It would be an interesting study to determine practically by
a collection of facts what are the elemeuts in a man’s character
which lead him to engage in this peculiar study. Certain it is that
men of most diverse disposition are led into it. I should not have
thought it likely that Professor Loomis would have taken up the
subject very seriously. Others have expressed to me the same thought,
and he himself says that he did not think it strange that others
should be surprised at his devoting so much time to this subject,
for he was surprised at it himself. He became interested in the sub-
ject early in life, and that interest remained unbroken to his last
days. For nearly forty years before his first publication he collected
from time time to materials for a list of the descendants of his ancestor,
Joseph Loomis, who came from Braintree, England, in the year 1638,
and settled in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1639. In each of his four
visits to Europe he extended his inquiries to his ancestor’s earlier
history in England. The materials thus collected were put in type
in 1870. He published a list containing 4,340 descendants of Joseph
Loomis bearing the Loomis name. He regarded it as entirely pro-
visional, printed to help himself in making further researches, and
to excite interest in others of the name, who would thus be led to
give additional information, or correction of errors.

Finding that to alimited extent only could he hope by correspondence
to gain the information desired, he now undertook in his’ vacations to
canvass the country by personal visits. He collected lists of names
from every available source, from catalogues of every description, from
city directories, county directories, county maps, and county tax lists,
and he compiled from these sources lists of all the Loomis names he
could find. Arranging these names by counties, he undertook to visit
each family personally. In this way he made a pretty thorough canvass
of every part of New England and New York State, of nearly every
part of New Jersey aud Pennsylvania, of the northern part of Ohio,
and of some of the western cities.

After five years of these researches he published the second edition of
the ‘Loomis Genealogy,” in which were given 8,686 names of persons
that bore the Loomis name, descendants of Joseph Loomis in the male
branches.

Five year later, in 1850, Professor Loomis printed in two additional
volumes a provisional list of 19,000 descendants of Joseph Loomis in
the female branches. Large as was this list, he did not regard it as
more than a first outline of a census of the descendants of the original
760 A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS.

emigrant, and he hoped in the near future to publish an additional vol-
ume. For this he has left in manuscript many corrections and large
additions that will be of use to the future Loomis genealogist.

Am I tarrying too long upon the vacation work of Professor Loomis ?
If so, I plead on this oceasien that among these direct descendants of
Joseph Loomis there were enrolled more than two hundred graduates
of Yale College, and nearly one hundred more of our graduates have
married members of this numerous family.

Professor Loomis was doubtless more widely known as the author of
mathematical text-books than as a worker in new fields in science.
Shortly after coming to New York, he prepared a text-book in algebra.
The market was ready for a good book of this kind, and the work pre-
pared for it was a good one. It was followed the next year by a Geom-
etry. This was an attempt, and if judged by its reception and sale it
was a successful attempt, to combine in a school book the rigid demon-
strations of Euclid with the courses of thought in Legendre and in
modern science. ‘The task is one of peculiar difficulty, as the existence
and activities of the English Society for the Improvement of Geometric
Teaching now for neartwenty yearsillustrates. Other books followed the
Geometry from year to year, the whole forming a connected series from
arithmetic upward, so that the list of his works finally numbered near
twenty volumes. His experience in teaching, his rare skill in language,
his clear conception of what was important, and his unwearied pains-
taking, combined to produce text-books which met the wants of teach-
ers. About 600,000 volumes have been sold, benefiting the schools and
colleges, and bringing to the author a liberal and well-merited pecuniary
return.

We ought not to omit—on this academic occasion—to speak of the
teacher. College graduates who have been under his instruction will
probably retain a more positive impression of the personal traits and
the character of Professor Loomis than of most of their other teachers..
His crisp sentences, lucid thought, exactness of language, and steadi-
ness of requirement, more than made up for any apparent coldness and
real reserve. These characteristics of his riper years were peculiar to
him from the beginning of his life as a teacher. During his tutorship
he was thought to be strict as a disciplinarian, and this may have un-
favorably affected his influence with some members of the class of
1837, of which he was tutor. It was not so with all of them. Some of
you will recall what was said by a member of that class as he came to
commencement a few years since, occupying at the time the highest
office which a lawyer in the line of his profession can in this country
secure: “If I have been successful in life,” said Chief-Justice Waite,
‘1 owe that success to the influence of Tutor Loomis more than to any
other cause whatever.”

There was in Professor Loomis so much of reserve, that to many per-
sons -he seemed cold and without interest in the lives of others. But
A MEMOIR OF ELIAS LOOMIS. T61

this was mainly due to appearances only. The tear would at times
come unbidden to his eye. His correspondence with his class-mates in
the years immediately following graduation shows warm interest in all
that coneerned them. [From Hudson he wrote often to Mr. Herrick,
and complained much of isolation, but more especially of isolation from
scientific companions aud books.

In 1840, he married Miss Julia E. Upson, of Talmadge, Ohio, a lady
about whom those who knew her have spoken to me only in terms of
praise, and for whose memory Professor Loomis cherished a tender rev-
erence. She died in 1854, leaving two sons. From this time Professor
Loomis lived in apartments, surrounded by his books and devoted to
his studies. His sons, after passing tbeir school and college days, went
to their own fields of work. During many years of his New Haven life
he was unable to receive visitors in the evening. He made very few
new friends, and one after another of his old ones passed away. To
his work he was able to give undivided his time and his strength. His
mind did not seem to require the excitementof social intercourse for its
full and healthful activity. Isolated though he was there was in him
no trace whatever of selfish or morbid feeling. In council his advice
was always marked by his clear judgment of what was important, and
at the same time what was practicable. Whatever he himself had the
right to decide was promptly decided by a yes or no, and few persons
cared to question the finality of his decision. But when his colleagues,
or others, had the right to decide he accepted their decision without
questioning or subsequent murmur. Upon being told that his letters to
Mr. Herrick had come to the college library, and that he could, if he
chose, examine them and see whether there were among them any which
he would prefer not to leave in this quasi public place, he promptly re-
plied: ‘‘ No, | never wrote a letter which I should be ashamed to see
published.”

After coming to New York he had a generous income from his books,
besides his salary as professor. ‘The amount he saved from his income
was carefully and prudently invested, and before his death the savings
with their accumulations were a large estate; how large only he and
his banker knew.

One of his college class-mates told me that Mr. Loomis left college
with the definitely expressed purpose that the world should be better
for his living in it. The central proposition in his inaugural address
at Hudson in 1838 was: ‘That itis essential to the best interests of
society that there should be a certain class of men devoted exclusively
to the cultivation of abstract science without any regard toits practical
applications; and consequently that such men instead of being thought
a dead weight upon society, are to be ranked among the greatest bene-
factors of their race.” He chose this for his prineipal work for man,
and he steadily kept to the chosen work. To establish an astronomi-
cal observatory had been through life a cherished object. He entered

into and aided heartily the plans of Mr. Winchester, both before and
after Mr. Winchester asked his trustees to transfer his magnificent en-
dowment tothe university. Professor Loomis looked forward to a large
institution in the future on the observatory site. To endow this public
service, after making liberal provision for his two sons, he bequeathed
his estate. The income from more than $300,000 will eventually be
available to continue the work of his life. With clear judgment of
what was most important he limited the use of that income to the pay-
ment of salaries of persons whose time should be exclusively devoted
to the making of observations for the promotion of the science of as-
tronomy, or to the reduction of astronomical observations, and to de-
fraying the expenses of publication. He knew that if he provided ob-
servers, other benefactors would furnish buildings and instruments,
and the costs of supervision and maintenance.

A university has an organic life, with its past and its future. The
wealth of a university consists mainly in its men; notso much in those
men who are its active members now, as in those who have lived them-
selves into its life in the past, and have made it a home of scholarship,
of truth, and of devotion to duty; a place fit for the development of
the nobler elements of character. The life and work of Elias Loomis
form no mean portion of the wealth of Yale University.

A MEMOIR OF WILLIAM KITCHEN PARKER, F. R. S.*

William Kitchen Parker was born at Dogsthorpe, near Peterbor-
ough, June 23, 1823, and died suddenly, of syncope of the heart, July 3,
1890. He was visiting his second son, Prof. W. N. Parker, of Cardiff,
and whilst cheerfully talking of late discoveries and future work in his
favorite biological pursuits, he ceased to breath. Accustomed to outdoor
life, he was a true lover of nature from the first; the forms, habits, and
songs of birds, especially, he knew at an early age. Village schooling
at Dogsthorpe and Werrington, and a short period at Peterborough
Grammar School prepared him for an apprenticeship at 15 years of age
to Mr. Woodroffe, chemist and druggist at Stamford ; and 3 years after-
wards he was apprenticed to Mr. Costal, medical practitioner, at Market-
Overton. At Stamford he studied botany earnestly, and used to per-
suade a fellow apprentice to leave his bed in early mornings to go afield
in search of plants. Both when living at his father’s farm and in his
holidays afterwards he kept many pet animals and dissected whatever
he could get, including a donkey and many birds. Of the latter he pre-
pared skeletons, and of these he made many large drawings at Market-
Overton, which of late years he had some thought of publishing as an
atlas of the osteology of birds. In 1344~’46 he studied at King’s Col-
lege, London, and became student-demonstrator to Dr. Todd and Mr.
(now Sir William) Bowman there. He also attended at Charing Cross
Hospital in 1846 and 1847, and, having qualified as L.s. A., he com-
menced practice in 1849 at Tachbrook street, Pimlico, and soon after-
wards married Miss Elizabeth Jetfery. His wife’s patient calmness
under all difficulties and trials was a true blessing to a man of Mr.
Parker’s excitable temperament, and her unselfish life and wide-
spread influence for good are well known in and beyond the family
circle. Unfortunately he was left a widower about four months ago.
His family consists of three daughters and four sons. Of the latter, one
is professor of zoology and comparative anatomy in the University of
Otago, New Zealand ; the second is professor of biology in the Univer-
sity College at Cardiff, South Wales; the third is an able draftsman
and lithographer, and the fourth has lately taken his diplomas of L. R.
Cc. Pp. and M. R. C. 8S.

Mr. Parker had a good father, courteous and gentle by nature, con-
scientious, and earnest in business, who had worked hard to be able to

give even his youngest son, Mr. W. K. Parker, ‘‘a start in life.” From
his placid and thoughtful mother he probably inherited much of his
love of reading and his talent for learning.

Always energetic, in spite of constant ill health, Mr. Parker enthu-
siastically carried on his medical work and his natural history studies,
especially in the microscopic structure of animal and vegetable tissues.
Polyzoa and Foraminifera, collected on a visit to Bognor, and from
among sponge sand and Indian sea-shells, especially attracted his at-
tention. Having sorted, mounted, and drawn numbers of these micro-
z0a, he was induced, about 1856, by his friends W. Crawford Williamson
and T. Rupert Jones, to work at the Foraminifera systematically. His
paper on the Miliolitidw of the Indian Seas (Trans. Micros. Soce., 1858),
and a joint paper (with T. R. Jones) on the Foraminifera of the Norwe-
giarn coast (Annals N. H., 1857) resulted; and the latter formed the
basis of a memoir on the Arctic and North Atlantic Foraminifera (Phil.
Trans., 1865). With T. Rupert Jones, and afterwards with W. B. Car-
penter and H. B. Brady, Mr. Parker, down to 1873, described and illus-
trated many groups and species of Foraminifera, recent and fossil (see
©. D. Sherborn’s ‘ Biography of Foraminifera” for these papers and
memoirs), thereby establishing more accurately a natural classification
of these microzoa, determining their bathymetrical conditions, and
therefore their value in geology. That he did not neglect anatomical
research is shown by memoirs in the Proceedings and Transactions of
the Zodlogical Society on the osteology (chiefiy cranial) and systematic
position of Balzniceps (1860), Pterocles (1862), Palamedea (1863), Galli-
naceous Birds and Tinamous (1862 and 1866), Kagu (1864 and 1869),
Ostriches (1864), Microglossa (1865), Common Fowl (1869), Eel (Nature,
1871), skull of Frog (1871), of Crow (1872), Salmon, Tit, Sparrow Hawk,
Thrushes, Sturgeon, and Pig (1873). In the mean time the Ray Society
had brought out his valuable “ Monograph on the structure and devel-
opment of the Shoulder Girdle and Sternum in the Vertebrata” (1868) ;
and his Presidential addresses to the Royal Microscopical Society (1872,
1873), and notes on the Archeopteryx (1864), and the fossil Bird bones
from the Zebbug Cave, Malta (1865 and 1869), had been published.
Subsequently the Royal Society’s Transactions contained his abun-
dantly illustrated memoirs on the skull of the Batrachia (1878 and
1880), of the Urodelous Amphibia (1877), the Common Snake (1878),
Sturgeon (1882), Lepidosteus (1882), Edentata (1886), Insectivora (1886),
and his elaborate memoir on the development of the wing of the Com-
mon Fowl (1888). In the ‘‘ Reports of the Challenger” is his memoir on
the Green Turtle (1880); and those on Tarsipes (Dundee, 1889), and the
Duck and the Auk (Dublin, 1890), are his last works.

In former times a skull was taken as little more than a dry, symmet-
rical, bony structure; or if it were the cartilaginous brain case of a
shark, it was to most a mere dried museum specimen. When however
the gradations of the elements of the skull, from embryonic beginnings,
were traced until their mutual relations and their homologues in other

é
A MEMOIR OF WILLIAM KITCHEN PARKER, F. R. S. ti

vertebrates were established, light was thrown on the wonderful com-
pleteness of organic uniformity and singleness of design. How such
studies can be carried on both by minute dissection and the modern art
of parallel slicing, and not by one method alone, is to be gathered from
his teaching.

Mr. Parker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865, and in
the year following he received a royal medal for his comprehensive,
exact, and useful researches in the developmental osteology, or embry-
onal morphology, of vertebrates. Some few years afterwards the Royal
Society gave him an annual grant to aid in the prosecution of his stud-
ies; and, when that was discontinued, a pension from the Crown was
graciously and appropriately awarded to him. A generous friend, be-
longing to a well-known Wesleyan family, more than once presented
£100 towards the cost of some of the numerous plates illustrating his
grand memoirs in the philosophical transactions.

In 1873, he received the diploma as member of the Royal College of
Surgeons, and was appointed Hunterian professor, Professor Flower
being invalided for a time; and afterwards both held the professorship
conjointly. His earnestn+ss and wide views were well appreciated,
opening up the modern aspect of comparative anatomy, and showing
that both in man and the lower vertebrates the wonderful structural
development of their bony framework should be studied in a strictly
morphological rather than a teleological method, and that its stages and
resultant forins could be regarded only in the Darwinian aspect.

These lectures, given in abstract in the medical journals, became the
basis of his “ Morphology of the Skull,” in writing which, from his die-
tation and notes, Mr.G. T. Bettany kindly assisted him; and again, in
a semi-popular book, ‘“*0n Mammalian Descent,” another friend (Miss
Arabella Buckley, now Mrs. Fisher) similarly helped him. In the lat-
ter work his own usual style frequently predominates, full of metaphor
and quaint allusions, originating in his imaginative and indeed poetic
mind, fully impregnated with ideas and expressions frequent in his
favorite and much-read books—Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, some of
the old divines, and above all the old English Bible.

Separating himself from the trammels of foregone conclusions and
from the formulated but imperfect misleading conceptions of.some of
his predecessors in biology, whom he left for the teaching of Rathke,
Gegenbaur, and Huxley, Prof. W. K. Parker earnestly inculeated the
necessity of siugle-sighted research, and the following up of any un.
biased elucidations, to whatever natural conclusion they may lead.
Simple and firm in Christian faith, resolute in scientific research, he
felt free from dread of any real collision between science and religion.
He insisted that * our proper work is not that of straining our too fee-
ble faculties at system building, but humble and patient attention to
what nature herself teaches, comparing actual things with actual”
(Proc. Zo6l. Soc., 1864); and in his * Shoulder girdle, ete.,” page 2, he
writes: “Then, in the times to come, when we have ‘ prepared our
774. A MEMOIR OF WILLIAM KITCHEN PARKER, F. 8. 8.

work without, and made it fit for ourselves in the field,’ we shall be able
to build a ‘system of anatomy’ which shall truly represent nature and
not be a mere reflection of the mind of one of her talented observers.”

Again, at page 225, in illustration of some results of his work, he
says: ‘The first instance I have given of the shoulder girdle (in the
skate) may be compared to a clay model in its first stage or to the
heavy oaken furniture of our forefathers, that ‘stood pond’rous and
fixed by its own massy weight.’ As we ascend the vertebrate scale the
mass becomes more elegant, more subdivided, and more metamorphosed
until, in the bird class and among the mammals, these parts form the
framework of limbs than which nothing can be imagined more agile or
more apt. So, also, as it regards the sternum; at first a mere outcrop-
ping of the feebly developed costal arches in the amphibia, it becomes
the keystone of perfect arches in the true reptile; then the fulcrum of
the exquisitely constructed organs of flight in the bird; and, lastly,
forms the mobile front wall of the heaving chest of the highest verte-
brate.

Prof. W. K. Parker was a fellow of the Royal, Linnean, Zodlogical,
and Royal Microscopical Societies ; honorary member of King’s College,
London, the Philosophical Society of Cambridge, and the Medical Chi-
rurgical Society. He was also a member of the Imperial Society of
Naturalists of Moscow, and corresponding member of the Imperial
Geological Institute of Vienna, and the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia. In 1885 he received from the Royal College of Physi-
cians the Bayly medal, “ Ob physiologiam feliciter excultam.”

In conversations shortly before his death he often spoke of looking
forward throughout his life-time (alas! how quickly shortened !) to con-
tinued application of all the energy he could devote to his useful work—
at once a consolation to him and a duty.

He has well expressed his own view of biological pursuits at page
363 of the “‘ Morphology of the skull:” ‘“* The study of animal morphol-
ogy leads to Continually grander and more reverent views of creation
and of a Creator. Each fresh advance shows us further fields for con-
quest, and at the same time deepens the conviction that while results
and secondary operations may be discovered by human intelligence,
‘no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to
theend” We live as ina twilight of knowledge, charged with revela-
tions of order and beauty ; we steadfastly look for a perfect light, which
shall reveal perfect order and beauty.”

An unwordly seeker after truth, and loved by all who knew him for
his uprightness, modesty, unselfishness, and generosity to fellow-work-
ers, always helping young inquirers with specimens and information, he
was suddenly lost to sight as a friend and father, but remains in the
minds of fellow-workers, of those whom he so freely taught, and of his
stricken relatives, as a great and good man, whose beneficent influence
will ever be felt ina wide-spreading and advancing science and among
thoughtful and appreciative men in all time,
