SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Con-
gress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of
James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his
property to the United States of America “to found at
Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and
accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution
in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the
heads of the executive departments, and vested responsi-
bility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian
Board of Regents.

Statement by the Secretary

Robert McC. Adams

Alexis de Tocqueville’s 150-year-old description of the
American people and their institutions still has such pene-
trating and uncanny currency that it is sometimes tempt-
ing to project the cultural and intellectual history of this
country in terms of a biological metaphor of growth—the
slow unfolding of possibilities that all were present in the
original organism. Yet there is also reason to distrust that
metaphor. It gives no credit to what we have learned in
passing through jarring and edifying crises like the Civil
War; to the massive, continuous, and probably altogether
unique reshaping of our ethnic composition with the pas-
sage of time; to the transformation not only of the condi-
tions of life but of the perception of life itself through
advances in science and technology; to the reshaping of
our corporate framework as largely unprecedented insti-
tutions of education and governance were grafted onto it;
and, most recently, to our new horizons of involve-
ment—and corresponding vulnerability—as the emer-
gence of a world system of interaction has eroded our
once-unambiguous national boundaries.

Operation in May 1988. (Photograph by Hugh Tallman)

There are also other reasons for recoiling from a bio-
logical metaphor. Unacceptably implicit in it is a process
of inevitable decline and death as well as birth and
growth. Surely we are entitled to reject any deterministic
outcome, but especially such a relentlessly pessimistic
one, as we view the admittedly uncertain balance of this
nation’s yawning problems against the deep reservoir of
our remaining strengths. So the fulfillment of the possi-
bilities of the seed, while a directing and restraining influ-
ence, is only one in a shifting mix of determinants.
Forces for change alternately dominate and are held back
in an irregular and indeterminate succession. Each new
crisis or resolution permanently alters the existing state,
opening the way to new dangers but also to new possibil-
ities fanning out in many directions.

The Smithsonian figures in this general appraisal. If
one scans the congressional debates leading to its estab-
lishment, there is in some respects little the Institution
has done or become that was not at least dimly foreshad-
owed at its birth. We are not a national university, as
some proposed. Yet our links with a number of universi-
ties are increasingly close; our predoctoral and postdoc-
toral fellowships and some aspects of our research
organization and departmental structures are indistin-
guishable from those of universities; and our Resident
Associate program of continuing adult education could
also be succinctly described as something approaching an
open university. We are not a national observatory, as
still others in Congress suggested. Yet our Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, conducted jointly with Har-
vard University, is a major player in the field. We are not
a national library, having at one time seemingly rejected
this course decisively by making an important early con-
tribution to the Library of Congress. Yet our public re-
sponsibilities and research needs make the gradual but
continuing growth of our own specialized library re-
sources unavoidable.

What we are primarily, of course, is a great complex
of national museums. Our eclectic diversification in this
direction, the absence of any significant element of guid-
ing Cartesian logic in the sequential patterns of what we
have collected and exhibited, might well have been pre-
dicted by de Tocqueville. But the emphasis on museums
is itself an outcome of shifting historical circumstances
that would have been difficult to anticipate.

Contributing to an early drift in the museum direction
(which was opposed by Joseph Henry, the Institution’s
great first Secretary) was the need for a repository for
national icons and for the curiosities accumulated during
an era of Western exploration, skirmishing, and settle-
ment. Out of the cabinet of curiosities emerged in time
an enduring, worldwide involvement in systematic collec-
tions embracing natural history. The collection of icons,
tinctured for the first century or so by a Whiggian con-
cern for industry-driven Progress, was ultimately en-
shrined in what was first called the Museum of History
and Technology. Within that edifice, now renamed the
National Museum of American History, those icons and
symbolic functions currently are regarded with mixed rel-
ish and ambivalence. But in any case there has been a
reduction in the former salience of science and technol-
ogy and a turn instead toward society and culture—
drawing heavily on the diversity and disputatiousness
characterizing modern historiography as practiced in
American universities. Meanwhile Whiggianism, in its
identification with advanced technology and with a seem-
ingly endless march toward understanding of and domi-
nation over the natural world, is alive and well at the
National Air and Space Museum. None of these develop-
ments, if you reflect on them, can be thought of as inevi-
table outgrowths of James Smithson’s founding vision or
of the Smithsonian’s original charter.

Even at the unabashedly impressionistic level of these
observations, the list of elements that are new and unan-
ticipated, and that in important ways have been situa-
tionally determined, continues to lengthen. Washington,
characterized by President Kennedy as “a town of North-
ern charm and Southern efficiency,” may have been al-

most always the seat of federal government. But for more
than the first century and a half it was barely recogniza-
ble as the national capital in other ways. The arrival of
air conditioning was one transformational force; until
then Washington was officially reckoned a hardship post
by parts of the diplomatic community. But another, not
insignificant element in the transformation of Washing-
ton into a true national capital has been the growth of
the great complex of free museums for which this city is
now noted. There is something awe-inspiring—if at times
also oppressive to be part of—about the enormous, alto-
gether unparalleled crowds of visitors from all over the
world that are to be found in a number of the museums
of this city.

Accompanying, but also contributing to, this growth in
national influence have been a number of innovative pro-
grams that the Institution has devised or co-opted: the
Smithsonian (and now also the Air & Space) magazine
and the organization of more than two million National
Associates on which it is based, the Smithsonian World
television series, our Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES)
and traveling program of lectures, and the network of
locally supported receiving centers maintained by the
Archives of American Art. All of these programs emanate
from Washington. If they are respected and effective as
forms of outreach, they also draw further attention to
their central stimulus in Washington.

How long and far should this process of centralization
continue? I do not suggest, in asking the question, that
the Smithsonian should cease to grow when “the last site
on the Mall” (immediately east of the Air and Space Mu-
seum) presently finds a new occupant. Discussions con-
cerning the possibility of several further museums are, in
fact, under way. But the character of those discussions is
becoming much more broadly participatory, and the
change anticipates new institutional forms that are not
only geographically more dispersed but more participa-
tory in the distribution of authority.

There are several apparent sources for this new devel-
opment. Loyalties to locality are declining as communi-
ties cease to be centers of permanent occupation for
growing numbers of their inhabitants and lose their social
cohesiveness. Interest groups and constituencies play a
correspondingly larger role, most immediately expressed
through the impact of PACs on Congress. But these |
trends, while general and powerful, impact on the Smith-
sonian only indirectly. Much closer at hand are forces
that have their origin precisely in the contribution of all
of Washington’s museums to enhancing its role as the
national capital. As the Mall becomes a symbolic cultural

center, equity of access and participation and sensitivity
of representation become increasingly vital issues.

The readjustments now under way may be illustrated
briefly by three examples. One involves ongoing discus-
sions over the prospect of bringing the Museum of the
American Indian from New York City to Washington. At
this writing the situation is still fluid and it would be rash
to predict the final outcome, but what matters almost
more are the terms in which the Smithsonian supports its
case. Only in Washington, it is argued, can the drawing
together of a truly unparalleled collection contribute in
full measure to an American Indian cultural renaissance.
What is foreseen is a growing network of museums and
cultural centers on Indian lands, in which circulating col-
lections of authentic materials of the highest quality can
be exhibited, studied, and drawn upon as historic roots
for new inspiration. Needed to make this possible are
hands-on programs greatly to enlarge the numbers of
rained conservators, archivists, ethnohistorians, art his-
Orians, curators, and museum administrators. But no
such developments would be either realistic or morally

defensible without the goodwill and leadership of na-
tional Indian organizations and the active involvement at
every stage of local organs of Indian governance as well.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from discussions
concerning African American culture and history. In
spring 1988 the Smithsonian was directed, by the House
subcommittee having jurisdiction over its appropriations,
to consider and provide a report on whether a new na-
tional museum with this focus should be created under its
auspices. That question, we soon realized, could not be
answered in isolation. There already exists an African
American Museum Association with around a hundred
members, and many churches and historically black col-
leges and universities also have important collections and
are involved to varying degrees in museum functions.
Not a few of these institutions lack adequately trained
staffs or are financially vulnerable. Means should be
found to enlarge and strengthen the academic resources
committed to the field, to support the preparation and
circulation of exhibits, and to develop a network of
shared information about existing collections.

ment of Japanese-Americans in the 1940s, to share her personal
experiences with visitors to “A More Perfect Union: Japanese
Americans and the U.S. Constitution,” an exhibition in the Mu-
seum of American History. (Photograph by Michael Yamashita)

It is to be hoped that the Smithsonian can assist in
these processes, and we are actively searching for ways in
which to do so. But the existing institutions are of funda-
mental importance, not only for what they have already
learned and collected but for their vital links of confi-
dence and shared commitment with members of their
own communities in whose basements and attics there
are yet to be identified major increments to a still largely
undiscovered past. Whatever moves the Smithsonian
makes in this area, it is once again clear that geographi-
cal dispersion, networking, shared control, and sensitiv-
ity to the accomplishments and needs of existing
institutions will furnish the indispensable keys to long-
term success.

Thirdly, consider the example of Hispanic culture.
Here I think it is fair to say that patterns of stereotyping
and neglect have long prevailed at the international level
as well as internally. In this country Latin America and
the Caribbean world are thought of, when they are con-
sidered seriously at all, largely in terms of debt crises,
military governments, drug cartels, corruption, and civil
violence. Overlooked are immensely rich and varied cul-
tural traditions, shining models of industrialization for

Iz

much of the rest of the Third World, the striking, recent
resurgence of democratic movements, and our own, not
insignificant, contributions over the years to some of the
region’s chronic problems. At least until recently, simi-
larly distorted stereotyping and neglect characterized the
Anglo-American view of our rapidly growing Hispanic
minority, centering not on its diversity, cultural richness,
and improving socioeconomic stature but on its resistance
to cultural and linguistic assimilation. |

The principal vehicle with which the Smithsonian pro-
poses to contribute to these issues is an imposing array of ©
television programs, exhibitions, and symposia—in fact,
an unprecedentedly broad institutional effort, involving a
majority of our museums—on the Quincentenary of Col-
umbus’s first voyage to the Caribbean. Without deprecat-
ing the boldness and decisiveness of his accomplishment,
it is not primarily the “discovery” of the New World that
we commemorate—that Eurocentric view overlooks the |
great civilizations already flourishing here long before his
arrival. Celebration of the Quincentenary instead is an
occasion to take account of five centuries of a hemisphere- |
wide encounter, and of the emergence of vigorous, new
civilizational traditions out of diverse Old and New
World roots. This alternate emphasis, the basis for the
growing importance with which the occasion is viewed
throughout Latin America as its time approaches, may
help to draw our peoples together by redirecting the at-
tention and sensitivity of many in this country as well.
But its success will depend, to an unprecedented degree,
on collaborative efforts involving institutions, scholars,
and creative artists not only in the United States but
throughout the hemisphere.

These three instances, roughly coinciding in time, point)
to a shift of emphasis within the Smithsonian that is un-
der way and likely to continue. Our pace of physical
growth in central Washington gives little evidence of
slackening, with the Sackler Gallery and the National
Museum of African Art having opened only a little more
than a year ago and plans for other facilities in varying
stages of preparation or discussion. But alongside of this
direct growth of our own facilities, here is growth and
outreach of another kind that depends upon entirely new
modes of cooperation and involvement with other institu-
tions and constituencies. What particularly differentiates
these modes of association from those of the past is a
concern to deepen and intensify the forms of dialogue,
not merely carrying on parallel activities but sharing in
the direction of common programs.

As this suggests, a concern for enhancing two-way dia-
logue is becoming the central means by which the Smith-

sonian can advance toward new and more ambitious
goals. This applies as much at the individual as at the

| sponsibilities for which we were appointed—whether to
advance the frontiers of knowledge, to maintain collec-
tions, or to contribute to the Smithsonian’s complex ag-
gregate of needs in other ways—we also can join in

| looking outward to the many constituencies with which
the Institution is increasingly engaged. In doing so we
learn, for example, that “popular” and “elitist” knowl-
edge are categories to be creatively adjoined, not forced
apart. The scholar, his or her informant, and the public
to which ensuing publications are addressed are partners
in a common enterprise.

I confine my further illustrations of the prevalence of
these patterns to a few at the institutional level, although
others can be found in virtually all our operations. There
are scientifically sampled surveys of some of our museum
audiences, the Contributing Members and the Resident
Associates, for example, that have begun to be carried
out by the newly organized Office of Institutional Studies
under the direction of Zahava Doering. Some have been
One-time studies of particular exhibitions or events, de-
signed to tell us something of visitor backgrounds and
reactions and so to improve them. Other surveys have
probed for the level of understanding of issues portrayed
in a topical exhibition like “Tropical Rainforests: A Dis-
appearing Treasure,” contrasting a sample of those who
have passed through the exhibition with another sample
of those who have not. The most ambitious of these
studies yet undertaken has sampled the huge visitorship
at the National Air and Space Museum for a six-month
period, helping us enormously as we seek to understand
the backgrounds, interests, and reactions of our audience
and to do a better job in promoting the Smithsonian’s
ission as an institution serving all members of society.
bout 5,000 interviews had been completed, with an 80
ercent response rate, by the end of the reporting period.

A similar objective will be attained in a somewhat dif-
ferent way in the permanent exhibition on the Informa-
ion Revolution that is in preparation at the National
useum of American History under the direction of Da-
id Allison. Highly interactive in design, this major in-
tallation encourages visitors to question or pursue
urther the aims of the exhibition itself through multiple
omputer entry points. Thus we will accumulate a record
f audience reactions, concerns, and level of interest and
ophistication, on the basis of which the exhibition can
€ progressively improved.

Interaction of an entirely different kind figures heavily

institutional level. Without diminishing the specialized re-

in another exhibition in which we take great pride, both
for its audience impact and as a distinguished scholarly
effort. “Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and
Alaska” opened in the Evans Gallery of the National Mu-
seum of Natural History in September, culminating al-
most a decade of collaborative planning that brought our
scholars together with fellow anthropologists attached to
the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. Carried
through under the indefatigable leadership of William Fitz-
hugh, this brings before the Soviet as well as the Ameri-
can and Canadian publics collections from both sides of
the Bering Strait that have never before been exhibited in
such profusion—let alone together. As a result of the
long years of collaborative planning, the exhibition and
its accompanying book rank as important contributions
to knowledge in their own right. Many viewers report an
almost emotional impact, not only from coming face to
face with astonishing cultural achievements in what we
think of as an exceedingly harsh and constraining envi-
ronment but from their sudden awareness of how much
was swept away and virtually forgotten by the incoming
Russians and Americans in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.

A readiness for sensitive and long-continuing interac-
tion, carried on at many levels, has been the key to other
successful Smithsonian activities that involved cooperat-
ing Soviet scholars and institutions. Exchanges of folklife
artists and scholars had a promising beginning during the
year, and promising cooperative arrangements were con-
cluded between the Folkways Record Company (now
Smithsonian owned) and Meloydia Records, a Soviet
counterpart. “Russian and Soviet Paintings, 1900-1930:
Selections from the State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow,
and the State Russian Museum, Leningrad” appeared at
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in the
summer, the sequel to other exchange exhibitions that
have moved in both directions. Much of this material
was entirely new to the American public, and its public
exhibition has also been suppressed in the Soviet Union
since the time of Stalin. For many, including this ob-
server, the creative diversity that flourished through
much of the twenties was breathtaking, correspondingly
amplifying the tragic losses in the decades that followed.

So I find myself asking as the year draws to a close,
what truly distinguishes the Smithsonian? What should
we try harder to be and do? On the one hand, the Insti-
tution endlessly carries forward a set of ambitious probes
of the limits of human experience and the ways of look-
ing at it, challenging all our unreflective assumptions and
placid routines. In this spirit, its concern is not with the

13
sum of received wisdom but with its cutting edges and
arresting incongruities. With the especially long-enduring,
for example; or the moment or process of transforma-
tion; or the unique, small or unnoticed, perhaps even
consciously suppressed, and yet important in the scheme
of things; or the universal or fundamental; or, not least,
the endangered and deserving of conservation—like the
whole of our planet.

On the other hand the Institution also has the responsi-
bility to impart what has been learned to many audi-
ences, and we find we understand it differently and better
as a result of having done so. We view the nature of
knowledge itself relativistically and problematically, in
other words, in order to make it more useful as well as
more universal. In that sense the Institution’s dialogues
and constituencies are an absolutely vital part of every-
thing it is and does.

The Year in Review

As a unique museum complex, a major center for re-
search, and a thriving public educational institution, the
Smithsonian Institution operates in several spheres, serv-
ing a multitude of communities. In the public sphere, the
Smithsonian welcomes a diverse mix of visitors to its mu-
seums and participants in its programs. They include
tourists and Washington—area residents, schoolchildren
and teachers, people of all ages, interests, and cultural
origins. In the Smithsonian’s scholarly sphere, which is
largely unseen by most visitors, an extensive research ap-
paratus grounded in a tradition of scholarship as old as
the Institution itself stimulates and supports the explora-
tion of intellectual frontiers in the sciences, art, and the
humanities. Books, television, radio, the print media, and
now the latest in interactive computer technology extend
the Institution’s reach still further. The Institution’s im-
pact is felt not just in this country, but around the world,
through programs, exhibitions, and research efforts that
engage the Smithsonian as an active participant in our
global society.

The highlights of 1988 are ample confirmation that the
Smithsonian is a lively, multidimensional institution that,
year by year, expands its scope and intensifies its contri-
butions in many spheres. Whether through an exhibition
on a vital contemporary issue, research that helps protect
an endangered animal species, or a workshop that shows
teachers how to use museums as classroom resources, the
Institution enriches the human experience on many lev-
els—individual and collective, local, national, and inter-
national, for today and for the future.

As the year began, the Smithsonian’s new museum, re-
search, and education complex on the Mall had just
opened to the public with great fanfare and popular ac-
claim. The vast underground complex is topped by pavil-
ions through which visitors enter the National Museum
of African Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. A cop-
per-domed kiosk leads to the S. Dillon Ripley Center and
to offices for several Smithsonian programs. The “roof”
of the complex is the Enid A. Haupt Garden, with plant-
ings that reflect the changing seasons.

This new addition to the Mall’s museums had been in
the making for two decades, and its impact was felt in all
quarters of the Institution throughout 1988. The National
Museum of African Art recorded a record number of vis- —
its—640,000—to its new and larger location. The Sackler |
Gallery, the Smithsonian’s newest museum, presented ex- |
hibitions, programs, and symposia that introduced the |
public and scholars to its extensive collection of Asian
art. Next door to the Sackler, the Freer Gallery of Art
began a three-year renovation that will renew the venera- |
ble museum. The second exhibition to be installed in the
new International Gallery in the S. Dillon Ripley Center,
“Tropical Rainforests: A Disappearing Treasure,” drew
large numbers of visitors during the year. And hundreds
of people attended educational programs, conferences,
and symposia held in Ripley Center facilities and spon-
sored by the Resident Associate Program, the Office of
Interdisciplinary Studies, the International Center, and
other Smithsonian bureaus and offices. The Quadrangle
complex meant an expanded role for supporting offices
such as the Office of Horticulture as arrangements for
special events, new indoor greenery in the Ripley Center,
and the plantings in the Enid A. Haupt Garden all re-
quired careful attention.

At year’s end, more than 1.6 million visits had been
recorded by the National Museum of African Art, by the
Sackler Gallery, and at the kiosk entrance to the S. Dil-
lon Ripley Center. Altogether, the Smithsonian’s twelve
museums (eleven in Washington, D.C., and one in New
York City), the Arts and Industries Building, and the
Smithsonian Institution Building counted 28.6 million vis-
its during the year, an increase of 3 million over 1987.
Among the milestones this year were the 1o millionth vis-
itor to the National Air and Space Museum’s IMAX®
film, To Fly; the busiest month ever for Smithsonian mu-
seum shops (July); and a record number of visits for a
single day at the National Air and Space Museum (Au-
gust Ir).

A large cadre of Smithsonian volunteers had helped to
make the opening of the Quadrangle complex run

smoothly, and with their continuing participation the in-
augural year was a resounding success. The Visitor Infor-
mation and Associates’ Reception Center (VIARC) added
to its volunteer force to serve the new museums; a pool

| of 534 volunteers now staffs sixteen information desks in
| eleven buildings throughout the Institution, filling sixty-
two daily assignments. Providing information to museum
visitors is just one of the more visible contributions vol-
junteers made to the Institution’s operation. Nearly 1,100
volunteers worked behind the scenes in bureaus and of-
fices. Another 437 worked on short-term special projects
this year, and 60 staffed the VIARC translation services
group. Altogether, 5,763 volunteers gave an impressive
485,084 hours of service to the Smithsonian during 1988.

The Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associ-
ates again provided a significant service to the Institution,
making forty-one grants to museums and offices for a
variety of projects that might not otherwise have been
possible. The committee’s sixty-three active members and
seventy resource members contributed more than 700
volunteer hours to the Institution this year.

Although the pace of 1988 may have seemed almost
leisurely in comparison with the milestone events of 1987,
anniversaries, expansions, and openings abounded. The
useum Support Center, the Institution’s innovative
torage and research facility, celebrated its fifth anniver-
ary this year. Open houses held in May gave the press,
members of Congress, Smithsonian staff, and others a
firsthand look at research, collections care, conservation
treatment, and training activities. The Suitland, Mary-
land, facility is the only collections storage center of its
kind in the United States, and it is considered a model for
he long-term storage and preservation of museum
bjects.

The National Air and Space Museum improved its col-
ections storage during 1988 with the completion of a new
puilding at Washington-Dulles International Airport. The
space shuttle Enterprise and other historically important
ircraft that had been stored outdoors are now housed
ndoors where they are protected from the elements.

Expanded research facilities strengthened the Institu-
ion’s prominent role as a leader in the advancement of
cientific knowledge. At the National Zoological Park, a
tate-ofthe-art veterinary hospital opened at Rock Creek
ark. A new laboratory wing was added to the main
uilding of the Smithsonian Environmental Research
enter in Edgewater, Maryland, and the building was
enamed for former Maryland Senator Charles McC.
athias, a dedicated supporter of environmental issues.

n Panama, work continued on the expansion of research

facilities at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
At the National Air and Space Museum, visitors are
enjoying the two new glass-enclosed restaurants, which
opened on the Mall in September to excellent reviews by
food critics and architecture critics alike. On a smaller
scale, but still with the public’s comfort in mind, the
shady garden between the Arts and Industries Building
and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has

been replanted and named the Mary Livingston Ripley
Garden.

Exhibitions

Exhibitions, public programs, research, and collections
are the four cornerstones of the Institution’s activities.
These are not separate functions, but overlapping, com-
plementary ones that together shape the quality of the
Smithsonian experience.

Museum exhibitions are one of the Institution’s most
visible links to its public. In every museum, exhibitions
are the visitor’s primary place of encounter with the ob-
jects that the museum collects and with the aggregate
meaning those objects embody. Exhibitions help visitors
appreciate the continuum of past, present, and future.
They stimulate personal recollections, introduce new
knowledge, clarify mysteries, and inspire contemplation.
They challenge assumptions, confirm beliefs, and invite

debate. And they provide a learning experience in which
intellectual enrichment and the expansion of knowledge
are synonymous with pure enjoyment and fun. The exhi-
bitions organized this year by the Smithsonian’s museums
and its traveling exhibition service were as diverse in
scope, approach, and subject matter as the Institution it-
self.

Some addressed subjects that have broad social conse-
quence on regional, national, and global scales. Atthe
Anacostia Museum, 30,000 visitors saw “Climbing Ja- |
cob’s Ladder: The Rise of Black Churches in Eastern
American Cities, 1740-1877,” which vividly recounted the
role of the black church as a stimulus for self-determina-
tion and rejuvenation. To commemorate the bicentennial
of the U.S. Constitution, the National Museum of Amer-
ican History mounted “A More Perfect Union: Japanese
Americans and the United States Constitution,” a dra-
matic exhibition that explored the ramifications of racial
prejudice and fear by documenting the internment of Jap-
anese Americans during World War II. An exhibition
organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhi-
bition Service with the World Wildlife Fund told the ur-
gent story of the ecology and destruction of one of the
most essential parts of our ecosystem. “Tropical Rain-
forests: A Disappearing Treasure” began its five-year na-
tional tour with a showing in the International Gallery of
the S. Dillon Ripley Center.

Other exhibitions presented the creative products of
artists from other countries and other cultures. Inaugural
exhibitions in the new museum complex presented slices
of African and Asian art and culture. The National Mu-
seum of African Art brought the public the finest in the
art and culture of sub-Saharan Africa in two exhibitions:
“Images from Bamum: German Colonial Photography at
the Court of King Njoya, Cameroon, West Africa, 1902-
1915” and “Shoowa Design: Raffia Textiles from Zaire.”
At the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, a scholarly retreat was
re-created in the galleries to embellish “The Chinese
Scholar’s Studio: Artistic Life in the Late Ming Period,”
an international loan exhibition of objects from the
Shanghai Museum in the People’s Republic of China.

A number of exhibitions reflected the diversity of the
American experience. “Special Delivery: Murals for the
New Deal Era,” organized by the National Museum of
American Art, recorded a picture of the nation’s values
during the Depression. The exhibition was drawn from
the museum’s collection of mural studies submitted in the
1930s to national competitions for commissions to deco-
rate post offices and other federal buildings. The mu-
seum’s permanent collection galleries were rehung

following the return of the exhibition, “Treasures from
the National Museum of American Art,” which had been
on tour since February 1986.

“American Colonial Portraits: 1700-1776” at the Na-
tional Portrait Gallery, the first in a series of exhibitions
at the gallery commemorating the bicentennial of the
U.S. Constitution, assembled an unparalleled selection of
portraits from public and private collections throughout
the country and abroad. At the Renwick Gallery, the 380
| works of art in “Lost and Found Traditions: Native
American Art 1965-1985” were stirring testimony to the
will for cultural survival among native peoples of North
America. Living American artists were the focus of the

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s new WORKS
| series, a program of temporary installations created espe-
cially for the museum’s building and grounds. Three
pieces were executed this year for the series, which is the
only continuing program of its kind in a major American
museum.

Through other exhibitions, visitors entered the realms
of science and technology. The complex, often controver-
sial topics of the rise of molecular biology and genetic
engineering were the subject of “The Search for Life: Ge-
netic Technology in the Twentieth Century” at the Na-
tional Museum of American History. Dick Rutan and
Deana Yeager’s Voyager aircraft is the centerpiece of the
National Air and Space Museum’s new exhibition, “Voy-
ager: Around the World without a Pit Stop.” The exhibi-
tion, which has become one of the most popular at the
museum, uses text panels, photographs, and a video
presentation to describe the first nonstop, nonrefueled
flight around the world.

New exhibitions at the National Zoological Park con-
tinued to establish the zoo as a biological park that re-
creates for visitors the interrelationships between plant
and animal life. In the Gibbon Ridge Exhibit, the endan-
gered forest apes are at home in spacious new naturalistic
surroundings. Ducks, geese, swans, herons, and egrets
inhabit the Waterfowl Wetlands Exhibit alongside lush
plantings typical of a wetlands environment.

A number of exhibitions reflected the growing sense
that we are members of a global community. Several of
hese were “firsts.” The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ure Garden organized “Russian and Soviet Paintings,
900-1930: Selections from the State Tretyakov Gallery,
oscow, and the State Russian Museum, Leningrad,”
he first American exhibition of Revolution-era Russian
nd Soviet art from Soviet museums.

“Then and Now: American Portraits from the Past
entury” is the first international traveling exhibition or-

ganized by the National Portrait Gallery. The survey of
roo years of American portraiture was shown in mu-
seums in Hong Kong and in Sapporo and Tokyo, Japan.

“Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and
Alaska,” a panoramic history of the native peoples of
Siberia, Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands, is the first exhi-
bition to have been researched and organized by a joint
Soviet-American curatorial team. Developed by the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History and the Soviet Acad-
emy of Sciences, with the collaborative aid of the
International Research and Exchanges Board, “Cross-
roads” brings together archaeological and ethnographic
artifacts from Soviet, Canadian, and U.S. museums in an
exhibition that will travel to seven cities in the three
countries.

Many of the exhibitions at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
in New York City reflected the international scope of the
Smithsonian’s National Museum of Design. Among them
was “Versailles: The View from Sweden,” showing the
influence of Versailles on late seventeenth- and early
eighteenth-century Swedish architecture. The exhibition
was organized to commemorate the 3s5oth anniversary of
the first permanent Swedish settlement in North America.

The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Ser-
vice (SITES) brought the Smithsonian to life in museums,
art centers, and other cultural institutions throughout the
country. In 1988 SITES exhibitions were displayed in 333
locations in forty-four states for an estimated audience of
ten million people. One of the twenty-four new exhibi-
tions organized this year traveled to the Soviet Union.
“New Horizons: American Painting, 1840-1910,” the re-
ciprocal exhibition to last year’s “Russia, The Land, The
People,” was seen in four Soviet cities. Another highlight
of the year at SITES was “King Herod’s Dream: Caesarea
on the Sea,” which traced the colorful history of an an-
cient Mediterranean seaport.

Public Programs

In a unique process of communication that blends ob-
jects, ideas, and individual experience, people of all ages,
interests, and backgrounds expand their horizons with
the help of the Smithsonian. Through its exhibitions,
programs, and special events, the Smithsonian is an agent
of cultural, scientific, and visual literacy. It is a place for
learning, in the broadest sense of the word. Whether the
learning experience is conscious or casual, whether it oc-
curs during an organized program or in a moment of
solitary contemplation, it has a lasting impact on Smith-

17
sonian visitors. In keeping with the philosophy that
learning is a lifelong process of enrichment, the year’s
agenda was dotted with educational programs for chil-
dren and adults alike.

Through the Resident Associate Program (RAP), more
than 296,700 people of all ages enjoyed a rich variety of
nearly 2,000 lectures, seminars, courses, films, and study
tours. RAP attracted a record 16,000 new members dur-
ing 1988; adult course registration grew by more than 20
percent over 1987. To build on this success, RAP estab-
lished a Development Office that will work to attract
new audiences and new members from the Washington
area’s minority communities.

To serve the Institution’s national constituencies, the
Smithsonian National Associate Program presented lec-
tures and seminars throughout the country and offered a
tantalizing selection of tours to places around the globe.
A popular new offering this year was the Smithsonian
Research Expedition Program, through which Associate
members can participate in two-week field research trips
led by Smithsonian scientists and curators.

Efforts to extend the scope and benefits of the Institution
to every segment of the public intensified this year, as a
number of bureaus and offices carried out activities
aimed at building an audience that reflects our society’s
cultural pluralism. The Office of Public Affairs set the
tone for these outreach efforts with its theme for the
year: “The Smithsonian. It’s for everyone—and for you.”
A coordinated media campaign designed to reach black
families resulted in thousands of written requests for in-

formation. A Spanish-language version of the Institution’s

monthly calendar, a bilingual brochure, and a Spanish-
language television public service announcement invited
greater participation by Hispanic Americans. And the of-
fice designed a media program directed to the national
Native American community.

Other efforts included Institution-wide observances of
Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Week, and
Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week. The Education
Department of the Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery
of Art established an advisory council to examine issues
of accessibility for disabled visitors to the museums. At
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, a sympo-
sium for docents focused on outreach.

Outreach efforts were not limited to programs for the
public, but included programs that encourage wider in-
volvement in the Institution through research and profes-
sional education. The Office of Fellowships and Grants,
in collaboration with Howard University, again offered a
program to promote minority interest in natural history.

18

Students and faculty joined in fieldwork at the Smithson-
ian Environmental Research Center and learned about
opportunities for research and study at the Smithsonian.
The Office of Museum Programs made awards to
twenty-four minority museum professionals in support of
their attendance at workshops and residencies organized
by the office.

Festivals, special events, and performances are an exten-
sion of the Institution’s role as an agent for education
and enjoyment. The twenty-second annual Festival of
American Folklife drew an estimated 1.5 million people to
the Mall for a celebration that extended beyond this na-
tion’s cultural richness to include the heritage of the So-
viet Union. This year the festival focused on the folklife
of Massachusetts; immigrant migration to Washington,
D.C.; Soviet musical traditions; and the history of the
American Folklore Society. Soviet performers participated
as part of a long-term cultural exchange agreement be-
tween the Office of Folklife Programs and the Soviet gov-
ernment.

traditions: the annual open house at the National Air and
Space Museum’s Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restora-
tion, and Storage Facility; the “Trees of Christmas” exhi-
bition at the National Museum of American History; the
Kite Festival on the Washington Monument grounds; and
the spring Washington Craft Show sponsored by the
Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates.

Live performances at the Smithsonian this year re-
flected the spirit and purpose of the museums and their
exhibitions. A concert by Washington’s award-winning
Eastern High School Choir accompanied the black
churches exhibition at the Anacostia Museum. At the
National Portrait Gallery, a dramatic portrait of play-
wright August Strindberg enhanced an exhibition from
the Swedish National Portrait Collection. And musical
programs at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery featured mas-
ters of the sitar and the Chinese seven-stringed zither.
The Resident Associate Program presented its fifth season
of performing arts events, entertaining more than 32,000
people with programs ranging from the dance and music
of Mongolia to a concert by singer Eartha Kitt.

Thanks to television, radio, and magazines, the Smith-
sonian can be experienced from a comfortable armchair
as well as from a trip to the Mall. Four new “Smithson-
ian World” programs were produced during the year for
broadcast on public television stations. The audience for
each telecast of this Emmy-award-winning series numbers
more than fourteen million viewers. The short-feature se-
ries “Here at the Smithsonian” aired on more than 175
television stations nationwide. Building on the success of
“Radio Smithsonian,” planning began for an expanded
radio series designed to provide a broad picture of the
Institution. The pilot program produced this year was
roundly praised by public radio programmers. The Office
of Telecommunications, in cooperation with the Smith-
sonian Film, Television, and Radio Communications
Council, began production on a series of home videos
with topics based on the Institution’s collections and re-
search. For approximately seven million readers, the
monthly Smithsonian magazine was a window on the
many facets of the Institution’s activities. The bimonthly
Air & Space/Smithsonian reached a circulation of about
390,000.

To enable elementary and secondary school students to
enjoy the full benefits of the Institution as a center of
learning, Smithsonian offices and bureaus served as re-
sources for educators from throughout the country. The
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education is a point
f contact for teachers in the Washington, D.C., area

and nationwide; the office’s periodicals—Let’s Go to the
Smithsonian and Art to Zoo—brought the Smithsonian
to teachers by providing useful information about how to
use the Institution as an educational resource. The Na-
tional Air and Space Museum published Skyline, a quar-
terly newsletter for teachers.

The National Science Resources Center continued its
efforts to enhance science teaching in the nation’s elemen-
tary schools. This year the center formed a partnership
with a group of Washington, D.C., elementary schools to
test the hands-on science curriculum units being devel-
oped as part of the center’s Science and Technology for
Children Project.

More than 1,300 teachers visited the National Air and
Space Museum’s new Education Resource Center after its
opening in January. The center provides free and low-
cost educational materials about aviation and space,
including slide sets, computer programs, lesson plans,
curriculum packages, and audiovisual programs.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in collab-
oration with Harvard University, has developed curricu-
lum materials that will help secondary school teachers
use examples from astronomy to teach basic principles of
physics and mathematics. A group of high school teach-
ers attended a special summer institute this year to cri-
tique the curriculum materials and take them home for
field-testing.

Smithsonian programs for students often begin in the
classroom and continue in the museum. For more than
65,000 students, exhibitions at the National Museum of
Natural History came alive through classroom materials
and lesson tours. National Air and Space Museum educa-
tion staff visited Washington, D.C.—area schools to tell
the story of the contributions blacks have made to Ameri-
can aviation and to invite students to tour the museum.
A group of Hopi students in northeastern Arizona partic-
ipated in a special course taught by scientists from the
Conservation Analytical Laboratory, who used the meth-
ods and results of their research on Hopi pottery to illus-
trate principles of scientific research design. During the
summer, the students came to the laboratory for three
weeks of hands-on learning. For students in the Office of
Elementary and Secondary Education’s high school intern
program, the entire Institution was a “classroom” in
which they explored opportunities for museum careers.

Research

Research activity conducted under the auspices of the In-
stitution is carried out in many corners of the world. It

19
involves museum staff, fellows, and interns. Researchers
work to advance knowledge in such diverse fields as ani-
mal medicine, the history of American art, and the bio-
logical diversity of the tropical ecosystem. They seek new
frontiers in domains as vast as the unexplored galaxies
outside our universe and as minuscule as the painted sur-
faces of artistic masterpieces. The fruits of their efforts
find their way into our lives in immediate ways—through
exhibitions, programs, or publications—and in far-reach-
ing contributions to the expansion and enrichment of
knowledge.

On the heels of last year’s discovery of the brightest
exploding star that had been seen in more than 400
years, scientists from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Ob-
servatory this year obtained the first convincing evidence
for the existence of a planet outside our solar system.
They detected minute variations in the motion of a faint
Sun-like star, HD 114762, some ninety light-years from
Earth. The variations appear to be caused by the gravita-
tional attraction of a large, planetlike companion body in
orbit about the star. The planet’s probable size, its dis-
tance from HD 114762, and the likelihood that it has
ovenlike temperatures make it an unsuitable habitat for
life. But the discovery reinforces speculation that planets
do exist outside our galaxy and that some of them might
even support the development of life and the evolution of
intelligence.

At the National Zoological Park, groundbreaking
work in gamete research and embryo technology contin-
ued this year. Zoo researchers applied the successful in
vitro fertilization procedures they have developed for the
domestic cat to collaborative research with the state of
Florida on the highly endangered Florida panther. Scien-
tists have been able to recover puma eggs and achieve a
45 percent fertilization rate and the production of ten
cleaved embryos. The zoo also made significant advances
in endocrinology during 1988, as researchers used urine
analysis techniques to study aspects of reproductive phys-
iology in zoo species.

Scientists from the National Zoo returned this year to
the Poco das Antas Reserve in Brazil for further field
research under the Golden-Lion Tamarin Conservation
Program. Between 1984 and 1987, U.S. zoos have gradu-
ally reintroduced groups of captive-born tamarins into
the reserve, and researchers regularly spend time there to
monitor the animals’ progress. Some of the studies during
1988 addressed the population dynamics, reproductive cy-
cles, and demography of this endangered species.

Researchers at the Smithsonian Environmental Re-
search Center are measuring the impact of air pollution

20

on the vegetation and soil of the deciduous hardwood
forests in the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin. Using in-
struments set up in a tall tulip poplar forest, they are
studying the forest’s photosynthesis, respiration, and effi-
ciency at trapping polluting gases and fine particles.

In 1988 Environmental Research Center scientists con-
tinued to study the impact on natural plant communities
of the dramatic changes in atmospheric conditions pre-
dicted for early in the twenty-first century. They have
found that one of the plant species studied—Scirpus olne-—
yii—showed greater productivity when carbon dioxide
levels were elevated. This and other factors may limit the ©
impact of the “greenhouse effect” on the productivity of
wetlands areas.

At the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Pan-
ama, the rapid disappearance of lush tropical habitats
lends urgency to the work of Smithsonian scientists as
they seek to advance understanding of tropical nature
and its relationship to the global ecosystem. Tropical in-
sects play an important role in the life of the forest, yet
they are poorly known and difficult to study. Studies at
the institute this year involving cassidine beetles, fig-polli-
nating wasps, riodinid caterpillars, social wasps, and
male earwigs all contributed to knowledge of the vast
diversity of insect habits, which may in turn shed light on
the fundamental principles governing the evolution of so-
cial behavior.

Scientists at the institute are also exploring the circum-
stances and mechanisms of sexual selection, the impact of
seasonal variations in the Panamanian climate on the
physical environment and animal populations, the history
of human settlement in Panama, and the domestication
of wild pacas. The consequences of the 1986 Caribbean
oil spill at Galeta continue to be monitored and analyzed, -
as do the effects of a massive die-off of long-spined sea
urchins (Diadema) in 1983. Both calamities appear to
have contributed to a decline in the growth rate of coral
species; an expanded study of older coral will further ex-
amine why coral growth may have slowed.

Research at the National Air and Space Museum
ranges from the history of aviation technology to rocket
and space technology. Scientists in the Center for Earth
and Planetary Studies continued to use satellite remote
sensing to study desert regions of Earth and structural
land forms on Mars. Enhanced satellite images of dune
formations in Egypt, Botswana, and Mali, along with
fieldwork and samples taken in 1988, have given re-
searchers greater insight into how climatic changes affect
sand formations and the movement of sand.

Research on the administration and management of

large-scale projects in the space program is now in its
second year at the museum. Staff of the Glennan-Webb-
Seamans Project for Research in Space History, a project
of the Department of Space Science and Exploration, are
involved in archives preservation activities and oral his-
tory interviews.

The National Museum of Natural History, the nation’s
largest research museum, continued its long-term effort
to document and study rare and endangered plant and
animal species in the biologically diverse Amazonian
regions of Bolivia and Peru. The museum’s biodiversity
research involves international collaboration with the Bo-
livian and Peruvian governments, host country scientists
and students, and international conservation organiza-
tions, all of which have a common goal: to protect spe-
cies that may yield new sources of food, medicine,
biological controls, and important germ plasm for agri-
cultural use. This year the museum held workshops for
biologists from Bolivia, Peru, and Puerto Rico as a first
step toward training hundreds of biologists and con-
servationists to conduct species inventories in tropical
ecosystems.

Natural History Museum scientists—with colleagues
from the Charleston Museum in South Carolina—this
year discovered and identified the mostly preserved skele-
ton of an extinct flying seabird that lived 30 million years
ago. A member of the pseudodontorn, or “bony-toothed
bird,” family, the remarkable creature’s wingspan meas-
ured as much as eighteen feet, and it may have weighed
nearly ninety pounds. It is the largest pseudodontorn ever
identified.

Conservators, scientists, and engineers at the Conser-
vation Analytical Laboratory conduct specialized research
that is essential to the care and preservation of museum
objects. One of the laboratory’s new initiatives in con-
servation research—a program to study the effects of
cleaning solutions that conservators use to remove old
varnish—will have important implications for the conser-
ation of paintings. Together, conservators and scientists
are examining the effects of these cleaning solutions on
he paint layer. A photographic scientist began research
uring 1988 on the deterioration of glass collodion nega-
ive plates, which are extremely common in the Smith-
onian collection and in photographic collections
orldwide. As part of its archaeometric research pro-
ram, the laboratory is collaborating with the Carnegie
nstitute to examine archaeological bone for traces of an-
ient disease and for evidence of prehistoric diets and to
evelop a methodology of preparing samples for use in
arbon-14 dating.

The Smithsonian is the home of several projects that
involve the organization, documentation, and publication
of the papers of noted Americans. This year the staff of
the Joseph Henry Papers continued work on volume 6 of
the correspondence and private papers of the Smithsoni-
an’s first secretary. At the National Portrait Gallery, the
Peale Family Papers project published volume 2 of the
selected letters and documents of the artist and naturalist
Charles Willson Peale and his artist sons, Raphaelle,
Rembrandt, and Rubens.

To visitors, the Smithsonian Institution is a treasure
house of objects and ideas. To the hundreds of scholars
and students who have the singular opportunity to delve
beneath the surface of what visitors see, the Institution is
an even richer resource. Where else can one explore top-
ics as diverse as form, style, and symbolic content in Arc-
tic fur clothing; the history of public health in nineteenth-
century Washington, D.C.; fiber art as a manifestation of
the post-World War II crafts revival in the United States;
and rates of molecular evolution in marine gastropods?

This year approximately 800 undergraduate and grad-
uate students and scholars visited the Smithsonian under
the academic research programs administered by the Of-
fice of Fellowships and Grants. During long- and short-
term residential appointments, they worked in collabora-
tion with Smithsonian curators and scientists, conducted
research using the collections, and investigated potential
topics for their dissertation research. The office also of-
fered a number of workshops and internships, and its
short-term visitor program continued to be especially
popular with scholars from developing nations.

Two fellowships were awarded this year under the
newly established James Renwick Fellowship Program in
American Crafts, which supports research in the history
of twentieth-century American craft. Another program
introduced this year, the Research Resources Program,
awarded seven grants for archival projects designed to
organize important collections and make them available
to scholars.

Smithsonian-sponsored conferences, seminars, and
symposia are fertile ground for the exchange of knowl-
edge and ideas among scholars, students, professionals,
and members of the public. The Archives of American
Art sponsored three symposia in 1988, along with eight
informal seminars at which art historians and American
studies scholars discussed work in progress. A highlight
of the programs sponsored this year by the Office of In-
terdisciplinary Studies was “Afro-Americans and the Evo-
lution of a Living Constitution,” a symposium organized

21
for the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. Ancillary
activities included a workshop for teachers and a telecon-
ference carried on public radio and broadcast to thirty-
six colleges. The Office of Interdisciplinary Studies also
inaugurated “Ways of Knowing,” a forum to encourage
the flow of ideas among Smithsonian staff and fellows in
different disciplines and bureaus.

Smithsonian bureaus collaborated with educational in-
stitutions in degree-granting programs and presented pro-
fessional training courses of their own. The Conservation
Analytical Laboratory, for example, completed the first
year of its joint doctoral program with the Johns Hop-
kins University to train conservation scientists. The first
class in the laboratory’s three-year Furniture Conserva-
tion Training Program completed its second year. In
cooperation with the Parsons/New School, the Cooper-
Hewitt Museum continued to offer a master’s-level train-
ing program in the decorative arts.

Smithsonian staff, researchers from outside the Institu-
tion, and members of the public can gain access to Smith-
sonian resources with the assistance of various offices.
Staff in the fifteen branches of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion Libraries answered more than 75,000 reference in-
quiries in 1988 and circulated nearly 67,000 volumes to
borrowers. At the Smithsonian Institution Archives, there
were nearly 1,400 inquiries, and the staff provided almost
6,000 items and 25,000 copies to researchers. Visitor In-
formation and Associates’ Reception Center volunteers
handled some 55,000 pieces of mail requesting general
information and reference assistance. Thirty-five hundred
research visits were made to the six regional centers of
the Archives of American Art in 1988.

Collections

At the heart of every museum are its collections. Smith-
sonian museums are especially rich in objects of art, his-
tory, and science that together preserve and present the
complexity of our cultural and natural heritage. The In-
stitution’s collections are far from static. Each year,
through gifts, bequests, purchases, and transfers from
other government entities, thousands of objects are added
to the collections held in trust for the public.

The National Museum of American Art’s 1988 acquisi-
tions included an important 1932 painting by Marsden
Hartley, Yliaster (Paracelsus); Thomas Cole’s The Pil-
grim of the World at the End of His Journey, ca. 1846-
48; and John Trumbull’s The Misses Mary and Hannah
Murray, 1806. Among the significant acquisitions by the

22

National Portrait Gallery were a Gilbert Stuart portrait
of the American statesman Rufus King, Marguerite Zo-
rach’s portrait of Marianne Moore and her mother, and
Thomas Hicks’s portrait of Edward Hicks, painter of
The Peaceable Kingdom.

The permanent collection of the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden was enriched by seven major
works from the estate of Marion L. Ring, the most sig-
nificant such gift the museum has received from a donor
other than Joseph H. Hirshhorn. An important acquisi-
tion for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum was a group of
1,488 sheets representing more than 250 textile and wall-
covering patterns by more than fifty designers affiliated
with the Wiener Werkstatte during the early twentieth
century.

Among the twenty-two works added to the permanent
collection of the National Museum of African Art were a
rare Yoruba staff and a unique Hongwe reliquary guard-
ian figure. The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery enhanced its
collections with several significant acquisitions, including
an important pair of Japanese six-panel folding screens
by an anonymous artist of the early seventeenth century.
The Freer Gallery of Art acquired a pair of illustrated
narrative handscrolls by a seventeenth—century Japanese
painter, along with other works for the museum’s Japa-
nese, Near Eastern, and Chinese collections.

More than 6,000 musical documents and artifacts that
belonged to bandleader Duke Ellington were added to
the multifaceted collections of the National Museum of
American History. Among other objects, the museum
also acquired an antique Torah mantle dating to 1786,
300 seldom-seen photographs of inventor Thomas Edison
and his family, and a 1784 copper dollar, one of the first
coins in the nation’s monetary system.

The National Air and Space Museum added to its col-
lections a rare example of the Junkers-Ju 52/3m three-
engined transport aircraft from the 1930s, the first widely
used European commercial transport airplane. The mu-
seum also acquired a Lockheed Super Constellation, fre-
quently used in the 1950s by commercial airlines for
transatlantic flights.

A noteworthy addition to the collections of the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History was an unmounted
5.03-carat round-cut red diamond. Now on display in the
Gem Hall, the diamond is the only one of its kind on
view in a museum anywhere in the world. From the fam-
ily of collector William Bledsoe, the museum also re-
ceived an unusually rich collection of 9,000 seashells,
which are valuable both for their beauty and for their
research significance.

Two Komodo dragon lizards, the only ones of their

significant milestone in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy was the detection by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

scientists and their collaborators, using this ro-meter-diameter gamma-ray detector, at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, of
zamma rays from the Crab Nebula that establishes a standard “candle,” against which to search for and measure other, weaker

sources in the sky. (Photograph by James Cornell)

ind in a U.S. zoo, were a gift from the people of Indo-
esia to the National Zoological Park. A highlight of the
zoo’s new Invertebrate Exhibit, ten giant Japanese spider
tabs, were also acquired this year. Nearly 1,000 births
and hatchings during the year bolstered the zoo’s stocks
of threatened and endangered species. Among the new-
dorns were a giraffe, orangutan, sandhill crane, Guam
ail, smoky jungle frog, and Dumerils ground boa, as

well as octopus and several clouded leopards and Pere
David’s deer.

The Smithsonian Institution Libraries purchased one of
the rarest eighteenth-century books on the history of pap-
ermaking, Versuche und Muster ohne alle Lumpen oder
doch mit einem qeringen Zusatze derselben Papier zu
machen, by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. The library also
received the collection of Ladislas Segy, who operated

23
one of the first African art galleries in New York City.

The papers of herpetologist George W. Nace of the
University of Michigan formed one of the largest of the
nearly 200 groups of records accessioned by the Smith-
sonian Institution Archives this year. The 180 collections
added to the holdings of the Archives of American Art
included the papers of painter and writer Walter Pach,
which are a valuable source of information on early
twentieth-century modernism.

Implicit in the act of collecting is the organization and
care of the objects that have been collected. In a collabo-
rative effort by the Office of Information Resource Man-
agement, the Office of the Registrar, and bureau
representatives, work continued this year on the Institu-
tion-wide Collections Information System, which now
contains approximately one million records. Staff began
to transfer information on the collections of the National
Museum of American Art and continued to transfer data
on the vast collections of the National Museum of Natu-
ral History.

Working with bureau staff, the Office of the Registrar
reviewed and revised Office Memorandum 808: Collec-
tions Management, which discusses the issues of, author-
ity for, and responsibility for the care and use of the
nation’s collections. At the National Museum of Ameri-
can History, the Computer Services Center developed a
local collections management system that meets both cu-
ratorial and registrarial needs and began a museumwide
analysis of potential computer applications in the areas of
collections management, public programs, and research.

Helping the Institution function smoothly in its several
spheres is a complex network of administrative and sup-
port offices. These fifteen offices and their divisions serve
a range of functions, some highly visible to the public,
some less apparent, but all essential.

As the year ended, three major construction projects
were completed under the direction of the Office of
Design and Construction: the National Air and Space
Museum restaurants, the Mathias Laboratory at the
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and the
Smithsonian Child Care Center (which opened in fiscal
year 1989). Construction began on the Smithsonian Infor-
mation Center in the Castle, a dining and conference cen-
ter at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and
the Freer Gallery of Art renovation.

Administrative offices served Smithsonian staff and
bureaus in a number of ways. The Office of Information
Resource Management opened a Help Desk for computer

24

users and developed an integrated telecommunications
system that joins more than 300 personal computers ina
network with the central computing facility. The Office

of Protection Services was involved in a record thirty-

four escorts for valuable objects in transit between the
Smithsonian and other museums and institutions in this
country and abroad. There was renewed emphasis on af-
firmative action by the Office of Equal Opportunity, and
the representation of minorities and women in profes-
sional and administrative positions continued to improve.

A complex institution like the Smithsonian must engage
in continuing self-assessment and careful thinking about
the future if it is to serve its public effectively while meet-
ing its obligations to preserve its collections and advance
knowledge. A forward-thinking attitude permeated a
number of Smithsonian bureaus this year.

The Freer Gallery of Art closed its doors in September
1988 to begin a major renovation and restoration project
that will revitalize the museum for the next century.
When work is completed, the Freer and the Sackler Gal-
lery will be linked underground and there will be im-
proved access for disabled visitors. Conservation and
technical research space will be triple its previous size,
and collections storage space will have grown by more
than 70 percent. The main-level galleries will have new
artificial lighting to enhance the existing artificial light,
and replacement glass ceilings will have been installed.
All of these interior and exterior repairs and improve-
ments will maintain the architectural integrity of the ele-
gant 1923 building, which is listed in the National
Register of Historic Places.

Looking to its future, the Anacostia Museum adopted
a collections management policy statement that focuses
the museum’s collecting activity on black history. The
statement, along with new acquisition, accession, and in-
ventory procedures, will ensure a sense of purpose and
organization as the museum’s collections grow.

The Smithsonian Institution Archives began a decade
of modernization this year with internal program re-
views, an assessment of automation alternatives, and a
conservation study.

Smithsonian Institution Press established a new divi-
sion that is exploring projects that use interactive educa-
tional technologies. The Press also began planning for an
electronic publishing venture that will make Smithsonian
resource data bases widely accessible to libraries, research
institutions, and individual scholars.

In another future-oriented effort, Smithsonian Project
Discovery continued planning for a new multimedia cur-

riculum on the history of ideas of the twentieth century.
The project will integrate television dramas and docu-
mentaries, books, learning guides, and interactive video-
discs.

Staff Changes

During the last year the Smithsonian lost several particu-
larly outstanding members of its top staff. After more
than eleven years of dedicated and meritorious service as
the Institution’s Director of Development, our good friend
James McKim Symington retired in November to pursue
other interests. We were equally surprised and disap-
pointed to receive the resignation of Charles C. Eldredge
who had served with distinction as the Director of the
National Museum of American Art. He has returned to
an endowed professorship at the University of Kansas,
whence he came just six years ago. Other job moves
among the top staff included the retirement of Elbridge
O. Hurlbut from the directorship of the Contracts Office
and the resignation of Richard Murray as Director of the
Archives of American Art to pursue scholarly enterprises
in the National Museum of American Art.
At the same time we have been successful in attracting

a distinguished cadre of energetic personnel to fill a vari-
ety of important positions. Thomas McCance, Jr., for-
merly Director of the Yale Alumni Fund, has come on
board as the Smithsonian’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for
External Affairs/ Director of Development, and Alice
Green Burnette, formerly Executive Assistant to the Presi-
dent of Howard University, has joined us as Deputy
Assistant Secretary for External Affairs/Coordinator for
Institutional Advancement. Other major appointments in-
cluded Anna Cohn as the Director of the Smithsonian
Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, Paul B. Johnson
as the Director of the Office of Telecommunications, and
Vincent J. Marcalus, formerly of the Veterans Adminis-
ration, as the new Director of the Office of Information
Resources Management. As the year drew to a close we
were able to confirm the appointments of Frank H.
‘ (Executive Director of the California Academy of
ciences) as the Director of the National Museum of Nat-
aral History and Dianne H. Pilgrim (Chairman of the
Department of Decorative Arts at the Brooklyn Museum)
is the Director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, both of

hom will assume their new positions early in the next
iscal year. And, finally, we were pleased to welcome
ack into the Smithsonian family Charles Blitzer (at one
ime the Smithsonian’s Assistant Secretary for History

and Art, and more recently the Director of the National
Humanities Center) as the Director of the Woodrow Wil-
son International Center for Scholars.

This year, as in many previous ones, this host of un-
predictable transitions in leadership has served to remind
us, just as the new staffers take hold, that the work of
the Institution continues to depend in large measure on
the kind of dedication and insight for which Smithsonian
staff of every stripe have deservedly earned widespread
recognition.

Report of the Board of Regents

At the Regents’ meeting on February 1, 1988, the Execu-
tive Committee reported that in mid-October it acted on
behalf of the Board in naming the small pool within the
sculpture garden of the Hirshhorn Museum in honor of
Mrs. Charlotte Lehrman in recognition of a major dona-
tion from the Lehrman Foundation. In mid-November
the Executive Committee also approved, on behalf of the
Board, the establishment of three financial reserves to
facilitate the closing of the books for fiscal year 1987
funds and to provide necessary financial flexibility in the
face of several significant pending transactions. The Au-
dit and Review Committee reported on its review of the
procurement and installation of storage equipment at the
Museum Support Center, approaches and outlets for re-
search at the National Museum of American History,
and preliminary discussions of a proposed policy on the
periodic rotation of the Institution’s independent audi-
tors. The Personnel Committee reported that it had re-
viewed the financial interests statements of the executive
staff of the Institution and had found no conflict of inter-
est whatsoever. The Investment Policy Committee met
and reported that it had met with the managers of the
Smithsonian’s endowment portfolio and had monitored
their performance. In addition, the Committee met spe-
cially to discuss asset strategy in the wake of broad
changes in the stock market.

Mr. Adams indicated to the Board that he was consid-
ering the Cultural Education Committee’s recommenda-
tions to redress the dearth of minorities in the professional
and senior management areas of the Smithsonian, and he
noted that concentrated efforts recently made to bring
minority personnel into professional positions had
brought forward an encouraging number of candidates.
Emphasizing that the Smithsonian is dealing with more
than one facet of affirmative action, Mr. Adams noted
that the Smithsonian has been asked for and will lend
assistance in studying the feasibility of establishing an
Afro-American museum in Washington.

In other reports, Mr. Adams discussed the federal and
Trust Fund budgets in terms of results of fiscal year 1987,
provisions for fiscal year 1988, and requests for fiscal
year 1989; he brought forward a draft of the Five-Year
Prospectus, 1989-1993 for the Regents’ consideration; and
he outlined a policy on establishing priorities in the resto-
ration and renovation of buildings and in major construc-
tion projects. Following Mr. Adams’s presentations, Drs.
Robert S. Hoffmann and Thomas E. Lovejoy spoke to
the Regents about their perspectives on assuming their
new positions as Assistant Secretary for Research and As-
sistant Secretary for External Affairs, respectively.

26

After the Secretary described the new vision that he
and Dr. Martin O. Harwit, the new director of the Na-
tional Air and Space Museum, had developed for the ex-
tension of that museum at a nearby airport, the Board of
Regents encouraged the Secretary to proceed with a plan-
ning study consistent with that program. The Regents
also reaffirmed their earlier presumptive support for the
use of a site at Washington-Dulles International Airport,
recognizing, however, that no final commitment regard-
ing a site could be made at least until all of the program,
financial, and site studies have been completed. In an
ensuing discussion, the Secretary briefed the Board on
developments with respect to the Museum of the Ameri-
can Indian and he received guidance from the Board that |
would be of importance in future deliberations with other
interested parties. Among other actions, the Regents
named the expanded laboratory at the Smithsonian Envi- |
ronmental Research Center in honor of former Senator
Charles McC. Mathias and appointed Wanda M. Corn,
Ronald Abramson, Barney Ebsworth, Patricia Frost, and
Melvin Lenkin, and reappointed Wendell Castle, Sharon
Percy Rockefeller, and Margaret Dodge Garrett to the
Commission of the National Museum of American Art.
The Regents also received status reports on a wide range
of significant Smithsonian activities.

On the preceding evening, Sunday, January 31, 1988,
the traditional Regents’ dinner was held in the National
Air and Space Museum in honor of Dr. David Challinor,
the outgoing Assistant Secretary for Research. After din-
ner the Secretary rose to welcome the guests and to speak
briefly about the new vision that Dr. Harwit has brought
to the Air and Space Museum. The Chancellor paid
honor to Dr. Challinor and presented him with the
Henry Medal, as approved by the Board of Regents, |
along with a citation that had been prepared in hand-
some calligraphy.

The Regents’ second meeting of the year was called to
order in the Regents’ Room on Monday, May 9. The
Executive Committee reported that, on April 14, its
chairman, Mr. Carlisle Humelsine, had issued a public
statement endorsing the position that the Secretary had
taken in the media with respect to amendments to S.
1722, legislation introduced to provide facilities for the
Museum of the American Indian in New York and Wash-
ington. The Executive Committee expressed concern that
the revised legislation would establish a museum on the
Mall without ensuring that it would have responsibility
for substantial permanent collections. Also concerned
that authorities proposed for the museum’s Board of
Trustees would violate the Smithsonian’s Charter and

cripple its management, the Executive Committee urged
the Senate Rules Committee to act cautiously and ensure
that the interests of both the Institution and the American
Indian people are well served.

Concluding its deliberations on the proposal to estab-
lish a policy of periodic rotation of the independent audi-
tors to introduce into the auditor relationship a degree of
competition and assurance of objectivity, the Audit and
Review Committee recommended, and the Regents
agreed, that the Smithsonian should issue a Request for
Proposals and select the most highly qualified firm to
conduct the annual audits for the next ten years, with the
understanding that the present independent auditors not
be excluded and that the contract with the successful re-
pondent be completed in time for work on the audit of
iscal year 1989 financial statements and records. The
Audit and Review Committee also reported that it had
eviewed research currently being conducted in the
ational Air and Space Museum, had received a “clean
pinion” from Coopers and Lybrand on its audit of the
mithsonian’s financial statements for fiscal year 1987,
ad received an annual report from the Smithsonian’s Of-
ice of Audits and Investigations, and had conducted a
reliminary discussion of certain financial and adminis-
rative practices. The Investment Policy Committee re-
ae that it had established minimum levels for fixed
ncome and equity holdings for the total endowment
dortfolio, and the Board of Regents approved the Com-
nittee’s recommended 3.5 percent increase in the total in-
some return for fiscal year 1989.

The Secretary and his staff briefed the Regents on cur-
ent year funding, and in that context the Regents ap-
roved the establishment of quasi endowments from the
equests of Joseph H. Hirshhorn and Charles H. Ettl.

r. Adams also informed the Board about the status of
ir & Space Magazine, the concept of enhancing Smith-
onian resources for activities abroad through “debt
swap, and the receipt of donations of blocked foreign
urrencies, various legislative actions and issues, and the
onsiderable efforts of the Smithsonian’s bureaus and of-
ices to comprehensively take into account Afro-Ameri-
an interests with regard to programming. The Secretary
Iso presented to the Regents his annual report, Smith-
onian Year 1987, which was accepted with enthusiasm.
dditional reports included those on National Air and
pace Museum extension planning, the status of the
ropical Research Institute in the Panamanian situation,
ffirmative action initiatives, and ten additional status re-
orts on a wide variety of topics.

The Secretary reported on developments with respect

to the Museum of the American Indian since the last
meeting of the Board. Following a lengthy discussion,
which Senator Daniel Inouye joined, the Regents author-
ized the Secretary to continue negotiations with the
Chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs to-
ward further revision of $. 1722, and the Regents also
asked their Executive Committee to make recommenda-
tions to the Board in regard to the proposed legislation.

The Regents’ dinner was held on the previous evening
in the Arts and Industries Building. After welcoming the
Regents and their guests, including the members of the
Cultural Education Committee and the Committee for a
Wider Audience, and speaking briefly about the origins
and establishment of these committees and their impor-
tance to the Institution, he explained the concepts of
“representation” and “cultural equity” and expressed con-
fidence that the Smithsonian will move sensitively in
these areas. Mrs. Jeannine Smith Clark, founding co-
chairman of the Cultural Education Committee, rose to
introduce Mr. Richard West, another founding member
of the Cultural Education Committee, who focused on
the recommendations of the Committee toward enhanc-
ing the Smithsonian’s affirmative action program and
spoke candidly about areas in which substantive improve-
ments are needed.

The Regents’ third formal meeting of the year was held
on September 19, 1988. In anticipation of his retirement
from the Congress, the Board designated Congressman
Edward P. Boland as a Regent Emeritus. The Regents
also accepted with regret the resignation of Dr. Murray
Gell-Mann as a member of the Board and gave prelimi-
nary consideration to a proposal to amend their Bylaws
to include a nominating committee as a standing commit-
tee. The Audit and Review Committee reported on its
review of Coopers and Lybrand’s plan for their consoli-
dated audit of fiscal year 1988 funds, its further discus-
sion of weaknesses in certain administrative and financial
practices, its tour of the new Veterinary Hospital at the
National Zoological Park, its review of a conceptual
study of an extension of the National Air and Space Mu-
seum, and its discussion of the competitive bidding pro-
cess for the Institution’s independent auditor. The
Investment Policy Committee noted that the endowment’s
asset allocation had been adjusted in accordance with the
Regents’ mandate. With the approval of the Board, the
Chancellor appointed Congressman Mineta as a member
of the Investment Policy Committee.

Mr. Adams reported on actions being taken to manage
properly the lands of the Environmental Research Center
in Edgewater, Maryland, in keeping with its research

27
mandate, and Mr. Lovejoy discussed the major new de-
velopment initiatives. The Secretary added his hope that
the Smithsonian would have an important role in the de-
velopment of a national center for biological diversity be-
cause of Institution’s significant research in the natural
sciences. The Regents were briefed on the status of the
Smithsonian’s contract for the sale of its former Museum
of African Art properties on Capitol Hill.

After receiving reports on the current year funds, the
Regents approved expenditures in keeping with budgets
for fiscal year 1989 and authorized the Institution’s re-
quest to the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal
year 1990 appropriations. The Regents also gave prelimi-
nary consideration to a draft of the Five-Year Prospectus
for Fiscal Years 1990-1994. Brief reports were prepared
for the Regents’ information and discussion on legislative
initiatives, major development projects, Afro-American
museum possibilities, and progress in affirmative action.

The Regents noted that recently revised legislation on
the National Museum of the American Indian represents
an enormous step forward in discussion and takes into
account Smithsonian concerns over governance and cus-
tody of the collections but needs still further revision to
address a few serious difficulties. Accordingly, the Re-
gents agreed that the Secretary should continue to work
with Senator Inouye toward an acceptable bili and in-
form the Executive Committee of any impending action.

Introducing the conceptual study of an extension of the
National Air and Space Museum, Mr. Adams com-
mented that it serves as an increasingly persuasive intel-
lectual justification for further studies toward its
realization. In discussion, the Board acknowledged, as
had the Audit and Review Committee at its September 14
meeting, that over the years the Regents had expressed
(and may continue to hold) a preference for the site at
Dulles airport, but it would be in the best interest of the
project to determine what material conditions might ac-
company offers from both Baltimore- Washington Inter-
national and Dulles International airports. The Board
authorized further studies to include the most appropriate
location for the extension, an element-by-element pro-
gram of detailed space requirements, forecasts of visita-
tion, an identification and evaluation of alternative
means of visitor transportation, and an analysis of finan-
cial feasibility.

Responding to recommendations from the respective
commissions, the Regents voted to reappoint Robert F.
Thompson and the Honorable Walter E. Washington
and to appoint Charles B. Benenson, the Honorable John
Conyers, Jr., Helen Kuhn, and James L. Hudson to the

28

Commission of the National Museum of African Art, and
they voted to appoint Jeannine S. Clark to the Commis-
sion of the National Portrait Gallery. After voting to
name the special exhibitions gallery of the National Mu- |
seum of American History in honor of that museum’s ,
founding director, Frank A. Taylor, the Board of Regents
received and discussed a dozen reports on the status of
various Smithsonian activities.

At the Regents’ Dinner held in the National Air and
Space Museum on the preceding evening, the Chancellor
hailed the opening of the museum’s new restaurant on the
previous day and the Regents and their guests were given ~
a short presentation on the recently installed exhibition
on the European Space Agency’s Giotto spacecraft. Dr.
Harwit explained that the Giotto had made unprece-
dented close observations of Halley’s comet in 1986 and
confirmed the hypotheses postulated in 1951 by former
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory director Fred L.
Whipple. Dr. Whipple in turn offered commentary on a
videotape that showed close-up views of the comet’s core —
as recorded by the Giotto mission. Upon the conclusion
of this brief program, the guests walked through buffet
lines and were seated for dinner in the “Flight Line”
cafeteria.

Benefactors

The Smithsonian gratefully acknowledges the support of
the individuals, foundations, and corporations listed be-
low, whose gifts, bequests, and contributing member-
ships aided the work of the Institution during the past
fiscal year.

The Smithsonian owes its founding to the generosity of
one individual. During most of its history since 1846, the
nstitution has relied upon a combination of both federal
and trust funding to carry out the terms of James Smith-
on’s will. As a trust instrumentality of the United States,
he Smithsonian has received federal appropriations for
esearch, exhibition of the national collections, and main-
enance of the valuable objects of science, history, and
ulture entrusted to it.

The trust funds have been equally important, providing
he Smithsonian with the flexibility and independence es-
ential to its innovative growth. Such nonfederal funds
raditionally have made possible many of the research,
cquisition, and educational programs central to the In-
titution’s achievements.

Certain donors have requested anonymity. If the name
of any other donor has been omitted, it is unintentional
and in no way lessens the Smithsonian’s appreciation.

Donors of In-Kind Support

In addition to the financial support of individuals, foun-
dations, and corporations listed above, the Smithsonian
Institution acknowledges in the following list our Fiscal
Year 1988 donors of in-kind gifts. Ranging from equip-
ment for office or program use to pro bono professional
consulting services, such in-kind gifts contribute greatly
to the success of research and educational programs as
well as to the efficient administration of the Institution.

Donors of volunteer service further enable the Smith-
sonian to accomplish a variety of programs and to offer
expanded services to the public. The names of our do-
cents and behind-the-scenes volunteers are listed annually
in “The Torch.” In Fiscal Year 1988, 5,763 volunteers
gave 485,084 hours of their time, which is conservatively
estimated at a value of more than $6.7 million. This in-
valuable corps of volunteers brings expertise, experience,
and enthusiasm to their work here, and we express to
them collectively our great appreciation for their dedica-
tion to the Smithsonian Institution.

It is with special appreciation that we remember and ac-
knowledge those friends who made gifts by will and thus
continue the legacy of James Smithson, our founder.

Unrestricted gifts become part of the Bequest Endow-
ment Fund. The principal of this fund is maintained in
perpetuity, while the income supports acquisitions, exhi-
bitions, scholarly studies, educational outreach, and
other functions of the Smithsonian. Some gifts are desig-
nated for a special purpose by the donor.

Financial Report

Ann R. Leven, Treasurer

For the fiscal year ending September 30, 1988, federal
appropriations provided $201,432,000 to fund ongoing
operations. This was a most welcome increase of
$12,459,000 or almost 7 percent over fiscal year 1987. A
meager $118,000, less than one-tenth of one percent of
the year’s appropriation, was returned to the Treasury at
year end, representing uncommitted salaries and ex-
penses.

The year, however, was somewhat more chaotic with
respect to nonappropriated funds. Black Monday her-
alded fiscal year 1988. By year end, the Institution’s en-
dowment had rebounded to within $13,292,000 of its
market value as of September 30, 1987. While the volatil-
ity of common stock prices within the endowment port-
folio had no immediate effect on spendable income, the
Institution was reminded of the fragility of this vital re-
source and heartened by donors’ confidence during this
period; $14,700,000 in new endowment monies were
added to the fund.

Of special interest and more immediate impact to our
visiting public was the opening of the new National Air
and Space Restaurant on September 17, 1988. This addi-
tion to the Smithsonian’s most popular museum offers a
cafeteria and a full service restaurant with combined seat-
ing for nearly a thousand patrons. Visitor response and
press reviews have praised both the architecture and the
food service at this much-needed facility.

Operations

The Institution’s mix of federal appropriations, govern-
ment grants and contracts, and trust funds continued to
provide a firm financial base for operations. Federal dol-
lars are the principal source of funding for the Institu-
tion’s research, exhibition, education, and collections
management programs, as well as related administrative
services. Thanks to the deeply appreciated support of
Congress, appropriated funds were sufficient to allow for
continuation and selective enhancement of these program
areas. New initiatives included staffing and equipping the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s new Tupper
Center in Panama, development of instrumentation for
submillimeter wave astronomy, planning for reinstalla-
tion of the National Museum of Natural History’s Ameri-
can Indian halls, and preparations for commemorating
the Columbus Quincentenary.

Government agencies and bureaus, utilizing project
grants and contracts issued to the Smithsonian, offered
n important additional source of research funding, par-

ticularly for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
and the National Museum of Natural History/ National
Museum of Man. Funded projects included development
work on stellar interferometers, an instrument used for
making measurements used in astronomy and of special
interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration; a study of tropical ecosystems in Bolivia; and a
research effort to determine acidity levels in rivers and
the resulting effect on fish.

Trust funds—that is nonappropriated income from
gifts, grants, endowments including the original Smithson
bequest of 1826, current investments, and revenue-
producing activities—provide the Institution supplemen-
tal base support as well as that extra margin for experi-
mentation and bold initiatives. Such support is a
relatively recent phenomenon at the Smithsonian that be-
gan in the 1970s. The Smithsonian is especially grateful
to its many friends—individuals, foundations, and corpo-
rations listed in the section “Benefactors of the Smithson-
ian Institution in 1988”—whose generosity contributed
so importantly to our work. During the fiscal year, the
Institution took significant steps to enhance its develop-
ment activities under the newly appointed Assistant Sec-
retary for External Affairs, Dr. Thomas J. Lovejoy. This
action is especially timely as the year saw a 13 percent
drop in restricted gifts and grants designated for operat-
ing purposes. It remains unclear at this writing whether
uncertainties over the stock market, changes in the tax
laws or the lack of appeal of certain projects for which
funds were solicited caused the decrease. Whatever the
reason, the availability of unrestricted monies generated
by the Institution’s revenue-producing activities proved
key to trust fund stability.

Available unrestricted trust funds were allocated to in-
stitution-wide priorities including $1,883,000 for acquisi-

35
tions, $3,160,000 for special exhibitions, $2,949,000 for
fellowships, $2,950,000 for scholarly research, and
$550,000 for educational outreach. Translated into spe-
cifics, trust funds purchased a painting for $600,000 enti-
tled Yliaster by Mardsen Hartley for the National
Museum of American Art, an 1839 portrait of Edward
Hicks by Thomas Hicks for $371,250 for the National
Portrait Gallery, and a painting for $360,000 by Phillip
Guston done in 1976, entitled Ancient Wall for the Hirsh-
horn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Funded exhibitions
include “Women in the Progressive Era” at the National
Museum of American History, “Beyond the Java Sea” at
the National Museum of Natural History, and “Photog-
raphy of Invention” at the National Museum of Ameri-
can Art. As well, 332 interns, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scholars studied at the
Smithsonian with Institutional support.

In addition, an amount of $3,000,000 in trust revenue
was transferred to endowment in keeping with the prac-
tice of recent years aimed at strengthening this important
asset. Trust fund income was sufficient to increase the
unrestricted trust fund balance by $3,860,000 to a total
of $9,036,000. The Institution is attempting to raise the
fund balance to a level of 5 percent of gross revenues over
time. This goal is in recognition of ever-increasing finan-

cial uncertainties within the financial markets and tax
changes under discussion in Congress, which could im-
pact the Institution’s revenue-generating activities.

These activities include the Associates membership pro-
grams, Museum Shops, Mail Order, and the Smithsonian
Press. All are publicly appealing outreach activities tied
very closely to the Institution’s mission “the increase and
diffusion of knowledge.” Sales desks in fact were estab-
lished at the Smithsonian as far back as the 1860s. Mu-
seum Shops carry guides to the collections, related books
and educational materials, and adaptations of museum
objects for the visitor to enjoy and carry home. Smithson-
ian Magazine and Air and Space Magazine along with
the Mail Order catalogue bring the museum experience
into the homes of members across the country and in
foreign countries who cannot visit the Mall.

Business Management Office

Four revenue-producing activities report directly to the
Treasurer—Museum Shops, Mail Order, Product Devel-
opment and Licensing, and Concessions. Clearly, the |
highlight of the year was the opening of the new restau-
rant at the National Air and Space Museum. Food service
there is provided by Guest Sevices, Incorporated, under a
contract with the Smithsonian. Early indications portend
a highly successful operation.

This success results from the hard work and dedication
of Smithsonian staff and the cooperation of numerous
contractors. The Smithsonian Office of Design and Con-
struction, in conjunction with the Office of Procurement
and Property Management, worked long and hard to
bring the project in on time and under budget. Special
thanks are due to Robert Perkins, procurement officer,
and Thomas Myers, project manager. The Riggs Na-
tional Bank provided eleven million dollars in unsecured
construction financing for the project supplemented by
Institutional working capital. Total construction costs
were $14.4 million. The loan will be repaid from conces-
sions revenue. Thus, no federal funds were required or
will be requested to provide the public with greatly ex-
panded and improved food service. The restaurant was
designed by Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum; Charles
H. Tompkins was the general contractor.

The cooperation of the National Air and Space Mu-
'seum staff was critical to the project. Claudia Oakes,
‘Chairman, Department of Aeronautics, was a devoted
and key member of the project team from its inception.
Although the Treasurer and the Business Manager, James
J. Chmelik, initiated the restaurant project, credit goes to
Roland Banscher, Concessions Manager, for his unstint-
ing effort and full commitment to making the seemingly
impossible possible.

Clearly, the new National Air and Space Restaurant
dominated business management activities during 1988.
However, such singlemindedness of purpose was only
possible given the strong leadeship of Samuel J. Green-
= Director of the Museum Shops; John Giesecke, the
ew Director, Mail Order, and Lisa Stevenson, Director
of Product Development and Licensing. These capable
managers and their staffs exceeded performance objec-
tives. John Giesecke joined the Smithsonian in November
1987, following many years with Neiman-Marcus; we
welcome his new insights to our operations.

Construction and Plant Funds

Each year in addition to an appropriation for salaries and
other operating expenses, the Institution receives appro-
oriations in support of the restoration and renovation of
ts facilities. In fiscal 1988, $19,254,000 was appropriated
‘or these purposes. Projects funded included work on fire
detection and suppression systems, utilities, facade resto-
‘ation and replacement, and routine repairs.

}

Appropriations for new construction provided
$1,315,000 for design, roadwork, and site preparation for
the Whipple Observatory base camp in Arizona. A sepa-
rate federal appropriation of $8,150,000 was specifically
for renovation of an existing building at the National
Zoological Park into a modern research facility and hos-
pital. The Earl S. Tupper Research and Conference Cen-
ter at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, jointly
funded by Congress and a generous gift from the Tupper
family, nears completion.

Endowment

The Smithsonian endowment fund was valued at
$220,829,000 on September 30, 1988. This represents a
decline of 8.8 percent from the same date last year. The
recovery from October 19, 1987 (“Black Monday”), has
been an arduous one, but the Smithsonian endowment
has in fact outperformed the market indices for the fiscal
year (Standard and Poors, —12.4 percent; Dow Jones In-
dustrial Average, —15.5 pecent; South Africa Free —12.2
percent).

The Investment Policy Committee of the Board of Re-
gents, chaired by Regent Barnabas McHenry, with mem-
bers Regent Carlisle H. Humelsine, Donald Moriarty,
Charles H. Mott, William R. Salomon, Thomas J. Wat-
son, and Jane Mack Gould focused on asset allocation in
order to maintain an appropriate level of diversification
within the portfolio and to protect it against futher sud-
den fluctuations in equity values. Cambridge Associates
was asked to assist the committee in developing new
portfolio guidelines for the Institution’s investment
advisors.

At its April 1988 meeting, the Investment Policy Com-
mittee voted unanimously to mandate a minimum of 25
percent in fixed-income investments and 45 percent in eq-
uities as opposed to the Institution’s historical equity ori-
entation. The Institution’s balanced managers, Fiduciary
Trust Company of New York, and Miller, Anderson and
Sherrerd, have complied with this guidance from the
Committee. The Smithsonian’s equity managers, Battery-
march Financial Management and Nova Advisors were
not affected by the policy change.

The Committee was notified at its Fall 1988 meeting
that Nova Advisors was withdrawing as one of the Insti-
tution’s outside managers. Assets under Nova manage-
ment were redeployed to the other advisors. The
Smithsonian portfolio had the following asset mix as of
September 30, 1988: 61 percent equities, 25 percent fixed

37
income, and 14 percent cash or cash equivalents. The
portfolio is “South Africa-free.”

Just over $14.7 million in new monies were added to
the endowment this fiscal year. This sum includes trans-
fers of $4.3 million from unrestricted funds, a gift of $2.8
million from the estate of Joseph H. Hirshhorn, a gift of
$5.0 million from the Holenia Trust, a gift from the es-
tate of Charles Ettl of $.8 million, and $1.3 million from
the sale of works of art deaccessioned by the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden following covenants of its
Board of Trustees.

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to
investment management of its consolidated endowment
funds. Income available for current expenditures is based
upon the calculation of the five-year average of the mar-
ket value of each fund. As to the use of principal, 40
percent of the funds is restricted; 60 percent is unres-
tricted. Of the resulting income 54 percent is restricted as
to purpose; 46 percent is unrestricted.

Financial Management Activities

The focus for the year was improving financial systems
within the Treasurer’s Office. In addition to systems 1m-
plemented, the groundwork was laid for significant
changes to the Smithsonian’s accounting system. The pro-
gress to date results from the coordination and coopera-
tion of the Office of Accounting and Financial Services,
the Office of Financial Management and Planning, and
the Office of Risk Management. These offices, which re-
port to the Treasurer, are jointly responsible for the con-
trol, security, and disposition of the funds detailed in the
accompanying reports.

Nearly a year’s preparatory work culminated in the im-
plementation of a new personnel/payroll system utilizing
the services of the Department of Agriculture’s National
Finance Center. Following conversion in November 1987,
work continued to resolve minor problems and to build
support and control systems to ensure efficient operation
of the new system.

Major effort was devoted to updating and improving
the Institution’s dated accounting system. The emphasis
was twofold: (1) identifying and testing potential soft-
ware, and (2) analyzing the capacity of existing hardware
to meet the needs of a new system. Price Waterhouse
assisted in this work. Simultaneously, staff worked to
simplify, clarify, correct, and document elements of the
current system so that an eventual implementation would
be facilitated.

38

Programming was completed on a new investment
management information system, which became opera-
tional with the start of the 1989 fiscal year. The project
to develop disaster preparedness plans for the Institution —
was facilitated by the development of unique personal
computer software conceptualized by Phillip H. Babcock,
Director, Office of Risk Management.

A management study completed during the year recom-
mended a restructuring of the Contracts Office. As a re-
sult, a new office called the Office of Sponsored Projects ;
was created to carry out negotiation and administration
of government grants and contracts. This new office be-
came part of the Treasurer’s Office effective October 1,
1988. Other functions of the Contracts Office have been
assigned to the Office of Procurement and Property Man-
agement.

Audit Activities

|
The Institution’s funds, federal and nonappropriated, are }
audited annually by the independent public accounting
firm of Coopers & Lybrand. In conjunction with the
1988 audit, Coopers & Lybrand reviewed the new per-
sonnel/payroll system to ensure all necessary controls _
were in place. Coopers & Lybrand’s unqualified report
for fiscal year 1988 is reprinted on the following pages.
The letter of transmittal and the statements have been
modified as required to conform with the most current
generally accepted accounting and audit standards. The
Institution has also chosen to simplify the accompanying
tables prepared by the Treasurer’s Office.

The Smithsonian’s internal audit staff regularly reviews
the Institution’s financial activities and fiscal systems, as- ©
sists the outside auditors, and does special projects as
required. In addition, the Defense Contract Audit Agency
audits grants and contracts received from federal agencies
and monitors allocated administrative costs. The Smith-
sonian conducted its Institution-wide triennial internal
control review in 1988. This process helps identify inter-
nal control weaknesses and identifies responsible offices
for remedial action under the oversight of the Under Sec-
retary.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Re-
gents, chaired by Regent David C. Acheson, met three
times during the fiscal year pursuant to its fiduciary re-
sponsibilities under legislation pertinent to the Institu-
tion, and the bylaws of the Board of Regents. In addition
to reviewing the 1987 audit performed by Coopers &
Lybrand, and the 1988 audit plan, the committee receives

reports from the Office of Audits and Investigations and
a wide variety of institutional programs and activities.

Related Organizations

The National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center
for Performing Arts and the Woodrow Wilson Interna-
tional Center for Scholars were established by Congress
within the Institution. Each organization is administered
by its own board of trustees and reports independently
on its financial status. The Smithsonian provides the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars fis-
cal, administrative, and other support services in addition
to office space on a reimbursement basis. Administrative
services are provided by the Institution on a contract ba-
sis for Reading is Fundamental. Office space continued to
be provided for Visions Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit or-
ganization that publishes American Visions magazine. An
independent nonprofit operation, the Friends of the Na-
tional Zoo, operates under contract for the benefit of the
National Zoological Park.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial
condition of the Smithsonian Institution as of September
30, 1988, and the related statement of financial activity
for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Institution’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We previously audited
and reported upon the financial statements of the Smith-
sonian Institution for the year ended September 30, 1987,
totals of which are included in the accompanying finan-
cial statements for comparative purposes only.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and generally accepted gov-
ernmental auditing standards. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and dis-
closures in the financial statements. An audit also in-
cludes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Smithsonian Institution as of September
30, 1988, and the results of its operations and changes in
its fund balances for the year then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Smithsonian Institution Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation

These financial statements do not include the accounts of
the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts or the Woodrow Wilson Interna-
tional Center for Scholars, which were established by
Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (the Institu-
tion) but are administered under separate boards of
trustees.

The financial statements of the Institution with respect
to Federal Appropriations have been prepared on the ob-
ligation basis of accounting, which is in accordance with
accounting principles prescribed by the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States as set forth in the Policy and
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.
The obligation basis of accounting differs in some re-
spects from generally accepted accounting principles.
Under this method of accounting, approximately
$54,484,000 of commitments of the operating fund, such
as purchase orders and contracts, have been recognized
as expenditures, and the related obligations have been
reported on the Statement of Financial Condition at Sep-
tember 30, 1988 even though the goods and services have
not been received. Approximately $11,988,000 of these
commitments are for grants under the foreign currency
program. Approximately $17,558,000 of these commit-
ments are for internal storage facilities and equipment at
the Museum Support Center. In addition, construction
fund commitments for other projects amounted to ap-
proximately $21,714,000 at September 30, 1988.

The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of
funds obtained from private sources, federal grants and
contracts, investment income, and certain business activi-
ties related to the operations of the Institution.

Fund Accounting

To ensure observance of the limitations and restrictions
placed on the use of resources available to the Institution,
accounts are maintained in accordance with the principles
of fund accounting. This procedure classifies resources
for control, accounting and reporting purposes into dis-
tinct funds established according to their appropriation,
nature and purposes. Funds that have similar characteris-
tics have been combined into fund groups in the accom-
panying financial statements. Accordingly, all financial
transactions have been recorded and reported by fund

group.

56

The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institu-
tion are self-balancing as follows:

Federal operating funds represent the portion of ex-
pendable funds available for support of Institution opera-
tions.

Federal construction funds represent that portion of ex-
pendable funds available for building and facility con-
struction, restoration, renovation and repair. Separate
subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—
Construction and Improvements, National Zoological
Park, Restoration and Renovation of Buildings, Museum
Support Center, and the Center for African, Near East-
ern, and Asian Cultures (Quadrangle).

Federal capital funds represent the value of those assets
of the Institution acquired with federal funds and nonex-
pendable property transfers from government agencies.

Trust current funds, which include unrestricted and re-
stricted resources, represent the portion of expendable
funds that is available for support of Institution opera-
tions. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific pur-
poses are segregated from other current funds.

Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that
are subject to restrictions of gift instruments requiring in
perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income
only be used. Also classified as endowment and similar
funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of principal
but only under certain specified conditions. Quasi-en-
dowment funds are funds established by the governing
board for the same purposes as endowment funds; how-
ever, any portion of such funds may be expended. Re- |
stricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for
restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the
principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of
time, but the governing board has elected to invest the
principal and expend only the income for the purpose
stipulated by the donor.

Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for fu-
ture plant acquisitions and funds expended for plant.

Investments

All investment income, except that of endowment and
similar funds, and gains and losses arising from the sale
of investments and property, are accounted for in the
fund in which the related assets are recorded. Income of
endowment and similar funds is accounted for in the
fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as reve-
nue in unrestricted current funds. Gains and losses on the
sale of investments are recognized on the trade date basis
using the average cost method.

Inventory

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method or retail cost method (for those inventories held
for resale).

Deferred Revenue and Expense

Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine
and Air and Space Magazine is recorded as income over
the period of the related subscription, which is generally
one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to
Smithsonian Magazine and Air and Space Magazine
are charged against income over the period of the
subscription.

The Institution recognizes revenue and charges ex-
penses of other auxiliary activities during the period in
which the activity is conducted.

Works of Art, Living or Other Specimens

The Institution acquires its collections, which include
works of art, library books, photographic archives, ob-
jects and specimens, through purchase by federal or pri-
vate funds or by donation. In accordance with policies
generally followed by museums, no value is assigned to
the collections on the statement of financial condition.
Purchases for the collections are expensed currently.

Property and Equipment—Trust Funds

Property and equipment purchased with trust funds for
use by nonincome-producing activities are recorded at
cost, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of
certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie
Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values.
Property and equipment are treated as a deduction of the
current fund and as a capitalized cost of the plant fund.

Property and equipment for use by nonincome-produc-
ing activities is depreciated on the straight-line basis over
their useful lives as follows:

Building 30 years
Major renovations 15 years
Equipment 10 years

Depreciation is recorded in the plant fund as a deduc-
tion to the investment in plant (see Note 7).

Capital improvements and equipment purchased with
trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are
capitalized at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years.

Property and Equipment—Federal Funds

Property and equipment purchased with federal funds
are recorded in the capital funds at cost and depreciated
on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows:

Building 30 years
Major renovations 15 years
Nonexpendable equipment 10 years

Certain lands occupied by the Institution’s buildings
were appropriated and reserved by Congress for the
Smithsonian and are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements. Property and nonexpendable equip-
ment acquired through transfer from government agen-
cies are capitalized at the transfer price or at estimated
amounts, taking into consideration usefulness, condition
and market value.

Government Grants and Contracts

The Institution has a number of grants and contracts
with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for
cost reimbursement to the Institution. Grant and contract
revenue is recognized within trust funds as expenditures
are incurred.

Pledges and Donations

The Institution records significant pledges that are sup-
ported by letters signed by donors. Pledges are recorded
at net realizable value as a receivable and as deferred
revenue on the statement of financial condition. Revenue
from pledges is recognized in the year the pledge funds
are collected.

Donations are recognized as revenue in the year the
cash is received.

57

Contributed Services

A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made
significant contributions of their time in the furtherance
of the Institution’s programs. The value of this contrib-
uted time is not reflected in these statements in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Annual Leave

The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual leave
in accordance with federal law and regulations. How-
ever, only the cost of leave taken as salaries is funded and
recorded as an expense. The cost of unused annual leave
at year-end is reflected in the accompanying financial
statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal
funds.

Annual leave is recorded for trust employees in the
trust fund as earned.

2. Related Activities

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services
to several separately incorporated organizations in which
certain officials of the Institution serve on the governing
boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these or-
ganizations for the aforementioned services, together
with rent for Institution facilities occupied, totaled
$380,000 ($305,000 for the trust funds and $75,000 for
the federal funds) for the year ended September 30, 1988.
Deposits held in custody for these organizations are
$4,371,000 as of September 30, 1988.

The following summarizes the unaudited expenditures
of these organizations for the fiscal year ended September
30, 1988 as reflected in their individual financial state-
ments, which are not included in the accompanying fi-
nancial statements of the Institution:

Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. $7,971,000
Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars:
Trust funds $5,321,000
Federal appropriations $4,028,000

3. Investments

Investments are recorded at cost on a trade date basis, if
purchased, or estimated fair market value at date of ac-

quisition, if acquired by gift. At September 30, 1988, in-
vestments were composed of the following:

Total investments $282,010 $287,390

Since October 1, 1982, the deposit with the U.S. Treas-
ury has been invested in U.S. Government securities at a
variable yield based on market rates.

Substantially all the investments of the endowment and
similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consoli-
dated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or
disposing of units on the basis of the per unit market
value at the beginning of the month within which the
transaction takes place. As of September 30, 1988,
303,177 units were owned by endowment funds, and
449,669 units were owned by quasi-endowment funds.

The following tabulation summarizes changes in rela-
tionships between cost and market values of the pooled
investments:

4. Endowment and Similar Funds

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to in-
vestment management of endowment funds and quasi-
endowment funds. Under this approach, an amount
equal to the difference between actual interest and divi-
dends earned during the year and the amount computed
under the total return formula is transferred to or from
the current funds.

In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy
to provide, as being available for current expenditures,
an amount taking into consideration such factors as, but
not limited to: (1) 4"/2% of the five-year average of the
market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and trans-
fers during this period), (2) current dividend and interest
yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists, and (4)
inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price
Index. However, where the market value of the assets of
any endowment fund is less than 110% of the historic
dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation), the
amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends
received.

The total return factor for 1988 was 5% to all partici-
pating funds. Actual dividends and interest earned ex-
ceeded the total return for the year, and the amount was
transferred from the current funds to the endowment
funds (see Note 11).

5. Receivables

Receivables at September 30, 1988 included the following:

_($000s)
Federal funds

Billed and unbilled costs and fees from

grants and contracts 3,440
Other 1,048

36,479
Total, all funds $45,160

6. Advance payments

Advance payments represent prepayments made to gov-
ernment agencies, educational institutions, firms and in-
dividuals for services to be rendered, or property or
materials to be furnished.

As of September 30, 1988, the Institution had advances
outstanding to the General Services Administration of ap-
proximately $17,800,000, principally for construction
services including the Museum Support Center and other
projects to be completed in future fiscal years. The Insti-
tution at that date also had advances oustanding to edu-
cational institutions amounting to approximately
$3,019,000, principally under the Special Foreign Cur-
rency Program.

tivities expenditures in the current funds. Depreciation of
nonincome-producing equipment and buildings for 1988
amounted to $1,967,000 and is included in the plant
fund.

The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1988
included $12,190,000 of unexpended funds for future
plant acquisitions.

8. Long-term Debt

The proceeds of the note with Riggs National Bank
were used to fund construction of a restaurant addition
to the National Air and Space Museum. Interest on the
note was approximately $990,000 for fiscal year 1988 of
which $165,000 was recorded as interest expense of the
Auxiliary Activities funds and $825,000 was capitalized
as a cost of the restaurant.

9. Federal Operating Funds

The federal operating funds include appropriations for
salaries and expenses which are expended in the year re-
ceived. Also included are amounts received with the pro-
vision that such amounts can be expended over a period

12. Retirement Plans

The federal employees of the Institution are covered by
either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the
Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). The fea-
tures of both of these systems are defined in published
government documents. Under both systems, the Institu-
tion withholds from the salary of each federal employee
the percentage of salary specified by each program, and
the Institution contributes specified percentages. The cost
of the programs for the year ended September 30, 1988
was $8,267,000.

The Institution has a separate retirement plan for trust
employees. Under the plan, both the Institution and the
employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary
which are used to purchase individual annuities, the
rights to which are immediately vested with the employ-
ees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September
30, 1988 was $4,480,000.

It is the policy of the Institution to fund the accrued
costs of the plans currently. There are no unfunded prior
service costs under the plans.

13. Income Taxes

The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the
provisions of Section so1(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Organizations described in that section are taxable
only on their unrelated business income. No provision
for income taxes is required for the year ended September
30, 1988 since the Institution had a net loss from unre-
lated business activity.

It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt
from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States
as defined in Section 5o01(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations
described in that section are exempt from all income tax-
ation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such
dual status.

International Center

Since the creation of the Smithsonian’s first international
office twenty years ago, international affairs affecting the
conduct of the Institution’s work abroad have become
ever more complex, and the scope of Smithsonian inter-
national activities has continued to expand. The estab-
lishment of the Smithsonian’s International Center in 1983
and the opening of the Smithsonian’s new museum and
education complex in 1987 provided a new focus for the
global interests of Smithsonian scholars and their collabo-
rators around the world.

Through its constituent divisions, the International
Center fosters the international dimension of basic re-
search, museum programs, and exchanges in scientific
and cultural fields. Major emphasis is placed on efforts to
broaden the American public’s understanding of the his-
tory, culture, and natural environment of regions
throughout the world. In the International Center’s first
year of operation in its new facilities, it introduced the
public and the scholarly community to the types of pro-
grams that will be mounted there. In the future, center
staff will provide support for the increasing number of
program initiatives from other Smithsonian bureaus and
from outside organizations.

The International Center grew out of the Directorate
of International Activities, which was established in 1984
to administer and outline prototype programs for the
center and assist in establishing contacts for research col-
laboration and cooperative institutional relationships.
Under the directorate’s purview were the International
Gallery, the Office of Service and Protocol, the Smithson-
ian Foreign Currency Program, the Office of Publications
Exchange, and the Office of Quincentenary Programs.
The directorate also provided a base for the Smithson-
ian—Man and the Biosphere Program, the affiliated
organizations of the Council of American Overseas Re-
search Centers (CAORC), and, more recently, the Inter-
national Union for the Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources (IUCN).

In early 1988 a newly established International Activi-
ties Council (IAC) assumed responsibility for administra-
tion of the International Center. The council is composed
of the Smithsonian assistant secretaries for research, mu-
seums, public service, and external affairs, each of whom
has responsibility for a portion of the International Cen-
ter’s activities. The council as a whole provides consoli-
dated oversight for the Institution’s international policies.
A coordinator and an administrative officer maintain
budgetary oversight for the units of the center, while the
directors of the component offices manage their programs
with reference to the appropriate assistant secretary. The

64

assistant secretary for research has responsibility for the
Office of Quincentenary Programs, the Man and the Bio- |
sphere Program, Smithsonian research exchange pro-
grams, and coordination with CAORC and IUCN. The
International Gallery is under the purview of the assistant
secretary for museums. The assistant secretary for public
service is responsible for a new Office of Conference
Services that serves the burgeoning needs of Smithsonian
bureaus for logistical assistance in planning scholarly
gatherings. The assistant secretary for external affairs
oversees the Office of International Relations, made up
of what were the Office of Service and Protocol and the
Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. The Office of
Publications Exchange was transferred to the Smithson-
ian Institution Libraries.

Office of International Relations

The Office of International Relations (OIR) provides sup-
port for Smithsonian research and programs abroad and
serves as the liaison between the Smithsonian and foreign
institutions, individuals abroad, international organiza-
tions, and government agencies. The office also assists
with the logistical details of international exchanges of
collections or personnel and serves as a point of contact —
for scholars, museum professionals, and foreign officials
seeking to establish cooperative relationships with the
Smithsonian.

Professional counsel and services in a variety of travel
documentation and immigration-related matters are avail-
able from the OIR. During 1988, for example, the office
provided documentation for 112 researchers and museum
professionals traveling to the Smithsonian and eleven
U.S. museums and zoos under the sponsorship of the
Smithsonian’s government-authorized Exchange Visitor
Program. For foreign travel by Smithsonian staff mem-
bers and grant recipients, the office obtained nearly a
hundred passports and more than a thousand foreign vi-
sas during 1988.

This year the OIR completed the Handbook on Inter-
national Research and Exchanges, which provides de-
tailed information and advice for Smithsonian staff who
wish to undertake work abroad or collaborate with for-
eign colleagues. Planning also began in 1988 for the de-
velopment of a computer data base on all Smithsonian
foreign research and exchange activities, information pre-
viously published in the periodic Profile of Smithsonian
International Activities.

The office was involved in a number of new coopera-

tive initiatives launched by the Smithsonian during 1988.
The office assisted, for example, in the preparation and
negotiation of a formal protocol of cooperation con-
cluded with Madagascar’s Ministry of Scientific Research
and Technological Development. The Smithsonian also
significantly expanded its collaboration with organiza-
tions in the Soviet Union. Exchanges of exhibitions,
scholars, and programs were planned with Soviet coun-
terparts and staff from the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden, National Museum of Natural History,
Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution Trav-
eling Exhibition Service, “Smithsonian World,” and Of-
fice of Folklife Programs. As part of its support for these
activities, the Office of International Relations arranged
visits to the Smithsonian by Soviet Minister of Culture
Vasiliy Zakharov, Soviet Academy of Sciences Deputy
Secretary General Andrei Kapitsa, Pushkin Museum Di-
rector Irina Antonova, and several other Soviet officials.
Groundwork was also laid this year for future Smithson-
ian collaboration with Japanese museums and research
institutes. Secretary Robert McC. Adams and National
Museum of American History staff visited Japan, and
two delegations of Japanese museum officials visited the
Smithsonian under the auspices of the Bunkacho, the Jap-
anese cultural agency. Early in the year, Japanese Crown
Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko called on Secretary
Adams and visited the National Museum of American
History. The OIR coordinated or planned all of these
visits and arranged for consultations at the Smithsonian
with the president of Iceland, the director-general of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Or-
ganization (UNESCO), and cultural or scientific affairs
ministers from Brazil, Bahrain, Korea, Thailand, and
Tunisia. In all, the OIR made arrangements for the visits
to the Smithsonian of more than 130 foreign officials and
distinguished scholars.

The Office of International Relations administers three
funding programs designed to encourage international
cooperation in scholarly activities. During 1988 the Smith-
sonian’s International Exchange Program supported work-
shops, training courses, and other short-term activities
involving scholars from seven countries working with five
Smithsonian bureaus. Now in its third year, the Suzanne
Liebers Erickson Memorial Fund supports exchange visits
between Smithsonian staff members and Danish scholars,
museum professionals, and students. Since its establish-
ment in 1965, the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program
has served to enhance the quality of American scholarly
work abroad by providing over $65 million in funding for
scholars from more than 250 institutions throughout the

United States. In 1988 awards from the program sup-
ported research in Burma, Pakistan, Yugoslavia, and In-
dia. The program supports the research of American
institutions—including the Smithsonian—in those coun-
tries where the United States held blocked currencies
derived largely from past sales of surplus agricultural
commodities under Public Law 480. Local currencies
have also been made available through the Foreign Cur-
rency Program for work in countries where post-Public
Law 480 funds have been established for that purpose.

In October 1987 the Office of International Relations
cooperated with the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies in
the planning and coordination of a colloquium on global
food issues. The proceedings were published in Septem-
ber 1988.

International Gallery

The International Gallery’s second major exhibition,
“Tropical Rainforests: A Disappearing Treasure,” opened
in May 1988. This cross-disciplinary exhibition focused
attention on the Earth’s most biologically diverse habitat
and its ongoing destruction, which is one of the most
serious ecological threats today. Organized by the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service in co-
operation with the World Wildlife Fund, “Tropical
Rainforests” closed in January 1989 and traveled under
the auspices of SITES. In conjunction with the exhibi-
tion, the Smithsonian organized a number of public and
scholarly programs, including film series, seminars for
policymakers, a rainforest folklife festival, and a lecture
series sponsored by the Resident Associate Program. Edu-
cational materials, teacher training workshops, and a
film resource guide were developed for use in schools and
in museums on the tour.

Office of Conference Services

Based in the International Center, the Office of Confer-
ence Services guides scholars and professionals through-
out the Institution in the planning and production of
symposia, conferences, and meetings. The office logged
almost two dozen requests for assistance in its first
months of existence. Initial undertakings included work-
shops entitled “Mesopotamian Paleoenvironment and
Pottery,” cosponsored by the Secretary’s office and the
University of Chicago in July 1988; a “Peace Corps in
Arab Countries” conference, cosponsored by the Office

65
of International Relations and the Peace Corps in Sep-
tember 1988; and the “Crossroads of Continents: Cul-
tures of Siberia and Alaska” symposium, cosponsored by
the National Museum of Natural History’s Department
of Anthropology and the International Research and Ex-
changes Board, also in September 1988.

Office of Quincentenary Programs

The sooth anniversary of Columbus’s first voyage to the
New World will be observed in 1992 at the Smithsonian
by the activities of at least sixteen bureaus, whose efforts
are being coordinated by the International Center’s Office
of Quincentenary Programs. Exhibitions and programs
are being planned in collaboration with scholars and in-
stitutions from throughout the United States and abroad
to highlight the cultural, historical, and scientific conse-
quences of the encounter between Europeans and the in-
digenous peoples of the Americas.

A broad array of activities ranging from scholarly and
public symposia to exhibitions, publications, and a televi-
sion series will present the complex relationships between
these cultures. The National Museum of Natural History
is organizing “Seeds of Change,” a major temporary exhi-
bition that will examine the process of plant, animal, and
disease exchanges between the Old and New Worlds. At
the National Museum of American History, a permanent
exhibition and a series of public programs will explore
the social and economic ties between Europe and the
Americas from the seventeenth century to the present.
The Office of Folklife Programs will look at the contribu-
tion of certain crops and plants to the establishment of
New World societies and at their role as symbols of iden-
tity and sources of artistic inspiration. The Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute is organizing the Fourth
World Congress on National Parks, to be held in Panama
in 1992. The institute is also planning an international
symposium, “Non-Imperial Politics in the Lands Visited
by Christopher Columbus.” “The Buried Mirror” is the
title of a bilingual series of five one-hour television pro-
grams, written and narrated by Mexican author Carlos
Fuentes, which is being developed by the Office of Quin-
centenary Programs and the Office of Telecommunica-
tions. A traveling exhibition on the iconography of
Christopher Columbus is being organized by the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. The Na-
tional Air and Space Museum plans to publish a world
atlas based on satellite photographs. The Cooper-Hewitt
Museum will illustrate the influence of Native American

66

design on European and American decorative arts
through an exhibition of ceramics, textiles, metalwork,
and architectural motifs.

Man and the Biosphere Program

In 1986 the International Center, in cooperation with

the National Museum of Natural History and the Man
and the Biosphere-UNESCO Program, launched a new
international program on biological diversity inventory
procedures. The program was designed to develop a high-
resolution data base management system that will eventu-
ally provide nearly complete biological inventories of se-
lected species-rich sites, such as national parks, nature
reserves, and biosphere reserves (areas set aside for pro-
tection and study that are representative of the world’s
major ecosystems). With such a methodology, compara-
tive work can proceed more efficiently and accelerate the
process of understanding biological diversity around the
world. One of the most important aspects of this new
program is that biologists and other related professionals
from developing countries are being trained to conduct
their own biological inventories and to assist in catalogu-
ing bioresources within their respective countries. With
support from the U.S. Agency for International Develop-

ment, the World Heritage Program of UNESCO, and the |

Man and the Biosphere-UNESCO Program, training
workshops on the methodology of conducting biological
inventories were held during 1988 in Bolivia, Peru, and
Puerto Rico. Participants also received training at the
National Museum of Natural History in collections man-
agement and computer techniques. The program comple-
ments the Biological Diversity in Latin America Program,
a research initiative of the Museum of Natural History.

Other Programs

Timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the board
of directors of the Council of American Overseas Re-
search Centers, an exhibition entitled “Sojourners and
Settlers: Yemeni Workers at Home and Abroad” was the
first show to be mounted in the International Center
Conference Suite. Drawn from a display of photographs
taken by scholars gathered together by the University of
California, Los Angeles, the exhibition was reorganized
and jointly coordinated by the council and the Interna-
tional Center.

Joseph Henry Papers

Staff of the Joseph Henry Papers continued to research
and write the sixth volume (1844-46) of the projected
fifteen-volume selective letterpress edition of the corre-
spondence and private papers of Joseph Henry (1797-
1878), one of America’s foremost nineteenth-century sci-
entists and the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. Work was begun on volume 7 (1847-49), which will
document Henry’s efforts to organize the Smithsonian as
a center for original research.

During the past year, installation of the project’s local
area network and initiation of the development of a re-
vised computer-based document index were part of the
effort to have the project’s editorial work fully automated
by 1989. After almost two years of design, planning, and
packing, the project moved into its new quarters on the
balcony of the Arts and Industries Building in March
1988. The new space, which includes a separate, secure
room for the Bell—Henry Library, is more efficient and
compact than the space occupied in the Castle.

Despite its small size, the staff has been active in edu-
cation programs and exhibitions. Two interns conducted
supervised research on topics relating to the history of the
Smithsonian. Dr. Paul Theerman, one of the project’s as-
sistant editors, taught the history of science at West Vir-
ginia University during the fall 1987 semester. He also
served as curator of the exhibition, “Isaac Newton and
the Principia: 300 Years,” which traveled to the IBM Gal-
lery of Science and Art in New York City after it closed
at the National Museum of American History.

The Joseph Henry Papers continued its commitment to
scholarship and service to the history profession. Dr. Marc
Rothenberg, editor of the Henry Papers, presented papers
or served as organizer or chair at the annual meeting of
the History of Science Society, at a joint meeting of the
British Society for the History of Science and the Ameri-
can History of Science Society, Anglo-American meeting,
and at an international symposium held in Melbourne,
Australia, in honor of the Australian bicentennial. In ad-
dition, the Joseph Henry Papers now publishes History of
Science in America: News and Views, the newsletter of
the Forum for the History of Science in America.

National Zoological Park

As the survival of the world’s living resources becomes
more and more threatened, zoos have a critical role to
play in directly preserving those resources, as well as in
expanding the public’s knowledge through exhibitions
and programs and in conducting research. The National
Zoological Park (NZP) furthers these aims at its Rock
Creek Park facility, a popular place for tourists and local
residents alike, and at its 3,000-acre Conservation and
Research Center (CRC) in Front Royal, Virginia. During
1988 the zoo carried out significant research to advance
understanding in the biological and veterinary sciences,
while continuing its transition to a biological park that
introduces visitors to the ecological and evolutionary re-
lationships among plants and animals.

Animal Exhibits

Animal exhibits are the zoo’s primary means of educating
the general public about animal welfare and behavior,
biological principles and relationships, and the role of
humans in the natural world. The exhibits at the zoo
appeal to both serious-minded zoogoers and to visitors
on recreational outings.

The popular Invertebrate Exhibit, which opened in
1987, was a major step toward transforming the National
Zoo into a biological park where plants and animals are
exhibited together without the unnatural separation that
traditionally has characterized zoos. Two new exhibits
that opened in 1988 continue this approach. The Gibbon
Ridge Exhibit, located on a wooded ridge, provides a
naturalistic setting for the endangered forest apes, which
captivate visitors with their spectacular movements and
territorial calls. The Waterfowl Wetlands Exhibit, situ-
ated in front of the Bird House, displays a wide variety of
aquatic birds in a lush environment enhanced by swamp
grasses, sedges, cattails, and other wetlands plants. In the
spring, ducks, geese, swans, herons, and egrets perform
their elaborate courtship rituals in full view of visitors.
Both of these new exhibits include innovative interactive
graphics that inform and teach visitors.

Design work on the Amazonia Aquatic Exhibit, which
furthers the biological park concept, progressed in 1988.
The Smithsonian’s unrivaled expertise in tropical biology
is informing and guiding the concept and design. Like the
other new exhibits, the Amazonia Exhibit will integrate
animals and plants in the same environment.

In 1988 zoo visitors could view more than 3,000 mam-
mals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians and more than
1,500 invertebrates. The successful breeding of many of

67

the animals is evidence of the quality of care given to the
animals at the zoo and at the Conservation and Research
Center. The nearly 1,000 births and hatchings in 1988
delighted visitors and bolstered the NZP’s stocks of
threatened and endangered species. Among the newborns
were a giraffe, orangutan, sandhill crane, Guam rail,
smoky jungle frog, and Dumeril’s ground boa, as well as
octopus and several clouded leopards and Pére David's

68

deer. More than 850 of the young animals born at the
zoo were traded or sold to other zoos for their exhibits
and breeding programs.

A popular and fascinating addition to the NZP’s collec-
tions were two Komodo dragons, a generous gift from
the people of Indonesia. Komodos, the world’s largest
lizards, are rarely exhibited in zoos. The pair at the NZP
are the only ones in the United States, and it is hoped

that they will become part of a breeding program that
will result in a self-sustaining population of Komodos in
this country.

Conservation

Saving threatened and endangered species, a critical func-
tion of most zoos today, is the focus of the NZP’s Conser-
vation and Research Center. Housed at the center is the
Department of Conservation, which had 390 mammals
and 219 birds in its collection as of September 30, 1988.
Significant births during the year included a Goeldi’s mon-
key, golden-lion tamarins, clouded leopards, Przewalski
horses, Eld’s deer, and Arabian oryx. Among the rare
birds hatched were Guam rails, Micronesian kingfishers,
Bali mynahs, red-crowned cranes, and a sunbittern.

The Department of Conservation began its participa-
tion in the Arabian Oryx Species Survival Plan with the
acquisition of a pair of these animals in November 1988.
Twelve Bali mynahs from the department were included
in a group of thirty-nine mynahs transferred to the Sura-
baya Zoo in Indonesia by U.S. zoos as part of an ongo-
ing cooperative propagation-reintroduction program.

The Conservation and Research Center hosted the fifth
summer Wildlife Conservation and Management Train-
ing Course, which attracted twenty-four participants
from seventeen countries. Dr. Rasanayagam Rudran gave
additional courses during the year in the People’s Repub-
lic of China, Venezuela, and Malaysia. Dr. Christen
Wemmer, Dr. J. Andrew Teare, and Charles Pickett pre-
sented a new Zoo Biology and Management Training
Course in Thailand and Malaysia. Dr. Rudran and Dr.
Wemmer received a generous grant from the J. N. Pew,
Jr., Charitable Trust to support the Wildlife Conserva-
tion and Management Training program.

Dr. Wemmer was appointed to the board of directors
of the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums and was named chairman of the association’s
Species Survival Plan Subcommittee. Dr. Scott Derrickson
transferred Guam rails to and from the breeding facility
on Guam in May 1988. During his visit he worked with
Guamanian and Commonwealth biologists in surveying
potential introduction sites on the island of Rota, Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

External Affairs

The Office of the Assistant Director for External Affairs
and Outreach was created during 1988 to coordinate the

expanding activities of the Offices of Public Affairs, Edu-
cation, Development, and Design and Exhibit Planning.
Gretchen Gayle Ellsworth was appointed to head the of-
fice, which also coordinates plans for the zoo’s centennial
celebration in 1989-90.

Through creative programs, exhibits, and educational
materials, the zoo informs and educates its large and di-
verse audiences. Area teachers learn about the zoo and its
educational programs through the National Zoo News, a
newspaper published by the Office of Education. New
activity-based programs, which enable students to ob-
serve animals at close range, include “Dinosaurs and
Reptiles” (a two-visit program conducted with the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History) and “Invertebrates.”
Teacher-training workshops and outreach kits for teach-
ers in the Washington area continued as key components
of the zoo’s school programs.

To augment the zoo’s programs in conservation educa-
tion, “ZooArk,” an exhibit on zoos and worldwide con-
servation issues, traveled to zoos throughout the United
States under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service. An innovative new museum
program for junior high school students, “Bison, Butter-
flies, and Conservation,” was begun in cooperation with
the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum
of Natural History. It combines behind-the-scenes mu-
seum and zoo visits, historical role-playing, and discus-
sion of contemporary issues.

In conjunction with the Friends of the National Zoo,
the zoo continued its classes for adults in conservation,
animal behavior, and principles of exotic animal medi-
cine. To date, several hundred people have received cer-
tificates for a course of wildlife studies, and many more
have enrolled in classes.

Through the combined efforts of several zoo offices,
educational exhibits were developed this year to accom-
pany major new animal displays, including Gibbon
Ridge, Waterfowl Wetlands, Japanese Spider Crabs, and
Komodo Dragons. The Office of Design and Exhibit
Planning continued its program of preparing information
and identification labels about animals, plants, and the
zoo. A photographic exhibition for the zoo’s centennial,
“The Zoo: Then, Now, and Future,” was developed.

Work began on a revision of the master graphics plan,
which encompasses all forms of visitor orientation. The
new system will reflect major physical changes, such as
the anticipated 1989 completion of the Olmsted Walk
renovation, as well as the major themes of the zoo’s cen-
tennial observation.

Also in 1988, people across the United States and

69
abroad shared in the zoo’s achievements through the

print and broadcast media. An important emphasis of the

information provided by the Office of Public Affairs was
the zoo’s role in conserving animal species through study
and breeding. The office also conducted a special promo-
tional campaign to increase the number of visitors in
winter and early spring, with the generous pro bono as-
sistance of the firm of Williams and Whittle, Associates.
Sunset Serenades, the summer folk, jazz, and blues con-
cert series, attracted new audiences to the zoo during the
more sparsely visited early evening hours.

Public lectures throughout the year on wildlife and en-
vironmental topics presented new information on North
American mammoths, dinosaur biology and behavior,
and the evolution of siamangs and gibbons. The zoo’s
Symposium Series continued to bring serious biological
topics to public attention through lectures and discus-
sions. The eighth symposium focused on human cultures
as key elements in national and global conservation strat-
egies. Symposia proceedings are published by the Smith-
sonian Institution Press.

During 1988 an Advisory Council was created to advise
and assist the zoo in fund-raising in support of major zoo
programs. Led by Dr. David Challinor, science adviser to
Secretary Adams and former assistant secretary for re-
search, the council is concentrating first on the Amazonia
exhibit and the Australia Pavilion.

Animal Health

The Department of Animal Health (DAH) provides veter-
inary care for the zoo’s animal collections at the Rock
Creek Park facility and at the Conservation and Research
Center in Front Royal. Research is concentrated in two
areas: clinical medicine and reproductive physiology.
These research programs involve collaboration with other
zoos in the United States and international field trips to
Kenya, Tanzania, India, Australia, Burma, Guam, and
other locations. The clinical studies now under way in-
clude improving anesthetic techniques and utilizing and
modifying newer tools, such as ultrasound, endoscopy,
and nuclear magnetic resonance, to aid in diagnosing the
problems of zoological patients.

In 1988 the zoo opened its new veterinary hospital, a
low-profile, two-story building nestled inconspicuously in
a wooded hillside overlooking Rock Creek. The building
is graceful, appropriate to its setting, and functional.
With the new hospital, the zoo now has a state-of-the-art
facility for the medical and surgical care of its collection,

7O

along with much-needed laboratory space to continue
and expand studies. The hospital’s facilities for diagnostic
support—the clinical pathology, histopathology, and mi-
crobiology laboratories—all have the latest biosafety
equipment, including laminar-flow cabinets for handling
parasites and other microorganisms, which zoo technolo-
gists are constantly screening. A new special research lab-
oratory and infectious disease isolation unit will enable
the pathology staff to investigate infectious agents in or-
der to control them. The new facilities also include staff
offices, a department library-slide review room, a slide
accession room, and teaching cubicles. A classroom/con-
ference room also serves as an audio-video center; it is
linked to the nearby pathology building so that important
necropsies conducted there can be documented or re-
viewed by students and zoo staff in an uncontaminated
environment.

At the Conservation and Research Center hospital in
Front Royal, animals are quarantined and major surgical
procedures are performed in the surgery suite. The associ-
ated laboratories are used for urinary hormone analysis,
semen freezing, antibiotic assays, and clinical pathological
studies. Analysis of urinary hormones allows the zoo to
monitor pregnancies in zoo animals in a noninvasive way.

The zoo made major advances in the field of reproduc-
tive physiology and endocrinology during 1988. The En-
docrinology Research Laboratory in the veterinary hospital
at CRC continues research into monitoring hormonal me-
tabolites in voided urine, a noninvasive approach to stud-
ying the endocrinology of zoo species. This technique has
been used to determine the reproductive cycle, diagnose
pregnancy, and predict parturition in Eld’s deer and the
Przewalski horse; studies are in progress involving Pere
David’s deer, muntjac, and golden-lion tamarins. The
laboratory also monitors the pregnancy of the zoo’s giant
panda, Ling Ling, and the results are used to plan man-
agement and medical decisions.

Research continued into the study of the domestic fer-
ret as a model for the highly endangered black-footed
ferret. During the past year, methods for inseminating
ferrets by laparoscopy (a fiber-optic system whereby
sperm are deposited directly into the uterus through the
abdominal wall) resulted in a 70 percent conception rate
and the births of more than 140 domestic ferret offspring.
Successful procedures were developed to freeze-store fer-
ret spermatozoa. Thirty-one ferret kits were produced
using sperm frozen for as long as one year.

Further advances also were made in gamete research
and embryo technology. Collaborative research with the
Dallas Zoological Park resulted in the birth of a suni
antelope after embryo transfer. The zoo’s distinction as
the first research laboratory to produce carnivore off-
spring (domestic cat kittens) from in vitro fertilized em-
bryos was advanced further by improving laboratory
procedures for producing embryos. About 80 percent of
all cat eggs collected fertilize in vitro and result in the
formation of embryos. This technology has recently been
used in collaborative research with Florida state officials,
who are managing the highly endangered Florida pan-
ther. In vitro fertilization procedures developed for the
domestic cat were used to recover puma eggs and achieve
a 45 percent fertilization rate and the production of ten
cleaved embryos.

NZP proposes to establish a Genetic Resource Bank,
which will rely heavily on the rapidly developing field of
cryobiology. Despite the frequent speculation that gamete
(sperm and ovum) and embryo cryopreservation will be
important for the conservation and management of mam-
mals, no organized effort exists in the United States or
elsewhere to sample, evaluate, cryopreserve, maintain,
and use germ plasm from animals other than common,
domestic species. The proposed Genetic Resource Bank
will facilitate international efforts to preserve rare and
threatened sources of biodiversity.

Pathology

The Department of Pathology (DOP) provides necropsy
and laboratory diagnostic support and engages in re-
search relating to disease of zoo animals. The DOP has
continued collaborative studies with the Uniformed Ser-
vices University of the Health Sciences and the San Diego
Zoo on a new viral hepatitis of marmosets and tamarins
that particularly affects golden-lion tamarins.

The department also completed a pathologic study of
eight giant panda cubs from three zoos (Mexico City,
Madrid, and Washington). The study showed that most
panda cub deaths were caused by opportunistic bacterial
infections associated with the cubs’ inability to attain suf-
ficient antibody protection from the mothers’ colostrum
right after birth. This study was presented at the Second
International Symposium for the Giant Panda in Tokyo
in November, along with a proposal to adapt technology
employing the preparation of concentrated immunoglob-
ulins from parent serums, which would be administered
to the cubs at birth.

In a program supported by the Friends of the National
Zoo (FONZ), a study carried out by veterinary patholo-
gist Dr. Richard Montali and illustrated by Ellen Seefelt,
FONZ junior project assistant, developed a protocol for
the post-mortem examination of the diaphragm to detect
hernias in golden-lion tamarins. This document was dis-
tributed to all breeders of golden-lion tamarins through
studbook keeper Jon Ballou.

One of the new research projects is a study by Dr.
Carol Partington, a FONZ senior research assistant, of
an iron storage disease (hemochromatosis) in the zoo’s
Bali mynahs. In addition, DOP staff, with the Depart-
ment of Animal Health and the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, are developing a vaccine against a
bacterial dysentery caused by shigella. They are also
studying the hematology of lizards using members of the
Iguanidae family as a model. Dr. Don Nichols completed
a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellowship on immunologic
studies of P. tenuis (meningial worm).

Nonmedical Research

The Department of Zoological Research (DZR) provides
scientific support and develops innovative programs to
further the zoo’s missions of conservation, research, exhi-
bition, and education. DZR staff and associates collabo-
rate within and outside the zoo on a broad range of
research problems, ranging from long-term multidisciplin-

71
ary field studies involving numerous scientists in Brazil,
Venezuela, and Sri Lanka, to one-on-one collaborations
testing a single hypothesis or solving a specific manage-
ment problem. The department currently collaborates,
both within and outside NZP, on more than seventy-five
projects.

In June 1988 work began on the $3 million renovation
of the Research Building. Upon completion of the project
in the summer of 1989, DZR’s functions will be housed in
the same location for the first time in over a decade. The
new facility has been tailored to the laboratory, adminis-
trative, and animal housing needs of the department.

Several staff research efforts continued in the Poco das
Antas Reserve in Brazil. Dr. Devra Kleiman, the zoo’s
assistant director for research, supervised the reserve’s
Golden-Lion Tamarin Conservation Program, traveling
to Brazil to continue basic field research with NZP re-
search associate Dr. James Dietz on the population dy-
namics, reproductive cycles, and demography of this
endangered species and to monitor the progress of cap-
tive-born tamarins reintroduced to the reserve between
1984 and 1987. Dr. Kleiman also began a long-term study
of small mammal ecology in the reserve in collaboration
with Dr. Jody Stallings of the University of Florida.

Dr. Dietz collaborated with research associate Dr. Lisa
Forman in using DNA “fingerprinting” to determine kin-
ship in wild and captive golden-lion tamarins. Dr. Dietz
and research associate Dr. Steven Thompson conducted
studies measuring the relative energetic costs of huddling
behavior in tamarins, both in captivity and at the Poco
das Antas Reserve. Research associate Lou Ann Dietz ran
the golden-lion tamarin education programs in and
around the reserve.

Dr. Thompson was among department staff who con-
ducted studies of terrestrial mammals during 1988. He
completed basic research on the comparative energetics of
small marsupials and eutherian mammals, concentrating
on sugar gliders, potoroos, North American porcupines,
tree kangaroos, and ring-tailed possums. The San Joa-
quin kit fox in California is the subject of a field study
that research zoologist Dr. Katherine Ralls initiated for
the Nature Conservancy. With population manager Dr.
Jon Ballou and others, Dr. Ralls continued collaborative
research on estimating minimum viable population sizes
for wild and captive populations. Dr. Olav Oftedal, NZP
nutritionist, began a diet study of the folivorous red
howler monkey in Venezuela in collaboration with re-
search zoologist Dr. Rasanayagam Rudran and Dr. Sue
Crissey of the Brookfield Zoo. Miles Roberts, coordina-
tor of the Red Panda Species Survival Plan, continued

gallon tank. (Photograph by Jessie Cohen)

research on the behavioral ecology of the eastern chip-
munk at the zoo and completed life history studies of a
variety of small mammals. In Sri Lanka, research associ-
ate Dr. Wolfgang Dittus completed the eighteenth year of
his sociodemographic studies of the toque macaque, fo-
cusing on the evolution of social behavior, mechanisms
of population regulation, and the genetic structure of pop-
ulations. Dr. Ted Grand finished a senior Smithsonian
postdoctoral fellowship study of comparative mammalian
anatomy and movement patterns with emphasis on ungu-
lates, callitrichid primates, and caviomorph rodents in
collaboration with the Department of Pathology.

Marine mammals were the subject of a number of re-
search efforts during 1988. Dr. Ralls collaborated with
Dr. Donald Siniff of the University of Minnesota to study
movement patterns of sea otters off the California coast.
Dr. Oftedal studied comparative analyses of pinniped
milk in collaboration with graduate student Sara Iverson
and NZP research zoologist Dr. Daryl Boness, and lacta-
tion strategies of harbor seals on Sable Island, Nova Sco-
tia, in collaboration with Dr. Boness and the Canadian
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Dr. Boness pursued
studies of California sea lion maternal investment on San
Nicholas Island and of the endangered Hawaiian monk
seal. He initiated studies of the behavior of the Juan Fer-
nandez fur seal and South American sea lion in Chile and

——

Argentina, both in collaboration with Smithsonian post-
doctoral fellow Dr. John Francis.

Research related to birds included DZR staff member
Dr. Eugene Morton’s continued work on Animal Vocal
Signals and Communication, a title in the Behavioral Bi-
ology Series of Cambridge University Press. Dr. Morton
also initiated studies in migrant bird demography and
comparative evolution of the martins and continued long-
term studies of a long-distance migrant bird, the Ken-
tucky warbler, at the zoo’s Conservation and Research
Center. Research associate Dr. Kim Derrickson began
studies of individual song and repertoire preference in
mockingbirds and continued studies of seasonal changes
in nest location and construction patterns in wild mock-
ingbirds. Research associate Russell Greenberg continued
research on neophobia (the fear of new surroundings and
new stimuli) in song and swamp sparrows and collabo-
rated with zoologists Dr. James Lynch of the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center and Dr. Samuel Droege
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to analyze bird cen-
sus data for possible trends related to tropical forest
deforestation. Susan Haig began a Smithsonian postdoc-
toral fellowship to study the genetics of the endangered
Guam rail and Micronesian kingfisher, two species for
which collaborative captive breeding programs provide
the only safeguard from extinction.

In other staff activity, Dr. Oftedal completed several
studies on green iguanas with Dr. Dagmar Werner and
the Iguana Management Project, Panama, and research
associates David Baer and Mary Allen of the NZP. Dr.
Lisa Forman evaluated genetic differences between the
three forms of Leontopithecus (lion tamarins). She also
established a working genetics laboratory at the Hospi-
tal/Research Building with facilities for DNA “finger-
print” analysis, cloning, and tissue culturing.

Construction and Support Services

Nineteen eighty-eight was a busy year for the construc-
tion of exhibits and facilities. The Office of Facilities
Management completed work on the Invertebrate Ex-
hibit, the renovation of the Panda House, the second
phase of the Olmsted Walk renovation, Gibbon Ridge,
the new veterinary hospital, the Komodo Dragon Ex-
hibit, the Waterfowl Wetlands Exhibit, the Mississippi
Fish Exhibit, the FONZ bookstore, Beaver Pool, and the
renovation of the Propagation Building. Work began on
a number of major projects: the renovation of the Ele-
phant House, the third phase of Olmsted Walk, the re-
placement of NZP’s high-voltage electrical system, and
the major renovation of the older Hospital/ Research
Building. The emphasis on the zoo as a biological park
has resulted in the installation of new planting beds and
the upgrading of existing ones.

The Office of Planning was created during 1988 to co-
ordinate major construction projects as outlined in NZP’s
revised master plan and to provide coordination among
capital construction, renovation and restoration, and in-
house repair. Esthetic overview, environmental assess-
ment, historic preservation, land-use planning, landscape
design, visitor impact, feasibility, and appropriate federal
commission reviews are part of the coordination process.

During 1988 the Office of Police and Safety was able to
solve the majority of the zoo’s radio communications
problems. The office administrative and technical staff
have been consolidated in one suite of offices, thus im-
proving the delivery of safety, security, and enforcement
services to the NZP. The Police Unit continues to keep
the park a safe place to visit and work.
Office of American Studies

Now in its twenty-first year, the program in graduate
education sponsored by the Office of American Studies
was designed to encourage research in the field of mate-
rial culture, using the collections and personnel of the
Smithsonian Institution’s many museums. Another origi-
nal purpose of the program was to overcome the separa-
tion then existing between university and museum
scholars. Through formal courses conducted at the Insti-
tution, graduate students from cooperating universities
are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities
that the national museums offer. Courses have dealt with
art, technology, and social, cultural, and political his-
tory. The research interests of participating students have
ranged from art to anthropology.

The 1987 fall semester seminar, “Material Aspects of
American Civilization,” focused on political culture and
the Constitution. The seminar was taught by Dr. Wil-
comb E. Washburn, director of the program, and Dr.
Bernard Mergen of George Washington University. Ten
students participated—six from George Washington Uni-
versity and four from the University of Maryland.

Other seminars during the past year included “The
Decorative Arts in America,” taught by Barbara G. Car-
son of George Washington University, and “Art in His-
tory,” taught by Dr. Lillian B. Miller of the Smithsonian’s
National Portrait Gallery. Thirty-six students partici-
pated in these seminars.

Two graduate students are pursuing specialized re-
search under the supervision of the office’s director. Dr.
Washburn continued his research in early exploration
and discovery, museum history, and anthropology.

Office of Fellowships and

Grants

At the Smithsonian, historical and anthropological ob-
jects, original works of art, natural history specimens,
living plants and animals, entire ecosystems, and even the
universe are available for study. The Institution and its
curators offer unparalleled resources, unavailable any-
where else and essential to many research projects.

Each year hundreds of scholars and students of art,
history, and science from the United States and abroad
come to the Smithsonian to use these unique resources.
The Office of Fellowships and Grants (OFG) develops
and administers the numerous programs designed to as-
sist researchers working at Smithsonian facilities in con-
junction with the Institution’s professional staff. These
academic programs, which include long- and short-term
residential appointments, are an important complement
to those offered by universities. Approximately 800 un-
dergraduate and graduate students and scholars received
awards administered by the OFG in 1988.

Programs for Visiting Students and Scholars

The office awarded eighty-eight predoctoral, postdoc-
toral, and senior postdoctoral Smithsonian Research Fel-
lowships in 1988, including nineteen foreign students from
sixteen countries. Participants in the twenty-three-year-
old fellowship program conduct independent studies un-
der the guidance of staff. Research is carried out in the
Institution’s bureaus or at field sites, usually over a pe-
riod of six to twelve months. Topics of study in 1988
spanned a range of scholarly interests, from the content
and function of audience talk in art and history museums
to the morphological analysis of asteroid larvae. Other
topics included sea otter genetics; black Christianity and
black society; Charles L. Freer and Japanese art; paleo-
ecology and site formation of Kanjera, Kenya; and rates
of molecular evolution in marine gastropods.

Twenty-three U.S. and six foreign students in the early
stages of their graduate training received ten-week fellow-
ships in 1988. These awards enabled the students to ex-
plore areas that they are considering as the subjects for
their dissertation research. They studied such topics as
American public ritual in the 1850s; form, style, and sym-
bolic content in Arctic fur clothing; material culture in
twentieth-century American life; and the physiological
ecology of competition between temperate forest vine and
tree species.

Smithsonian Institution Regents Fellows in residence in
1988 included David Kingery of the the Massachusetts

rn

|
Institute of Technology, who worked at the Conservation
Analytical Laboratory and the National Museum of
American History to study the role and development of
materials technologies. At the National Museum of
American Art, Albert Boime of the University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles, continued his research on nineteenth-
and twentieth-century American art.

George A. Michell received a fellowship in 1988 to con-
duct research on the arts in South Asia. The fellowship is
funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation Pro-
gram in the Humanities to support postdoctoral research
related to the programs of the National Museum of Afri-
can Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer
Gallery of Art.

The Faculty Fellowship Program encourages minority
faculty members to conduct research at the Smithsonian.
In 1988 seven awards were made for two- to four-month
periods. Some of the subjects Faculty Fellows studied
were Baltimore’s antebellum free black community; the
history of public health in nineteenth-century Washing-
ton, D.C.; the singing life of the Reverend Dr. Joseph
Johnson; and the costumes of nineteenth-century Afro-
Americans.

In addition to the Institution-wide programs funded
through the OFG, the office administers fellowships and
other awards supported with funds from bureau sources.
In all, there were ninety-two such awards in 1988 for
visitors who came to the Institution for varying periods.

At the National Air and Space Museum, this year’s
awards included appointments to the Daniel and Florence
Guggenheim, A. Verville, and International fellowships.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory offered four
postdoctoral and five predoctoral fellowships. Also this
year, the National Museum of American Art, in conjunc-
tion with the James Renwick Alliance, developed the
James Renwick Fellowship Program in American Crafts.
One senior and one graduate fellowship were awarded
under this new program, which encourages research in
the history of twentieth-century American art, crafts, or
design.

The Conservation Analytical Laboratory made seven
postgraduate internship awards for research and training
in areas ranging from art conservation to objects conser-
vation. These interns were appointed to a variety of SI
bureaus, including the Conservation Analytical Labora-
tory, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the National Museum
of African Art, the National Museum of American Art,
and the National Museum of American History.

The popularity of the OFG’s short-term visitor pro-
gram continues to grow, especially with participants from

developing regions of the world. In 1988 the program
assisted 138 scholars, including 74 international visitors
from 31 nations, who came to the Institution to conduct
research, examine collections, present seminars, and
coauthor publications with Smithsonian staff.

Under the OFG’s successful workshop program, scho-
lars in research, education, and museological fields gath-
ered to discuss issues of mutual or complementary
interest. Last year Smithsonian staff members organized
nineteen workshops. One of these, “Collections and Cul-
ture: Museums and the Development of American Life
and Thought,” was a joint venture of the Woodrow Wil-
son International Center for Scholars and the National
Museum of American History. Some of the other topics
included women in the progressive era, the coming of
modernism to Chicago, 1920-40, and the systematics of
sea cucumbers.

Internships and Other Programs

Internships continue to provide valuable experiences for
students and are becoming an integral part of many un-
dergraduate and graduate programs. The Office adminis-
ters all internship appointments supported with stipends.
In 1988 these included fifteen at the National Air and
Space Museum, four at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden, and three at the National Museum of Amer-
ican Art. Twelve students participated in the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center’s work-and-learn pro-
gram in environmental studies. At the National Museum
of Natural History, the Botany and Vertebrate Zoology
Departments offered new programs of stipend support
for twenty-four students. Fifty-six interns received sti-
pends from other bureaus.

Twelve students participated in the Smith College
Smithsonian Program in American Studies. The program
features a seminar course and research projects conducted
under the supervision of staff members.

High school students also took advantage of the Insti-
tution’s internship opportunities through the successful
programs offered by the Office of Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education (OESE). In 1988, forty-one students
participated in a five-week session designed to broaden
an existing academic or vocational interest. The OFG
also administered five appointments to the Teacher Intern
Program for the OESE.

The OFG supplemented these programs with efforts
aimed at increasing the participation of minority students
in Smithsonian research activities. Forty-six minority un-

75
dergraduate and graduate students from all over the
country were awarded internships to work in bureaus
and offices throughout the Institution.

In collaboration with the bureaus, the office continued
a program for Native American students and community
scholars, with sixteen short-term awards in 1988. The
scholars’ research projects included the Smithsonian’s
Seminole artifacts and materials, and prehistoric and his-
toric Pueblo textiles.

With the support of a grant from the Smithsonian Edu-
cational Outreach Program, the Office and Howard Uni-
versity offered the second session of a program to
promote minority interest in natural history. Students
from Howard, accompanied by two Howard faculty
members, spent a week at the Smithsonian Environmen-
tal Research Center participating in field exercises and
learning about staff research. Three other faculty mem-
bers from historically black colleges observed the course.
Faculty members then visited the Mall to learn more
about the Institution and opportunities for research and
study. The Office expects to expand this pilot program to
include other schools and fields of study.

The Office continued to administer cooperative educa-
tion appointments aimed at minority graduate students
whose research interests coincide with those of the Insti-
tution. In 1988 three students were in cooperative educa-
tion positions, working in professional research-related
jobs at the Smithsonian while continuing their university
education. The appointments hold the potential for per-
manent employment at the Smithsonian.

The Education Fellowship Program, which offers sup-
port for graduate study and research training, also con-
tinues to encourage the participation of minority students
in the Institution’s fields of interest. One fellow, a gradu-
ate student in anthropology, is continuing his studies at
the University of Massachusetts and spending the sum-
mer months conducting fieldwork in the Caribbean.

The Webb Fellowship Program, named in honor of Re-
gent Emeritus James E. Webb, is intended to promote
excellence in the management of cultural and scientific
nonprofit organizations. This year six professional staff
members from the Smithsonian were awarded fellowships
to enhance their administrative abilities. The recipients
came from the staffs of the National Portrait Gallery,
Conservation Analytical Laboratory, National Museum
of American Art, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Gar-
den, Office of Folklife Programs, and Office of Interna-
tional Relations.

The Scholarly Studies Program is a competitive grant
program that funds research by Smithsonian staff and

76

outside collaborators that falls outside the purview of tra-
ditional sources of support. As a result of two meetings
of a review committee composed of scholars from outside
the Institution, thirty-five one- and two-year grants were
awarded in 1988.

The Research Resources Program supports archival
projects that arrange, describe, preserve, and make avail-
able to scholars collections of major importance to re-
search in the arts, the sciences, and history. During the
first year of this pilot program, which was developed to
complement the Scholarly Studies Program, a review
committee of archivists from outside the Institution rec-
ommended that seven grants be awarded.

—EEEE—EE—————————————EE———
Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory

Is Earth unique? Or are there other planets orbiting stars
elsewhere in the Milky Way? Although most people be-
lieve that other stars may have planetary systems like the
one around our star, the Sun, the observational evidence
in support of this view has been very weak.

This year, scientists from the Smithsonian Astrophysi-
cal Observatory (SAO) obtained the first convincing evi-
dence for a planet circling a star other than our own.

They used a painstaking technique designed to detect
minute variations in a star’s motion caused by the gravi-
tational attraction of a companion body. The faint star
HD 114762, one very much like our Sun, at a distance of
some 90 light-years from Earth, was found to have a
slight periodic wobble due to a large planet in orbit about
it. Because the viewing angle of the orbit is still unknown,
the size of the planet cannot be calculated with any cer-
tainty, but it is most likely a giant body some ten to
twenty times more massive than Jupiter. The planet’s dis-
tance from HD 114762 is about the same as that of Mer-
cury from the Sun. Since HD 114762 is about as luminous
as the Sun, the planet would have ovenlike temperatures,
making it an unsuitable habitat for life. This discovery,
however, supports the speculation that other stars in our
galaxy have planetary companions—and that some of
them may even have conditions conducive to the develop-
ment of life and the evolution of intelligence.

Appropriately, the discovery of a low-mass companion
to HD 114762 was made at the Smithsonian-operated
Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts, with
an optical telescope located just a few yards from an 84-
foot radio receiver devoted exclusively to the search for
signals from a technologically advanced civilization else-
where in the universe.

These two unusual investigations underscore the some-
times unexpected, often complementary, and always ex-
citing nature of the diverse research programs of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Founded in 1890
by the Institution’s third secretary, Samuel Pierpont Lang-
ley, for studies of “the new astronomy,” the observatory
today prepares to celebrate its centennial as one of the
world’s premier centers for astrophysical research. From
_ oneering studies of solar-terrestrial relationships to the
establishment of a worldwide satellite-tracking network,
the SAO has been a leader in fields as diverse as the
application of new technology to telescope design, the
observation of cosmic x-rays, and the survey of large-
scale structure in the universe. Since its move to Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, in 1955, the SAO has been closely
associated with the Harvard College Observatory (HCO).
Their partnership in the Center for Astrophysics (CfA)

has allowed a broad interdisciplinary approach to re-
search that combines observations across the entire elec-
tromagnetic spectrum with theoretical studies to provide
a deeper understanding of the basic physical processes
shaping the cosmos.

Research programs are organized in seven divisions,
with efforts coordinated to complement each other. Data-
gathering facilities include telescopes at the Fred Law-
rence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins in Arizona
and at the Oak Ridge Observatory, and a millimeter-
wave radio telescope in Cambridge. In addition, SAO
scientists gain access to data from instruments aboard
rockets, balloons, and space satellites, as well as from
laboratory experiments.

On behalf of the International Astronomical Union,
the SAO operates two global science information ser-
vices. The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams
disseminates information about transient astronomical
phenomena such as comets and supernovas. The Minor
Planet Center computes orbits and provides observational
information on asteroids and serves as the official arbiter
of minor planet nomenclature.

In collaboration with Harvard, the SAO is conducting
an innovative program to develop secondary-school cur-
riculum materials that use examples from astronomy to
teach basic principles of physics and mathematics. This
year the SAO hosted a special Summer Institute for high
school teachers from around the country who critiqued
and refined teaching aids and classroom activities to be
field-tested in their home schools.

Highlights of the research conducted during the past
year in each of the observatory’s seven divisions follow.

Atomic and Molecular Physics

Almost all the information that comes from astronomical
objects is in the form of light. To understand the physical
conditions within those objects, as well as the intervening
medium through which the light travels, one must first
understand the complex atomic and molecular processes
that create the light and alter it during its long journey to
Earth. Through a combination of theoretical studies and
laboratory experiments, SAO scientists attempt to de-
scribe these processes.

In one such project, SAO scientists have studied how
the presence of unusually large molecules in space may
change our understanding of interstellar cloud chemistry.
Increasing evidence suggests that the interstellar medium
may be laced with giant molecules ranging in size from

UI
30 to 100 atoms each. These molecules may be the source
of infrared radiation seen near many astronomical bod-
ies. Moreover, the presence of such molecules, known to
researchers as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, appears
to resolve a discrepancy between astrophysical models of
diffuse interstellar clouds and observations by reducing
the abundance of singly charged atomic ions through a
process known as charge-transfer.

- Inside very hot astronomical bodies, a process known
as dielectronic recombination occurs, in which electrons
collide with positively charged atoms to form less highly
charged atoms. This process is particularly important in
high-temperature, low-density plasmas, such as those in
the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars. SAO scien-
tists have developed an extremely sensitive ion-beam ex-
periment to measure the dielectronic recombination rates
as a function of electric field for several ions present in
the solar corona, or outer atmosphere.

High-Energy Astrophysics

High-energy x-ray radiation is associated with some of
the most energetic—and violent—processes in the uni-
verse. Fortunately for humans, the Earth’s atmosphere
absorbs x-rays, but this also means all observations must
be made from balloons, rockets, or space vehicles. SAO
scientists are currently analyzing x-ray data from several
past space missions and are preparing instrumentation in-
tended for future spaceflight, including a High-Resolu-
tion Imaging Telescope to fly aboard the Advanced X-ray
Astrophysics Facility.

Clusters of galaxies, the largest aggregations of matter
yet recognized in the universe, can be studied by observ-
ing the x-ray emissions from the very hot gas filling the
space between individual galaxies. SAO scientists used x-
ray images from the Einstein Observatory satellite, which
completed its mission in 1981, and visible light observa-
tions of both large clusters and smaller groups of galaxies
to compare the amount of matter found in the galaxies
with that seen in the medium between them. They found
a much larger percentage of gas in the large clusters,

‘which suggests that galaxy formation (by condensation

out of the gaseous medium) may be more efficient in
smaller clusters.

Further studies will be aimed at determining how much
of the intercluster gas is primordial—left over from the
early formation of the universe—and how much has been
produced more recently by processes inside the stars. In-
deed, SAO scientists examining images of nearby galaxies
have already found some evidence that explosive forces in
galactic centers may be driving gas out into the surround-
ing space.

Although the Sun is not a particularly copious emitter
of x-rays, its 2-million-degree-Celsius gaseous outer at-
mosphere does radiate strongly at these wavelengths.
This year, a novel SAO-built x-ray telescope, equipped
with a modified Hasselblad camera and special high-sen-
sitivity film, was flown aboard a suborbital sounding
rocket to make extremely high spatial resolution images
of the hot corona.

Optical and Infrared Astronomy

Optical and infrared astronomy research at the Smithson-
ian Astrophysical Observatory ranges from studies of the
large-scale structure of the universe to the formation and
evolution of stars. In support of this research, the SAO
operates the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, site of
the Multiple Mirror Telescope, the world’s third largest
optical telescope, jointly run with the University of Ari-
zona. Other optical telescopes at the observatory are used
for large-scale surveys and other observations. A light
collector to meters in diameter, the most sensitive of its
type, is used for ground-based searches for high-energy
gamma rays. In collaboration with Harvard, the SAO
also operates the Oak Ridge Observatory, where a vari-
ety of instruments are employed for research ranging
from asteroid orbital determinations to galactic studies to
the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

The long-term program using a 1.5-meter telescope at
the Whipple Observatory to survey the distribution of
more than 10,000 galaxies has produced a striking three-
dimensional map that suggests that the galaxies are dis-
tributed on flattened sheets surrounding vast, bubblelike
voids, some more than 100 million light-years in diame-
ter. This year, the survey was extended to the Southern
Hemisphere through collaborative programs with obser-
vatories in Brazil and Argentina. The initial results indi-
cate that the large-scale structures seen in the northern
sky prevail throughout the universe.

79
SAO scientists and their collaborators reached a mile-
stone in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy when they
detected gamma rays from the Crab Nebula with the 1o0-
meter-diameter light collector. The observation estab-
lishes a “standard candle,” that is, a steady source of
gamma-ray emission at a known level against which to
search for and measure other, weaker sources in the sky.
It also offers new clues to the physical processes at work
within the expanding shell of that exploded star.

Planetary Sciences

Research in planetary sciences at the SAO strives to un-
derstand planets, satellites, and other small bodies of the
solar system, as well as the processes that created them
billions of years ago. Research continued this year on the
wealth of data provided by the European Space Agency’s
Giotto mission to Comet Halley in 1986, and a new study
is under way on the likely mode and place of comet
birth. As part of investigations on the mineral composi-
tion of meteorites, SAO scientists have calculated that the
original solar nebula must have been rich in oxygen, sug-
gesting that icy, cometlike, presolar material may have
vaporized and then recondensed without ever mixing
with the nebula’s gases.

Worldwide interest in Supernova 1987A continued to
play a major role in the record-breaking activity of the
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. An unprece-
dented number of reports on comets—sixteen new dis-
coveries and seventeen recoveries—added to the total of
messages received and transmitted this year.

Radio and Geoastronomy

Research in radio astronomy attempts to understand the
structure, evolution, energy sources, and ultimate fate of
those astronomical objects that emit radio waves. As pio-
neers in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), SAO
scientists use this radio observing technique to measure
directly drifts among the continents, to probe the interior
of the Earth, and to determine the distances to cosmic
sources and study their structures.

One major effort has been to measure the size of our
own galaxy and the distance to neighboring galaxies. By
charting the relative motions of water-vapor masers (am-
plified emissions of microwaves) surrounding a newly
formed massive star, scientists can determine the distance
to that star with high precision. This technique has been

80

used to measure the distance to the center of the Milky
Way, and this year new data yielded an even more accu-
rate value for this distance. Similar measurements were
made of maser complexes in the neighboring galaxy M33;
these measurements may make possible the first direct
determination of this galaxy’s rotation.

The large-scale structure of the Milky Way can be
probed and mapped by measuring the distribution of car-
bon monoxide gas, a molecule that emits strong radio
signals at millimeter wavelengths. This year SAO scien-
tists conducted the first complete survey of clouds of car-
bon monoxide, leading to the discovery that the inner
part of the Milky Way may contain as much matter in
molecular form as has been previously seen in the form
of atomic gas.

The SAO continued its leadership in the development
of instruments for astronomical research, including
highly stable atomic clocks built to support programs of
VLBI, deep-space tracking efforts, and national time-
keeping programs. The most novel instrument, an optical
interferometer constructed on Mount Wilson in Califor-
nia by the SAO in collaboration with several other insti-
tutions, began daily observations to determine the
position of stars with an accuracy Io to 100 times greater
than is possible with conventional telescopes.

Solar and Stellar Physics

Research in solar and stellar physics is concerned with
understanding the physical processes underlying the be-
havior of the Sun and other stars. Scientists study stars
like the Sun to understand the dependence of observed
properties on factors such as their age, their composition,
and their physical association with others in pairs and
groups. Of particular interest to SAO scientists is the be-
havior of hot gas under varied conditions—in the Sun’s
interior, in the outer atmospheres of stars, in the space
between stars, and in the material ejected by young stars
and supernovas.

One of the major puzzles of solar physics, for example,
is determining what process heats the Sun’s outer atmos-
phere and creates the powerful flow of gas and super-
charged particles called the solar wind that sweeps over
all the planets. An SAO-conceived instrument called an
Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer, designed to create
artificial eclipses and allow continuous observation of the
solar corona and study of the solar wind, has been se-
lected for flight aboard the international Solar Helio-
spheric Observatory in the mid-1990s.

To study magnetic activity cycles in other stars, SAO
scientists observe the relationship between this activity—
as evidenced by “spottedness” on a star’s surface—and
stellar rotation. For example, since one hemisphere of the
giant star Delta Coronae Borealis is covered with dark
regions, or “starspots,” its exact period of rotation has
been determined from accurate measurements of the star’s
periodic dimming. A new research tool being used for
these observations is the Automatic Photoelectric Tele-
scope, a relatively low-cost, fully automated instrument,
ideal for long-term monitoring of cyclic stellar brightness
variations. The SAO has established two such telescopes
at the Whipple Observatory, and plans are now under
way to develop a worldwide network.

Theoretical Astrophysics

Theoretical astrophysicists study the objects and systems
of the universe by means of mathematical analysis and
computer simulations. Although usually intended to in-
terpret observed phenomena, this research often results in
the prediction of new phenomena not yet seen. Among
other investigations last year, SAO scientists sought pos-
sible explanations for a number of phenomena, including
the cosmic background radiation thought to be a rem-
nant of the Big Bang, the manner in which large gas
clouds collapse to form galaxies, the properties of the
material spiraling into black holes, the instabilities in the
powerful winds expelled from stars, and the processes
that destroy globular clusters.

Globular clusters are dense, spherical congregations of
several million stars, usually found on the periphery of
the Milky Way. Among the oldest objects in the galaxy,
they may hold clues to its formation. The manner in
which globular clusters are destroyed becomes important
in accounting for observed differences between the orbits
of globular clusters and halo stars, also found outside the
main disk of our galaxy. In their investigations, SAO
theorists found that most of the initial population of clus-
ters had been destroyed by tidal disruption and that those
remaining have generally been distributed in orbits
aligned along the plane of the galaxy.

Smithsonian Environmental
Research Center

On 2,600 acres bordering the Rhode River, a tributary of
the Chesapeake Bay, Smithsonian scientists are contribut-
ing to a better understanding of complex environmental
phenomena and problems. Through the Smithsonian En-
vironmental Research Center (SERC), located in Edgewa-
ter, Maryland, they carry out long-term interdisciplinary
studies in the field and in the laboratory.

The center complements its research activities with ed-
ucational programs for students—from undergraduates to
postdoctoral fellows—and for the public. Teacher- and
docent-led tours acquaint the public with the center’s
mission and facilities. Hikes along the two-mile Discov-
ery Trail or center-organized canoe outings on the tidal
river introduce visitors to the wonders and fragility of the
coastal environment.

Through regular seminars, center researchers and their
counterparts from universities and governmental labora-
tories keep each other abreast of work and issues in areas
of mutual interest. In addition, the center organizes and
hosts scientific workshops on a variety of topics.

The center sponsored about thirty research seminars
for its staff and the public during 1988. Educational tours
and activities involved about 5,000 visitors. Approxi-
mately thirty undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
students conducted research projects at the center.

During 1988 the center’s facilities were expanded to
meet growing research needs. A 7,400-square-foot labo-
ratory wing was added to the main office and laboratory
building, and the building was renamed in honor of for-
mer U.S. Senator Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland, a
tireless champion of the Chesapeake Bay. An instrument
shop was also added to the shop building.

The following examples of 1988 research activities
show how SERC studies help unravel the complex web of
factors that influence the health of the environment. Re-
search is conducted by staff scientists, who represent a
diverse array of disciplines, and by visiting scientists and
students.

Impact of Air Pollution on Forests

Air pollution has many documented impacts on the de-
ciduous hardwood forests of the Chesapeake Bay drain-
age basin, including decreased physiological vigor,
leaching of nutrients, and the inhibition of photosynthe-
sis. Scientists at the Environmental Research Center have
measured a high correlation between daily ozone levels in
the Washington, D.C., urban area and at the center’s
research facility. Using a variety of approaches, they are

measuring the deposition of gases and fine particles in
these forest canopies. In a research tower constructed in a
tall tulip poplar forest, instruments enable scientists to
measure the forest’s photosynthesis, respiration, and effi-
ciency of trapping air pollutants. Initial studies to charac-
terize this forest with respect to peak basic ecological
parameters have found median leaf numbers at an eleva-
tion of seven to eight meters, median leaf mass at twenty-
two to twenty-three meters, and median leaf area at
eighteen to nineteen meters. Leaf stratification is species
specific and segregates into understory (zero meters to ten
meters), midcanopy (ten meters to twenty-five meters)
and overstory (twenty-five meters to thirty-seven meters).
Intensive studies of this forest will determine the rates of
wet and dry atmospheric deposition and measure the im-
pacts of these depositions on the vegetation and soil of a
forest, which has been carefully characterized for future
comparative purposes.

Woodland Bird Populations

In the past, the center’s researchers have investigated the
breeding habitat preferences and requirements of wood-
land birds in the Chesapeake Bay region. These studies
included the effects of forest fragmentation that results

82

from development and land usage (for example, farm-
ing). Most woodland bird species spend the majority of
their lives wintering in the tropics, so the staffs research
has expanded to investigate the impact of land manage-
ment in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico on these bird
populations. Overwintering migrants comprised forty-
two regularly occurring species and accounted for forty-
one of the individual bird species surveyed in a wide
range of natural and disturbed habitats. The preferred
habitat for most migrant species was tropical forest. Spe-
cies that preferred mature forest as their breeding habitat
in the Chesapeake region also preferred mature forest in
the tropics, while overwintering migrants that breed in
forest edge or field habitats avoided tropical forest. In the
course of this study, thirteen species of birds were re-
corded for the first time in the Yucatan peninsula; fifty-
six other species of birds were found in new locations.

Ant Identification

Ants are a diverse and important part of the Chesapeake |
landscape. This year, center staff published an annotated
checklist and key to the ninety ant species that occur on
the coastal plain lands of Maryland, Virginia, and Dela-
ware. This publication was designed as an aid to biolo-
gists interested in behavioral and ecological studies of
ants in the mid-Atlantic region. Seventy of these ant spe- _
cies have been collected at the center’s study site on the
Rhode River.

Greenhouse Effect on Tidal Marshes

The center is conducting the only current study of the
impact of increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in

the atmosphere—the “greenhouse effect”—on natural

plant communities. On a tidal marsh, experimental plant —
plots have been created in open-top chambers that are |
designed, built, tested, and calibrated for continuous car-
bon dioxide enrichment of the air. The chambers allow

the continuous measurement of plant photosynthesis, res-
piration, and water-use efficiency. The test atmosphere
composition was selected to simulate conditions predicted
for the Earth early in the twenty-first century, when the
warming of global temperature is expected to cause mas-
sive changes in the ecosystem. Long-term studies will al-
low investigators to assess whether plant communities
can acclimate to the altered atmosphere and whether spe-
cies composition in these communities will be affected.

In one of the plant species studied—Scirpus olneyii—
the elevated carbon dioxide levels resulted in greater pro-
ductivity. There was increased shoot density and fall dor-
mancy was delayed. On the other hand, there was no
effect on the growth of Spartina patens plants, probably
because of the nature of their photosynthetic mechanism.
Another aspect of the study focuses on the dynamics of
nitrogen nutrition in these plants. When exposed to in-
creased carbon dioxide, the Scirpus community showed
no increase in nitrogen assimilation, and scientists project
that this factor may limit the impact of increased carbon
dioxide levels on the productivity of this wetland area.

Narrow-Leaved Cattail Ecology

Tidal marshes of the Chesapeake are categorized as either
low- or high-elevation marshes. Low marshes, which
flood frequently at high tide, are dominated in the Rhode
River by narrow-leaved cattail. Field experiments have
shown that dead shoots provide vital aeration for under-
ground storage organs during the dormant season. Cut-
ting or bending dead shoots at the soil surface lowered
the oxygen concentrations in below-ground plant parts
and also lowered above-ground production and flowering
in the following growth season. Cutting had a greater
effect than bending. Dead shoots can be bent over by
wind or snow, destroyed by fire, or cut off by ice move-
ment or by animals such as muskrats. These natural dis-
turbances have significant effects on plant growth and
reproduction.

Self-Thinning in Wild Rice Populations

Plant ecologists have been interested in size variation and
self-thinning in plant populations for many reasons. As
natural plant populations mature, differences in self-thin-
ning between species help determine which species will
dominate. In managed plant populations, self-thinning
characteristics help managers determine optimal plant
spacing at each stage. The center’s staff have investigated
these aspects of a wild rice population in a Chesapeake
Bay freshwater tidal marsh. Size variability decreased
during the course of density-dependent mortality (self-
thinning). This effect was probably driven by competition
for light. These results have important implications for
plant evolution, since only those plants that survive this
self-thinning process will reproduce.

Blue Crab Ecology

The blue crab is a pugnacious predator in the Chesa-
peake Bay. One result of its aggressive activity is the fre-
quent loss of one or more legs. These legs can regenerate,
but the adverse effects of limb loss and regeneration are
not well understood. A study at the Environmental Re-
search Center found that 19 to 25 percent of the blue crab
population were missing at least one limb. The loss of
four or more limbs was rare.

In laboratory experiments, various limbs and combina-
tions of two limbs were removed and the long-term ef-
fects on growth and molting frequency were measured.
The loss of a single cheliped (large claw) did not alter the
molting frequency or the percentage of weight increase.
Multiple limb loss, however, significantly affected growth
rate. By the second molt, this effect was no longer ob-
served. Blue crabs regenerated 85 percent of a limb in the
first molt following limb loss. The rarity of multiple limb
loss in the natural population suggests that the popula-
tion’s overall growth rate is not seriously affected by limb
loss.
Smithsonian Institution
Archives

The Smithsonian Institution Archives (SIA) cares for the
Institution’s records and is responsible for documenting
Smithsonian history. As the Institution grows and diversi-
fies, so do its archival needs. To acquire, preserve, and
service an adequate historical record, the Archives must
anticipate future preservation and research requirements
and make effective use of new technologies. Toward that
end, the Archives has begun a decade of modernization
and development. Program reviews by the Archives staff
and the Smithsonian’s Management Committee, a study
conducted by American Management Systems, Inc., to
assess automation alternatives, and a conservation study
have all contributed to the Archives’ plans for the future.
In order to identify and coordinate the needs, interests,
and concerns of archives and special collections through-
out the Institution, a Smithsonian Institution Archives
and Special Collections Council was established and held
its first meetings during the year.

Major developments this year included the lease of in-
terim archives storage in the Northern Virginia suburbs
of Washington, D.C.; receipt of a grant from the Smith-
sonian Research Resources Program to conserve early
architectural drawings of Smithsonian buildings; develop-
ment of an automated data base for accession reports;
development of an automated box-labeling procedure;
and an Institution-wide seminar on the management re-
quirements of audiovisual records.

General Archival Program

During the year the Archives helped the newly appointed
archivist at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer Gal-
lery of Art formulate a mission statement. Assistance
with filing and information systems was provided to the
Office of Fellowships and Grants, the Office of Environ-
mental Management and Safety, and the Wilson Ouar-
terly. The Archives also advised the archivist of the
American Association of Museums Registrars Committee
and began a records survey of the Smithsonian Institution
Libraries.

Nearly 200 groups of records were accessioned this
year, including records of the museums and central ad-
ministrative offices, private papers of curatorial and sci-
entific staff, and records of professional societies. One of
the largest accessions was the papers of herpetologist
George W. Nace of the University of Michigan. Also ac-
cessioned were the papers of former Smithsonian research
associate and helminthologist Roman Kenk and those of
former curator of entomology Ralph E. Crabill. The ar-

An early twentieth-century photograph of a National Zoologi-
cal Park keeper feeding a pygmy hippopotamus was included in
the Archives’ first number in its new series Occasional Papers.
The “Guide to Animal-Related Records at the National Zoolog-
ical Park, 1887-1985” was written by Julie Hamman of Portland
State University.

chives received additions to the papers of entomologist
Curtis W. Sabrosky, botanist Floyd McClure, historian
Nathan Reingold, paleontologist Ellis L. Yochelson, and
paleontologist Charles L. Gazin.

This year the Herpetologists’ League and the American
Arachnological Society named the SIA as the repository
for their records. The Archives received additions to the
papers of the Crustacean Society, the American Society of
Zoologists, the American Association for Zoological No-
menclature, and several other professional societies.

Reference Service

The Archives staff answered nearly 1,400 inquiries and
provided almost 6,000 items and some 25,000 copies to
researchers. Smithsonian Institution Press Director Emeri-
tus Edward F. Rivinus wrote an article on the philatelic
interests of second Secretary Spencer F. Baird as a side-
light to his work on a biography of Baird. Harvard pale-
ontologist Stephen Jay Gould studied the fourth
Secretary, Charles D. Walcott, and his discovery of the
Burgess Shale locality, while paleontologist Ellis Yochel-
son continued his work on a biography of Walcott. Ar-
chives staff spent considerable time helping researchers
working on the Crow Ethnology Catalogue, which will

document the Smithsonian’s Crow Indian collection. The
staff and interns of the Office of Architectural History
and Historic Preservation continued to study the history
of the Natural History Building and the National Zoo-
logical Park.

The SIA added many new entries to the list of publica-
tions based on research using archives collections. These
included Exploring the West, by Herman J. Viola (Wash-

ington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 1987); “Meteo-

rology in America, 1814-1874: Theoretical, Observa-
tional, and Institutional Horizons,” by James R. Fleming
(Ph.D. dissertation, Princeton University, 1988); and “‘All

about Me Forgotten’: The Education of Caroline Healey °

Dall (1822-1912),” by Gary Sue Goodman (Ph.D. disser-
tation, Stanford University, 1987). A recent issue of Earth
Sciences History (volume 6, 1987,) contained three arti-
cles that draw on SIA collections: “James Hall and the
New York Survey,” by Michele L. Aldrich and Alan E.
Leviton; “Walcott in Albany, New York: James Hall’s
Special Assistant,” by Ellis L. Yochelson; and “Meek at
Albany, 1852-1858,” by Clifford M. Nelson.

The Research in Progress lecture series continued this
year with topics ranging from archaeology to aeronau-
tics. David J. Meltzer of Southern Methodist University
spoke on American archaeology at the turn of the cen-
tury. Tom Crouch, chairman of the Department of Social
and Cultural History at the National Museum of Ameri-
can History, discussed facets of his research for a biogra-
phy of the Wright brothers. The series closed for the year
with a lecture on “A Botanical Rivalry: Stephen Elliott,
William Baldwin, and the LeContes,” by George A. Ro-
gers, professor emeritus in the Department of History at
Georgia Southern College.

Projects

The Smithsonian Archives Oral History Project continued
interviews of Institution scholars and administrators in
1988. The collection now totals 316.5 hours of recording,
accompanied by 5,600 pages of transcripts. Interview top-
ics ranged from the history of systematic biology to the
development of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden.

The Smithsonian Videohistory Program, funded by the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, continued to support the
work of Smithsonian historians and curators to document
the history of science and technology using videotape. By
the end of the year the program had created nearly ninety
hours of videotape. Topics included the design and man-

ufacture of twentieth-century small arms; the observing
techniques in traditional ground-based astronomy; the
development of the first electronic digital computer; the
history of the Manhattan Project; and the role of the
Rand Corporation in aerial reconnaissance. The archives
historian began work on a multiyear project that will
trace the role of Smithsonian scientists as policy advisers
on the conservation of endangered species.

During 1988 the SIA’s ongoing survey of Smithsonian
photographic collections resulted in the second volume of
the Guide to Photographic Collections at the Smithson-
ian, to be published by Smithsonian Institution Press.
This volume serves as a guide to photographic collections
in the National Museum of Natural History, the Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute, the Smithsonian As-
trophysical Observatory, and the National Zoological
Park. Work has begun on the third volume, a guide to
art bureau photographic collections.

Surveying began during 1988 at the National Museum
of American Art. By the close of the year, collections
containing seven million photographs had been surveyed
and described. Project staff members also assisted more
than 125 photo collection managers and curators from
Smithsonian bureaus and outside organizations in solving
reference, management, and conservation problems in-
volving audiovisual resources.

Publications

In 1988 the Archives issued the first in a new series of
publications, Occasional Papers. The Guide to Animal-
Related Records at the National Zoological Park, 1887-
1985, the result of a survey undertaken to document regis-
tration records, was written by Julie Hamman, an intern
from Portland State University. Two new numbers in the
Guides to Collections series were published during the
year. William E. Cox was the author of the Guide to the
Papers of George Sprague Myers, circa 1903-1986, and
Undated. James A. Steed wrote the Guide to the Records
of the Office of the Secretary, (Samuel P. Langley),
1866-1927.

Smithsonian Institution
Libraries

With collections numbering more than one million vol-
umes, including more than 20,000 journal titles and
35,000 rare books, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries
(SIL) supports the Institution’s research and curatorial ac-
tivities and its programs for loan and information serv-
ices, publications, exhibitions, and public lectures. SIL
serves its users through a network of fourteen branch
libraries spread over thirty-eight locations throughout the
Washington, D.C., area and in New York City; Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts; Mount Hopkins, Arizona; and
the Republic of Panama. Personnel resources are en-
hanced through the service of fifty-two volunteers, many
young people who are participating in stay-in-school pro-
grams, and five interns, including a professional librarian
from Australia. SIL participates in the creation of a na-
tional bibliographic data base, Online Computer Library
Center (OCLC), with more than 18 million records and
8,000 member libraries, and makes its records available
through an on-line catalogue, accessible from more than
100 terminals.

A member of the Association of Research Libraries,
SIL is divided into three operational divisions—Research
Services, Collections Management, and Automated Sys-
tems—and a Planning and Administration Office. High-
lights of this year included the final stages of a multiyear
renovation, which continued in units of the Automated
Systems Division and in the Planning and Administration
Office.

Research Services

The Research Services Division provides library service
for Smithsonian staff, scholars from outside the Institu-
tion, and members of the public. In 1988 staff of the four-
teen branch libraries answered 74,160 reference questions
posed by on-site users and in telephone and written in-
quiries. The Museum Reference Center in particular ex-
perienced a surge of more than 3,500 additional requests
for information, many from foreign countries planning
new or expanded museum ventures.

In order to provide additional information on a num-
ber of topics of continuing interest, the staff developed
more than a dozen new bibliographies. These range from
an annotated bibliography on the Victorian garden in the
United States, prepared by the Office of Horticulture
branch library, to a bibliography on the golden-lion tam-
arin written for the National Zoo branch library. These
two branches, as well as branches in the National Mu-
seum of African Art and the Anthropology Department

86

of the National Museum of Natural History, prepare
monthly lists that alert potential users to newly acquired
materials in the SIL collections.

Providing appropriate research materials to readers is
another important function of the Research Services Divi-
sion. This year, SIL circulated almost 67,000 items to
borrowers within and outside the Institution. Of these,
nearly 38,000 volumes were from the SIL collections. The
remainder were borrowed from other libraries to meet
the needs of Smithsonian researchers, were photocopied
from materials in the SIL collections, or were obtained in
photocopy from other libraries or from a commercial
document delivery service. Of the loans made in all for-
mats, close to 7,000 went by interlibrary loan to libraries
outside the Institution for use by their patrons.

The third area of focus for Research Services staff was
the improvement of physical facilities in several SIL
branches through renovation, expansion, or rearrange-
ment to make better use of available space. The branch
at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center ac-
complished the greatest leap forward. Thanks to the cen-
ter’s willingness to make available and remodel a large
area, the library is for the first time properly housed with
room for expanded collections and study space. The Re-
mote Annex on North Capitol Street in Washington,
D.C., was expanded and renovated to ensure the long-
term survival and immediate accessibility of the collec-
tions housed there. Especially critical was the installation
of air-conditioning. At the National Museum of Ameri-
can History (NMAH), about half of the branch library
collections previously stored in the first-floor storage
area, including serials, auction catalogues, and encyclo-
pedias, were moved to the new and improved facilities at
the Remote Annex. The other half, principally the trade
literature collection, is being housed in a temporary area
in the museum awaiting the completion of the Dibner
Study Center. As at the NMAH branch, the shifts and
changes at the National Air and Space Museum branch
library were undertaken at the museum’s instigation in an
effort to solve space problems. Compact shelving was in-
stalled in order to consolidate the branch’s collection and
release space for the construction of museum offices.

In the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH),
the Botany Library has been renovated and expanded and
the collections shifted to improve their accessibility. Simi-
larly, the Anthropology Department is providing addi-
tional space in which to erect stacks and relieve
overcrowding. Concurrently, the SIL is continuing to
merge the collections from the Bureau of American Eth-
nology and the Smithsonian Office of Anthropology. The

named.

collections in the Mollusks, Fishes, and Kellogg libraries
have also been shifted to achieve greater accessibility.
The NMNH library staff and users continue to enjoy the
remodeled main branch space, which was officially inau-
gurated with a gala open house early in the fiscal year.

The new branch at the National Museum of African
Art is also enjoying a positive response from its users.
Branch use has increased substantially since it moved to
its new facility. The branch was named in honor of
Warren M. Robbins, founder and director emeritus of
the National Museum of African Art.

Collections Management

Selection, acquisition, deaccession, and preservation are
the management activities of this division, which is re-
sponsible for the maintenance of the more than one mil-
lion volumes and other research resources that form the
libraries’ collections. In June the Institution transferred
the Smithsonian International Exchange Service (SIES),
formerly known as the Office of Publications Exchange,
to the libraries. On behalf of U.S. universities, institutes,
and other nonprofit organizations, SIES receives, sorts,
and ships scholarly materials to their foreign counterparts

and, in turn, receives foreign publications for domestic
distribution. Established in 1848, SIES is one of the
Smithsonian’s oldest continuous programs and provides
an important link among scholarly communities here and
abroad.

Through its own exchange program, SIL acquires valu-
able research materials by agreements with 3,500 official
exchange partners throughout the world. This year the
division staff began to review and reactivate journal sub-
scriptions (more than two-thirds of SIL’s active subscrip-
tions) that come from foreign universities and research
organizations in exchange for Smithsonian publications.
This is an especially important task in the light of recent
dramatic price increases in journal subscriptions, pro-
voked in part by the rapid fall of the dollar against for-
eign currencies since 1985.

SIL added a new Preservation Services unit to the divi-
sion roster in February 1988 to develop and implement
programs to improve the life span of non-rare books and
journals. Unit responsibilities include binding paperback
volumes and journal issues, microfilming brittle books,
and improving the care and maintenance of collections.
Improved procedures and enhanced funding enabled the
unit to bind approximately 13,000 volumes in 1988, an
increase Over previous years.

Books and journals containing highly acidic paper are
in the most danger of deterioration. SIL’s Book Conser-
vation Laboratory has installed a new nonaqueous “soft-
spray” deacidification system to neutralize acids in paper
and protect it against further acid-caused damage. The
convenient, reliable system lowers considerably the cost
of treating books and flat papers. The system has been
useful this year in conserving SIL’s collection of books
and journals owned by James Smithson, the Institution’s
founder.

To protect brittle volumes until they can be micro-
filmed, SIL places them in specially constructed boxes. A
grant from the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian
Associates in 1988 enabled SIL to construct boxes to pro-
tect several hundred late-nineteenth-century volumes per-
taining to Native American languages.

SIL’s African art collections were greatly enhanced by
Helen Segy’s gift of the library of her late husband, Lad-
islas Segy. A pioneer in the field of African art, Mr. Segy
opened one of the first African art galleries in 1952 in
New York City and ran it until his death in 1987. The
gift includes books, journals, slides, photographs, and
field notebooks. SIL honored another major donor who
passed away this year, Dr. Bern Dibner, by purchasing a
rare work on natural philosophy, Gines Rocamora y

87
Torrano’s Sphera del universo (Madrid: Juan de Herrera,
1599) as a memorial volume. A 1988 award from the
James Smithson Society enabled SIL to purchase one of
the rarest eighteenth-century books on the history of pap-
ermaking, Versuche und Muster ohne alle Lumpen oder
doch mit einem geringen Zusatze derselben Papier zu
machen, by Jacob Christian Schaeffer (Regensburg: 1765-
1771). The volume has special significance for the Smith-
sonian. In 1856, the Washington Star reported that the
Institution had acquired a copy of the 1772 edition,
which may have been lost in the 1865 fire in the Castle,
since no evidence or record of it exists.

Automated Systems

SIL increasingly uses electronic technology for most of its
processing functions, both for internal library operations
and for resource-sharing and communication with other
libraries. The Institution’s Bibliographic Information Sys-
tem (SIBIS), installed in 1984, is the major mechanism for
most SIL automated functions. It provides an on-line sys-
tem with a central data base of bibliographic informa-
tion. Manual processes and files are gradually being
replaced with electronic processing and machine-readable
files that can be updated and accessed from most of SIL’s
scattered locations. In 1988 SIL completed the basic con-
version of its records from standard manual files to ma-
chine-readable format. This conversion program, begun
in 1981, has added a total of 375,000 records to the data
base. The program is now directed toward upgrading
and converting partial and substandard records.

SIL planned and implemented new phases of the SIBIS
automated system this year. The SIBIS circulation system,
which will be phased in gradually, will be operational in
the first branch in October 1988. Approximately 425,000
volumes in the SIL collections represented in the on-line
catalogue were bar-coded to allow for electronic identifi-
cation and circulation control. SIL implemented a new
capability in the SIBIS acquisitions module this year: an
automatic claim for books ordered, but not received. The
acquisitions module is also used for on-line ordering,
processing orders, account maintenance, interface with
the Institution’s Accounting Office, and on-line access to
order information. The SIBIS electronic mail system, in
use for two years, has fostered better and faster interof-
fice communication among SIL staff.

During 1988 SIL continued to catalogue previously un-
catalogued gift and trade literature collections. In addi-
tion to in-house work, almost 13,500 titles were

88

catalogued by contract. More than 2,300 trade catalogues _

were indexed and added to SIL’s on-line catalogue by
July 1988. SIL also began cataloguing rare items in the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum branch.

Public Programs

In February SIL honored Dr. Bern Dibner, who died Jan-
uary 6, 1988, with a memorial exhibition that featured
memorabilia highlighting his life and accomplishments. A
concurrent exhibition was held at the Burndy Library,
which he founded in Norwalk, Connecticut. Dr. Dibner
collected the 10,000 books and 1,600 manuscripts that
the Burndy Library donated to the Institution in 1974,
forming the core of the Dibner Library of the History of
Science and Technology, a part of SIL’s Special Collec-
tions Branch.

As a member of the Washington Collegium for the Hu-
manities (WCH), SIL presented a public lecture for the
1988-89 Lecture Series, “Death and the Afterlife in Art
and Literature.” Professor Betty Jo T. Dobbs of North-
western University gave an illustrated lecture, “Alchemi-
cal Death and Resurrection: Alchemy in the Age of
Newton,” featuring Newton manuscripts in the library’s
collections.

SIL published catalogues for two of its exhibitions,

“Book Conservation Laboratory Tenth Anniversary Exhi- —

bition” and “Marbled Papers in Books.” An exhibition of
selected issues of nineteenth- and twentieth-century jour-
nals purchased from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia
were displayed in the Dibner Library. A new book pub-

lished in the Translation Publishing Program, Description |

of the Tula Weapon Factory (originally published Mos-

cow, 1826), was distributed to 170 domestic and foreign
libraries and deposited in the National Technical Infor-

mation Service for permanent accessibility. “Information
for Borrowers,” incorporating guidelines for SIL’s auto-

mated circulation system, was published for distribution
to users of the libraries’ system.

Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute

The luxuriance of the natural world peaks in the tropics,
which shelter the earth’s greatest diversity of plants and
animals. Tropical organisms exhibit the greatest variety
of ways to live and reproduce, and the relationships be-
tween different species are most complex and elaborate in
the tropics. Just as this stunning abundance of life was a
revelation and a stimulus to early evolutionary biologists
like Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, so it is
to modern biologists.

The rapid disappearance of tropical habitats requires
us to learn as many lessons as they have to offer, as
quickly as possible. A greater understanding of why natu-
ral communities in the wet tropics are so lush may sug-
gest how humanity can live in tropical habitats without
ruining their beauty or productivity. Indeed, a knowledge
of how tropical habitats interact with global ecosystems
may be critical to the ultimate ability of humans to sur-
vive anywhere on this planet.

Scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Insti-
tute (STRI) work to increase our knowledge in these and
other areas of tropical biology. STRI is a premier interna-
tional center for tropical research and is recognized as an
international mission by the Republic of Panama. The
institute’s twenty-seven scientific staff and scores of visit-
ing scientists carry out basic research on the ecology, be-
havior, and evolution of tropical plants and animals and
are concerned with how man’s past and present activities
in the tropics affect biological processes. In addition, the
institute supports international education and training in
its research areas and encourages the conservation of
tropical flora, fauna, and cultures.

STRI’s unique geographic location in the Republic of
Panama and the variety of its facilities offer students and
Visiting scientists from around the world access to a rich
diversity of terrestrial and marine environments. STRI
scientists also conduct research elsewhere in the tropics
and collaborate with colleagues at research institutions
worldwide.

The institute administers the Barro Colorado Nature
Monument, which protects more than 13,000 acres of
tropical forest surrounding the Panama Canal. The cen-
terpiece of this monument is Barro Colorado Island.
STRI also maintains three marine laboratories, on the
Pacific coast near Panama City, on the Caribbean coast
near Colon, and in the San Blas Archipelago in the Ca-
ribbean. STRI sponsors research at these and other sites
through a variety of resources. In addition to its own
scientific staff, STRI supports predoctoral and postdoc-
toral fellows for periods of two months to three years.
Visitors and staff have access to an extensive reference

library, and STRI provides housing, office, and labora-
tory space for visiting scientists for a modest fee.

In 1988 STRI continued its long record of progress and
achievement in research, facilities development, and in-
ternational education and conservation. The number of
research publications from work done at the institute
should exceed the more than 200 published in 1987. Two
STRI scientists received major honors for their research.
The bureau opened a new cloud forest research station,
and construction neared completion on the state-of-the-
art Earl Silas Tupper Research Center.

Honors

Basic to understanding any biological phenomenon is a
sound grasp of the natural history of the organisms con-
cerned. Two STRI naturalists have been signally honored
for such work this past year. The election of Dr. Mary
Jane West Eberhard to the National Academy of Sciences
was a fitting tribute to STRI’s tradition of research in
ethology, ecology, and evolution. Dr. Eberhard has stud-
ied the social organization of wasp colonies, the circum-
stances by which a queen wasp comes to dominate a
colony, and the extent to which she can cause her fellow
colony members to work together for her benefit. These
studies show the important role sexual selection and
other forms of social competition play among all social
animals, and they shed much light on how social behav-
ior can evolve.

Dr. Philip De Vries, who has been a predoctoral and a
postdoctoral fellow at STRI, recently received an unsoli-
cited award from the MacArthur Foundation to support
him and his research for five years. He is studying riodi-
nid caterpillars which, when alarmed by potential insect
predators, produce sounds that attract certain ants to
protect them. Fellows at STRI have always made impor-
tant contributions to our understanding of Barro Colo-
rado Island and other sites, and it is satisfying to see
them suitably honored.

Research Highlights: Sexual Selection and Behavior

Environmental biologists have argued that sexual selec-
tion can be an important agent of biological diversifica-
tion. In species where males compete for matings, novel
ways of attracting or stimulating females are at a pre-
mium. Coevolution between male attractions and female

replaced several bridges in Soberania National Park, one of the
most accessible lowland tropical forests in the new world.

responses to them is, however, an unpredictable process.
If a population is geographically divided, this process can
develop differently in the different subpopulations. Even-
tually, females of one may find themselves not attracted
by, or even unable to mate with, males from the other,
rendering the two groups distinct species. Thus, under-
standing the circumstances that favor effective sexual se-
lection, and the mechanisms by which it works, may help
us understand how species originate.

Dr. David Zeh, a three-year postdoctoral fellow at
STRI, is studying a species of pseudoscorpion in a lineage

90

that disperses by riding large beetles. They disperse from
one dead fig tree to another under the elytra, or wing
cover, of a species of harlequin beetle whose larvae usu-
ally occur in dead fig trees. Mites, which the pseudoscor-
pions eat, also live under the elytra of these beetles,
providing sufficient food to maintain male pseudoscor-
pions for at least three weeks.

Dr. Zeh’s species is the only one of its lineage where
males are markedly larger than females. This kind of dif-
ference is usually a sign of sexual selection based on com-
bat between males. And indeed, these males establish
mating territories under the elytra of their beetles. Dr.
Zeh is interested in how the males compete for mates,
what constitutes an attractive mating territory, and, more
generally, why sexual selection is so much more effective
in this species than in its relatives.

Dr. John Christy of the STRI staff is studying sexual
selection in fiddler crabs, Uca beebei, which live on mud
flats of the Pacific coast. Many males build a pillar of
mud next to their burrows. Forty-eight percent of the
females courted by males with pillars enter the males’
burrows, while only 20 percent of those courted by males
without pillars do so. Yet once a female enters a burrow,
the length and depth of the burrow, but not the presence
or absence of a pillar, affect her decision whether to stay
and breed. When frightened, fiddler crabs are more likely
to flee into a burrow with a pillar. An unanswered ques-
tion is, why don’t all males build pillars? They seem easy
to build, and Dr. Christy’s experiments show that the
pillars do not attract predators or unwanted intruders.
Moreover, males without pillars do court females, a
vastly more energetic business than building pillars.

Dr. A. Stanley Rand of the STRI staff is continuing his
study of sexual selection in tungara frogs, testing females
to determine which aspects of the complex male call
make it preferred to the simpler call. Working with Dr.
Michael Ryan of the University of Texas, Dr. Rand is
asking whether the complex call stimulates part of the
female’s auditory apparatus that the simpler call does not
or, in other words, whether the complex call exploits a
sensory capacity of the females that can be pleasurably
stimulated.

Tungara frogs call only when floating in the water,
and they produce waves on the water surface with each
call. Dr. R. Stimson Wilcox of the State University of
New York has “recorded” these surface waves and
“played them back” to male frogs. The males responded
to the waves of water as if they were hearing real calls
and adjusted their own accordingly.

Kyle Summers, STRI predoctoral fellow from the Uni-

ersity of Michigan, is studying mating behavior in Den-
drobates auratus on Taboga Island, a few miles beyond
aos. Another study of mating behavior is being carried
ut by postdoctoral fellow Christopher Peterson, who is
ooking at the simultaneously hermaphroditic coral reef
fish Serranus tabacarius at STRI’s San Blas field station.
Among the tropical forest’s most characteristic features
is the stunning variety of insects. Yet they are difficult to
study and, with a few spectacular exceptions, are poorly
nown. As a result, many species are not even named,
nd most of the named species can only be identified by
xperts. We know, however, that they play a fundamen-
al role in the life of the forest: They may actually be
esponsible for the great diversity of tropical trees. The
mazing differences in their habits from one species to
he next may help us grasp general principles governing
he evolution of social behavior.

Dr. Donald Windsor of the STRI staff, along with re-
earch associate Dr. Henry Stockwell, is surveying the
ecology and social behavior of the 120 species of cassi-
dine beetle in Panama. Dr. Windsor has found host
lants for more than forty of these species. Their larvae
Il feed on fast-growing secondary foliage of several dif-
erent plant families. No one species of larva, however,
as yet been found to feed on more than one genus or
ore than two species within that genus, suggesting a
pecialization to particular food plants of the type thought
o maintain plant diversity. The idea is that insect spe-
ialists depress the numbers of their own host plant, al-
Owing room for different species that they cannot eat.
he beetles vary greatly in behavior, and Dr. Windsor is
2xploring possible explanations for this diversity.

Dr. Allan Herre, a STRI postdoctoral fellow, is study-
ng the effects of parasitic nematodes on fig-pollinating
wasps. This study should shed light on the circumstances
hat allow natural selection to transform parasitic rela-
ionships into mutually beneficial ones, a fundamental
drocess in evolution.

STRI staff scientist Dr. William Eberhard is completing
study of the relationship between the shapes and the
ses of the pinchers on the hind ends of male earwigs.
ike beetle horns, earwig pinchers have diverse, fre-
uently elaborate shapes, often characteristic of a partic-
lar species. But unlike male beetles, which use their
orns almost exclusively to fight for access to females,
ale earwigs also use their pinchers as threat devices,
ourtship devices, and to clasp hold of a female during
opulation. The role of these pinchers in sexual selection,
Owever, may be the primary reason why shapes usually
iffer from species to species.

Research Highlights: Molecular Evolution

This year marked the beginning of the new program in
molecular evolution at the Smithsonian. Research at
STRI is a major component of this initiative at the fron-
tiers of evolutionary biology. This new capability permits
STRI scientists to address fundamental questions about
the origin and integrity of species. When the Isthmus of
Panama rose from the sea several million years ago, it
geographically separated the populations of marine spe-
cies that occurred in the area. Many of these organisms
are now distinct species.

Staff scientist Dr. Harilaos Lessios and new staff scien-
tist Dr. Eldredge Bermingham asked whether proteins in
species of sea urchins on either side of the Isthmus evolved
at a different rate than the DNA in their mitochondria,
which are organelles found inside cells. They found that
the DNA evolves at a much more regular rate than the
proteins. The results imply that mitochondrial DNA is a
much better “molecular clock” than proteins for estimat-
ing the amount of time a given pair of species has been
separate.

Dr. Lessios and former postdoctoral fellow Dr. James
Weinberg, now of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti-
tution, compared proteins from populations of the small
crustaceans called isopods from different Atlantic and Pa-
cific beaches in Panama. They were surprised to find
smaller differences between oceans than between different
beaches on the same ocean. Practically every beach in the
eastern Pacific is characterized by populations with unique
genetic structure, even over distances of less than one-
sixteenth of a mile. The low dispersal ability of these
animals probably accounts for this striking effect.

Along with Dr. Howard Lasker of the State University
of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo, Dr. Lessios also exam-
ined the variability of proteins in a species of gorgonian,
a soft coral. The species exhibited absolutely no variabil-
ity, even from populations as distantly separated as the
Bahamas and Panama. The cause of this uniformity re-
mains a puzzle. Dr. Lessios and Daniel Brazeau of SUNY
Buffalo found that another species exhibited high varia-
bility. Yet this latter species tends to occur in clones of
asexually produced offspring, which in theory should be
genetically uniform. Much remains to be learned from
the gorgonians.

Research Highlights: Seasonal Rhythms

The tropics are not usually thought of as particularly sea-
sonal in nature. Yet the Panamanian climate creates a

91
strikingly cyclical alternation of wet and dry seasons.
While physical seasonality in Panama is not nearly as ex-
treme as in the temperate zone, research at STRI has
shown that animals and plants respond significantly to
the changes that do occur.

STRI scientist Dr. John Cubit and his associates have
just published a fifteen-year record of different climatic
variables for the reef flat at Galeta and the ways different
aspects of the physical environment respond to those var-
iables. Dr. Donald Windsor is preparing a similar docu-
ment for Barro Colorado Island.

Dr. Robert Stallard of the U.S. Geological Survey in
Denver has been monitoring seasonal changes in the
chemical content of streams draining different soils on
Barro Colorado Island. From these data he can deduce
the chemical processes responsible for weathering these
soils and the impact of those processes on soil fertility at
different seasons.

Michael Keller, a graduate student at Princeton Univer-
sity, is assessing the net contribution of methane to the
atmosphere from various habitats of central Panama. In
Panama, perennially flooded habitats release methane.
Seasonal swamps release methane when flooded and sud-
denly start consuming it when dry. Upland forest soils
(but apparently not vegetation) consume methane more
rapidly during the dry season than during the rainy
season.

Jaime Cavalier, a STRI predoctoral fellow from the
University of Cambridge, is comparing the seasonal
rhythm of root production on Barro Colorado Island, at
nearby Gigante, and at the cloud forest near Fortuna on
the Chiriqui Highlands. On Barro Colorado, he finds
that irrigation abolishes the seasonal rhythm of root pro-
duction. In the cloud forest, the peak flush of new roots
occurs during the driest months, and root production is
much lower than at Gigante.

Seasonal rhythms in climate influence the timing of leaf
flush, leaf fall, and fruit production. The resulting sea-
sonal alternation of feast and famine in fruit and new
leaves is thought to regulate animal populations. Deci-
phering those features of climate that affect leaf and fruit
production of different plants will allow us to infer from
the climatic record the reliability with which the forest
supplies food to different kinds of animals.

Dr. Joseph Wright of the STRI staff is completing a
four-year field experiment assessing the effect on different
kinds of plants of keeping the soil saturated all year and
thereby mitigating the effects of the annual dry season.
Canopy and midstory trees were, for the most part, little
affected, but irrigation increases the total year-round leaf

92

production of understory shrubs, such as Piper and Psy-
chotria species.

Dr. Alan Smith and Dr. Joseph Wright, STRI scien-
tists, and Dr. Stephen Mulkey of the University of Mis-
souri at St. Louis are studying the different ways that
understory shrubs adjust to seasonal variation in water
supply. Psychotria marginata makes one set of leaves
early in the rainy season and another set very late. As one
might expect, the second set of leaves is designed for the
dry season. During the early dry season, they photosyn-
thesize more per unit of water transpired than the leaves
designed for the rainy season. Another shrub, Psychotria
limonensis, produces long-lived leaves throughout the
year. A particular leaf changes physiologically from one
season to another, improving its overall performance as a
result. Psychotria furcata, however, produces 90 percent
of its leaves early in the rainy season. They are well
suited to wet conditions, but very poorly suited for the
dry season. A close link appears to occur between the
rhythm of leaf production and the conditions for which
the leaves are suited.

This year, STRI fellow Dr. Jacalyn Giacalone of Up-
sala College continued a long-term study of frugivorous
mammals, red-tailed squirrels, and agoutis (burrowing
rodents) on Barro Colorado Island. Dr. Giacalone also
began following brocket deer, finding that during the dry
season they eat mostly leaves, flowers, and fruit newly
fallen from the forest canopy.

Dr. Nicholas Smythe of the STRI staff found that seeds
of the palm genus Astrocaryum can only germinate and
grow if buried by agoutis. During the season of fruit
shortage, the animals depend heavily on buried seeds.
The dormancy of Astrocaryum seeds varies greatly. Some
germinate in a month, and some remain dormant but
viable through three successive seasons of fruit shortage.

STRI scientist Dr. Ross Robertson is exploring what
factors govern seasonal rhythms of reproduction in coral
reef fish. Do they reproduce when conditions are good
for adults or when their larvae can best survive in the
plankton? To address this question, Dr. Robertson simul-
taneously records reproductive activity and recruitment
of larvae from the plankton at various reefs in the San
Blas Islands. He finds that adults breed when they can,
regardless of the prospects for their larvae.

Research Highlights: Effects of Catastrophes
and Disturbances

To what extent are the fates of various populations gov-
erned by occasional catastrophes? With the passage of
time, STRI has witnessed several such events and moni-
tored their effects. The 124-acre Forest Dynamics Project
plot of old forest on Barro Colorado Island was re-
mapped in 1985-86. Dr. Stephen Hubbell of Princeton
University found that 16 percent of the trees over 10 cm
in trunk diameter had died since 1980-81. This figure
amounts to a death rate of more than 3 percent per year.
Earlier, more limited studies in the same place had indi-
cated death rates of 1 percent per year. Apparently, the
very severe E] Nino dry season of 1982-83 killed one-
tenth of the trees on the plot. The next recensus in 1990
will enable STRI scientists to judge the long-term effects
of this event.

A group led by STRI scientist Dr. Jeremy Jackson and
managed by Dr. Brian Keller continues its study of the
consequences of the April 1986 Caribbean oil spill. Corals
have been sliced and x-rayed to assess recent changes in
growth rate. For all species of coral, the growth rate has
declined during the last five years, perhaps because the
die-off in 1983 of long-spined sea urchins (Diadema antil-
larum) has allowed greater competition from the algae
the Diadema were eating. Coral growth was particularly
low during the year of the oil spill. This study will be
extended to older corals to place the effects of the oil spill
in perspective, to monitor the effects on coral growth of
recent nearby reforestation, and perhaps to assess the ef-
fects of the disappearance of Indians and subsequent for-
est regrowth after the Spanish conquest.

The oil spill project may force a reconsideration of evi-
dence in intertidal ecology, which relies heavily on the
results of small-scale field experiments. Such experiments
have established the causes of zonation and the models of
population regulation of rocky shores of the temperate
zone. One cannot infer, however, the results of a wide-
spread calamity such as a Diadema die-off or a major oil
spill from small-scale Diadema removals or applications
of oil. The scale of the calamity alters the community’s
owers of recovery.

Research Highlights: Anthropology

nthropological researchers at STRI are seeking to recon-
struct the history of human settlement in Panama. To a
arge extent, this history can be inferred from the history
f vegetation recorded in sequences of pollen and phyto-
iths in lake sediments. But the history of the vegetation is
interesting for many other reasons. Was the forest largely
leared before the arrival of Columbus? Was Panama

uch drier or much cooler 15,000 years ago than it is

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s new high-speed
launch for Barro Colorado Island being placed in Gatun Lake in
November 1987.

now? Answers to these questions could reveal how quickly
tropical forest recovers from widespread disturbances.

As part of this study, new STRI staff scientist Dr. Do-
lores Piperno and visiting scholars Dr. Paul Colinvaux
and Dr. Mark Bush, both of Ohio State University,
bored and lifted a 60-meter-long core, spanning over
35,000 years, from a lake near El Valle. They also con-
tinued their study of a 14,000-year core from La Ye-
guada, a lake in the highlands of Veraguas. Their results
indicate that more than 12,000 years ago the vegetation
zones near La Yeguada were 800 meters lower than they
are now, suggesting that the climate was much cooler
then. Carbon from fires set by humans first appeared in
the lake 11,200 years ago. Temperatures there attained
present-day levels about 8,600 years ago. Pollen and
other traces of maize appeared in the lake 7,000 years
ago.

Mediating between Man and Nature
With support from the W. Alton Jones Foundation, five
years ago STRI initiated research on how man could live

in profitable harmony with tropical nature. Among the
projects started then is Dr. Nicholas Smythe’s continuing

93
study of the domestication of the paca, a small mammal
considered a delicacy. Wild pacas are exceedingly aggres-
sive toward each other, and Dr. Smythe has sought ways
to make them more tolerant in populations dense enough
for commercial exploitation. He has scored a signal suc-
cess: Fifteen young have now been born, one or both of
whose parents were born in the colony and “tamed” by
being with other pacas when young. This second genera-
tion of pacas was not forced to live together, yet the
female offspring are living happily and unaggressively in
a group with one male. Without human intervention,
they have learned from their parents how to be social
animals—a truly novel behavior for pacas.

Dr. Dagmar Werner is completing her project on rais-
ing iguanas for commercial exploitation and reintroduc-
tion to the wild. She plans to continue iguana work with
the National University of Costa Rica’s master’s program
in wildlife management in Heredia, Costa Rica.

STRI scientist Dr. Gilberto Ocana is continuing his ex-
periments with reclaiming soils ruined by fire and over-
grazing. He has planted two and a half acres of old
pasture with three leguminous trees, Giliciridia sapium,
Acacia mangium, and Acacia flexuopa, all of which fix
nitrogen in the soil and provide leaves for livestock. He
has planted cassava under a third of these trees and will
plant sorghum and Pueraria phaseoloides, a crawling
vine, under the rest. When the trees mature, their leaves
will be fed to stabled goats. Dr. Ocana hopes his experi-
ments will demonstrate a profitable way of using the land
without depleting its nutrients.

Education and Conservation

As part of its mission, STRI provides research and train-
ing opportunities for tropical biologists. During 1988 the
institute supported more than eighty men and women at
various academic levels, from undergraduates through
senior scientists, representing fifteen nations. STRI also
added a second three-year postdoctoral position in eco-
physiology, a program established this year.

In addition to its own fellowship program, STRI re-
ceived funding from the Smithsonian and the Exxon Cor-
poration to enable Latin American students and senior
scientists to conduct their own research or to participate
in Ongoing projects at various STRI facilities. As part of
the program for senior Latin American scientists, Dr. An-
tonio Brack-Egg from Peru used the resources of the
STRI Library for his book on Peruvian fauna. Dr. Noris
Salazar, a specialist in bryophytes at the University of

94

Panama, continued her work with two students on the
preparation of a flora of lichens and mosses of Barro
Colorado Island. Dr. Salazar’s project is a sequel to her
university course offered during 1987.

STRI’s educational program includes weekly public
group tours to Barro Colorado Island. To enhance the
experience of Spanish-speaking visitors, this year STRI
published a Spanish edition of its guidebook A Day on
Barro Colorado Island, Panama. This book provides in-
formation on the fifty-four stations along the island’s na-
ture trail and explains important characteristics of
lowland tropical forests.

STRI continues to collaborate with international and
local groups to promote conservation of marine and ter-
restrial tropical environments. Because of its biological
diversity and proximity to the city, Panama’s Soberania
National Park is an important research site for the inter-
national scientific community, and its protection and ac-
cess are essential to the success of the long-term research
efforts in the area. Toward this end, STRI collaborated
this year with Panama’s National Association for Conser-
vation of Nature, a private, nonprofit organization, and ©
the Institute for Natural and Renewable Resources, a
government agency, in extensive repairs to the Pipeline
Road through the park. This work was funded in part by
the James Smithson Society.

Facilities Development

During the past year STRI continued its program of facil-
ities improvement. At Tivoli, construction of the Earl
Silas Tupper Research and Conference Center, a state-of-
the-art laboratory facility and auditorium with adjoining
rooms for exhibits and meetings, nears completion and is
on schedule for an opening in 1989. On Barro Colorado
Island, new dormitories, a dining hall and kitchen, and a
seminar hall are well under way. A new dormitory and
associated offices and laboratories have been completed
in Gamboa.

At Naos, renovation is progressing for the new molec-
ular evolution program. One just-completed laboratory
will be available for work on the molecular genetics of
enzymes, and another will be used for research on DNA.
A site convenient to other STRI facilities has been se-
lected for the new Naos dormitory, and bids for its con-
struction will be advertised soon. Negotiations are under
way with the Kuna Nation for a new site for the San Blas
marine station in the Caribbean.

STRI has also successfully negotiated with the Pana-

anian Institute for Hydroelectric Resources and Electri-
ication for the use of a new field station in the montane
et forest at the Fortuna hydroelectric project watershed
n western Panama. Simple office and laboratory space
nd fully equipped living facilities are available to indi-
idual scientists and small groups wishing to carry out
tudies in this unique environment.

taff Changes

r. Eric A. Fischer was appointed deputy director of
TRI in July 1988. Dr. Fischer is an evolutionary biolo-
ist specializing in the study of reproductive patterns and
ehavior. He was an assistant professor in the animal
ehavior program at the University of Washington and
ast year worked with the U.S. Senate Budget Committee
s a Congressional Science Fellow sponsored by the
erican Association for the Advancement of Science.
Dr. Fischer replaces Dr. James R. Karr, who accepted
n endowed chair at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
tate University in Blacksburg, Virginia.

MUSEUMS

Tom L. Freudenheim, Assistant Secretary for Museums

97
Anacostia Museum

Established more than twenty years ago, the Anacostia
Museum has evolved into a national resource for diffu-
sion of knowledge about Afro-American history and cul-
ture. Located in the historic Fort Stanton Park in
southeast Washington, D.C., the museum mounts art
and history exhibitions, conducts scholarly research on
Afro-American history and culture, and produces pro-
gramming for an audience of children and adults who are
empowered by increased knowledge of African-American
creativity.

Exhibitions

More than 30,000 visitors passed through the doors of
the museum to see “Climbing Jacob’s Ladder: The Rise of
Black Churches in Eastern American Cities, 1740-1877,”
an exhibition that opened in October 1987. The exhibi-
tion drew record numbers of visitors during its stay,
which was extended to the end of October 1988. Histo-
rian Edward Smith unearthed the artifactual history of
the black church, which emerged as an independent insti-
tution when black ministers seceded from segregated con-
gregations. The exhibition shows that black churches
were arenas of rejuvenation and self-pride for communi-
ties bereft of mainstream social service institutions. The
pathos of the black church’s struggle for self-determina-
tion in America was captured in the exhibition installa-
tion with original church pews, hymnals, photographs,
and tattered frocks of itinerant preachers. Perhaps just as
important is the exhibition catalogue, which provides a
visual record of the exhibition and makes a well-docu-
mented contribution to Afro-American religious history.

Also in 1988 historian Portia James and other staff
members continued research and planning for the exhibi-
tion “The Real McCoy: Afro-American Invention and In-
novation, 1619-1930,” scheduled to open in May 1989.
The exhibition and catalogue will trace the pivotal role of
Afro-American inventiveness from the Colonial period of
agricultural production to the late nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century period of modern industrial
innovation.

Several other promising exhibitions were planned in
1988. An exhibition of works by artists in the District of
Columbia Art Association is scheduled to open in Janu-
ary 1989. Research continued for an exhibition of the
works of P. H. Polk, a noted black photographer whose
prints vividly record the folkways of the rural South. Re-
search and planning began on an exhibition titled “The
Health Problems of the Black Community,” which will

98

explore the causes and cures of several diseases, including
sickle cell anemia and AIDS, that afflict the black com-
munity with particular devastation. This exhibition will
reflect the museum’s responsibility and commitment to
present contemporary community social problems.

Collections Management

The museum made significant progress in collections |
management and inventory of the permanent collection.

A new Collections Management Policy Statement reflects —
the museum’s expanded mission to collect, as well as to
interpret, Afro-American history and culture. This state- —
ment focuses the museum’s collecting on the preservation
of black history. The statement also establishes proce-
dures for the acquisition, accession, and inventory of ar-
tifacts. In 1988 the first computerized inventory of the
museum’s permanent collection was completed. The Ana-
costia Museum is now ready to collect Afro-American |
artifacts in a systematic manner.

Education and Public Programs

The Education Department increases the value of the mu-
seum’s exhibitions by bringing elements of the curators’
research to area schools and adult audiences. To support
the exhibition on the black church, there were concerts
by Joan Hillsman, Toshi Reagon, and the Eastern Senior
High School choir and Lunch Box Forum lectures by Dr.
Richard Powell and Rev. Clarence G. Newsome. The
museum collaborated with the National Museum of
American History to host a dramatic presentation by ac-
tor Michael W. Howell of the life and times of Richard
Allen, first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church. The department’s in-service course for teachers
brought experts on the history of the black church to the
museum for a four-day teachers’ workshop.

Perhaps most successful was “Conservation for the
Layperson,” a seminar for church historians, archivists,
and other interested individuals on the techniques of con-
serving books, letters, clothing, paintings, furniture, and
photographs. In panel presentations and talks, conserva-
tors from throughout the Smithsonian provided expert
assistance. As a result of this seminar, an active group of
people representing churches and community organiza-
tions now meets monthly at the museum.

rchives of American Art

he Archives of American Art, founded thirty-four years
go and a Smithsonian bureau since 1970, is a leading
esource for research in American art history. Its collec-
ions, which include nine million items of primary docu-
entation, cover a 250-year period and embrace every
spect of the visual arts. Through its central office in
ashington and its five regional centers, the Archives
erves thousands of graduate students, faculty members,
curators, and independent historians each year. Its quar-
erly Journal is highly regarded in the profession, and its
ymposia have achieved a strong reputation for scholarly
ubstance.

cquisitions

The Archives added 180 collections to its holdings in

988. The much-sought-after papers of Walter Pach, a
ainter and writer in New York and Paris during the first
alf of this century, were acquired a full twenty-five years
fter the first fruitless approach to his widow. Composed
f nearly a thousand letters, together with diaries, sketch-
ooks, photographs, and rare exhibition catalogues, the
collection is especially valuable as a revealing source of
nformation on early twentieth-century modernism in Eu-
ope and America. In addition to important documenta-
ion on the 1913 Armory Show and other art exhibitions
n New York, the papers include letters from Matisse,
rancusi, Duchamp, Diego Rivera, Bernard Berenson,
obert Henri, Arthur B. Davies, John Sloan, and a long
ist of other friends and colleagues.

The nineteenth century is well represented in the year’s
cquisitions in the papers of James L. Claghorn, a Phila-
elphia art patron and collector who corresponded with
rederic E. Church, John Kensett, Hiram Powers, and
orthington Whittredge; of Frederick MacMonnies,
hose 1885 diary records his experiences as an art student
n Paris; and of Francis Millet, including diaries, sketch-
ooks, and letters from his sister describing visits from
enry James, John Singer Sargent, and Mark Twain.
Hardly a year goes by without the addition of at least a
ew letters from Marsden Hartley, surely American art’s
ost prolific correspondent. Twenty of them, all dating
rom the 1930s and 1940s, were donated in 1988. More
han a hundred letters from Jean Dubuffet to an Ameri-
an collector and adviser touch on the market for his
ork in this country. Other artists represented by useful
etters acquired this year are Cecilia Beaux, Kenneth
ayes Miller, David Smith, and Grandma Moses.

The Archives’ oral history program covered an unusu-

ally broad generational range through taped interviews
conducted with museum director John Coolidge, folk art
dealer Jeffrey Camp, and artists Jennifer Bartlett, Isabel
Bishop, Paul Cadmus, Chuck Close, Janet Fish, Kenneth
Noland, and Susan Rothenberg. A videotaped interview
with Seattle sculptor George Tsutakawa was also com-
pleted for the program.

Research

On the evidence of research conducted at the Archives,
scholarship in American art history continues to flourish.
Thirty-five hundred research visits were made to the six
Archives centers in 1988. Twenty-five hundred rolls of
microfilm were circulated through interlibrary loans, a
substantial increase over figures for previous years.

Books, articles, exhibition catalogues, and doctoral
dissertations are the concrete results of research. Among
those published in 1988 with acknowledgments to the Ar-
chives are major studies of Washington Allston, Frank
Duveneck, George Luks, Marsden Hartley, Georgia
O'Keeffe, Philip Evergood, and Stuart Davis. Other
publications dependent on Archives holdings included
books on the early twentieth-century socialist magazine
The Masses, expressionist painting in America, and
Works Progress Administration posters.

Exhibitions and Education

The Archives lent selected items from its holdings to sev-
eral museum exhibitions this year. Its own exhibition of
documents from its official and unofficial records of the
1913 Armory Show opened at the Archives’ new New
York quarters in October 1988.

Archives education activities included three well-at-
tended symposia: “The Coming of Modernism to Chi-
cago, 1900-1940,” held at the Art Institute of Chicago;
“Art for the Record: Issues of Documentation and Con-
temporary Art,” held at the Huntington Library in San
Marino, California; and “Earthquake to Albright: Mod-
ernism in Northern California, 1906-1945,” held at the
California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Fran-
cisco. On a smaller scale, the Archives’ Washington office
sponsored eight informal seminars devoted to discussions
of work in progress by art historians and American stud-
ies scholars. The quarterly Archives of American Art
Journal continued to publish articles based on research at
the Archives, reports from the regional centers, and se-
lected items from the collections.

Collections Management

The Archives completed the first phase of a three-year
project to record all cataloguing information about its
more than 3,000 collections in the Institution’s on-line,
computerized data base for archival, library, and other
special collections. The project is funded by grants from
the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Andrew W. Mellon Foun-
dation. Funding from these grants also enabled the Ar-
chives to prepare two large and complex collections for
research use, the papers of Rockwell Kent, and those of
the art historian and curator William Ivins.

Staff Changes

Richard Murray resigned October 1, 1987, after having
been director of the Archives since 1983. John Fleckner,
director of the National Museum of American History

Archives Center, served as acting director.

Arthur M. Sackler Gallery

The inaugural year of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the
Smithsonian’s new museum of Asian art, began with a
change in leadership. Dr. Thomas Lawton resigned as
director of the Sackler and the Freer Gallery of Art in
order to pursue his research in the art of ancient China.
He assumed the position of senior research scholar. Dr.
Milo C. Beach, who had been assistant director of the
Sackler Gallery, was named acting director. Dr. Beach is
a scholar of the art of India, particularly Indian painting.
Patrick H. Sears was named assistant director of the
Sackler and the Freer for exhibitions and facilities. He
continues to serve as head of the Department of Design
and Installation.

International publicity on the building and the inaugu-
ral exhibitions greeted the opening of the Sackler, with a |
partial compilation of articles from magazines and news-
papers filling a 2-inch-thick report. First-year attendance
was projected at more than half a million visitors.

Among the distinguished foreign guests was His Excel- |
lency Yasuhiro Nakasone, former prime minister of Japan,
whose country donated $1 million toward the construc-
tion of the Sackler Gallery. Other notable visitors repre-
sented the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of
Korea, Sikkim, Singapore, Bahrain, Israel, Luxembourg,
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Exhibitions

An important international loan exhibition of objects
from the Shanghai Museum, “The Chinese Scholar’s Stu-
dio: Artistic Life in the Late Ming Period,” presented 120 —
rare paintings; sculptures; objects in ceramic, bamboo,
and stone; and books. The exhibition, organized by the
Asia Society Galleries in New York City, explored the
world of a highly influential group of Chinese scholar-
artists born near Shanghai on the Yangzi River delta dur-
ing the late Ming dynasty, a period that spanned the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

To illustrate the type of environment that intellectuals
of the period sought to create, the Sackler design staff
built and installed a room adjacent to the exhibition that
was intended to suggest the appearance of a scholarly
retreat. It was fitted with paintings, books, and furniture
drawn from private collections, including the estate of
Arthur M. Sackler.

A contribution from the Boeing Company made possi-
ble a concert of traditional Chinese music during the ex-
hibition. A grant from the Washington Post supported a
variety of educational and public programs, including a

mily guide to the exhibition, a teacher’s workshop, and
ucational materials.

The gallery’s first display of contemporary South Asian
rt showcased eleven large terra-cotta figures, represent-
g Hindu deities and animals, which had been presented
the museum by the Indian Advisory Committee for the
estival of India and the development commissioner
andicrafts), government of India. Another selection of
dian objects, ranging from the thirteenth through the
ineteenth centuries, displayed recent acquisitions in
ulpture, painting, and the decorative arts.

ducation

a continuing effort to encourage the appreciation of
sian art among a broad range of visitors, the Education
epartment of the Sackler and Freer galleries established
n advisory council to investigate plans and programs
ertaining to accessibility. In its first year, the committee
orked with groups representing hearing-impaired, visu-
lly impaired, and mentally disabled individuals. Using
formation gathered through special workshops and
urs, the committee hopes to contribute to more enlight-
ned decision making about accessibility in the museum.
Public programs in the Sackler’s inaugural year, organ-
ed by the Education Department and advertised

rough the bimonthly calendar, drew enthusiastic
rowds to the museum. Programming was designed to
ppeal to specialists and the general public alike; some
vents were aimed at those with well-developed interests
nd others were planned to tantalize the uninitiated with
e rich panorama of Asian culture.

Highlights included musical programs by master sitarist
ilayat Khan; Wu Wenguang, accomplished performer on
e€ gin, a seven-stringed zither that is the oldest Chinese
lucked musical instrument; traditional vocal and instru-
ental musicians from Uzbekestan and Azerbaijan; and
akistani master singer Salamat Ali Khan.

Among the events of interest to children was a popular
orytelling program concentrating on Chinese, Indian,
ersian, and Japanese folktales that related to images
ortrayed in the exhibition galleries. Other activities
emonstrated traditional Chinese musical instruments

d techniques from the Beijing Opera.

A public lecture series offered eighteen programs rang-
g from a talk about the design of the Sackler Gallery

d its inaugural exhibitions to an exploration of “Arabic
d Persian Calligraphy: Illuminating the Eye of the

ul.” Overflow audiences attended the twelve Japanese
d Indian films shown by the gallery this year.

Among the distinguished visitors to the Sackler Gallery in its
inaugural year was His Excellency Yasuhiro Nakasone, former
prime minister of Japan (center). Dr. Milo C. Beach, acting
director (left), escorted Mr. Nakasone through the exhibitions.

Research

The Sackler Gallery sponsored its first scholarly confer-
ence, “Investigating Artistic Environments in the Ancient
Near East,” an exploration of evidence for the environ-
ments in which works of art were produced. Secretary
Adams delivered opening remarks, and twelve scholars
from institutions in the United States and Europe were
featured. The conference was organized by Dr. Ann Gun-
ter, assistant curator for ancient Near Eastern art, and
was made possible through the generosity of Mrs. Arthur
M. Sackler.

The Sackler and Freer jointly sponsored three addi-
tional scholarly programs drawing on the expertise of the
galleries’ staff and scholars from other institutions. These
programs were “Ancient Sources of Metal in Asia, East
and West,” with speakers K. Aslihan Yener, a fellow at
the Smithsonian Conservation Analytical Laboratory, and
W. T. Chase, head conservator at the Sackler and Freer
galleries; “The Depiction of Nature in Heian Period
(794-1185) Manuscripts and Handcraft Ornament,” by
Professor Yasushi Egami of Sophia University, Tokyo,
the 1988 Harold P. Stern Memorial Fellow; and “Recent
Studies in Ancient Chinese Metallurgy and Bronze Cast-

Iot
ing Techniques,” a symposium led by Hua Jue Ming, a
professor at the Institute of History of Natural Science,
Academia Sinica, Beijing.

Dr. Glenn Lowry, curator of Near Eastern art, re-
ceived a grant from the Institute for Turkish Studies to
conduct research in Istanbul on fifteenth-century Persian
drawings. He completed the second and final year of a
Smithsonian Scholarly Studies Grant to work on Timurid
art and culture in preparation for the 1989 exhibition,
“Timur and the Princely Vision: Persian Art and Culture
in the Fifteenth Century.”

Dr. Shen Fu, curator of Chinese art, received a Smith-
sonian Scholarly Studies Grant for an upcoming exhibi-
tion, “Chang Dai-chien: Synthesis and Transformation in
Chinese Painting.” Dr. Fu conducted research in China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and India.

Ann Yonemura, assistant curator of Japanese art, trav-
eled to Japan to study prints made during the Yokohama
period (1860-70), a time when many foreign businessmen
came to trade in that port city. Yonemura’s research,
which was conducted in preparation for a Sackler Gallery
exhibition in 1990, was supported by a grant from the
Daval Foundation.

Dr. Ann Gunter received a grant from the American
Research Institute in Turkey for two months of study in
that country. She also received grants from the Smithson-
ian Research Opportunities Fund to give papers at three
scholarly conferences.

Louise Cort, museum specialist for ceramics, elected a
year-long sabbatical leave to translate the diary of a
seventeenth-century Japanese potter under a National En-
dowment for the Humanities Translation Grant and a
Japan Foundation Professional Fellowship.

Wheeler Thackston of Harvard University completed a
year’s residency as a Smithsonian-Rockefeller Foundation
Resident in the Humanities. George Michel, an art and
architectural historian specializing in South Asia, began
his residency as the new Smithsonian-Rockefeller Fellow.

Publications

Subscriptions to Asian Art, the quarterly journal pub-
lished by Oxford University Press in association with the
Sackler Gallery, reached 1,700 individuals and institu-
tions after just three issues had been released. Introduced
in September 1987, Asian Art continued in 1988 with is-
sues on “The Art of Eating and Drinking in Ancient Iran”
and the art of India.

Library

The library, one of the few at the Smithsonian that is
open to the public without appointment, became a spe-
cial member of the Research Libraries Group, using their
Chinese-Japanese-Korean languge capability. This na-
tional organization promotes the coordination of collec-
tion development among its members and offers improved
access to collections through the computerized Research
Libraries Information Network. The library grew by
1,521 volumes and added approximately 300 slides. The
staff responded to more than 3,000 reference inquiries
and handled more than 200 interlibrary loan requests.
Colleen Hennessey was hired as the library’s first full-
time archivist to organize, maintain, and make accessible
the archives of the Freer and Sackler galleries.

Conservation

The Technical Laboratory and the Oriental Art Restora-
tion Studio moved from the Freer Gallery of Art to tem-
porary quarters in the Sackler Gallery, where these
departments will be housed until the Freer renovation is
complete. In spite of this major disruption, the staffs con- _
ducted technical research on Persian and Indian paintings, -
Chinese bronzes, Chinese lacquer, and other materials; |
completed conservation on objects in the collections; and
monitored the condition of works of art on loan. |
A major effort was given to the restoration and conser-
vation of a Japanese ceremonial palanquin made to carry
the bride of a noble family to her wedding. This striking
black-and-gold lacquer conveyance, acquired through the -
Smithsonian Collections Acquisition Program Fund in
1985, was the first purchase for the Sackler Gallery. The —
palanquin was placed on exhibition in the fall of 1988.
A collaborative effort by the Technical Laboratory staff
resulted in a paper describing their work on a Chinese
lacquer box in the Sackler Gallery collection. The paper
was delivered at a meeting in Japan of the International
Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works.

Acquisitions

An important pair of Japanese six-panel folding screens
depicting the Legend of Mount Oe, by an anonymous
artist of the early seventeenth century, was purchased
through the Smithsonian Collections Acquisition Program
Fund. Significant groups of twentieth-century Japanese

prints were added to the collection from several sources.
Margot Paul Ernst and Henry Horowitz each donated
works from their collections. Additional Japanese prints
were transferred from the collections of the Hirshhorn
“Museum and Sculpture Garden and the National Mu-
-seum of American Art.

Other additions to the Sackler Gallery collection in-
cluded five hanging scrolls by the twentieth-century Chi-
nese artist Chang Dai-chien and a mother-of-pearl box
from India dating to the first decade of the seventeenth
‘century. Flower and Rock Arrangements in Pots, an al-
bum of eight leaves by the Chinese artist Sun Kehong

i 75-1670), was given by Karen Wang.

Conservation Analytical
Laboratory

The Conservation Analytical Laboratory (CAL) is the
Smithsonian’s specialized research facility for wide-rang-
ing aspects of the conservation and technical study of
museum objects. Research is performed on the conserva-
tion-related properties of materials, the improvement of
conservation treatment technology, and the extraction of
historical information from the technical record of the
materials being studied. Within these areas of expertise,
CAL staff provide assistance and advice to specialists in
other bureaus of the Smithsonian. CAL conducts a con-
servation training program that includes basic and ad-
vanced training, holds workshops and seminars, and
provides information services to museum professionals
and the general public.

Archaeometric Research

In this area of research, CAL scientists develop methods
of chemical and physical analysis and apply these meth-
ods to museum objects and related materials to answer
questions pertaining to anthropology or art history. To
identify the place of origin of archaeological ceramics and
clay resources and draw conclusions about historical
trade patterns, for example, scientists can generate large
amounts of analytical data on the chemical and minera-
logical composition and the manufacturing methods of
ceramic and clay artifacts. One such project led to a ma-
jor outreach program. More than 1,000 chemical analy-
ses of Hopi pottery were integrated with the stylistic
analyses of these ceramics in order to develop and test
models of the socioeconomic dynamics of the Hopi peo-
ple during the period of the great migrations (ca. A.D.
1300). In a specially designed applied science course
taught at the Hopi Junior/Senior High School in north-
eastern Arizona, CAL scientists used their own research
methods and results to illustrate principles of scientific
research design. In turn, the students spent three weeks
during the summer at the laboratory and gained experi-
ence in using sophisticated equipment and evaluating ex-
perimental data.

In collaboration with the National Bureau of Stan-
dards, CAL staff used lead isotope analysis to character-
ize and identify Mexican lead ore sources, which are
thought to have been used for glazes on Spanish-Colonial
majolica ceramics. This demonstration of the use of New
World raw materials for glaze production in the sixteenth
century complements other ongoing work on the identifi-
cation of the clay sources used in these ceramics.

Similar research projects, often involving international

103
“ye
collaboration, relate to the Old World. Examples include
a major study of the production and distribution of Mid-
dle Eastern ceramics, which has interesting ramifications
for understanding the diffusion of early ceramic technolo-
gies. Additional projects deal with the technological his-
tory of Far Eastern porcelains, stonewares, or glazes of
Egyptian, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern provenance.

The laboratory is also conducting a project with the
National Bureau of Standards and the National Museum
of American Art on autoradiographic studies of paint-
ings. Using autoradiography, a nondestructive technique
for examining underlying paint layers, scientists have
gained new insights into the painting techniques of turn-
of-the-century artists Thomas W. Dewing and Albert P.
Ryder. This project, strengthened by the recent hiring of
a research art historian, involves a number of other ex-
amination and analysis techniques, which in combination
provide new information on the creation process of these
works.

In a new initiative, CAL staff members have estab-
lished new ties with the Carnegie Institute to examine the
organic phase of archaeological bone for traces of ancient
disease and evidence of prehistoric diets and to develop a
methodology of preparing unadulterated microsamples
from collagen-derived amino acids for carbon-14 dating.

Conservation Research

The goal of the conservation research program is a fun-
damental understanding of the chemical and physical
processes involved in the deterioration of museum objects
and the factors that affect the rates of these processes.
The development and testing of treatment technology to
stabilize decaying objects is also a focus of conservation
research. On request, CAL scientists perform chemical
and physical analyses and technical examinations for con-
servators and curators throughout the Institution. The
following examples illustrate the directions of conserva-
tion research.

The CAL’s materials research engineer has designed
and constructed innovative testing equipment to deter-
mine the mechanical properties of polymeric materials
under environmentally controlled conditions. Conserva-
tors use this equipment in cooperation with the research
engineer in a number of ways: to evaluate the effective-
ness of materials and techniques used in lining paintings,
assess the mechanical changes seen in aqueous treatment
of paper objects, and monitor the effects of humidity,
temperature, and aging on the mechanical properties of a

104

Postgraduate conservation intern Ann Boulton examines a
group of 7,000-year-old plaster figures from Jordan at the Con-
servation Analytical Laboratory. Because of their extremely fri-
able condition, these objects could not be excavated on site, but
were shipped in the soil for consolidation in the laboratory
prior to their recovery.

range of materials. In another area of mechanical re-
search, results from testing and computer modeling help
CAL researchers understand and predict the effects of
shock and vibration on art objects during transport. Mu-
seum staff will use the resulting advice on packaging to
ensure improved safety for these objects.

This year CAL conservators and scientists initiated a
joint program to study the effects of the various cleaning
solutions that conservators use to remove old varnish
from paintings. In this project, which has important im-
plications for the conservation of paintings, they will ex-
amine in depth the effects of cleaning solutions on the
paint layer itself.

In the area of photograph conservation, a photo-
graphic scientist joined the CAL in the summer of 1988
and began research on deterioration phenomena in glass
collodion negative plates, which form a significant part
of most photographic collections.

CAL paper conservators are involved in research on
various aspects of treatment through light bleaching and

on the effects of a range of aqueous and solvent treat-
ments on the surface texture and strength of paper arti-
facts. Scientists continued a long-term project to evaluate
accelerated aging tests for paper and other cellulosic ma-
terials. A reliable acceleration of reactions is essential in
order to validate the efficiency and safety of preservation
treatments.

A joint investigation of the effect of sulphury] fluoride
‘fumigant on a wide range of materials is nearing comple-
tion; the project has been supported by the Getty Conser-
vation Institute. The CAL is investigating proteinaceous
materials, such as wool, silk, leather, and glue, as well as
textile dyes, while the Canadian Conservation Institute
and the Getty Conservation Institute are conducting re-
search on other materials.

Objects conservators used a variety of techniques to
determine the composition, structure, and manufacture
of 7,000-year-old Near Eastern plaster figures and to test
the efficiency of a range of possible reinforcing agents for
these objects. One conservator set up an on-site conserva-
tion laboratory for the excavations at Harappa, Pakistan,
and worked on objects from the site. In textile conserva-
tion, research centered on the stability of certain pig-
ment-binder systems used in textile printing and on the
deterioration of weighted silk fabrics.

Conservation Training

The diversity of the CAL’s conservation training program
is reflected in the year’s activities. The laboratory spon-
sored six one-year postgraduate internships for recently
graduated conservators to work in conservation laborato-
ies throughout the Smithsonian. A number of interns at
arious levels of experience and expertise were trained at
CAL, including seven summer interns, two one-year
graduate interns, and two of the above-mentioned post-
raduate interns.

The first class in the CAL’s Furniture Conservation
raining Program will finish its third and final year in
989. By that time they will have had twelve two-week
ets of formal courses interspersed with return to their
ormal work and assigned home study. The students will
hen be required to complete an additional year as interns
ith a recognized furniture conservator. Because of the
uccess of this program and the imminent completion of
he formal course phase, a new group of students will be
elected for a second class. As evidence of the program’s
uccess and the need for training in furniture conserva-
ion, all of the students who were interested in attaining

employment were able to find jobs in major American
museums while they were attending the program.

The joint doctoral program with the Johns Hopkins
University to train conservation scientists finished its first
year. CAL scientists and conservators taught a course on
the properties of organic materials encountered in mu-
seum collections and served as research advisers to the
students. Next year, with more students enrolled, CAL
staff will continue to act in this capacity.

As in previous years, the CAL organized specialty
courses for practicing conservators. CAL staff and out-
side lecturers taught courses on a wide variety of sub-
jects, such as the identification of natural and early
synthetic dyes on historic textiles; coatings and colorants
for furniture; the technology of ancient jewelry; and the
deterioration and conservation of stone.

The laboratory’s information program continues to
provide specialized bibliographic and reference support to
professionals in the Smithsonian and other museums. On-
line access is maintained to the conservation literature
data base of the Conservation Information Network
(CIN), an international collaborative venture of which
the CAL is a contributing member. CAL staff also re-
sponded to questions about conservation from the gen-
eral public.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum

In the physical world that surrounds us, design is a uni-
versal human activity. Most fundamentally, it entails in-
dividual attempts to solve problems in a social context.
Design can impart, organize, and communicate values.
Since the Industrial Revolution, design has often referred
to the collective disciplines of separately trained profes-
sional groups who work for themselves or others, such as
architects, landscape architects, city planners, engineers,
industrial and product designers, interior and theatrical
designers, textile and fashion designers, and graphic
designers.

Too often, design is dismissed or discounted as the vis-
ible envelope or surface packaging of a functional prod-
uct or structure. Too rarely, it is appreciated as an ability
to organize the production and use of the physical matter
of our lives. Since its designation as the Smithsonian
Institution’s National Museum of Design in 1968, the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum has been an internationally ac-
claimed pioneer in the innovative exploration of both the
processes and the products of human design and art.

Collections

With more than 167,000 objects in its wide-ranging per-
manent collections, the Cooper-Hewitt is one of the
Smithsonian’s most active collection centers. The mu-
seum puts objects to work as aggressively as possible:
Forty-four items were lent to thirteen other museums in
just the first six months of 1988, during which time the
museum permanently acquired 461 items (78 by purchase
and 383 by gift) and borrowed 507 objects from forty-
three lenders for temporary exhibitions.

Among the year’s permanent acquisitions, the most
outstanding was a group of 1,488 sheets representing
more than 250 textile and wall-covering patterns by more
than fifty designers affiliated with the Wiener Werkstatte
during the early twentieth century. Unique in the world
outside of Vienna, this material represents a major
strengthening of twentieth-century holdings in the De-
partment of Drawings and Prints. Its purchase was made
possible, in part, by a grant from the Regents Collections
Acquisitions Program.

Collections that are growing and working at this rate
obviously require continuous conservation and data man-
agement efforts. The museum’s conservators treated more
than 460 objects in the first three quarters of 1988. The
application of current data processing technology to such
collections-related activities as inventory and loan man-
agement continued to evolve in all curatorial departments
throughout the year.

106

International Audiences

New York is an international design capital, and Cooper-
Hewitt audiences and interests reflect an increasing inter-
national awareness of the significance of design’s past,
present, and future. The museum welcomed a visit from
a U.S. Information Agency-sponsored group of museum
professionals from developing countries in 1987 and was
the site for the signing of a historic Accord of Mutual
Agreement and Exchange between the Industrial Design-
ers Society of America and the Society of Soviet Design-
ers. The museum was also host to King Carl XVI Gustaf
and Queen Silvia of Sweden, who toured the exhibitions,
“The Triumph of Simplicity: 350 Years of Swedish Silver”
and “Versailles: The View from Sweden,” both of which
were organized exclusively for the Cooper-Hewitt. Ad-
ministrative and curatorial colleagues from Czechoslo-

Three vases, c. 1902-20, from the William and Marcia Good-
man collection in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum featured in the
publication American Art Pottery.

Re ae

vakia and West Germany were among those greeted
during the year. Events with a local flavor included the
December 1987 meeting of the New York State Council
on the Arts and a reception for the members of the New
York City Museums Council.

A sampling of this year’s exhibition themes affirms the
international scope of the Cooper-Hewitt’s work and sug-
gests the diversity of design creativity at different times
and in different places. These themes included the career
of the twentieth-century architect Joseph Urban in
Vienna and New York; the colorful and inexpensive
household ceramics produced for Germany’s Weimar Re-
public; the influence of Versailles on late seventeenth-
and early eighteenth-century Swedish architecture; the
origins and influence of the American arts and crafts
movement; the history of European printed textiles; and
theatrical designs from three centuries of Paris Opera
productions.

The year also brought preparations on an international
scale for three major exhibitions scheduled for 1989 and
1990. “Courts and Colonies: The William and Mary Style
in Holland, England, and America” is being coproduced
with the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, by a team
of curators from all three countries. In celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution, “L’Art de Vivre:
Decorative Arts and Design in France 1789-1989” incor-
porates the contributions of numerous colleagues from
France. “Czech Architecture and Design 1900-1950” is an
official exchange exhibition sanctioned by the govern-
ment of Czechoslovakia, with guest curators from the na-
tional museums in Prague. It is being organized by the
Cooper-Hewitt in association with Montreal’s Canadian
Center for Architecture.

Public Education

The museum sent study tours to Los Angeles, Miami,
and Venice, Italy, and planned itineraries for future ex-
plorations in central and eastern Europe and the Nether-
lands. More than 5,000 students attended courses,
symposia, workshops, and lectures in the international
design arts at the museum. Byzantine, Italian, French,
English, Russian, Japanese, and American topics were
among the offerings this year. A special evening focused
on questions relating to industrial design for global mar-
kets and the status of American productivity in this in-
creasingly competitive area. Summer studies in London
were available under the auspices of the master’s-degree-
level program that the Cooper-Hewitt and Parsons/New

School continue to offer as a unique training program for
future decorative arts scholars and curators.

International and Local Support

As the offerings and audiences are international, so are
the origins of the Cooper-Hewitt’s financial support. In
1988, for instance, grants and in-kind gifts were received
from sources such as the Smithsonian Special Exhibition
Fund, British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Shell
Oil Company Foundation, Sotheby’s, and the Dutch
American West-India Company Foundation. The largest
grant in the museum’s history was received from France’s
Comité Colbert, a consortium of seventy leading French
firms, and Air France agreed to donate air-freight services
for “L’Art de Vivre.” Corporations such as SONY, Laura
Ashley, Brunschwig & Fils, Inc., J. P. Stevens & Co.,
Inc., Mitchell Energy & Development Corporation, Ger-
ald D. Hines Interests, Hearst Magazines, and Potlatch
Corporation became Corporate Patrons and made finan-
cial gifts in support of specific projects or as contribu-
tions to meet a three-year challenge grant from the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for a permanent research
endowment. Individual members generously responded to
a special appeal in that campaign, and the William Ran-
dolph Hearst Foundation and James Smithson Society
each provided matching funds for the same purpose.

All of the museum’s publications are produced with
private funds. This year marked the publication of Amer-
ican Art Pottery, supported in part by Marcia and Wil-
liam Goodman and the New York State Council on the
Arts. A handsome gift from the Port Royal Foundation
made possible the catalogue for Versailles: The View
from Sweden, and the J. M. Kaplan Fund provided a
grant to help absorb the costs of the exhibition and ac-
companying publication on the work of the German ar-
chitect Erich Mendelsohn.

The Decorative Arts Association, a group of collectors
and others with special affinity for the Decorative Arts
Department, also raised funds for its future activities.

Support of this sort, in addition to annual allotments
from the Institution and from Congress, provides the
means for the museum to serve its growing public. In
response, that public has provided support in the form of
admissions and membership fees. The number of visits
for the year is estimated at 150,000. Twelve hundred
members crowded into the garden for the annual mem-
bers’ garden party in June. On the next evening 7,000
visitors of every age and background arrived to celebrate

107
the tenth anniversary of New York’s world-famous Mu-
seum Mile, with Mayor Edward I. Koch and New York
State Council on the Arts Chairman Kitty Carlisle Hart

presiding over the opening ceremonies.

Staff Changes

Harold Pfister served as acting director of the museum
during the year. At year’s end Dianne Pilgrim, chairman
of the Brooklyn Museum’s Department of Decorative
Arts, was appointed director.

108

Freer Gallery of Art

As the year began, Dr. Thomas Lawton stepped down
after a decade as director in order to pursue his research
in the art of ancient China. He assumed the position of
senior research scholar. Dr. Milo C. Beach, a specialist in
the painting of India, was named acting director of the
Freer and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Dr. Beach had
been assistant director of the Sackler Gallery.

Much of the staff effort at the Freer Gallery this year
was aimed at preparing the world-renowned collection of
Asian and turn-of-the-century American art for a major
construction and renovation project that is expected to
take more than three years. For the safety of the collec-
tion and for the convenience of gallery visitors, the Freer
closed to the public on September 6, 1988, for the dura-
tion of the project. All staff moved to the Sackler
Gallery.

The renovation is planned in four phases. In the first
phase, all work will be carried out below the gallery
level. An exhibition gallery will be constructed to provide
staff and public access between the Freer and the Sackler.
A new elevator between the Independence Avenue level
and the exhibition galleries will make the building acces-
sible to visitors with mobility impairments. Space for art
conservation and technical research will triple, and facili-
ties for art storage will expand by 7o percent.

Later stages of the project will involve restoration and
repair to the gallery level, the auditorium, and the exte-
rior, followed by reinstallation of the collection. Work
on the gallery level will preserve and restore the original
appearance of the building, which is listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places. The north foyer (Jeffer-
son Drive) will emerge as the grand public entry, as the
building’s architect, Charles Platt, intended. The Gallery
Shop, now located in the foyer, will be moved to the
ground level.

Repairs to and restoration of eighteen exhibition galler-
ies will include new glass ceilings copied after the original
ones. A new artificial lighting system will complement
the generous natural light in the galleries. Gallery walls
will be replastered; marble flooring and limestone walls
will be repaired; and metal architectural detailing will be
restored. The courtyard, which will be excavated during
the first phase of the project, will be returned to its origi-
nal appearance.

In preparation for the renovation project, an inventory
was conducted and the collection was moved to the exhi-
bition galleries, which have been adapted for storage
during construction. An independent temperature and
humidity control system has been devised to maintain a
stable environment.

collection in 1988.

Research and Education

Study of the Freer’s American collection continued under
Dr. Linda Merrill, assistant curator of American art, and
three visiting students. Dr. Merrill completed the manu-
script for Dwight William Tryon: Paintings in the Freer
Gallery of Art, a catalogue to accompany the exhibition
scheduled to open in 1992. Dr. Merrill was awarded a
Regents’ Publication Fellowship for the preparation of
her manuscript, A Pot of Paint: Whistler v. Ruskin. This
critical analysis and the reconstruction from contempo-
ary newspaper accounts of the transcript of the libel trial
f 1878 will be published by the Smithsonian Institution
Tess.
John Siewert, a Smithsonian Fellow from the Univer-
ity of Michigan, continued his research on the Whistler
octurnes; Victoria Corbeil, a Smith College—Smithson-
ian Intern, was in residence to study Abbott H. Thayer;
nd Jim Ganz, a Williams College intern, conducted re-
earch on Whistler prints. Professor Yasushi Egami of
ophia University, Tokyo, was in residence as the Harold

P. Stern Fellow, conducting research on Japanese sutras
of the Heian period in the Freer collection.

Acquisitions

A pair of illustrated narrative handscrolls depicting the
story of Tamamo-no-mae, by Yasunobu (Shichizaemon),
a Japanese painter of the seventeenth century, was pur-
chased for the collection. Another addition to the Japa-
nese collection, an eighteenth-century hanging scroll by
Tsukioka Settei, was given by Elizabeth Gordon Nor-
cross. A late fifteenth- to early sixteenth-century Otto-
man Turkish bowl of silver and gilt was added to the
Near Eastern collection. Four hanging scrolls, a hand-
scroll, and a Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) ceramic incense
burner were purchased for the Chinese collection.

Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the
Smithsonian Institution’s museum of modern and con-
temporary art, maintained an active exhibition schedule
and acquisition program this year. Films, concerts, sym-
posia, tours, and other educational activities supported
these programs. The museum’s departments of conserva-
tion, registration, photography, and the reference library
continued to offer technical support to staff and scholars.

Exhibitions

Two complementary, simultaneous exhibition series that
offer an intimate experience with contemporary art were
inaugurated this year. The Directions series, which fo-
cuses on small-scale solo exhibitions, highlighted the
work of Joel Shapiro, Sherrie Levine, and Robert Cum-
ming. A 1,572-square-foot gallery on the museum’s third
floor was redesigned to accommodate these single-artist

On September 22, 1988, Mrs. Eduard Shevardnadze (second

Hirshhorn Museum’s exhibition of Russian and Soviet paint-
ings, 1900-30. With her are Museum Director James Demetrion
(left, with an interpreter) and Mrs. Yuriy Dubinin (far right),
wife of the Soviet ambassador to the United States. After the
tour, Mrs. Shevardnadze crossed the Mall to preview the
“Crossroads of Continents” exhibition at the Museum of Natu-
ral History. (Photograph by Lee Stalsworth)

exhibitions. The WORKS series, which features tempo-
rary installations created for the museum’s building and
grounds, is the only ongoing program of its kind in a
major American museum. Sol LeWitt, the team of Kate
Ericson and Mel Ziegler, and Vernon Fisher created site-
specific pieces this year. Both series and the accompany-
ing publications were made possible, in part, through the
Smithsonian Special Exhibition Fund.

Three major exhibitions were organized by Hirshhorn —
staff members this year, with catalogues published or dis-
tributed by the Smithsonian Institution Press. With sup-
port from the Smithsonian Special Exhibition Fund, the —
Hirshhorn mounted “Russian and Soviet Paintings, 1g900—
1930: Selections from the State Tretyakov Gallery, Mos- —
cow, and the State Russian Museum, Leningrad.” This
was the first American exhibition of early twentieth-
century works by Russian and Soviet artists drawn exclu-
sively from the two most important museums in the
Soviet Union specializing in works from that period. The
exhibition was selected by director James T. Demetrion
and chief curator for exhibitions Dr. Edwin Rifkin.
“Alberto Giacometti 1901-1966,” organized by associate
curator of sculpture Valerie J. Fletcher, opened in the fall)
of 1988 and then traveled to the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art. Grants from Credit Suisse and the Xerox
Foundation, with supplemental assistance from Balair
and the Pro Helvetia Foundation and an indemnity from
the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities,
made this retrospective possible. “Different Drummers,”
organized by curator of prints and drawings Frank Get-
tings, focused on highly individual and diverse art in
many media by nine contemporary artists.

Other exhibitions included “A Quiet Revolution: Brit-
ish Sculpture since 1965,” sculpture and works on paper
by six artists, organized jointly by the Museum of Con-
temporary Art, Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art. The Hirshhorn Museum was the only
American venue for “Expressiv: Central European Art
since 1960.” This exhibition of paintings, sculptures,
mixed-media pieces, and photographs by artists from
Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugosla-
via was first shown at the Museum of Modern Art in
Vienna.

Smaller exhibitions featuring works from the perma-
nent collection included “Sea and Shore: Selections from
the Permanent Collection” and “The New Spirit: Artist-
Organizers of the Armory Show,” both organized by as-
sociate curator of painting Dr. Judith Zilczer.

Loans from the Hirshhorn Museum were featured in
retrospective exhibitions honoring several artists. Two of

rst Barlach’s Seated Girl, 1937, is one of the major works
rom the Marion L. Ring Estate given to the Hirshhorn Mu-
seum and Sculpture Garden.

harles Demuth’s popular watercolors, Circus and
audeville: Many Brave Hearts Are Asleep in the Deep,
ere part of a touring exhibition organized by the Whit-
ey Museum of American Art in New York City. Two of
ablo Picasso’s works on paper from the recently ac-
uired Joseph H. Hirshhorn Bequest traveled to West
ermany for inclusion in a show about the artist’s classi-
al period. Charles Sheeler’s oil painting, Staircase,
oylestown, was part of a comprehensive exhibition that
howcased works in many media executed by this artist.
oordinated by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the
xhibition also traveled to New York City and Dallas.
nselm Kiefer’s two-panel painting, Das Buch, has been
een throughout the United States in a critically ac-
laimed exhibition focusing on this painter’s unusual style
nd subject matter.

Among the more than seventy works lent to museums
in this country and abroad were several borrowed for
shows that dealt with artistic endeavors of the 1950s. In
“The Figurative Fifties,” an exhibition at the Newport
Harbor Art Museum in California, Bob Thompson’s La
Fete and Fairfield Porter’s Katie and Anne depicted the
style known as New York figurative expressionism. At
the Paine Art Center in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Joan
Brown’s Nun with Staffordshire Terrier and Elmer Bis-
choffs Houses and Hills illustrated another regional style
in the exhibition, “Painting from the San Francisco Bay
Area.” Overseas, this trend to analyze the art of the 1950s
continued with the Berlinische Galerie’s “Documenta II,”
to which the Hirshhorn’s stainless steel Sentinel II, by
David Smith, and large canvas Delaware Gap, by Franz
Kline, were important contributions. The new Nagoya
City Art Museum in Japan included Edward Hopper’s
City Sunlight and Willem de Kooning’s Woman in its am-
bitious inaugural exhibition. Other loans, to an exhibi-
tion organized by the International Sculpture Center that
dealt with American industrialization from 1920 to 1930,
were part of a four-venue tour of major Japanese cities.
Finally, the Hirshhorn’s Study for a Portrait of Van Gogh
III, by Francis Bacon, was part of an exhibition orga-
nized by the British Council in London that traveled to
the Soviet Union.

The Hirshhorn Museum’s acquisition funds were
handsomely increased by a gift from the Holenia Trust,
established by the late Joseph H. Hirshhorn for the ad-
vancement of art. The museum also received a grant
from the Lannan Foundation under its new contemporary
art acquisitions program for emerging artists. Two mu-
seum facilities were named in recognition of the support
of generous donors. The pool in the Sculpture Garden
has been designated the Jacob and Charlotte Lehrman
Foundation Pool and the auditorium now bears the name
the Marion and Gustave Ring Auditorium.

Education

The education department continued to bring the mu-
seum’s exhibitions and permanent collection alive for au-
diences ranging from schoolchildren to senior citizens. A
docent symposium, “Pulse: A Practicum on Current Ideas
and Approaches in Museum Education,” focused on mu-
seum outreach endeavors. The museum’s ninety-five do-
cents conducted tours for 18,000 visitors during the year.
Programs for area schools attracted both elementary- and
secondary-school students. The summer intern program

Iil
gave five undergraduate students much-desired museum
experience. Regularly scheduled free films about artists,
films by artist-filmmakers, and a special program of films
for young people were vital aspects of the museum’s out-
reach to the public.

Acquisitions

The museum’s permanent collection was enriched by
twenty-six gifts and twenty purchases. Among the recent
acquisitions are seven major works from the estate of
Marion L. Ring, the most significant art donation the
museum has received to date other than through Joseph
H. Hirshhorn’s benefactions. Works in the Ring gift in-
clude a wood sculpture by Ernst Barlach and paintings by
Milton Avery, Stuart Davis, Adolph Gottlieb, Giorgio
Morandi, and Edouard Vuillard. Other important addi-
tions to the collection were nine works from the Mary
and Leigh Block Collection, including sculptures by Jac-
ques Lipchitz, Marino Marini, and Auguste Rodin and a
painting by Daniel Vladimir Baranoff-Rossiné. Other
newly acquired paintings include: Everything Is Going
Well (1981), by Sandro Chia; Untitled (1988), by Moira
Dryer; Ancient Wall (1976), by Philip Guston; Landscape
(1987), by Robert Moskowitz; In the Dark (1987), by Eli-
zabeth Murray; Sanctuary (1988), by Gerhard Richter;
and Thursday (1960), by Jack Tworkov. Among the no-
table sculpture acquisitions are Spanse (1987), a paint-
infused bronze by Nancy Graves, and Timber’s Turns
(1987), a wood sculpture by Martin Puryear.

National Air and Space
Museum

The National Air and Space Museum, which houses the
largest collection of historic air and spacecraft in the
world, is the nation’s center for exhibition, education,
and research in the history of the science, technology,
and culture of aviation and spaceflight. This year the mu
seum took steps to make the contributions by other
nations to space exploration more visible. It also empha-
sized the development of long-range plans for exhibits
that will examine the history of aviation and space tech-
nology in its broader social and scientific contexts. The
museum recorded more than nine million visits in 1988.

Research

The museum’s three curatorial units conduct a wide
range of research projects. Research in the Department 0+
Aeronautics focuses principally on the history of aviation
technology. The Department of Space Science and Explo
ration carries out studies on the history of astronomy,
space science, and rocket and space technology. Scientific
research on satellite remote sensing of the Earth and on
comparative planetology is the emphasis of the Center fo:
Earth and Planetary Studies.

The activities of resident staff members are augmented)
by the work of visiting scholars, who use the museum’s
singular collections of artifacts and documents to pursue -
their research interests. In 1988 Dr. John W. Fozard,a
distinguished British aeronautical engineer and designer
and past president of the Royal Aeronautical Society,
held the Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace His-
tory. His research at the museum was concerned with
producing a definitive technical history of jet-powered lift
flight (used by a class of fixed-wing aircraft that can op-
erate from short runways and small ships). Dr. John A.
Simpson of the Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space
Research, University of Chicago, was appointed to the
Martin Marietta Chair in Space History. Simpson, who
was principal investigator on twenty-seven scientific
spacecraft missions, conducted research at the museum ta
document his successful placement of a dust detector on
the two Soviet Vega spacecraft to Comet Halley. Dr. Mi-
chael J. Neufeld of Colgate University came to the mu-
seum as the Verville Fellow to study the career of
Wernher von Braun.

Museum staff members published two major reference
works in 1988. Air and Space History: An Annotated Bib-
liography, compiled by curators Cathleen S. Lewis (De-
partment of Space Science and Exploration) and Dr.
Dominick A. Pisano (Department of Aeronautics), was

published by Garland Publishing. This book has been de-
scribed by one reviewer as a landmark event for scholars.
The year also saw publication of the definitive NASA
Historical Data Book, Volumes II and III, written by Lin
Ezell, the museum’s assistant director for collections
management.

Work has begun on the Smithsonian History of Avia-
tion book series, under the general editorship of Dr.
Dominick Pisano in collaboration with other aeronautics
department curators and an international board of edi-
tors. The series will include monographs as well as re-
prints of classics, source documents, and translations.

It was a benchmark year in historical research and
writing for several members of the Aeronautics Depart-
ment. R. E. G. Davies won the Aviation/Space Writers
Association Award of Excellence for the best nonfiction
aviation book of 1987, Rebels and Reformers of the Air-
ways, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.
Davies recently completed research for a book on the his-
tory of Lufthansa Airlines and is conducting research for
three additional books. Dr. Von Hardesty was coeditor
and translator of H. N. Finne’s important biography,
Igor Sikorsky: The Russian Years. Hardesty and Dr.
Dominick Pisano jointly wrote the introduction to
Thomas E. Simmons’s The Brown Condor, a historical
novel based on the life of John C. Robinson, an early
black aviator. Robert C. Mikesh published the Flying
Dragons: The South Vietnamese Air Force, one of the
few historical works available on the air war in Vietnam.
Peter Jakab is completing work on The Wright Flyer:
Study in the Process of Invention, to be published in
1989 by the Smithsonian Institution Press. Robert van der
inden completed the manuscript for a forthcoming book
n the Boeing 247, and Rick Leyes is coauthoring a book
with William R. Fleming) on the evolution of the small
as turbine aircraft engine industry in America.

In the Department of Space Science and Exploration,
the Glennan-Webb-Seamans Project for Research in
Space History, directed by Martin J. Collins, entered its
second year. Project staff are working on archives preser-
vation and conducting oral history interviews in support
f their research on the administration and management
f large-scale projects in the space program.

Also entering its second year was a collaborative pro-
ject between the Space Science and Exploration Depart-
ent and the Rand Corporation involving the archival
reservation of unpublished papers related to the first
ecade of the corporation and the compilation of more
han ten hours of videotaped interviews with Rand-asso-
iated pioneers in aerial and space-borne reconnaissance.

Curators Dr. Joseph Tatarewicz and Martin Collins are
coinvestigators on the project.

The NASM-Johns Hopkins University Program in the
History of Space Science continued, with the completion
and submission to Cambridge University Press of Shaping
the Space Telescope: The Interpenetration of Science,
Technology, and Politics, by Dr. Robert W. Smith et al.

Dr. Allan A. Needell is conducting research on several
fronts: the relations between physical scientists and the
American military and civilian space programs; the career
of Prof. Lloyd Berkner, first president of the Space Sci-
ence Board of the National Academy of Sciences; and the
study of cosmic rays and solar and terrestrial electromag-
netic fields using rockets and spacecraft. Needell has also
written an extensive introduction to be published in the
1988 reprinting of Max Planck’s classic Lectures on the
Theory of Heat Radiation.

Dr. Paul Ceruzzi completed a book on the history and
present role of computers in aerospace applications, to be
published next year by the MIT Press. The book will
document the forthcoming permanent exhibition, “Be-
yond the Limits: Flight Enters the Computer Age” (for
which Ceruzzi was curator), while treating the more sub-
tle historical issues in greater depth. Ceruzzi also contrib-
uted to the forthcoming book Computing before
Computers (Iowa State University Press).

Dr. David DeVorkin is completing Spectacle in the
Stratosphere, a major book on manned scientific balloon-
ing in the 1930s and r94os. Derek W. Elliott is conduct-
ing dissertation research on the political influences in the
development of early U.S. space policy.

Department curators have also been involved in univer-
sity teaching. Needell and Smith planned and taught a
graduate seminar on “The Organization of American Sci-
ence since 1930” at the Johns Hopkins University, and
Tatarewicz was named visiting assistant professor of his-
tory at the University of Maryland, teaching two courses,
“Science and Technology in World History” and “History
of Technology.”

In the museum’s Center for Earth and Planetary Stud-
ies (CEPS), basic research on the use of remote sensing of
terrestrial and planetary surfaces continued, with empha-
sis on desert regions of Earth and structural land forms
on Mars. Analysis of satellite images of Africa concen-
trated on determining changes that took place in Egypt,
Mali, and Botswana over a nine-year period. Analysis of
Landsat orbital images by Dr. Patricia Jacobberger
showed that desert dunes in Mali and Botswana that are
stabilized by vegetation do not migrate, but are subject to
increased local erosion from lack of rainfall. Fieldwork

113
and samples taken in 1988 resulted in an increased aware-
ness of climatic changes as a controlling factor of dune
form and migration rate.

Dr. Ted Maxwell’s investigations of the hyperarid de-
sert core in the Western Desert of Egypt and the northern
Sudan continued in 1988 with the mapping of sand sheet
deposits in the area where the Space Shuttle Radar Ex-
periment revealed buried drainage patterns in 1981. Com-
parison of images taken fifteen years apart has shown
significant change in the desert surface. Large-scale rip-
ples, 3 miles from crest to crest, were discovered in
Landsat images and confirmed by field surveying. These
features move up to 100 meters per year, transporting
enormous volumes of sand. Joint work with Dr. C.
Vance Haynes of the University of Arizona, who was a
senior postdoctoral fellow at CEPS in 1987, helped refine
prior estimates of dune migration rates in the region.

In November 1987, at an international conference in
Paris sponsored by the Centre Nationale d’Etude Spa-
tiales, Dr. Ted Maxwell and Constance Andre presented
their results of using the French SPOT satellite data. The
stereo capabilities of SPOT enabled them to define the
location of a fault system in Saudi Arabia, which may be
one of the largest known intracontinental faults.

Dr. Tom Watters used Viking Orbiter images of the
Martian surface together with models of structural geol-
ogy to deduce that folding of the near-surface crust has
played a major role in the tectonic evolution of the
planet. Analogous fold belts in the Columbia Plateau in
Washington State are being studied to further define the
role of folding and faulting. Additional Mars research by
Dr. Ted Maxwell detailed the timing and nature of fault-
ing episodes along the boundary between the southern,
highly cratered hemisphere and the northern smooth
plains. This work made it possible to identify a unique
class of rimless impact craters, indicating a widespread
zone of erosion or deposition early in Martian geological
history.

Studies of Mars using data from the Viking Infrared
Thermal Mapper experiment are planned to provide con-
straints on the size range of rocks exposed on the surface.
These studies, by Dr. Jim Zimbleman and Robert Crad-
dock, will be field-checked by studying analogous sur-
faces in the Mojave Desert.

Collections

In 1988 the museum completed a building at the Wash-
ington-Dulles International Airport to shelter part of the

114

collection that was previously out-of-doors. In addition

to the space shuttle Enterprise, the building houses sev-
eral historically important aircraft, including B-25, B-57,
and B-17 bombers; an F-8U Crusader; and a Junkers Ju-
52 transport plane. A Super Constellation transcontinen-
tal airliner has recently been acquired and is now at
Dulles.

The staff at the museum’s Paul E. Garber Preservation, —
Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland,
finished restoring the o8-2U Kingfisher seaplane, the Ar-
ado 234 German World War II jet bomber, and the
Fowler-Gage wooden biplane. Restoration work was
completed on the interior of the forward fuselage of the
Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, and the full restoration of this important air-
plane is now being given high priority. Complete restora-
tion of the ATS-6 satellite awaits only the treatment of
the antenna meshing and final assembly. The Hubble
Space Telescope’s structural dynamic test vehicle, slated
for exhibition in the museum’s Space Hall, is being |
treated at the Garber Facility, as are several small arti- |
facts that will figure prominently in the new aerospace
computing gallery, “Beyond the Limits.” Restoration has |
also begun on a World War II British Hawker Hurricane. —
Restoration efforts have been enhanced by the addition
of a program in which volunteers with special skills work ©
on restoration projects. Two new environmentally con- —
trolled storage units were constructed at the Garber Facil- |
ity this year. |

During 1988 the museum’s archives acquired 115 col- |
lections, including materials related to the Bendix Air |
Races and Trophy, donated by Allied-Signal Aerospace
Company; a collection from United Technologies Cor- |
poration; and personal papers, maps, charts, and memo- —
rabilia belonging to Arthur Raymond Brooks, who flew
the World War I Spad XIII aircraft that is now in the
museum’s collection.

The museum’s film archives acquired 800 films during
1988 from the Department of Defense Motion Picture De-
pository. Preservation efforts included duplication of a
film on the Grover Loening Aircraft Company.

Two videodiscs have been added to the museum cata-
logue and are ready for public distribution. Videodisc 4
contains 50,000 images of U.S. Air Force activities prior
to 1954 and includes the Air Force Art Collection; video-
disc 6, assembled with the cooperation of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), contains
100,000 images from all the U.S. lunar missions. |

To provide better support for curatorial and collection’!
management staffs, the museum is developing an interim —
collections information system. This on-line inventory
system, which will later be incorporated into the planned
Institution-wide Collections Information System, will give
the staff maximum computing power for recording infor-
mation about objects in the collection and provide im-
proved research and collections management capabilities.

Exhibitions

In December 1987, to mark the first anniversary of the
first nonstop, nonrefueled flight around the world, the

Craftsmen from the National Air and Space Museum’s Paul E. Garber Facility prepare to suspend the Voyager, the first aircraft to
fly around the world without landing or refueling, from the ceiling of the museum’s South Lobby on November 20, 1987.

museum opened “Voyager: Around the World without a
Pit Stop.” The exhibition has become one of the most
popular at the museum. It features Dick Rutan and
Jeanna Yeager’s Voyager aircraft, together with photo-
graphs and a videotape of highlights of the flight.

“Horizons,” a new art exhibition in the Flight and the
Arts Gallery, features the extraordinary paintings and
drawings of British artist Robert Taylor. Many of the
thoroughly researched and meticulously detailed paint-
ings and drawings are highly realistic portrayals of inci-
dents that occurred during World War II.

II5
The spirit of international cooperation is alive and well
at the museum and is being fostered through an exhibi-
tion of full-scale and engineering test models of space-
craft developed by the European Space Agency (ESA).
The exhibition, mounted with the cooperation of ESA,
includes the Giotto spacecraft, which approached within
370 miles of Comet Halley in 1986 and obtained the first
detailed images of a comet nucleus; the Ulysses space-
craft, which will be launched in 1990 into an orbit taking
it over the heretofore unseen poles of the Sun; the Hip-
parcos satellite, which will carry an astronomical tele-
scope designed to bring unprecedented accuracy to the
determination of the positions and motions of the stars;
and Exosat, a satellite that will study x-ray sources in
our galaxy and beyond.

A team of five staff members led by Claudia Oakes
continued its work on the new World War I gallery. This
major project will address the historical theme of the gen-
esis of air power in its larger social and political context.
Work also began on a new exhibition to mark the 1989
centenary of the birth of Igor Sikorsky, the famed Rus-
sian-American aircraft designer.

In cooperation with the U.S. Customs Service, the mu-
seum produced an exhibition titled “The War against
Drugs: Air Interdiction Program,” which portrayed the
agency’s use of aircraft to prevent the airborne smuggling
of illicit drugs into the United States.

As part of the museum’s continuing effort to represent
women in its exhibitions, an exhibition devoted to the
history of “Women in Helicopter Aviation” was added to
the Vertical Flight Gallery. This photographic display
was produced in cooperation with Whirly-Girls, the in-
ternational association of women helicopter pilots.

Public Events and Educational Programs

During the year the museum presented a wide selection of
programs and events designed to educate, entertain, and
involve the public in the museum. From the popular
IMAX films shown in the Samuel P. Langley Theater to
outreach programs for minority young people, the mu-
seum’s public programs appealed to a cross section of the
museum’s audience. Lectures and seminars for scholars
and specialists also drew on the rich resources of the mu-
seum’s collections and research efforts.

The Office of Public Affairs and Museum Services con-
tinued to run the well-received thirteen-week “Fly-By-
Night” series, intended to take advantage of the mu-
seum’s late summer evening hours. The series included
lectures, films, and other free activities for families.

116

The office also coordinated the second annual nation-
wide photography contest, “Focus on Flight,” adding spe- |
cial categories for young people and senior citizens. An
exhibition featuring the prizewinning entries was installed
in the Pioneers of Flight Gallery. At a press conference in ©
May 1988, the museum announced the winners in its |
Race for Space Software Chase, a computer software }
competition among colleges and universities nationwide. _
The competition was sponsored jointly by the museum
and by Apple Computer, Inc. The museum will install
the winning entries in the new gallery, “Beyond the Lim- |
its: Flight Enters the Computer Age,” which opens in
May 1989.

On June 30 the Samuel P. Langley Theater welcomed
the ten millionth visitor to see the film To Fly. Regina
Doll of Thurmont, Maryland, was greeted on arrival by
Dr. Martin Harwit, director of the National Air and
Space Museum, and Stacy Mobley, vice-president for fed-
eral affairs of the Dupont Company, the film’s sponsor.
The five IMAX films commissioned by the museum—To
Fly, The Dream Is Alive, On the Wing, Living Planet,
and Flyers—continue to play to delighted audiences.

During the year the museum offered free to the public _
nine General Electric Aviation Lectures, twelve Monthly
Sky Lectures in the Albert Einstein Planetarium, seven
aviation film classics, eight space science fiction film clas-
sics, four lectures titled “Astronomical Enigmas: True
Mysteries of the Cosmos” and delivered by scientists
from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, five
lectures on “The Universe in a New Light” by distin-
guished astrophysicists, and a well-attended, seven-part
adult education course entitled “Investigating Modern As-
tronomy.” The latter, presented in the Albert Einstein
Planetarium, dealt with topics ranging from the use of a
telescope to the large-scale structure of the universe. The |
annual Wernher von Braun lecture was given by Gen.
Samuel C. Phillips (USAF, Ret.) and was called “Destina-.
tion Space: Managing the U.S. Space Program.” Dr. John:
W. Fozard gave the annual Lindbergh lecture on “The
Engineering Elegance of Jumping Jets.” |

The museum marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of
planetary exploration with a lecture by Dr. Carl Sagan,
“Voyage to Venus: The Mission of Mariner 2”; a lecture
by Dr. Jeff Plescia of NASA, “Exploring the Planet
Mars”; and a video history symposium with pioneers of |
the planetary program entitled “Toward a Venus En- |
counter, 1962: The Organization and Execution of Man- |
kind’s First Mission to Another Planet.”

Under the auspices of the Office of Cooperative Pro- |
grams, the museum conducted a one-week workshop in |

The Viking Lander, identical to the two that landed on Mars in
1976, was of particular interest to King Carl XVI Gustaf of
Sweden on his early morning visit to the National Air and
Space Museum on April 11, 1988. Accompanying the king were
Director Martin Harwit (left) and Deputy Director Donald S.
Lopez (right).

January on the history of aviation, spaceflight, and re-
lated technologies for twenty professors from the Univer-
sity of Maryland and Clemson University who are
participating in the New Liberal Arts Program of the
Sloan Foundation. A random-access videodisc and curric-
ulum material based on the workshop will constitute an
aviation module for courses on the history of technology
in the New Liberal Arts Program.

In March the museum and the American Association of
Museums cosponsored a two-day seminar, “Mutual Con-
cerns of Air Museums.” The seminar included lectures,
behind-the-scenes tours, and workshops.

In April the museum sponsored an all-day seminar,
“Blacks in Aviation: Three Historic Films.” This event
brought together for the first time an eminent group of
historians and specialists to evaluate the contribution of
blacks to aviation in the social and racial context of
America from the 1920s through the 1940s. Among the
invited guests were Gen. Benjamin O. Davis and the Tus-
keegee Airmen.

This year the Office of Volunteer Services recruited
behind-the-scenes volunteers with wood- and metalwork-
ing skills to undertake restoration projects at the Garber

Facility. The office also initiated a series of summer
“highlights” tours of the museum designed for a school-
age audience.

The museum began a new minority outreach program
that brings to Washington, D.C.—area public schools the
relatively unknown story of the contributions of blacks to
American aviation. To follow up and reinforce the class-
room program, the students may tour the museum with
their classes. The tour emphasizes the “Black Wings” ex-
hibit about black aviators and astronauts and features an
IMAX film showing. The program has visited more than
thirty area schools this year; more than half of these vis-
its have resulted in group tours of the museum.

For Black History Month in February, the museum of-
fered “Flying against Tradition: Blacks in Aviation.” This
program included lectures titled “Blacks in Space Flight,”
by Derek Elliott, assistant curator in the Department of
Space Science and Exploration; “From These Begin-
nings,” by Elwood Driver, director of NASA’s Aircraft
Management Office; and “Memoirs of a Black Fighter
Pilot,” by Louis R. Purnell, a former National Air and
Space Museum curator.

To mark Hispanic Heritage Week in September, the
museum offered free recorded tours in Spanish and Por-
tuguese. Also featured was an evening lecture by astro-
naut Sidney M. Gutierrez (Major, USAF) called “Return
to Flight.”

The museum’s Office of Publications produced The Of-
ficial Guide to the National Air and Space Museum, pub-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution Press. The office
also coordinated publications projects for other museum
departments.

The museum’s Education Resource Center opened on
January 12, 1988, with astronaut Jon McBride as the
guest speaker. More than 1,300 teachers visited the cen-
ter, which provides air-and-space-related materials for
teachers, during its first six months of operation.

The Office of Education produced three new publi-
cations this year: Discovery, a curriculum package for
kindergarten through third grade, produced in coopera-
tion with NASA; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, a guide for the very young
visitor; and Skylines, a quarterly newsletter for educa-
tors. Kasse Andrews-Weller of the Office of Education
received a Charles A. Lindbergh Foundation grant to de-
velop a slide kit, “The Fragile Earth.”

The museum conducted fifteen teacher workshops on a
wide variety of subjects during the year. An “Exploring
Frontiers” workshop was presented in collaboration with
the National Science Foundation. Six workshops were
funded by the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian

117
Associates, and two were offered for continuing educa-
tion credit through Oklahoma State University.

In collaboration with the Anacostia Museum, District
of Columbia Public Schools, and the National Urban Co-
alition, the museum held several workshops on the
grounds of the Anacostia Museum involving building,
flying, and launching hot air balloons, kites, and rockets.

Air & Space/Smithsonian

The bimonthly magazine Air & Space/Smithsonian
marked its second anniversary by creating a “Space Ex-
plorers” poster for insertion in the April/May 1988 issue.
The poster, a compilation of photographs and data on all
204 astronauts and cosmonauts from nineteen countries
who had orbited the Earth by the end of 1987, was pre-
sented to the science adviser to the president and to the
Soviet Academy of Sciences. In addition to the 390,000
copies of the poster that were inserted in Air @Space/
Smithsonian, 100,000 copies were purchased for distribu-
tion by NASA; 60,000 were inserted in the magazine So-
viet Life, published by the Soviet government for readers
in the United States; and another 60,000 (in Russian
translation) were inserted in the magazine Amerika, pub-
lished by the U.S. Information Agency for readers in the
Soviet Union. The shared poster represents a first in edi-
torial collaboration between these two magazines, which
are published under the terms of a bilateral governmental
agreement.

In further recognition of international space efforts, Air
e& Space/Smithsonian published “The Chariot of Indra”
on the space program of India and “Balloons over Venus”
on the Soviet Vega mission to the planet Venus and
Comet Halley. For the latter article, the magazine com-
missioned five paintings by astronomical artist Ron
Miller.

National Museum of
African Art

The past year marked a milestone for the National Mu-
seum of African Art: its first year at its new location on
the National Mall. Nineteen eighty-eight also saw the
museum take great strides toward realizing director Syl-
via Williams’s vision of bringing to the public the finest,
most classic examples of the art of Africa south of the
Sahara. Exhibitions and activities during the year rein-
forced the museum’s goal of guarding, cherishing, and
sharing these works, which stand as a tribute to the crea-
tive skill and ingenuity of African artists and to their dy-
namic past.

A record number of visits—640,000 in all—were re-
corded by the National Museum of African Art, the only
museum in the United States dedicated to the collection,
exhibition, and study of the art of Africa south of the
Sahara. Among the distinguished visitors were U.S. Su-
preme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor; Her Royal
Highness, the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg; the am-
bassadors to the United States from Senegal, Nigeria,
Italy, and Switzerland; the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Ofala
Okagbue III; and Princess Njoya of Bamum, Cameroon.

Exhibitions

Five inaugural exhibitions launched the museum’s ambi-
tious exhibition schedule for the year. Among the high-
lights was “The Permanent Collection of the National
Museum of African Art,” including sculpture, textiles,
utilitarian objects, and decorative arts. “African Art in
the Cycle of Life” featured eighty-eight works illustrating
various stages of the life cycle, from birth and the coming
of age to death, the afterlife, and ancestors. Three addi-
tional installations, focusing on African textiles (“Patterns
of Life: West African Strip-Weaving Traditions”), utili-
tarian objects (“Objects of Use”), and Benin metal sculp- —
ture (“Royal Benin Art in the Collection of the National
Museum of African Art”), completed the opening exhibi- —
tion schedule. |
Nine months after opening its doors, the museum pre- —
sented two exhibitions, one focusing on historical photo- |
graphs of a Cameroonian kingdom in the early r900s and _
the other featuring textiles from Zaire. “Images from Ba- |
mum: German Colonial Photography at the Court of |
King Njoya, Cameroon, West Africa, 1902-1915,” pre-
sented sixty compelling photographs taken by German
colonials portraying the life at the court of King Njoya,
ruler of the Bamum Kingdom in Cameroon at the turn of |
the century. The second exhibition, “Shoowa Design: |
Raffia Textiles from Zaire,” featured more than roo raf-
fia textiles created by the Shoowa group of Zaire’s Kuba
peoples.

As the fiscal year came to a close, curatorial and other
museum staff were putting the finishing touches on two
major fall exhibitions celebrating Kalabari art and ritual.
“Kalabari Ancestral Screens: Levels of Meaning,” will ex-
plore the traditional function and use of the screens as
well as their history and formal qualities. The museum’s
first exhibition of contemporary art since becoming part
of the Smithsonian, “Echoes of the Kalabari: Sculpture
by Sokari Douglas Camp,” will feature life-size figurative
sculpture in steel and other materials. Inspired by Kala-
bari performing and visual arts, Sokari Douglas Camp
draws inspiration from Kalabari masquerades, funeral
celebrations, and festivals.

Acquisitions

In the past year twenty-two works of art were added to
the permanent collection, including five objects acquired
through gift and thirteen acquired through purchase. In
addition, a rare Yoruba staff was purchased with funds
provided by the Smithsonian Institution Collections Ac-
quisitions Program. A Kuba mat and a Mangbetu vessel
were acquired through a combination of donated and
federal funds. A grant from the James Smithson Society
supplemented federal funds that enabled the museum to
purchase a Hongwe reliquary guardian figure. Among the
gifts to the museum were a Fulani textile given by the
National Museum of Guinea-Bissau and a Kente cloth
donated in honor of Secretary Emeritus S. Dillon Ripley
and Mary Ripley.

Education and Research

A rich program of lectures, teacher workshops, seminars,
performances, demonstrations, and films brought the
museum’s exhibitions and collections alive for audiences
ranging from elementary-school children to senior citi-
zens. Several projects—including workshops and a book-
let of gallery activities for both children and adults—were
organized in conjunction with the “Shoowa Design”
exhibition.

The museum launched its first film series—one for chil-
dren and another showcasing films on the lives of African
women—and began planning for a third series on the
aesthetics of African cinema. Another educational pro-
ject, funded by the Women’s Committee of the Smithson-

I20

ian Associates, invited students from Washington, D.C.,
high schools to participate in a ten-week in-depth study
of the museum profession and African art.

Additional events included a two-day symposium held
at the museum on “History, Design, and Craft in West
African Strip-Woven Cloth” and a reception to celebrate
the dedication of the museum’s Smithsonian branch li-
brary, which is named for museum founder Warren M.
Robbins. Curators, scholars, and the museum’s designer
and conservator participated in a week-long seminar,
“African Art at the Smithsonian,” held in conjunction
with the Smithsonian National Associate Program.

Throughout the year, the museum’s curatorial staff and —
guest curators published exhibition catalogues and addi-
tional informational materials to accompany the exhibi-
tions. A brochure on the permanent collection was
published to complement the didactic material in “The
Permanent Collection of the National Museum of African »
Art.” The full-color brochure focuses on masks and mask —
performances, rites of passage, regalia and personal
adornment, and artists and clients.

Dr. Herbert M. Cole, the recipient of a Rockefeller
Residency Fellowship in the Humanities, studied “Arche-
types: Five Themes in the Visual Arts of Africa,” which is —
scheduled to open as an exhibition in the fall of 1989.
Funded by a grant from the Smithsonian Institution Spe-
cial Exhibition Fund along with federal funding, the ex-
hibition will be accompanied by a scholarly publication |
that will illustrate all the exhibited works of art and ex- |
plore the related imagery and ideas in depth. |

Research and planning continue for a future major ex-
hibition on the art and architecture of African nomads. A —
grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for a working
conference set the parameters for this exhibition. |

The museum’s full-time paid staff grew to nearly sixty,
double the number of people who worked at the museum —
when it became part of the Smithsonian Institution in
1979. In addition, dozens of docents and information
desk volunteers helped to fulfill the museum’s mandate of _
educating the public about African art.

ational Museum of
merican Art

The National Museum of American Art (NMAA) is dedi-
cated to the acquisition, preservation, study, and exhibi-
tion of American painting, sculpture, graphic arts,
photography, and folk art. The Renwick Gallery, a cura-
torial department of the NMAA, collects and exhibits
American crafts, decorative arts, and design objects. The
Barney Studio House is also maintained by the museum
as a period home open for tours and special interpretive
programs.
The museum houses the largest collection of American
art in the world, now comprising almost 34,000 objects.
In addition, the NMAA maintains seven research data
bases, which include over 500,000 object listings of
merican art, for the benefit of investigators both at the
Smithsonian and throughout the country. Complement-
ing the research opportunities at the museum and within
the Institution are active programs for fellows and in-
terns, which serve some forty-five scholars and students
each year.

After six years of leadership as director of the museum,
Dr. Charles C. Eldredge announced his resignation effec-
tive August 22, 1988. Until a search committee chooses a
uccessor, assistant director and chief curator Dr. Eliza-
beth Broun will serve as acting director. Among his ac-
complishments during his tenure, Dr. Eldredge
reorganized the museum’s administrative structure and
budgetary practices; established the American Art Forum
as an important support group for the Smithsonian col-
lections of American art; founded the nationally re-
spected Smithsonian Studies in American Art; reinstalled
the museum’s galleries with fresh coherence and beauty;

nd profoundly enhanced the museum’s collection both in
scope and substance.

Renwick Gallery

This year the Renwick Gallery presented a series of suc-
essful exhibitions on diverse themes in American crafts
nd decorative arts. Its major effort culminated in the
resentation of “Lost and Found Traditions: Native
merican Art 1965-1985,” organized by the American
ederation of Arts and curated by former NMAA senior
ellow Ralph T. Coe. Tracing the threads of continuity
etween artistic traditions rooted in the past and their
urrent manifestations, the 380 Native American works
n the exhibition demonstrated a will for cultural sur-

vival. Many people had believed that such objects were

no longer being made, but far less has been lost than had
been assumed, and traditions thought to have been aban-

doned have survived and evolved. Among the objects in
the exhibition were canoes, drums, a full-size tepee,
masks, a cradle, feather war bonnets, kachinas, and vari-
ous textiles.

An impressive array of public programs and events en-
hanced “Lost and Found Traditions.” A colorful and dra-
matic ceremonial dedication, featuring singing and
dancing in tribal dress, took place in Lafayette Park
across from the White House. In addition, craft demon-
strations were held throughout the duration of the exhi-
bition on such topics as pottery decoration, beading
applications, mask making, rug and basket weaving, and
flute making.

Another series of public programs at the Renwick dur-
ing Black History Month considered the historical and
contemporary contributions of Afro-Americans in aes-
thetic and functional crafts. A panel discussion, an illus-
trated lecture by a story quilter, and a presentation by a
multimedia artist explored the historical background and
African antecedents of cloth, clay, and wood crafts. Also
discussed was the fine line between folk art, crafts, and
memorabilia.

I21
Other exhibitions at the Renwick in 1988 included
“Cynthia Schira: New Work,” which presented this art-
ist’s intricate abstract weavings created on a computer-
ized loom; “American Art Pottery, 1880-1930, from the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum,” which featured seventy-five ex-
amples in the aesthetic and historical development of this
movement; and “Clay Revisions: Plate, Cup, Vase,”
which examined three traditional ceramic forms as trans-
formed into nonfunctional art objects by twenty-six na-
tionally known contemporary American artists.

In an effort to foster scholarly activities at the Ren-
wick, the James Renwick Fellowships in American Crafts
were inaugurated in 1988. After a national competition
based on the criteria of historical, aesthetic, and intellec-
tual study and evaluation of the American studio craft
movement, two recipients were appointed. These in-resi-
dence fellows conducted research on critical approaches
to art in craft materials and on fiber art as a manifesta-
tion of the post-World War II crafts revival in America.

Two other events of 1988 will greatly strengthen the
Renwick and its programs: the appointment by the
NMAA Commission of an ad hoc advisory committee to
encourage new initiatives, increase collecting and other
opportunities, and extend the efforts of the professional
staff; and the inclusion of the Renwick as a beneficiary of
the Smithsonian’s Collections Acquisitions Program. As a
result of the latter, the gallery was able to acquire major
works by such notable artists as William Hunt Diederich,
Lenore Tawney, William Daley, and Frederick Miller.
Significant gifts and purchases from other sources in-
cluded important works by Otto Natzler, John McQueen,
Tom Patti, Paul Bogatay, Tage Frid, and Frances and
Michael Higgins.

Research Resources and Activities

In the spring of 1988, with the support of the Henry Luce
Foundation, the museum began a nationwide solicitation
of information for its newest research data base, the In-
ventory of American Sculpture. Questionnaires were
mailed to more than 14,000 museums, historical socie-
ties, and cultural institutions around the country; respon-
ses have been received at a steady rate. The Inventory,
which began with a core of 24,000 records developed
through a pilot project in fiscal year 1987, will continue
with a national survey and conservation assessment of
outdoor sculpture, to be cosponsored by the NMAA and
the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural
Property, in cooperation with the American Association

I22

for State and Local History, the National Conference of
State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Park
Service, and the Smithsonian Conservation Analytical
Laboratory.

The NMAA’s widely acclaimed scholarly journal,
Smithsonian Studies in American Art, this year increased
the number of annual issues from two to three; articles
have been secured to put the journal on a quarterly publi-
cation schedule beginning in 1989. Articles ranged over a
wide spectrum of subjects and approaches, from an in-
sightful interview with contemporary artist Wayne Thie-
baud to a new investigation of the scenic artistry in the
classic film Casablanca.

During the year, the museum welcomed its second con-
secutive Smithsonian Regents Fellow. Dr. Albert Boime,
professor of art history at the University of California,
Los Angeles, pursued research on the social history of
modern art and on American art at the 1899 Paris Expo-
sition. Other fellows and visiting scholars in residence
during the year came from such universities as Cornell,
Minnesota, Arizona, Syracuse, Tennessee, and Connecti-
cut College.

Exhibitions |

The museum presented exhibitions of works by specific
artists and exhibitions drawn from thematic topics per-
taining to the history of American art. The source for
“Special Delivery: Murals for the New Deal Era” was the
museum’s collection of mural studies submitted in na-
tional competitions held between 1934 and 1943 for com-—
missions to decorate post offices and other federal
buildings. In addition to studies on paper and sections of
actual murals, the exhibition included sculpture that was _
executed for specific federal projects. In conjunction with
the exhibition, author Studs Terkel moderated a panel
discussion on related federal arts activities during the
1930s and 1940s, featuring artists who had worked under
New Deal programs. After closing in September 1988,
“Special Delivery” began a five-city tour.

Three exhibitions continued the museum’s new direc-
tion of exploring contemporary photography as artistic
expression. “City Life: Photographs by Bruce Davidson”
consisted of 168 works selected by the museum from |
three of Davidson’s series, which illustrate the often mov-)
ing and sometimes brutal life of New York City in
streets, subways, and a cafeteria. Organized by the Cen- |
ter for Creative Photography, “Supreme Instants: The |
Photography of Edward Weston” surveyed this pioneer-
ing artist’s entire oeuvre from 1904 until 1947, when he

was stricken by Parkinson’s disease; the exhibition in-
cluded many images that have long been classics in the
field of photography. “Wanderlust,” from the Hallmark
Collection, provided a taste of the exotic with works by
eight contemporary photographers who recorded scenes
of such diverse locales as Spitzbergen and Calcutta, Cairo
and Beijing, Kyoto and Afghanistan.

For the avant-garde, “Lucas Samaras: Objects and Sub-
jects, 1969-1986,” organized by the Denver Art Museum,
presented an overview of this artist’s remarkable versatil-
ity and intellectual challenge in a host of expressive me-
dia. Assemblages of distorted and transformed objects
(including jeweled, reliquary-like boxes filled with bizarre
materials), “unsittable” and encrusted chairs, and a 5o0-
foot-long mirrored corridor were shown with paintings,
sculpture, photographs, collages, and cloth hangings.
The artist assisted with the design of the installation and
was present at the opening.

More traditional images from the museum’s collections
provided the basis for special thematic installations in the
galleries, such as “Images of Innocence: The Child in
American Art,” drawn from paintings and sculpture of
the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth century, when chil-
dren were often idealized as examples of purity. “Close
Focus: Prints, Drawings, and Photographs” examined
ways in which contemporary realists crop and press their
images so near the frontal plane of the picture that lines,
forms, and color fields work as abstractions. “Drawings
from the Collection” and “Olympian Trials” (a selection
of photographs from Walter Iooss, Jr.’s, portfolio of ath-
letic events) presented other works that had not been pre-
viously shown at the museum.

The return of “Treasures from the National Museum
of American Art,” which had been on tour since February
1986, required an extensive rehanging of the permanent
collection galleries. Two other large-scale exhibitions or-
ganized by the museum completed their national tours:
“John La Farge” (which opened at the NMAA and trav-
eled to two other locations) and “American Art Deco”
(which opened at the Renwick and traveled to five other
venues).

Acquisitions

A number of major gifts and purchases enriched the
NMAA’s permanent collection this year. The museum’s
extensive holdings in American landscape painting were
further strengthened by gifts of Thomas Moran’s Rain-
bow over the Grand Canyon, 1900 (bequest of Marion
H. Conley); Looking Out of Battle Harbor, 1877, by Wil-

FARE NC "Ir a

liam Bradford (gift of David S. Purvis); and Sanford Gif-
ford’s From the Shawangunk Mountains (gift of the
Estate of Charles H. Ettl). The twentieth-century collec-
tions were enhanced by the addition of Leon Kroll’s Sum-
mer, New York, 1931 (bequest of Mrs. Leon Kroll).
Preamble, 1987, Mike Wilkins’s assemblage of “vanity”
license plates from fifty-one states spelling out the pream-
ble to the U.S. Constitution, a project conceived to com-
memorate that document’s bicentennial, received
substantial public and media interest; it came as a gift to
the museum from Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A.
A series of twenty-five photogravures of Indian life (c.
1903-27) by Edward Curtis was added to the photogra-
phy collection as a transfer by the U.S. Department of
Justice from art confiscated under its drug enforcement
program. The National Endowment for the Arts made a
significant transfer of sixty-four prints created under its

123
grant programs by such artists as Robert Rauschenberg,
Jasper Johns, Josef Albers, Ernest Trova, William T.
Wiley, and Jacob Lawrence.

The museum was able to make significant purchases
through a combination of federal and trust funds. These
included Marsden Hartley’s Yliaster (Paracelsus), a 1932
oil reflecting the artist’s conjunction of landscape and
spiritual themes; Raymond Jonson’s Composition Four—
Melancholia (Space Moods), 1925, an oil on canvas; and
John Trumbull’s The Misses Mary and Hannah Murray,
1806, a rare double portrait from the early Federalist pe-
riod. The Pilgrim of the World at the End of His Jour-
ney, 1846-48, by Thomas Cole, a study for the artist’s
ultimate but unrealized allegorical cycle, joined another
work from this series already in the museum’s collection.

Collections Management

Computer-assisted object tracking has greatly enhanced
collections management in all areas during the past three
years. The system was developed in cooperation with the
Smithsonian Office of Information Resource Manage-
ment and is in use at four locations within the museum.
Efforts have begun to expand its use to include inventory
functions.

In 1988 the NMAA launched its Artist Authority Proj-
ect to establish a data base that will link listings in the
museum’s permanent collection and those in its seven re-
search data bases. More than 2,500 artists’ names have
now been researched. In a related effort, the NMAA has
joined other Smithsonian bureaus in a continuing analysis
of collection information, research, and collection man-
agement needs and the data structures that will support
access to collection information at the Smithsonian. A
working information model has been produced, and the
feasibility of providing simultaneous electronic access to
images and data for research use of the museum’s perma-
nent collection has been successfully demonstrated using
CD-ROM, which incorporates text and images on a laser
disc.

Continuing its policy of supporting important exhibi-
tions at other museums and institutions in the United
States and abroad, the museum this year lent a total of
187 artworks from its collection. Not only was art added
to the NMAA’s collection, but a total of 301 deacces-
sioned works from the collection were sold at public auc-
tion. Proceeds from the sales will be used solely for
acquisitions for the collection, with donors’ names appro-
priately credited for the newly acquired works.

National Museum of
American History

The National Museum of American History (NMAH) in-
vestigates, interprets, collects, preserves, exhibits, and
honors the heritage of the American people. The mu-
seum’s first responsibility is to protect and present tangi-
ble pieces of history—tools, machines, gowns, ceramics,
photographs, and countless other survivors of the past.
But it also seeks to reconstruct more elusive pieces of the
past through music, drama, and the oral heritage of
Americans. Drawing on original research, the museum’s
exhibitions, publications, and public programs contribute:
to both the scholarly understanding of American history
and the broad dissemination of knowledge.

The life of the museum this year was full and varied.
The year began with the opening of a controversial exhi-—
bition on the constitutional issues raised by the intern-
ment of Japanese Americans during World War II;
included the acquisition of the magnificent Duke Elling-
ton Collection of the composer’s manuscripts, photo-
graphs, papers, and many other objects; and ended with
the completion of the Smithsonian Institution’s first child’
care center.

Exhibitions

The museum presented more than two dozen exhibitions.
large and small, in the last year. The first was among the’
most dramatic. “A More Perfect Union: Japanese Ameri-
cans and the United States Constitution,” which opened
in October 1987, focuses attention on the bicentennial of
the U.S. Constitution. Funded through a special congres- |
sional appropriation, the exhibition explores a period
when fear and racial prejudice upset the balance between
the rights of the citizen and the power of the state and
led to the internment of some 120,000 Japanese Ameri-
cans during World War II. The exhibition features scores
of everyday objects and works of art made by Japanese
Americans in internment camps during the war and com-
pelling video interviews with men and women who spent
months, even years, in the camps. A section also de-
scribes the valor of the men of the rooth Battalion/442nd
Regimental Combat Team, an all-Japanese American unit
of the U.S. Army.

Events of the late summer confirmed that the influence
of this period continues to ripple through American his-
tory. On August 4, 1988, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives voted the nation’s apologies to Japanese Americans
interned during the war and granted cash reparations of
$20,000 to each of about 60,000 surviving internees.

The next large exhibition demonstrated the museum’s

willingness to tackle even the most complicated and con-
temporary of subjects. “The Search for Life: Genetic
echnology in the Twentieth Century,” which opened in
ovember 1987, chronicled the rise of molecular biology
and genetic engineering. Funded by a grant from the

V. K. Kellogg Foundation, the exhibition explored how
the knowledge gained in these fields brings with it a new
responsibility. It pointed to technologies with which peo-
ole can alter their environment, create man-made plants
and animals, and, perhaps, even manipulate their own

“A Material World” opened in April and serves as a
zeneral introduction to the artifacts of the museum as a
whole. Most exhibitions ask questions like “Who made
hese objects, how, and what were they used for?” This
exhibition poses other, seldom-asked questions: “What is
his object made of, why, and why does it matter?” Using
aundreds of objects, from a spinning wheel to a dragster,
he exhibition traces changes in the composition of arti-
acts over the past 250 years and explores how our
hoices of materials affect the makeup and “feel” of our
artificial environment. A softcover exhibition booklet by
istorian of science Robert Friedel accompanies the exhi-
dition, which was funded by E. I. du Pont de Nemours
and Company.

_ For the last large exhibition of the year, the museum
‘iterally raised the roof. From July 1 on, visitors at the
museum’s Constitution Avenue entrance encountered a
sonian Automatic House, designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright in 1955 and erected for “Frank Lloyd Wright: In
he Realm of Ideas.” Organized by the Scottsdale Arts
enter Association and the Frank Lloyd Wright Founda-
tion, this traveling exhibition explores the ideas and

‘rom his writings.

The museum’s other exhibitions addressed subjects as
liverse as international art medals; changing visual im-
iges of work and workers in America; and the develop-
nent of the collotype process, one of the first successful
nethods of printing photographs in permanent ink. One
exhibition highlighted the national efforts to preserve and
estore migratory waterfowl populations and the wet-
ands they inhabit, efforts made possible in part through
he sale of Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation

As quartet-in-residence at the National Museum of American
History, the Smithson String Quartet holds a preeminent posi-
tion as one of the few quartets to perform the great classical
and early romantic repertoire on original instruments. The
members of the quartet are (from left to right) Marilyn Mc-
Donald, Jaap Schroeder, Judson Griffin, and Kenneth Slowik.

Research, Scholarship, and Collections

The research and collecting activities of curators and
other staff members lay the groundwork for the mu-
seum’s exhibitions and publications. Some of the year’s
notable developments for each of the museum’s major
units, and for several other smaller scholarly enterprises,
are described here.

In addition to opening “A Material World,” the De-
partment of the History of Science and Technology con-
tinued its work toward the reinstallation of other halls of
science and technology. The two largest projects under
way are a permanent exhibition on information technol-
ogy and its effects on society, scheduled to open in
March 1990, and a new hall of American science, empha-
sizing the history of the physical sciences, especially
chemistry, during the last century.

During the past year, the department established im-
portant new contacts with scholars abroad, especially in
Asia. Ramunas Kondratas and Michael Harris of the Di-
vision of Medical Sciences visited the People’s Republic of
China to promote communication between Chinese and
American medical historians and to study how traditional
Chinese methods are being practiced in conjunction with
Western medicine. Historians Marie Mattson, David Alli-
son, and Arthur Molella accompanied Secretary Adams
to Japan to begin a dialogue with museum officials, scho-
lars, and industrial leaders there on issues of technologi-
cal history. Dr. Bernard Finn, curator in the Division of
Electricity and Modern Physics, traveled to India as a
consultant for an exhibition on the information age, and
a group from India visited the Smithsonian in September.

A brief list must represent the many other projects un-
dertaken by members of the department. As part of the
celebration of the centennial of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), staff of the Division of Medical Sciences
used objects from the collections to re-create a part of the
original U.S. Hygienic Laboratory, which evolved into
the NIH. Lu Ann Jones, a historian working for the Divi-
sion of Agriculture and Natural Resources, completed in-
terviews of 175 farm men and women for the Oral
History of Southern Agriculture project. Smithsonian
photographers also took thousands of photographs of the
subjects. Donald Kloster, curator in the Division of
Armed Forces History, served as a member of a joint
U.S.-Canadian team that identified artifacts from the
War of 1812 at Fort Erie, Canada. The investigation de-
termined that remains found at the site were those of a
member of the U.S. Army; they were brought to the
United States and reinterred in a veterans’ cemetery at
Bath, New York.

Among the department’s important accessions were
SCAMP, the first personal computer made by IBM; a
Rumely Oil Pull 20-40 tractor; the laboratory instruments
and notes of Stanley Cohen of Stanford University, who
with Herbert Boyer invented and patented the technique
for producing recombinant DNA; a complete uniform of
Helen Ostheimer, World War I U.S. Marine, 1918-19;
and an eighteen-inch Hadley quadrant, which became the
standard instrument for determining latitude at sea in the
late eighteenth century.

The work of the Department of Social and Cultural
History revealed an ongoing concern for the study of the
diverse traditions present in America and an increased
emphasis on twentieth-century material culture. This year
the Afro-American Index Project, directed by Theresa
Singleton, neared the end of its task of collecting informa-

126

tion about Afro-American artifacts housed in five Smith-
sonian bureaus. The information will be published in a
collections guide that will include essays on Afro-American’
material culture. New curators Charles McGovern and
Bernice Reagon bring to the Division of Community Life —
expertise in the history of consumerism and in Afro-
American culture, respectively, to reinforce the museum’s—
commitments in these areas. ;

The Division of Musical Instruments and staff from the
Department of Public Programs’ performance section
merged to create the Division of Musical History; its re-
search, acquisition, exhibition, and performance objec-
tives emphasize music in America. The division organized
several critically acclaimed performances featuring the
Smithson Quartet and the Smithsonian Chamber Orches- —
tra, culminating in the first U.S. performance of Bee-
thoven symphonies using period instruments.

Dramatic progress was made during the year on the
planned long-term interpretive exhibition on nineteenth-
century America, and work proceeded for its counterpart
on the twentieth century. Barbara Smith and Claudia
Kidwell, with the staff of the Division of Costume, con-
tinue to combine social history with costume history in
an exploration of attitudes toward gender; the product of
their work will be a book and an exhibition scheduled
for 1989. Department staff also organized several confer- |
ences last year in cooperation with other institutions and —
NMAH offices. The subjects of these conferences ranged —
from “Women in the Progressive Era” to “Black Migra- |
tion and the American City: Forging the African Ameri- '
can Urban Community.” |

The department’s major acquisitions of the past year
include a large, well-documented collection of textiles
copyrighted between 1955 and 1977; a gift from Mr. and
Mrs. C. Malcolm Watkins of 5,085 stereographs that rec-
ord details of American technological and social history;
and kitchen appliances dating from the 1930s to the 1960s
that reflect changes in household technology and design. |

As a living history project, the National Philatelic Col-
lection dispatched a newly restored vehicle to retrace the
nation’s original Highway Post Office route from Harri- |

sonburg, Virginia, to Washington, D.C. The bus was the
same one used on that first route in 1941 when service
was inaugurated; it completed the 146-mile journey on
April 15. |

The philatelic library expanded the computerization of |
its reference collection of books, monographs, serials, ad

| ie new slide programs were added to the twenty-
ve already available free of charge to civic groups,
ostal unions, and philatelic organizations. Curator

mes Bruns and specialist Joseph Geraci gave a course
n philatelic research in conjunction with the American
hilatelic Society’s summer seminar at the University of
ennsylvania. This year’s accessions totaled 88,000 ob-
»cts, among them 53 historic American postal marking
evices.

Research by the staff of the National Numismatic Col-
‘ction proceeded at its customarily ambitious pace. Cu-
ator Richard Doty continued his research at the museum
nd at the Matthew Boulton Archives in Birmingham,
ngland, on the revolutionary coining process developed
y Boulton and James Watt in the 1780s and 1790s and

bsequently exported around the world. Executive di-

ctor Elvira Clain-Stefanelli published an article on an-
ent Greek metrology in a leading Belgian numismatic

view and was invited to testify at Senate hearings on a

ecial bill introduced to change the design of our na-
onal coinage. In April, curator Cory Gillilland attended

e International Delegates’ meeting of the Federation of

e Medal in Paris. Especially important this year was the

sign of an automated collections management system,
hich will aid both recordkeeping and research. Acces-
ons numbered more than 600 items, among them a

ique copper pattern of an 1894 dollar, the first dollar
sued by the U.S. Mint.
| While archivist John Fleckner has been serving as act-
g director of the Archives of American Art, the Ar-
nives Center has continued its growth onde acting
ministrator Robert Harding. This year’s most signifi-
nt activity was the inauguration of the Duke Ellington
‘oject—the processing, rehousing, and cataloguing of
€ musician’s massive archives, including manuscripts,
tapbooks, photographs, correspondence, memorabilia,
pe recordings, and other valuable artifacts related to
llington’s life and work. With funds provided through a
ecial congressional grant, the museum acquired the col-
ction this year through the joint efforts of the Archives
enter and the Division of Musical History. Other new
llections acquired during the year include the Sam
eVincent Collection of Illustrated American Sheet Mu-
, estimated at 150,000 items; the records of the Society
rt the History of Technology; the United Shoe Machin-
Company archives; and more than 300 photographs
lating to the life and work of Thomas A. Edison.
The Office of Academic Programs, established in 1987,
responsible for developing and coordinating the mu-
um’s relationships with colleges and universities. This

year the office brought the journal of the American Stud-
ies Association, American Quarterly, from Philadelphia
to Washington, established a board of managing editors
composed of scholars from nearby universities, and
opened new editorial offices here. The office also began
the first year of a joint NNYAH-American University pro-
gram. Gary Kulik, assistant director for academic pro-
grams, completed two forthcoming manuscripts,
“Designing the Past: A History of History Exhibits” and
“The Transfigured Past: Memory and Forgetting in the
Industrial Landscape of New England.”

In addition to its major offices and curatorial units, the
museum is home to several smaller projects, the work of
individual scholars or small staffs investigating specific
periods or historical figures. The Afro-American Com-
munities Project indexes and analyzes information from
social, economic, and personal documents to help scho-
lars assess historical assumptions about the nature and
role of black community life in the nineteenth century.
This year the project acquired death records for the city
of Boston for 1801-60; Boston marriage records for
1849-60; and the 1855 Buffalo census, which has been
coded and entered into a data base providing statistical
analysis of family structure, income, occupation, and res-
idency of the free black community of Erie County, New
York. The Robert Mills Papers project has collected cop-
ies of 3,500 documents related to the career of the archi-
tect of the Washington Monument. Publication in 1989 of
a microfilm edition, index, and guide to the materials
will facilitate research on Mills and early nineteenth-cen-
tury American architecture, including several buildings
now operated by the Smithsonian.

As a service to the history museum field, the museum
is providing space for the Common Agenda project of the
American Association for State and Local History.
Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities,
the project promotes collaboration among museums and
related organizations in solving common problems in-
volving collections and interpretation. Initial activities
aim at strengthening ties between academic historians
and history museums and creating shared data bases of
history museum collections.

Public Programs

Our national experience and cultural traditions are
brought to the public both through exhibitions and
through the activities sponsored by the Department of

Public Programs. The department’s offerings increase the

educational value of exhibitions, bring the museum’s
services to schools, and provide a live and artistic compo-
nent to the study of history. In 1988 the department pre-
sented films, live performances, symposia, and other
programs on a broad variety of subjects, such as the mu-
sic and life of Irving Berlin; musical traditions of black,
white, and American Indian communities; black women
composers; and the role of heroes in American life.

128

Building on the department’s efforts to attract a
broader constituency for the museum, the Program in
Black American Culture and the Smithsonian’s Commit-
tee for a Wider Audience presented a conference at whicl|
twenty-one scholars and museum practitioners explored |
ways to draw a larger and more diverse audience to mu- |
seums. The Program in Hispanic American History or-
ganized “The Other D.C./El Otro D.C.,” a series of

yerformances and forums focusing on the role of His-
yanic culture in shaping American history.
In the Division of Education, the audience research
ia continued to study the reaction of museum visi-
ors to exhibitions and public programs. In 1988 the pro-
ram gathered and analyzed visitor responses to the
»xperimental “Science, Power, and Conflict” exhibition
e aid in the development of science programming and
xhibitions planned in the next five years.
_ The Columbus Quincentenary Program planning
sroup, headed by Lonn Taylor, assistant director for
public programs, continued its work toward a permanent
»xhibition, “American Encounters,” to open in 1992. A
emporary exhibition, “Commerce and Conflict: The
inglish in Virginia, 1625,” opened this year in conjunc-
jon with a forum at which scholars of ethnohistory, an-
hropology, and folklore discussed American Indian
yerceptions of European colonization in North America.
Completing the department’s activities in 1988 were
uch popular and well-established programs as Jazz in the
is Court, Music in the Bandstand, America on Film,
nd Saturday After Noon. In addition, the department
oordinated the efforts of nearly 200 undergraduate and
aduate interns and approximately 200 docents.
_ The 1988 Frank Nelson Doubleday Lecture and Per-
‘ormance, coordinated by the Office of Special Events,
eatured black American gospel music. Conceived by Dr.
3ernice Johnson Reagon, the program included perform-
ances by Robert Anderson of Chicago, the Sterling Jubi-
ees of Bessemer, Alabama, and the Richard Smallwood
Singers of Washington, D.C. A special dress rehearsal

as open to the public. Although Smithsonian produc-
ion staff and research have undergirded all of the pro-
3rams in the Doubleday Lecture Series over the past
decade, this year’s marked the first occasion on which
ymithsonian research actually took the stage.

Behind the Scenes
A great deal of invaluable work goes on at the museum
simply to keep the building and the collections it houses
n shape and make possible the exhibitions and programs
‘hat millions of visitors come to see. This year, the mu-
i began to implement the first of four phases of its
aster space plan. The plan calls for new heating, venti-
ating, and air-conditioning systems, fire prevention sys-
‘ems, a new public address system, new communication
‘ines, a new roofing system, and the removal of asbestos.
The Office of the Building Manager is primarily responsi-

ble for overseeing the plan, but during the five or more

years it will take to complete, the master plan will have
an impact on virtually every office and division and will
necessitate the relocation of millions of objects as differ-
ent sections of the building are renovated in turn.

After more than a decade of effort by Smithsonian em-
ployees, the Institution’s first child care center opened on
the second floor of the museum’s west wing in early Oc-
tober. This 2,300-square-foot facility will accommodate
forty children aged two through five and consists of three
learning centers, an activities area, a kitchen, utility and
storage rooms, a director’s office, and bathrooms.

In the Office of the Registrar, important work contin-
ued in the collections management program during 1988,
especially in the automation of collections information
and in improvements in physical care. More than
100,000 objects were accessioned into the permanent col-
lection and almost 3,000 were lent or borrowed for exhi-
bitions. Important loans from the collections included the
early ENIAC computer, lent to Osaka, Japan, and the
exhibition “Isaac Newton and the Principia: Three Hun-
dred Years,” lent to the IBM Gallery of Science and Art
in New York City.

Newly designed automated recordkeeping systems
became available for the National Numismatic and Na-
tional Philatelic collections, as well as a general collec-
tions program for new acquisitions, loans, and object
tracking. Office staff also participated in the design of the
Institution’s central Collections Information System. As a
result of the numerous collections relocations and in an-
swer to the increasing lack of storage, the museum took
possession of 24,000 square feet of rental warehouse
space at Fullerton Industrial Park in Springfield, Virginia.

Staff of the Computer Services Center coordinated an
expansion in the central minicomputer system and the
network of microcomputers and workstations, accom-
panied by an extensive training program. The center’s
biggest projects dealt with collections, including the de-
velopment of a local system to support collections that
meets the requirements of the curatorial and registrarial
staffs and a project that is analyzing the functions of col-
lections management, public programs, and research. The
results of this analysis, which involves approximately too
staff members from all parts of the museum, will lay the
foundation for the development of a far-reaching system
containing information about collections at the museum
on the Institution-wide Collections Information System.

During the year the Division of Conservation rehoused
or gave basic stabilization treatment to more than 30,000
objects. A major new project was also begun, the work

129
of microfilming, audiotape copying, and paper conserva-
tion for the newly acquired Duke Ellington Collection. A
costume conservator and technician were hired to begin
treatment of the First Ladies’ gowns. Documentation,
cleaning, preparation of new mannequins, and the design
of safe storage and exhibit cases are just a few of the
elements in the complex process of stabilizing the collec-
tion and preparing selected gowns for a new exhibition.
The division’s conservators and curatorial collections
managers also began planning for the construction of a
specialized laboratory devoted to the museum’s holdings
of more than 40,000 costumes, uniforms, flags, and
other textiles and fragile organic objects. Pendragon Press
published The Metallurgy of 17th- and 18th-Century Mu-
sical Instrument Wire, by head conservator J. Scott Odell
and coauthor Martha Goodway.

National Museum of
Natural History/ National
Museum of Man |

The National Museum of Natural History/ National Mu-
seum of Man, the nation’s largest research museum,
houses the largest and most valuable natural history and
anthropological collections in the world—more than 118
million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, rocks, min-
erals, and human cultural artifacts. These vast, exten-
sively documented holdings support research by the 120
doctoral-level scientists on the museum staff, by visiting
scholars and students from all over the world, and by
eighty resident scientists from affiliated federal agencies
with natural history functions (the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, and the National Institutes of Health).

The museum shares its work with the scholarly com-
munity through publications, symposia, and scholarly ex- |
changes and with the public through exhibitions, popular
publications, public forums, and educational programs. |
Testimony to the success of the public programs are the
more than seven million visits recorded to the museum in
1988, making NMNH by far the most heavily visited nat- |
ural history museum in the world.

Dr. Frank H. Talbot was appointed director of the
museum in June 1988; he assumed his new position in
January 1989. The former executive director of the Calli-
fornia Academy of Sciences, he is an expert on fish ecol-
ogy and coral reefs and a well-known innovator in
natural history exhibitions and education. Before his ten-
ure at the California Academy, Dr. Talbot held the
founding chair of environmental studies at Macquarie
University in Sydney, Australia (1975-82); served as direc-
tor of the Australian Museum in Sydney (1964-75); and
worked as a marine biologist and assistant director at the
South African Museum, Cape Town (1958-64). During
the year Dr. James C. Tyler served as acting director.

Highlights of the museum’s 1988 research, manage-
ment, exhibition, and educational activities follow.

Biodiversity Research

The major center of biological diversity on Earth is Ama-
zonia. With this region’s rich habitats imperiled by defor-
estation, the museum is moving as rapidly as possible to
document and study plant and animal species there. For
the second consecutive year, Dr. Terry Erwin led teams
of scientists to Beni Biosphere Reserve, Bolivia, and |
Manu Reserved Zone, Peru, where long-term, in-depth |
biodiversity inventories are under way in collaboration |
with the Bolivian and Peruvian governments, host coun- |
try scientists and students, and international conservation
organizations. The studies are expected to help protect
many of the rare and endangered species of the neotrop-
ics, some of which may yield new sources of food, medi-
cine, biological controls, and important germ plasm for
agricultural use.

Training workshops for fifty Bolivian and Peruvian
biologists and seventeen Puerto Rican biologists partici-
pating in biodiversity inventories were held at Beni Bio-
sphere Reserve, Manu Reserved Zone, and Luquillo
National Forest, Puerto Rico. As the biodiversity pro-
gram expands, the museum will train hundreds of host-
country biologists and conservationists to develop inven-
tories of species in these tropical ecosystems.

Museum botanists Dr. Lawrence Skog and Dr. Dieter
Wasshausen and colleagues from the United States,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the Guianas ex-
plored Montagne de Tortue, a remote and botanically
unknown mountain range in French Guiana, bringing
back an abundance of new, poorly known, or seldom-
collected species. The expedition was part of a long-term

tional Museum of Man working on Siberian and Alaskan cloth-
ing for the major exhibition “Crossroads of Continents.”

multinational effort to analyze the little-known vegeta-
tion of the Guianas. One goal is to determine what areas
in the Guianas merit special protection on the basis of
biotic diversity.

Museum zoologist Dr. Ronald Heyer investigated the
remnants of a vast coastal forest that was once continu-
ous along the northern Atlantic coast of Brazil. Most of
the forest has been logged and replaced by sugar and
cocoa plantations, but patches of forest survive. Studies
of these scattered fragments are planned as part of the
ongoing investigations of the composition, distribution,
and evolution of the plants and animals in Amazonia and
the Atlantic forests.

Investigation of Dolphin Deaths

When dead and dying bottlenose dolphins began strand-
ing on Atlantic coastal beaches in unheard-of numbers in
July 1987, members of the museum’s Marine Mammal
Program team—Dr. James Mead, William McClellan,
and Charles Potter—were the first to recognize that
something unusual was happening and alerted the scien-
tific community. The program began in 1972 to recover
data and specimens of marine mammals on the U.S. At-
lantic coast, an area that Smithsonian marine mammalo-
gists have had a keen interest in since the nineteenth
century. The program has vastly increased scientific
knowledge of the biology, migratory patterns, size, and
distribution of dolphin populations. To study the myste-
rious epidemic, the museum, the Marine Mammal Com-
mission, and the National Marine Fishery Service
assembled an international Dolphin Resource Team.
Throughout 1988 the museum made regular aerial sur-
veys of Atlantic coastal beaches, sighting many stranded
dolphins that otherwise might never have been recovered
and examined. The cause of the deaths has not been de-
termined, but researchers believe that a disease agent is
responsible, possibly a virus that spread through the dol-
phin population, weakening the animals’ immune
systems.

Museum Scientist Identifies Gigantic “Toothed”
Seabird

The discovery and identification of the largest flying sea-
bird ever to soar above the oceans of the world, an ex-
tinct creature thought to be related to pelicans,
cormorants, and their allies, was announced in Novem-

131
ber 1987 by the museum’s Dr. Storrs Olson and col-
leagues at the Charleston Museum in Charleston, South
Carolina. The bird, a member of an extinct family called
“the bony-toothed birds,” or pseudodontorns (so named
because of the unusual long “bony teeth” protruding
from the upper and lower jaws), had a wingspan of more
than 18 feet and may have weighed close to 90 pounds. It
lived thirty million years ago. All previous pseudodon-
torn species were known only from isolated bones or
from two-dimensional impressions in rock. The new spe-
cies is remarkable because it is much larger than any pre-
vious known pseudodontorn and because most of the
skeleton is preserved.

Global Fieldwork

Dr. Robert Fudali was a member of a U.S. scientific team
that collected more than 700 meteorites and meteorite
fragments on the Antarctica South Polar plateau. Dr. Er-
nani Menez, director of the museum’s Oceanographic
Sorting Center, led a marine biological expedition to the
relatively isolated and unexplored Tawi-Tawi Islands of
the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines. Dr.
Charles Handley headed a field party that explored the
unique fauna of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, a maze
of hundreds of biologically unknown islands, reefs, and
mangrove swamps off the northeastern coast of Panama.
Dr. James C. Tyler, using an underwater video system,
conducted studies with a colleague on sailfin blenny fish
behavior on the reef at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize. In China,
Malaysia, and Singapore, Dr. Robert Higgins made col-
lections of kinorhyncha and other tiny invertebrate ani-
mals that live between grains of sand on the ocean floor.

Folsom Hunting Campsite Excavated

Among the earliest human inhabitants of the Americas
were the Folsom people, who hunted bison and other
game animals in the western portion of the Great Plains
and Rocky Mountain regions between 10,900 and 10,400
years ago. In 1988, archaeologist Dr. Dennis Stanford,
director of the museum’s PaleoIndian Program, and re-
search archaeologist Pegi Jodry continued investigations
of a Folsom site in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, uncov-
ering new data on the activities of roving Folsom hunting
bands. The scientists were assisted by a team of volun-
teers from the new Research Expeditions Program, spon-
sored by the Smithsonian National Associate Program.

132

Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port

The Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port in Fort
Pierce, Florida, had more than too visits from Smithson-
ian scientists during 1988. Their diverse research activi-
ties—often undertaken in collaboration with colleagues
from other institutions—ranged from systematics, ecol-
ogy, and life histories of the marine flora and fauna to
the spectral attenuation of underwater light and the den-
sity of submarine volcanic pumice. One new project, ini-
tiated by the museum’s Dr. Ian Macintyre, Dr. Mark
Littler, and Diane Littler, seeks to document the distribu-
tion of the calcareous green alga Halimeda in the Florida
Keys in an effort to understand what environmental con-
ditions over geological time gave rise to the alga’s great
sediment-producing ability.

Native American Tribal Catalogues

In an effort to make the museum’s collections more acces- —
sible to Native American communities, the museum has __
begun to survey and describe its tribal holdings. The goal —
is a set of illustrated catalogues describing in detail the |
museum’s collections of ethnographic objects, film, pho-
tographs, and archival materials. These catalogues |
should provide the tribes with vast amounts of informa-
tion about their cultural past. The Kiowa, Zuni, and
Crow catalogues are in preparation, and others are |
planned. The catalogues will be inexpensive and thus

more available to tribal people, scholars, and the general
public. Coordinated by Dr. JoAllyn Archambault, direc-
tor of the museum’s Native American Indian Program,

the project is being carried out by interns from the tribes
involved.

Symposia

“Americans before Columbus: Prehistoric South Ameri-
cans,” a public symposium honoring contemporary South
American archaeologists who have received training and |
support from the National Museum of Natural History,
featured six leading South American anthropologists who
discussed new research findings bearing on the first peo-
ple to inhabit the South American continent. The forum |
was organized by the museum’s Dr. Betty Meggers, with |
the support of Dr. Herman Viola, director of the mu-
seum’s Columbus Quincentenary programs.
Forty authorities from the Soviet Union, Japan, China,
Australia, and eight other nations gathered to reassess
and clarify the systematic status and biological knowl-
edge of squid, octopus, and cuttlefish families important
in biomedical research and as fishery resources. Organ-
ized by the museum’s Dr. Clyde Roper, this hands-on
workshop allowed these scientists to conduct research on
thousands of specimens brought together from around
the world. Out of the workshop will come a publication
that will contain natural history data invaluable to biolo-
gists, ecologists, and fishery resource managers.

“The Poetics and Politics of Representation,” an inter-
national conference jointly sponsored by the Institution
and the Rockefeller Foundation, brought together leading
scholars from museums and universities throughout the
world to discuss the portrayal of human cultures in mu-
seum exhibitions. It was organized by museum anthro-
pologist Dr. Ivan Karp in collaboration with the
California Institute of the Arts.

Distinguished Soviet and American scholars were parti-
cipants in a symposium coinciding with the opening of
the museum’s major exhibition, “Crossroads of Conti-
nents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska.” Sponsored by the
International Research and Exchanges Board, the Ameri-
can Council of Learned Societies, and the Institute of
Ethnology, USSR Academy of Sciences, the symposium
presented new perspectives on the relationships of the
North Pacific cultures that have occupied the lands on
both sides of the Bering Strait for at least the last 15,000
years.

More than roo U.S. and Canadian scholars attended
the Nineteenth Algonquian Conference at the museum.
Papers were presented on Algonquian Indian culture, his-
tory, prehistory, folklore, and languages. The museum’s
Dr. Ives Goddard, an authority on Algonquian language,
was the conference organizer.

New Technology

The museum purchased a new transmission electron mi-
croscope, ten times more powerful than the microscope
the museum has relied on for the past fifteen years. The
new instrument's resolution, speed, convenience of opera-
tion, and immense magnifying power—up to and above
500,000 X—are opening new paths of research for mu-
seum scientists who are attempting to chart and under-
stand the labyrinthine internal complexities of plant and
animal anatomy. For example, the museum’s Dr. W.
Duane Hope is using the new transmission electron mi-
croscope in combination with a scanning electron micro-

scope to study details of marine nematodes, discovering
new taxonomic characters that may change their system-
atic position in nematode classification.

Museum researcher Dr. Jeffrey Post is employing state-
of-the-art analytical electron microscopy, powder x-ray
diffraction data, and computer graphics to learn more
about minerals. One ongoing study is shedding light on
the structure and formation of economically important
oceanic manganese oxides. These minerals, which occur
on the ocean floor, often contain cobalt, nickel, copper,
and other strategic metals. The United States has a lim-
ited supply of these minerals and may eventually decide
to mine them.

Notable Publications

In an April 1988 article in Science magazine, museum sen-
ior oceanographer Dr. Daniel Stanley reported that the
northeastern edge of the Nile Delta is rapidly subsiding, a
situation aggravated by sea-level rise and by the blockage
of normal sediment flow by the Aswan Dam on the Nile
River. The subsidence could flood a large part of the
northern delta plain by the year 2100, inundating agricul-
tural lands where several million people now live. The
findings were based on an ongoing multidisciplinary
study in the delta directed by the museum in cooperation
with the Egyptian government.

Exploring the West, by museum historian Dr. Herman
Viola, was published by Smithsonian Books. Drawing on
unpublished materials in the Smithsonian Archives, Viola
provides the most detailed description ever written of the
Smithsonian’s role in aiding the U.S. government-spon-
sored expeditions that mapped and described the nearly
unknown American West in the mid-nineteenth century.

Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Alaska and Sib-
eria was edited by museum anthropologists Dr. William
F. Fitzhugh and Aron Crowell, with contributions from
Soviet and American scholars. This 360-page book, with
color plates, was published by the Smithsonian Press to
accompany the “Crossroads of Continents” exhibition.

Collections Management

In 1988 approximately 428,000 specimens were added to
the collections by expedition, gift, purchase, and deposit
by affiliated federal agencies. Among the notable gifts
were a collection of 9,000 display-quality seashells of
rare form, pattern, and color; a 5.03-carat red diamond,
one of only five documented red diamonds in the world;
a 22,892.5-carat golden-yellow topaz, the world’s largest
faceted gemstone; and a complete skeleton of a 90-million-
year-old shark, the finest of its kind ever discovered.

The museum is actively engaged in the care and conser-
vation of the collections. A multiyear effort to convert the
collections inventory data base to the Institution’s on-line
Collections Information System is under way, contribut-
ing to more effective scholarly use of the museum’s vast
collections and helping to maintain inventory control. Ap-
proximately one million records are now accessible
through this system, developed in conjunction with the
Institution’s Office of Information Resource Management.

Museum Support Center Celebrates Fifth
Anniversary

A month-long schedule of special tours and programs in
May 1988 marked the fifth anniversary of the Museum
Support Center (MSC) in Suitland, Maryland, a facility
that provides modern storage and security for the na-
tional collections, as well as office and laboratory space.
The lack of space in the Natural History Building makes
the MSC vital to the continued growth of the museum
and its collections, many of which are the largest and
best of their kind. In 1988 the museum moved approxi-
mately 1.5 million collection items to the MSC, which
now houses more than 4 million of the museum’s anthro-
pological artifacts and natural history collections.

Exhibitions

“Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and
Alaska,” an exhibition developed jointly by the museum
and the Soviet Academy of Sciences with the collabora-
tive aid of the International Research and Exchanges
Board, opened in September in the Thomas M. Evans
Gallery. Ten years in the planning, the exhibition marks
the first time many early and important archaeological
and ethnographic collections from this remote but in-
creasingly important geographic region have been
brought together for presentation to the people of both
continents. The artifacts had been held in museums in the
Soviet Union, Canada, and the United States.

The exhibition presents a unified and panoramic view
of the history, art, and traditional cultures of the native
peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait. The 550 arti-
facts on display—including kayaks, harpoons, ivory carv-
ings, beadwork, masks, drums, clothing, and weapons of
war—demonstrate the elaborate arts, cultures, and his-
tory of the Pacific Rim from 20,000 years ago to the
present. The museum’s Dr. William F. Fitzhugh headed
the North American curatorial team; Serghei Aroutiounov
of the Institute of Ethnology, Moscow, headed the Soviet
team. After closing at the museum in April 1989, the ex-
hibition will travel to seven cities in the United States and
Canada, as well as to Moscow, Leningrad, and two other
cities in the Soviet Union.

“King Herod’s Dream: Caesarea on the Sea,” a Smith-
sonian Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) exhibition,
traced the colorful history of Caesarea, an ancient Medi-
terranean seaport and a significant center of early Christi-
anity. It drew nearly 300,000 visitors during its showing

in the Thomas M. Evans Gallery from late March
through mid-June. An ambitious “dream” of King Herod
of Judea, Caesarea was intended to rival Alexandria,
Egypt, as a harbor. It was built at the end of the Helle-
nistic age and survived through five other historical per-
iods: Herodian, Roman, Islamic, Byzantine, and the
Crusades. The design, development, and evolution of the
city and the harbor can be traced by the underwater and
land archaeological finds. Included in the exhibition, the
result of fifteen years of archaeological research, are a
statue of the Greek goddess Tyche, a hoard of Islamic
jewelry, Byzantine mosaics, glassware, coins, and culi-
nary items. The objects are supported by interpretive
graphics, models, and three video components. All of
these elements address the exhibition’s two interrelated
themes—archaeology and its techniques and the study of
an important urban culture.

The exhibition was organized by SITES, the University
of Maryland Center for Archaeology, the Caesarea An-
cient Harbour Excavation Project, and the Joint Expedi-
tion to Caesarea Maritima, in cooperation with the
Department of Antiquities and Museums of the State of
Israel.

“Plains Indian Art—Continuity and Change,” demon-
strated how the work of contemporary Plains Indian art-
ists is rooted in the tribal traditions of the past. The
exhibition, organized by Dr. JoAllyn Archambault, direc-
tor of the museum’s Native American Indian Program,
compared objects from Smithsonian collections made in
the nineteenth century with similar objects made by con-
temporary Plains Indian artists.

“Birds and Flowers of the Fifty States: The Singer
Stamp Series,” featured the work of Arthur Singer, one of
the best-known American wildlife painters, and his son
Alan, a noted botanical artist. On view from November
through March were the original Singer paintings of the
official birds and flowers of the fifty states, which were
reproduced in the best-selling set of 1982 U.S. commemo-
rative stamps.

“Andrew Jackson Grayson: The Audubon of the West”
was a showcase for paintings of the birds of the Pacific
slope by a brilliant self-taught nineteenth-century Ameri-
can artist. Organized by the Oakland Museum in cooper-
ation with the museum, this exhibition was the first
public showing of Grayson’s 156 surviving bird paintings.
It was on view from April to July.

“Places of Power: Sacred Sites of the Americas and Pa-
cific” featured sixty painted photographs of prehistoric
ceremonial sites by Corson Hirschfeld, who is undertak-
ing an exhaustive documentation of ceremonial sites

around the world. The exhibition was on view from Sep-
tember until January.

Other temporary exhibitions featured North American
butterflies and the wildflowers that they feed upon; scien-
tific illustration; wood and bronze insect sculptures; the
research activities of museum scientists at Aldabra Atoll,
home to many unique species and subspecies; and sea-
shells from the William Bledsoe Collection.

In the Gem Hall two new additions to the museum’s
collection were placed on permanent display. A 5.03-carat
red diamond was a bequest from the estate of S. Sydney
DeYoung, and a 22,892.5-carat golden-yellow topaz was
a gift of the six regional federations of mineralogical soci-
eties and Drs. Marie and Ed Borgatta. “The Incompara-
ble,” a 407.48-carat yellow diamond—the largest cut
colored diamond in the world—was on temporary dis-
play during August 1988.

Planning is in progress for “Vision of the Americas,” a
new permanent exhibition hall that will explain the diver-
sity and dynamics of Native American life. In 1988 mem-
bers of the planning committee visited Alaska,
Washington, and British Columbia to view Native Ameri-
can exhibits, museums, and cultural centers and meet
with representatives of Indian tribal political and cultural
organizations. One of the objectives of the trip was to
learn how Indians wish to be represented in the exhibi-
tion hall.

Education

Relying on the assistance of the 365 docents who volun-
teer to provide educational services, the museum’s Office
of Education gives free programs for a variety of audi-
ences, including families, students, and general visitors.
The office operates the Discovery Room, a nationally ac-
claimed hands-on facility for children, which hosted more
than 100,000 visitors, and the Naturalist Center, where
natural history objects, books, and equipment for visitors
aged twelve and older are available. It hosted approxi-
mately 17,500 visitors. The office also produces a quar-
terly calendar that is mailed to interested constituents and
made available at the museum’s information desks.

More than 65,000 students visited the museum in 1988
for lesson tours of permanent and temporary exhibitions.
Pre- and postvisit instructional materials were available
to enhance this experience. Special school programs in-
cluded the fall Indian Walkaround for students in kinder-
garten through second grade, the fall Dinosaur Walk for
nursery and kindergarten students, and National Science

Week in April. Nearly a dozen teacher workshops were
offered on weekends during the academic year and dur-
ing the summer weeks.

More than 18,000 people attended the free films and
lectures sponsored by the museum. Highlights included a
film program, “South Africa Today: Life in a Divided
Society,” and special showings of “Ocean Symphony,” a
film featuring spectacular underwater footage of the
earth’s oceans.

Films, festivals, tours, and seminars were scheduled in
conjunction with the exhibitions, “Ebla to Damascus,”
“King Herod’s Dream,” “Tropical Rainforests: A Disap-
pearing Treasure,” and “Crossroads of Continents.” The

136

office participated in the development of an exhibition of
Asian and Pacific artists, “Across the Sea and over the
Mountains: Immigration—Its Hardships and Rewards,”
produced in honor of Asian American Heritage Week.
Special programs were also held during Black History
Month and Hispanic Heritage Week. Other activities in-
cluded demonstrations of Native American craftsmanship
during American Indian Week, featuring Indian artists
from the American Southwest and Plains states, and
Scout Day, bringing more than 3,000 Boy and Girl
Scouts to the museum for demonstrations and tours.

National Portrait Gallery

The National Portrait Gallery is dedicated to the exhibi-
tion and study of portraits of people who have made
significant contributions to American history, develop-
ment, and culture and of the artists who created this por-
traiture. The gallery offers a continuing exploration of
the heritage and accomplishments of the American people
by collecting, studying, preserving, and exhibiting por-
traits in all media as both historical and artistic
documents.

Exhibitions

“American Colonial Portraits: 1700-1776” was the first of
the two major exhibitions at the gallery in 1988 and the
first in a series of exhibitions commemorating the bicen-
tennial of the U.S. Constitution. It has been more than
half a century since the subject was explored in a
museum exhibition, and never before have comparable
masterworks been gathered for study from public and
private collections throughout the country, as well as
from England, Ireland, Jamaica, Bermuda, and Canada.

In April King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of
Sweden opened “Masterpieces from Gripsholm Castle:
The Swedish National Portrait Collection.” Part of the
celebration of the 350th anniversary of Swedish settlement
in America, this exhibition brought to the National Por-
trait Gallery sixty objects ranging from a late-medieval
woodcarving to a contemporary photorealist painting. It
was the second in a planned series of exhibitions display-
ing highlights from the great portrait collections of other
nations.

Other exhibitions in 1988 were “Studies from Life: Por-
trait Photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron,” composed
of fifty-one images from the J. Paul Getty Museum, and
“The Artist’s Mother: Portraits and Homages,” featuring
works by twentieth-century artists who used their moth-
ers as the subjects of, or inspirations for, their work. The
latter exhibition was organized by the Heckscher Mu-
seum, Huntington, New York.

December 1987 marked the beginning of the first over-
seas tour of a major exhibition from the National Por-
trait Gallery. “Then and Now: American Portraits from
the Past Century,” a survey of important trends in Ameri-
can portraiture during the past 100 years, was generously
sponsored by American Express International, Emery
Worldwide, Inc., and Nippon Cargo Airways. It opened
at the Hong Kong Museum of Art, followed by showings
at the Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art in Sapporo,
Japan, and the Sogetsu Gallery of Art in Tokyo.

Exhibitions of recent acquisitions were mounted in
January and August. In July 1988 the gallery opened
“Champions on TIME,” an exhibition of twenty portraits
of athletes featured on the cover of Time magazine. All
but one of the portraits was from the gallery’s collection.

Polaroid Corporation cosponsored “The Instant Like-
ness: Polaroid Portraits,” which opened in August 1988.
The photographs in the exhibition surveyed the forty
years of instant photography’s history as reflected in por-
traiture; they included the work of some of the most fa-
miliar names in American photography.

Loans made from the National Portrait Gallery collec-
tion to museums and institutions across the United States
and abroad have tripled in number in the last two years.
The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service
(SITES) toured a portion of the gallery’s Harmon Collec-
tion of outstanding black Americans. Another SITES ex-
hibition from the gallery’s collection, “Athletes and
Heroes,” completed a nearly three-year tour in 1988. The
gallery’s portrait of Mary Cassatt traveled to France and
Canada and to New York for the Edgar Degas retrospec-
tive. Outgoing loans were made to several dozen mu-
seums and institutions during 1988.

Acquisitions

The presidential portrait series was enhanced by the gift
of Everett Kinstler’s portrait of President Ford from the
Gerald R. Ford Foundation, as well as by the purchase of
a miniature of President McKinley by Emily D. Taylor.

A major Gilbert Stuart portrait of the American states-
man Rufus King was acquired through a partial gift from
the James Smithson Society and through museum pur-
chase funds. Another substantial acquisition was
Marguerite Zorach’s portrait, Marianne Moore and Her
Mother, purchased with appropriated funds.

Through the Smithsonian Institution Collections Ac-
quisitions Program, the gallery purchased Thomas
Hicks’s portrait of Edward Hicks, the “naive” Quaker
artist best known as the painter of the several versions of
The Peaceable Kingdom. Charles Peale Polk’s portrait of
the agricultural scientist David Wiley was also acquired,
enhancing the gallery’s holdings of early American scien-
tists as well as adding to its collection of portraits by the
family of Charles Willson Peale.

Among the most important gifts to the collection were
a wax bust of Chief Justice John Marshall, by Robert
Ball Hughes, and an oil portrait of psychoanalyst Karen
Horney, by Suzanne Carvallo Schulein.

137
Major photographs purchased included a 1923 plati-
num print of cinematographer Karl Struss by Edward
Weston; a dye-transfer color print of Judy Garland and
Mickey Rooney by Harold Edgerton, the inventor of the
stroboscopic flash; a self-portrait of W. Eugene Smith,
the legendary photojournalist; a silver print of author
Theodore Dreiser by Charles Sheeler; a portrait of Ezra
Pound by Richard Avedon; a rare and unusual Barbara
Morgan photograph of Martha Graham performing
“Deep Song;” an early photograph of Lazlo Moholy
Nagy taken in Paris by the Hungarian-born Ergy
Landau; an extremely rare Civil War carte de visite of
Mathew Brady; and rare portraits of Igor Stravinsky by
Edward Weston and Alfred Langdon Coburn.

Major gifts of photographs included two daguerreo-
types and sixteen 17-by-21-inch Mathew Brady glass plate
negatives from 1862 of the actor Edwin Forrest, from the
collection of the Edwin Forrest Home for Retired Actors
in Philadelphia; a collection of sixty portraits by Irving
Penn, selected and donated by the artist; Joanne
Verberg’s unique 20-by-24-inch Polacolor ER portrait of
artist Andy Warhol, given by an anonymous donor; and
a portfolio of Hollywood portraits by George Hurrell,
given by David Davis of Los Angeles.

The gallery acquired several fine drawings, including
William Glackens’s humorous image of Charles Dana
Gibson, Reginald Marsh’s portrait of Thornton Wilder
(the gift of Wilder’s sister), J. Alden Weir’s charcoal of
John Twachtman, Eastman Johnson’s pencil of William
Henry Vanderbilt, Cecilia Beaux’s drawing of Henry
James, an early Raphael Soyer self-portrait, and an ink
sketch of Man Ray by Czech artist Adolf Hoffmeister.
An important acquisition of four portraits of John Held,
Jr., from his widow’s estate was negotiated. In addition
to a bronze bust and a sketch by Mahonri Young, it
included caricatures by Peter Arno and Al Hirschfeld.
The gallery was particularly lucky to find intriguing cari-
cature material, including a watercolor cartoon of Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan and William Randolph Hearst by
Peter Newell, a watercolor of Eddie Cantor, and a pencil
of Senator Theodore Bilbo by Sam Berman.

Two significant early works on paper were added to
the collection with the purchase of William Henry
Brown’s silhouette of Elias Howe and the rare and bril-
liantly colored 1775 mezzotint of John Hancock by
Joseph Hiller, Sr. In addition, a Thomas Hart Benton
self-portrait lithograph and posters depicting Joe Louis,
General John Pershing, Lillian Russell, and Paul Robeson
were acquired.

Publications

This year marked the culmination of the Publication De-
partment’s largest and most ambitious project ever, the
newest edition of the National Portrait Gallery Perma-
nent Collection Illustrated Checklist. This invaluable ref-
erence document reproduces some 4,000 portraits and
includes two indexes.

The exhibition catalogue, Then and Now: American
Portraits of the Past Century from the National Portrait
Gallery, was published in Hong Kong, funded by a gift
from a Hong Kong benefactor (Bay Apparel, Ltd.). Sub-
sequently, a Japanese-language edition of the book was
published in Tokyo, sponsored by Nihon Zooki Seiyaku
(a pharmaceutical firm) and will reach new audiences in
both Japan and the United States.

American Colonial Portraits 1700-1776, by guest cura-
tor Richard H. Saunders and staff curator Ellen G.
Miles, and Man of the Year: A TIME Honored Tradi-
tion, by Frederick S. Voss, curator of the Time collec-
tion, were copublished with the Smithsonian Institution
Press

Education

The Education Department offered secondary-school
classes several programs in commemoration of the bicen-
tennial of the U.S. Constitution: “Before the Constitu-
tion: The Roots of Self-Government,” “Constitution
Quest: Why a Navy?” (developed and run jointly with
the Navy Museum), and “The Constitution and the Presi-
dency.” These programs were officially recognized by the
Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States
Constitution for their exceptional merit, national signifi-
cance, and substantial educational and historical value.
Special lectures were presented in conjunction with
“The Artist’s Mother: Portraits and Homages” by the
guest curator and by five of the artists represented in the
exhibition. For the exhibition, “Masterpieces from Grip-

Gustav III by Alexander Roslin, oil on canvas, 1777. Lent by
the Sweden Nationalmuseum Collection, Gripsholm Castle, for |
the National Portrait Gallery’s exhibition, “Masterpieces from
Gripsholm Castle: The Swedish National Portrait Collection.”
(Photograph by Eugene Mantie)

sholm Castle: The Swedish National Portrait Collection,”
the gallery collaborated with the Washington Stage Guild
in presenting a theatrical performance, “Voices from the
Inferno: A Biographical Sketch of August Strindberg.”

The Education Department was awarded a grant to
develop a new public program series, “Cultures in
Motion: Portraits of American Diversity.” Intended to
promote serious reflection on the multiethnic aspects of
American history, “Cultures in Motion” will bring the
gallery’s collection to life through lectures, symposia,
one-person biographical plays, recitals, concerts, and
storytelling.

Research

Approximately 3,100 additional portrait records and
about 40,000 newly edited records were added to the
computerized data base of the Catalog of American Por-
traits, which serves researchers in American art history
and American history. Fieldwork to gather new portrait
material and photographing of collections continued,
with five public collections and three private collections
added to the survey. The Southern states survey com-
pleted earlier has been edited into the current computer
system. Work is under way to include two large and im-
portant local collections in the data base—the portraits at
the U.S. Capitol and those in the National Museum of
American Art. The Catalog of American Portraits contin-
ued its active role in the Smithsonian-wide Collections
Information System.

The Peale Family Papers staff continued transcribing,
researching, and annotating selected letters and docu-
ments of the noted artist and naturalist Charles Willson
Peale and his artist-sons Raphaelle, Rembrandt, and
Rubens. In April 1988 volume 2 of The Selected Papers of
Charles Willson Peale and His Family, subtitled The Art-
ist as Museum Keeper, 1791-1810, was published in two
parts consisting of about 1,300 pages, illustrated in black
and white and in color. With funds from the Smithsonian
Institution Scholarly Studies Program and the Baltimore
Gas and Electric Foundation, the project has embarked
on a program to hire two consultants to assist the editor
in the identification of portraits by Rembrandt Peale
(1778-1860) and ultimately in the publication of a cata-
logue raisonné of Rembrandt Peale’s work. An exhibition
of Rembrandt Peale’s portraits will follow the completion
of the catalogue. The staff looks forward to the comple-
tion of the seven-volume series of Selected Papers within
the next decade and to an updating of the catalogue rai-

140

sonné of the portraits and miniatures of Charles Willson
Peale.

The American Art/Portrait Gallery Library acquired a
large collection of exhibition catalogues and periodicals
from the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In addition to the five
data bases already available to library users, major
national bibliographic data bases and other commercial
on-line services are now accessible thanks to the latest
technology.

Through contributions from the family and friends of
Gloria Haas, a fellowship fund was established this year
to enable graduate students in the history of art and
other related fields to work at the National Portrait
Gallery.

Office of Exhibits Central

The Office of Exhibits Central (OEC) supports the
Smithsonian’s exhibition programs by providing exhibit-
related services throughout the Institution. In 1988 the
OEC completed more than 300 projects serving nearly
every museum, bureau, and office. The services that the
office provides range from exhibit design and script writ-
ing and editing to all facets of exhibit production, includ-
ing woodworking, plastics, modelmaking, taxidermy,
packing, framing, and silkscreening.

“King Herod’s Dream: Caesarea on the Sea,” the of-
fice’s largest single project of the year, is an example of
the variety of expertise available in the OEC. Designed
and produced for the Smithsonian Institution Traveling
Exhibition Service, the exhibition opened in March in the
Thomas M. Evans Gallery at the National Museum of
Natural History. OEC staff were involved in every aspect
of the exhibition: design, editing, graphics, model-
making, and fabrication.

The office designed both the traveling exhibition and
the installation in the Evans Gallery. Design decisions en-
compassed everything from the design of the exhibit cases
to the position of objects inside them, from label typogra-
phy to interpretive graphics, from wall color to traffic
flow.

Large portions of the exhibit script were submitted in
outline form. Using materials that the curators provided,
the OEC editor researched, wrote, or rewrote the copy.
The script was then carefully edited for accuracy and for
appeal to a lay audience. The OEC graphics lab silk-
screened labels, text panels, diagrams, and maps;
mounted photographs; and mounted and framed prints.

“King Herod’s Dream” called for several models em-
ploying a variety of techniques. Excavation drawings
from several shipwrecks and frequent consultations with
the curators enabled OEC staff to build a model of a
merchant vessel from about A.D. 100. Full-size models of
an excavation wall and a Crusader burial were cast in
fiberglass. From materials provided by the curators, OEC
staff also created a scale model of a trench showing ar-
chaeologists at work with their tools and equipment.
Custom brackets were fabricated for about 140 objects to
secure them while on display or for travel. Of particular
note was the 1,200-pound marble statue of the city god-
dess, which required a specially designed bracket pro-
duced under OEC supervision.

The office built all the components and furniture for
the exhibit, including interpretive panels with text and
photographs, wall-hung vitrines, free-standing exhibit
cases, and pedestals for large and small objects. Shipping
containers with custom-designed interiors were also built

at OEC. The containers and the packing methods will
ensure the safety of the objects during travel.

In addition to large and small exhibits, the office sup-
ported a number of other projects: brochure design and
editing for the Smithsonian National Associate Program;
printed materials for the Washington Craft Show spon-
sored by the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Na-
tional Associates; interpretive panels and silkscreening for
the Festival of American Folklife; and illustration and
graphics for the Office of Horticulture’s presentation at
the Philadelphia Flower Show.

Office of Horticulture

Managing more than forty acres of gardens and grounds,
caring for the plants in museum interiors, and providing
plants and floral arrangements for Smithsonian Institu-
tion special events and exhibitions are among the respon-
sibilities of the Office of Horticulture (OH). In addition
to this full range of horticultural services, the office de-
velops educational and outreach activities and exhibitions
for local, national, and international audiences. Large
collections of living plants and horticultural artifacts and
images are maintained for use in all of these programs.

The new museum complex on the Quadrangle, with its
interior plantings and the Enid A. Haupt Garden, has
substantially increased the scope of the office. In 1988,
83,000 annuals and 7,000 pot plants were raised; these,
along with 50,000 tulip bulbs, were planted and main-
tained on the grounds and in museum interiors. Six hun-
dred ninety-five special events alone required the
production, preparation, pickup, and delivery of 13,500
plants and 328 floral arrangements. The office also se-
lects, installs, and cares for all landscape materials and
interior plants for the new National Air and Space Mu-
seum Restaurant.

Program Highlights

Among many projects accomplished during the past year
was the dedication on May 25, 1988, of the Mary Liv-
ingston Ripley Garden. Located between the Arts and In-
dustries Building and the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden, the garden was established in 1975 by
the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates.
It has now been renovated and is named for the commit-
tee’s founder. Over the years the committee has gener-
ously supported the development of the garden. This
year’s grant purchased plants, signs, and an irrigation
system. Hilda van Roijen, first chair of the committee,
funded the purchase and restoration of an antique cast-
iron “Gothic” settee, one of the earliest and most popular
nineteenth-century styles. Mrs. Horace Peters, also a
committee member, donated a rare nineteenth-century la-
beled “Bouquet” settee.

As part of the official celebration of Mrs. Lyndon B.
Johnson’s seventy-fifth birthday, the office organized the
exhibition, “Native American Flora” in the Arts and In-
dustries Building Rotunda. Photo panels and native
plants portrayed Lady Bird Johnson’s well-known efforts
to conserve wildflowers. The office coordinated a recep-
tion in honor of Mrs. Johnson and her contributions to
conservation on April 29 in the Rotunda.

142

A holiday tradition at the Institution, the eleventh an-
nual “Trees of Christmas” exhibition was held in the Na- —
tional Museum of American History. Ten new collections _
of ornaments created by American craftspeople were dis- _
played and then donated to the office. Stenciling, tin |
punch, candlewicking, rug hooking, and macramé were |
among the handiwork techniques new to this popular
show.

The office was pleased to assist U.S. Chief of Protocol
Selwa Roosevelt with the extensive Blair House renova-
tion project. A fine antique cast-iron fountain, c. 1850,
from the prominent American foundry of J. W. Fiske,
and two pairs of antique cast-iron urns were loaned for
use in the handsome new courtyard garden.

Educational Outreach

In March the office received the Emile H. Geshick Award
for its display in the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society’s
Flower Show in Philadelphia. The exhibit was a remarka- —
ble re-creation of part of the interior of Horticultural
Hall at the time of the Centennial Exposition.

James R. Buckler, director of the Office of Horticul-
ture, and Kathryn Meehan, museum specialist, were the
curators of a traveling exhibition, “Victorian Gardens: A
Horticultural Extravaganza,” developed with the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and the
Office of Exhibits Central. The exhibition started a fully |
booked three-year itinerary in May. :

To respond to requests for information, photographs
and illustrations, lectures, and tours of gardens and
greenhouses, the office trained volunteers to help organ-
ize graphics, handle processing, and lead tours. |

Director Buckler led a week-long Garden Study Tour
in May for the National Associate Program (SNAP) and
lectured for the SNAP symposium on historic horticul-
ture, held in Greenwich, Connecticut. Buckler also lec-
tured at the Ohio Historical Society, the Alexandria
(Virginia) Forum, Morris Arboretum, National Master
Gardeners Conference, American Ivy Society, and Vir-
ginia Museum of Fine Arts.

Collections Management |

Both the living plants and the artifacts collections have
grown. Four hundred fifty-one orchids, bromeliads,
ferns, and ivies were acquired. Two orchids grown in
greenhouses from seedlings were selected while in bloom |
for awards by the American Orchid Society.

“Exotic Plants: Horticultural Hall 1876,” the Office of Horticulture exhibition at the 1988 Philadelphia Flower Show, won the

Emile H. Geshik Memorial Award.

To date 9,000 35-millimeter slides and 2,000 glass
plates have been received for the Garden Club of America
Slide Library of Notable Parks and Gardens. The exqui-
site hand-colored glass plates, made in the 1920s and
1930s, show great American gardens, some no longer in
existence. They represent an unparalleled archives of gar-
den history. The Frances Jones Poetker Collection of
more than 300 unique hand-bouquet holders was photo-
graphed and accessioned, primarily by volunteer techni-
cians Marilyn Hanlon, Ursula Pariser, and Sally
Tomlinson.

During 1988 the Office of Product Licensing success-
fully negotiated a licensing contract with furniture manu-
facturer Brown Jordan for a Smithsonian Collection.

Two groups of garden furniture, Day Lily and Fern Leaf,
were based on pieces in the Office of Horticulture collec-
tion and are now being marketed nationwide. Revenues
from the sales of these reproductions will be used to en-
hance the office’s collections.

Office of Museum Programs

The Office of Museum Programs (OMP) is the museum
training and services arm of the Smithsonian. Under the
direction of Jane R. Glaser, the office provides extensive
professional development services to those who work in
museums in the United States and throughout the world.
These services include workshops, seminars, internships,
publications and audiovisual materials, short-term resi-
dencies for visiting professionals, career counseling, and
professional museum consultations. The office also
houses the Museum Reference Center, a branch of the
Smithsonian Institution Libraries.

Workshops

In collaboration with domestic and international museum
organizations, the Training Program develops and oper-
ates one- to five-day workshops on museum practices.
Faculty are drawn from all bureaus and offices of the
Smithsonian, as well as from museums and universities
across the country. In 1988 the Washington Workshop
Series consisted of eighteen workshops at the Smithson-
ian, attracting more than 400 participants from all parts
of the United States, two U.S. territories, and eleven for-
eign countries. Eighteen on-site workshops were con-
ducted at institutions throughout the United States and in
Trinidad, Barbados, and Puerto Rico. The Organization
of American States, UNESCO, and the University of
Puerto Rico were collaborating organizations. A special
workshop, “Planning a Small Local Museum,” was con-
ducted for Micronesian historic preservation and museum
professionals in collaboration with the National Park
Service. This was the inaugural workshop in a training
series for professionals from the U.S. Trust Territories
and the Federated States of Micronesia.

Internships and Visiting Professionals

The Internships in Museum Practices Program provides
placements at the Smithsonian for undergraduate and
graduate students and for museum professionals. In 1988
Participants came from the United States, Costa Rica,
Greece, Malaysia, Mexico, and the Sudan. The program
sponsored the eighth annual Museum Careers Seminars
Series for forty Washington, D.C.-area museum interns.
During this seven-week course, professionals from the
Smithsonian and other area museums discussed museum
operations and career opportunities.

The Visiting Professionals Program organized short-

144

term programs for twenty-nine museum professionals
from this country and thirty-one from abroad. The pro-
gram also developed a special seminar on museum prac-
tices for a group of Danish museum professionals. The
fifth annual project on museum management for Euro-
pean museum administrators, cosponsored with the U.S.
Information Agency, introduced concepts of management
and governance in American museums to museum direc-
tors from seven countries.

Native American and Minority Programs

The goal of the Native American Museums Program
(NAMP) is to strengthen the educational and professional |
capabilities of Native Americans by offering a full range
of training and information services. A training needs as-
sessment conducted in 1988 demonstrated that American
Indians were seeking better collaboration for sharing
resources and were interested in learning about new
museum models. The NAMP’s cooperation with the
Ak-Chin Indian Community in Arizona presented an op-
portunity to conduct research in the United States and |
Canada on tribal museums and ecomuseums, a new mu- _
seum concept that includes natural heritage conservation |
and public participation. Eight Ak-Chin staff members
attended a special NAMP workshop on museum practices
and information resources. |

Under the 1987-88 Awards for Minority Museum |
Professionals Program, twenty-four museum profession-
als received financial and logistical support for their at-
tendance at Office of Museum Programs workshops and
their participation in one-week Smithsonian residencies. _
For the first time in the program’s five-year history, parti-
cipants came from the outlying areas of Palau, Guam,
Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. An Institution-wide re-
view panel selected thirty-one professionals as recipients
of the 1988-89 awards.

Audiovisuals, Publications, and Reference Services

The Audiovisual Program produces and distributes in-
structional videotapes and slide-cassette programs on pre- |
ventive care, conservation, education, and other
museum-related topics. In collaboration with the OMP’s
Kellogg Project, the program produced a thirty-six-
minute film, Museum and Community, which focuses on
four museums that have developed exemplary public edu-
cation programs. Other new productions include two

slide-cassette programs, Connoisseurship in the Visual
and Decorative Arts: The Educated Eye and More than
Meets the Eye, and a film videotape, Horticulture in
Museums.

The Museum Reference Center responded to more
than 8,500 inquiries from within Smithsonian, across the
United States, and around the world this year. Three is-
sues of the center’s bulletin, Museworld, were published
and distributed to museum documentation centers
abroad, Smithsonian libraries, and Smithsonian staff
members. Nine of the approximately eighty bibliogra-
phies that the Museum Reference Center distributes were
revised this year; the topics range from museum market-
ing to transportation museums to planning and organiz-
ing a new museum.

A redesigned and updated edition of Museum Studies
International was published in 1988. This comprehensive
directory lists more than 400 degree programs, courses,
internships, fellowships, seminars, and workshops
offered at the undergraduate, graduate, and midcareer
levels in this country and abroad. Cosponsored by the
International Council of Museums Committee for the
Training of Personnel, the new edition features articles
about selecting and evaluating a museum studies
program.

Studies by Museums for Program Planning and Exhibi-
tion Evaluation, 1977-1985, a bibliography compiled
from responses to an OMP survey, was published this
year. The citations, most of which are unpublished stud-
ies, are available for use in the Museum Reference
Center.

Kellogg Project

The Kellogg Project, the office’s six-year-long special pro-
gram to expand the educational role of museums in their
communities, was completed during 1988. Among the ac-
complishments that had national impact were three na-
tional colloquia, twelve demonstration museums that
created model museum educational projects, residencies
at the Smithsonian, and regional and topical workshops.

This year the Kellogg Project broadened its Museum
Professionals Program, making all senior-level employees
in museums eligible for ten-day residencies at the Smith-
sonian. Museums and Adult Education is being published
jointly by the Kellogg Project and the National University
Continuing Education Association. In addition to the film
produced with the OMP’s Audiovisual Program, other
publications, videotapes, and a complete project evalua-
tion will be made available as a result of the project.

Office of the Registrar

As the focal point for the management of all museum
objects and specimens, the Office of the Registrar regards
as primary the development and implementation of poli-
cies and procedures that promote and strengthen collec-
tions management. The office celebrated one year of
residency in the Smithsonian Castle in 1988.

During this fiscal year the office launched a project to
review Office Memorandum 808: Collections Manage-
ment, which provides institutional guidance to bureaus
and offices responsible for museum collections. Informed
by the assembly of collection managers—curators, regis-
trars, scientists, conservators, archivists, and librarians—
and specialists in audit procedures, risk and information
management, law, and security, this document discusses
the issues, authority, and responsibility for the care and
use of the national collection. Led by Joseph Wiley, small
working groups of bureau staff reviewed and revised des-
ignated sections, stressing contemporary thinking related
to multiethnic collecting patterns and biodiversity. The
collaborative process, the issues raised, the breadth of
collection types considered, and the flexible format make
the revised office memorandum a useful guide for the
international museum community.

Physical care of the national collection constitutes only
half the activity of the Office of the Registrar. Equal ef-
fort is dedicated to the care of the intellectual collection—
data, documents, and records. In collaboration with the
Office of Information Resource Management and bureau
representatives, the office directs the transfer of collec-
tions information from outdated information technolo-
gies to modern computing media. In 1988, one million
records were made available through the interactive tech-
nologies of the Collections Information System. These re-
cords reside on a mainframe computer, along with a small
machine system at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, an im-
age-processing project at the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden, and local transaction programs at the
National Museum of American History. Standards that
guide the further development of the system have been
developed and embraced by the museum participants.

The publication of Registrars on Record: Essays on
Museum Collections Management in September 1988
completed a four-year editorial effort by Mary Case, di-
rector of the Office of the Registrar. Published by the
American Association of Museums, Registrars on Record
chronicles the daily challenges of working with priceless
works of art, irreplaceable icons, and countless natural
history specimens. It also defines the wide scope of mu-
seum registration and provides historical perspective.
Smithsonian staff members Margaret Santiago of the Na-

145
tional Museum of Natural History and Ellen Myette of
the Renwick Gallery contributed chapters, as did a dozen
other museum professionals.

The membership of the Registrar’s Council, which ex-
panded in 1988 to include metropolitan Washington col-
lections management specialists, grew to nearly Iso.
Programs included a timely range of subjects—managing
a building for collections care, registration methods at
the zoo, art theft, disaster preparedness, and foreign
loans and acquisitions.

On the international front, the office directed the first
stages of a worldwide survey of computer use in mu-
seums. This survey, which used Washington museums as
the pilot group, reached twelve countries in 1988 and will
continue throughout 1989 and 1990. Participants in the
International Council of Museums Documentation Com-
mittee meeting in Barcelona, Spain, discussed the 1988
results and expanded the program into more countries.

Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service

The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service
(SITES) develops exhibitions on a range of topics and
circulates them to museums and other educational and
cultural institutions throughout the United States and
abroad. During 1988 SITES organized twenty-four new

exhibitions, among them three complex projects—exhibi- _

tions on fine art, natural history, and archaeology—that
illustrate the breadth and diversity of the SITES program.

“New Horizons: American Painting, 1840-1910,” the
reciprocal exhibition for “Russia, The Land, The Peo-
ple,” opened in Moscow in November 1987. In conjunc-
tion with the exhibition’s tour of four cities in the Soviet
Union, SITES also arranged for concerts, symposia, and
special events for members of the Smithsonian Board of
Regents. The exhibition was supported by funding from
the Armand Hammer Foundation and from the PepsiCo
Foundation.

“Tropical Rainforests: A Disappearing Treasure” began
a five-year tour in May 1988 with a seven-month showing
in the International Gallery of the S. Dillon Ripley Cen-
ter. Organized by SITES with the World Wildlife Fund,
the exhibition surveys rainforest ecology and destruction
in a global context through multimedia presentations, di-
oramas, models, and interactive displays. The exhibition
and its public programs were supported by a major grant
from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Founda-
tion, with additional funds from the Smithsonian’s Spe-
cial Exhibition Fund, the George Gund Foundation, the
Wm. Wrigley Foundation, the James Smithson Society,
and the Smithsonian’s Educational Outreach Program.
The SITES exhibition book, People of the Tropical Rain
Forest, was copublished with the University of California
Press.

“King Herod’s Dream: Caesarea on the Sea,” which
opened at the National Museum of Natural History in
March 1988, introduces land and underwater archaeology
techniques involved in researching and reconstructing
Herod’s famed ancient harbor. The exhibition was organ-
ized with the University of Maryland Center for Mediter-
ranean Archaeology, the Caesarea Ancient Harbour
Excavation Project, and the Joint Expedition to Caesarea
Maritima, in cooperation with the Department of An-
tiquities and Museums of the State of Israel.

One-third of SITES’ new exhibitions were organized in
cooperation with Smithsonian bureaus. Among them were
“Exploring the Planets” and “Into the Sunlit Splendor”
with the National Air and Space Museum, “ZooArk” with
the National Zoo, “Victorian Gardens” with the Office
of Horticulture, “The Grand Generation” with the Office
of Folklife Programs, and “Official Images” and “Field to

Factory” with the National Museum of American His-
tory. Research and program assistance with “Tropical
Rainforests” was provided by the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute (STRI), the International Activities
Council, and a curatorial review committee that included
members from the National Zoo, STRI, and the National
Museum of Natural History.

SITES continued to collaborate with other museums in
the presentation of “Athletes: Photographs 1860-1986”
(International Center for Photography, New York), “Com-
puters in Your Pocket” (Computer Museum, Boston),
“Master Watercolors and Drawings from the Norton
Gallery of Art” (West Palm Beach, Florida), “Sound-
tracks” (Staten Island Children’s Museum, New York),
“Tracks in the Sky” (California Academy of Sciences, San
Francisco), “Coverlets: New Threads in Old Patterns”
(Mountain Heritage Center, Cullowhee, North Carolina),
and “The Art of Botany” (New York Botanical Garden,
Bronx, New York).

SITES was fortunate to receive substantial funding for
its exhibitions and programs from a variety of sources. In
addition to those already mentioned, grants totaling in
excess of one million dollars were received from corpora-
tions, foundations, and the Smithsonian’s Special Exhibi-
tion Fund. One of the more innovative subsidies was
provided by the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company and its lo-
cal bottlers for program support of individual exhibitors
for “Field to Factory.”

Eileen Rose, associate director for program, served as
acting director of SITES during 1988. Anna R. Cohn was
named director by Secretary Adams and began her tenure
in September 1988. Cohn, an art historian and educator,
has been associated with SITES over the past several
years as a guest curator and project director for “The
Precious Legacy” (1983-85) and “Generations” (1987-88).

National Demonstration
Laboratory for Interactive
Educational Technologies

Through the National Demonstration Laboratory for In-
teractive Educational Technologies (NDL), the Smithson-
ian Institution has made a commitment to strengthening
the nation’s educational system through new and innova-
tive technologies. A cooperative project of the Smithson-
ian and the Interactive Video Consortium (IVC), a group
of public broadcasting stations seeking ways to use inter-
active technologies to enrich programming, the NDL is a
national resource for disseminating information, demon-
strating new technologies, and encouraging the develop-
ment of interactive projects.

The coupling of interactive computer programs with
multimedia materials offers educators the ability to make
maximum use of scarce resources, address curriculum
problems, achieve success with problem students, and
reach new groups of learners. Using interactive programs,
students can review, annotate, question, respond to, and
see relationships within a rich data base that includes
audio, video, and textual material. Schools, museums,
public broadcasting stations, and other educational insti-
tutions and organizations are hailing the potential of in-
teractive technologies as key ingredients to both formal
and informal learning.

To strengthen its ties to the academic community, the
NDL has established a Research Consortium composed
of prestigious academic institutions and educational or-
ganizations. With the consortium’s assistance, the NDL
staff will develop criteria for research in educational ap-

tion for Interactive Educational Technologies, demonstrates

plications of interactive video and evaluation of interac-
tive materials. The laboratory also intends to conduct
and issue needs assessments. Additional activities include
establishing a data base of interactive video information
and identifying elements of educational curricula that are
particularly suitable for interactive video applications.

The laboratory features an extensive array of hardware
and software for review and evaluation by visitors. The
NDL does not promote individual products, but rather
makes potential users aware of the variety of options
available to them. Demonstrations are offered several
times weekly by appointment. As many Smithsonian of-
fices consider the development of interactive capabilities
and displays, Smithsonian staff have found the laboratory
to be a valuable resource.

Jacqueline Hess joined the National Demonstration
Laboratory in April 1988 as its new director. In June the
NDL received an operational funding grant from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

National Science Resources
Center

The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) was es-
tablished in 1985 as a joint undertaking of the Smithson-
ian Institution and the National Academy of Sciences.
The NSRC’s mission is to contribute to the improvement
of science and mathematics teaching in the nation’s
schools by establishing a science and mathematics curric-
ulum resource center and information data base, develop-
ing resource materials for science and mathematics
teachers, and offering a program of outreach and leader-
ship development activities.

The pressing need to start in the early years to improve
the scientific and technological literacy of young people
has led the NSRC to place a high priority on developing
programs to reform science teaching in the nation’s ele-
mentary schools. Several projects are under way in this
area.

NSRC Elementary Science Resource Database and
Guide. During 1988, the NSRC developed an elementary-
level science resource collection and computer informa-
tion data base. The resource collection will be used by

Children in the Milwaukee Public Schools working on elemen-
tary science activities. The Milwaukee Public Schools is one of
several large urban school districts participating in the National
Sciences Resources Center network. (Photograph by Robert Ze-
man)

school systems and regional science education centers
that are working to improve their elementary science pro-
grams and by participants in NSRC workshops and con-
ferences. The information data base includes annotations
written by teachers, as well as bibliographic information
about the materials in the resource collection. The data
base was published as a guide, Science for Children: Re-
sources for Teachers, by the National Academy Press in
October 1988.

Science and Technology for Children. This four-year
elementary science materials development project, sup-
ported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, will make hands-on science
manageable for elementary-school teachers and link it to
the broader curriculum through a strong emphasis on
reading, writing, and mathematics. The Science and
Technology for Children project will develop twenty-four
instructional units for grades 1-6 on topics in life science,
physical science, earth science, and technology. After
they are tested in elementary-school classrooms, these
units will be revised, published, and distributed to school
systems throughout the country.

As another component of Science and Technology for
Children, the NSRC will sponsor leadership institutes to
prepare selected teachers and science supervisors to or-
ganize elementary science improvement projects in their
school districts. The center will also provide technical as-
sistance to help school systems design effective inservice
teacher education programs and establish resource
centers to supply teachers with science materials and
apparatus.

NSRC Elementary Science Network. The NSRC is de-
veloping a network of teachers, scientists, science educa-
tors, and school administrators who are working to
improve the teaching of science in the nation’s schools.
To communicate with the 20,000 network members, the
center published the first issue of NSRC Newsletter in
June 1988.

Office of the Committee for a
Wider Audience

In 1988 the Office of the Committee for a Wider Audi-
ence (OCWA) continued its role of extending the reach of
Smithsonian programs to segments of the public that tra-
ditionally have been underrepresented in the institution’s
audience. The office has helped museums, offices, and
bureaus throughout the institution in their outreach ef-
forts. Major activities for the year included the organiza-
tion of a radio pilot series, a celebration of Martin
Luther King’s birthday, and the design of a cultural tour
to the Caribbean. The office also collaborated in the
launching of a public awareness campaign carried out by
the Office of Public Affairs.

In an effort to identify the Smithsonian with the preser-
vation and dissemination of information on black Ameri-
can culture, to inform black Americans about their
culture, and to build relationships among black institu-
tions, artists, and the general public, the OCWA initiated
a radio pilot series. Funded by the Women’s Committee
of the Smithsonian Associates and produced in coopera-
tion with the Office of Telecommunications and Smith-

sonian magazine, the programs were aired on urban
contemporary radio stations across the country. The se-
ries marked the centerpiece of the OCWA’s summer pub-
lic awareness marketing campaign.

The OCWA systematically ensures participation of mi-
nority groups at receptions and special events. About 350
guests attended the Martin Luther King birthday celebra-
tion on January 18 at the National Museum of Natural
History; 40 percent were Hispanic and 60 percent repre-
sented a cross section of other groups. The event, which
was sponsored by the Smithsonian’s Cultural Education
Committee, featured Dr. Frank Bonilla, distinguished
Thomas Hunter professor of sociology and director of
the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in
New York City. His lecture was titled, “From Racial
Justice to Economic Rights: The New American Di-
lemma.” Los Pleneros de la 21, a Puerto Rican bomba
and plena musical group from New York, provided the
entertainment.

In conjunction with the Smithsonian National Associ-

Los Pleneros de la 21, a Puerto Rican Bomba and Plena musical group from New York. The group performed at the Martin Luther
King Celebration in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., sponsored by the Smithsonian Cultural Education Committee.

152

ate Program, the OCWA is designing cultural study tours
to developing nations. The first, a tour of the Caribbean,
is scheduled for the winter of 1989.

Exposure to all facets of the institution continues to be
an essential part of building new audiences. Throughout
1988 the OCWA continued to hold discussions with bu-
reau and office directors on the progress of wider audi-
ence initiatives.

Office of Elementary and
Secondary Education

Through teacher training programs, publications, special
education programs, and precollege training for young
people, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Educa-
tion (OESE) helps teachers and students reap the full po-
tential of museums as educational resources. Working
with other Smithsonian education offices, the OESE aims
to make known the instructional value of museums and
museum objects.

The OESE’s symposia and courses for teachers demon-
strate how to teach by using a museum-oriented ap-
proach. During 1988 the office collaborated with
education departments around the Smithsonian to organ-

153
ize ten courses for teachers from the Washington, D.C.,
area and one graduate-level course for instructors from
around the country. In addition, as part of an ongoing
effort to foster more productive relationships between
museums and school systems nationwide, the OESE’s Re-
gional Workshop Program sponsored a partnership in
Wilmington, North Carolina, one outcome of which was
a day-long event involving museums and more than 500
teachers. A Teacher Internship Program built on the
work of the Regional Workshop Program by training
high school teachers from four communities to serve as
liaisons between their local museums and schools.

The office also organizes special programs that focus
on important events and issues. In 1988 the OESE collab-
orated with the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies on a
symposium, “Afro-Americans and the Evolution of a Liv-
ing Constitution.” Classroom materials growing out of
the presentations were published in Update, an American
Bar Association magazine.

OESE periodicals for teachers continued to bring the
Smithsonian into the classroom, both in the Washington,
D.C., area and across the nation. Art to Zoo, a quarterly
newspaper, reached 70,000 teachers nationwide with in-
formation about how to use local resources to teach such
subjects as “animal communication” and life on the
World War II home front. Let’s Go to the Smithsonian, a
newsletter circulated to schools in and around Washing-
ton, alerted about 12,000 teachers to events at the
Smithsonian.

The office’s Summer High School Internship Program
brought forty-two recent high school graduates to the In-
stitution for two five-week sessions. The young people
learned about museum careers while assisting Smithson-
ian professional staff in such tasks as installing exhibi-
tions, adapting computer programs, researching topics in
Afro-American history, and building display cases.

On April 29, the OESE convened the second meeting
of the Smithsonian Advisory Council on Education. Ap-
pointed by Secretary Adams, the council is charged with
helping to stimulate and shape Institution-wide priorities
and directions in education. Developing wider audiences
was the topic of this year’s meeting, as participants ex-
plored ways in which Smithsonian educators could at-
tract to their programs such currently underrepresented
groups as Hispanic Americans, Native Americans,
blacks, Asians, and disabled people.

Office of Folklife Programs

Through scholarly research, professional advocacy, and
public programs, the Office of Folklife Programs engages
in cultural conservation and representation activities that
encourage continuity, integrity, and equity for traditional
cultures in the United States and abroad. Highlights of
the year included a successful Festival of American Folk-
life, a cultural exchange program with the Soviet Union,
a lecture series on South Africa, and the first publications
of Smithsonian Folkways Records.

Festival of American Folklife

The twenty-second annual festival on the Mall drew an
estimated 1.5 million people to a vibrant “living mu-
seum,” giving traditional artists needed national visibility
and exposing the public to the skills, knowledge, and
creativity of diverse peoples. At this year’s festival, held
June 23-27 and June 30-July 4, the focus was the folklife
of Massachusetts, the music of the Soviet Union, the cul-
ture of immigrants to metropolitan Washington, D.C.,
and the work of the American Folklore Society.

The Massachusetts program examined continuity and
change in the agricultural, maritime, small-town, and ur-
ban traditions of the state and featured talks and demon-
strations on topics ranging from city gardening to
computer assembly. Soviet performers treated festival vis-
itors to a sampling of musical traditions of the Soviet
Union. In “Migration to Metropolitan Washington:
Making a New Place Home” the festival explored how
immigrants to the Washington, D.C., area have pre-
served and adapted their traditions. Another festival pro-
gram celebrated the centennial of the American Folklore
Society, and the Festival Music Stage again featured per-
formances and evening dance parties.

The festival reached millions more people beyond the
Mall through network television coverage, National Public
Radio and “Radio Smithsonian” series, and many news-
paper and magazine articles. Portions of some festival
programs were remounted in other locations. The Massa-
chusetts exhibition was on view in Holyoke, Massachu-
setts; Soviet musicians performed in the S. Dillon Ripley
Center and in New York; and the American Folklore So-
ciety display was installed in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Folklife Research

During 1988 scholars conducted studies on the accessibil-
ity of natural and cultural resources needed to continue

The men’s choir “Elesa,” from Georgian SSR, perform poly-
phonic choral music at the 1988 Festival of American Folklife’s

the traditions of several American Indian tribes; ethno-
graphic research on Jamaican-American cultural identity
and its expressions; and analytic work on the folk tales
of Southeast Asian immigrants. Training for native and
community scholars was conducted as an integral part of
all office research projects.

Senior ethnomusicologist Dr. Thomas Vennum, Jr.,
published the monograph, Wild Rice and the Ojibway
People, which examines Ojibway ethnobotany, cultural
expressions related to rice harvesting and subsistence,
and current cultural conservation issues. The Smithson-
ian Folklife Studies series released the documentary film,
Kathputli: The Art of Rajasthani Puppeteers, which ex-
plores traditional Indian stringed puppetry.

Smithsonian Folkways Records

Dr. Anthony Seeger, an internationally renowned anthro-
pologist and ethnomusicologist, was named founding cu-
rator of the Folkways Collection. Among the first
recorded sound publications in the Smithsonian Folkways
series are Folkways: The Original Vision, a compilation
of songs by Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly, and Music of
the Soviet Union, based on the Soviet program at the

1988 Festival of American Folklife. Both publications in-
clude scholarly notes, maps, and bibliographic references.
The Office of Folklife Programs collaborated with Co-
lumbia Records to produce Folkways: A Vision Shared,
featuring Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson,
Emmylou Harris, Pete Seeger, and other artists perform-
ing Guthrie and Leadbelly songs. Donated artists’ royal-
ties from the recording will help the Smithsonian recoup
the costs of acquiring Folkways Records and support fu-
ture scholarly research and Folkways recording projects.

Special Projects

Distinguished South Africans addressed the historical,
communal, and personal dimensions of apartheid in a
lecture series cosponsored by the office, the Smithsonian
Resident Associate Program, the National Museum of
Natural History Department of Anthropology, and How-
ard University. A National Public Radio series and a
Smithsonian Institution Press publication based on the se-
ries, which was called “South Africa Today: Life in a
Divided Society,” are being developed.

The office has initiated a long-term program of cul-
tural exchange with the USSR Ministry of Culture, Melo-
diya Records, and various scholarly organizations as a
result of the performances of forty Soviet musicians at the
Festival of American Folklife and the participation of
American music groups at the International Folklore Fes-
tival in Moscow. Folkways Records and Melodiya
publications, Smithsonian World television treatment,
and Radio Smithsonian broadcasts enhanced this initial
exchange.

Staff Changes

Dr. Peter Seitel, director of the Office of Folklife Pro-
grams for the past five years, returned to the position of
senior folklorist. Dr. Richard Kurin was acting director
of the office during 1988.

Office of Interdisciplinary
Studies

The Office of Interdisciplinary Studies contributes to
both the increase and the diffusion of knowledge in its
efforts to strengthen integrative learning and research in-
side and outside the Institution and to reach a wider au-
dience. Public officials, business and industry leaders,
educators, philanthropists, media representatives, stu-
dents, and interested members of the general public join
in seminars with scholars from a variety of fields to ex-
plore gaps in existing knowledge and speculate on the
implications of new research findings in the physical, nat-
ural, and human sciences. The office also coordinates
programs commemorating historic events and anniversa-
ries of the publication of classics in philosophy, science,
and literature. Books and educational materials are com-
monly generated from the major symposia.

A highlight of this year’s programs was a second sym-
posium organized for the bicentennial of the U.S. Consti-
tution, “Afro-Americans and the Evolution of a Living
Constitution.” According to Eddie N. Williams, president
of the Joint Center for Political Studies, which cospon-
sored the program, the purpose of the undertaking was
not to “lament the shortcomings or the limited reach of
the original document” but to celebrate “its vitality and
flexibility” and the creative role black Americans have
played in its 200 years of growth. Thirty distinguished
scholars, jurists, and civic leaders gave lectures and par-
ticipated in panels on constitutional interpretation. They
also examined how the struggles of black Americans for
full citizenship have affected other groups and communi-
ties, namely women, Native Americans, and Hispanic
Americans. The March 15-16, 1988, symposium featured
a special workshop for teachers and a teleconference that
was broadcast to thirty-six colleges and carried on public
radio stations across the United States. As the major bi-
centennial forum in Washington, D.C., to deal with the
relationship of Afro-Americans to the Constitution, the
program was notably successful in opening new channels
of communication and increasing interest in issues of na-
tional concern.

Other programs dealt with the global food supply and
science education. At the October 6-7, 1987, “Science,
Ethics, and Food” colloquium, a group of concerned
scholars and representatives of governmental and private
organizations in the United States and abroad addressed
pressing problems of global food production and distri-
bution. The colloquium, which initiated a multiyear col-
laborative effort between the Smithsonian and the
General Foods Fund, Inc., coincided with the presenta-
tion of the first General Foods World Food Prize. A semi-
nar on “Science Education: A Challenge for Excellence in

America’s Future” demonstrated the viability of the “Vol-
untarism and the Public Interest in American Society” se-
ries begun in 1971 to promote private-sector initiatives in
public policy. Cosponsored by the ARCS (Achievement
Rewards for College Scientists) Foundation, the May 5,
1988, discussion on Capitol Hill attracted more than 300
people.

A new forum for Smithsonian staff and fellows, “Ways
of Knowing,” was launched in November. Sessions dur-
ing the first year provoked lively exchanges on such mul-
tifaceted subjects as perception and computers. Plans call
for continued efforts to foster the flow of ideas among
staff and fellows in different disciplines and bureaus on
intellectual questions related to research and exhibitions.

Two book manuscripts based on office programs were
completed during 1988. Contemporary Indian Tradition
will be copublished in December 1988 by the Smithsonian
Institution Press and Oxford University Press in India;
the “Science, Ethics, and Food” proceedings appeared in
September. Summary reports of the May 1987 sympo-
sium, “Constitutional Roots, Rights, and Responsibili-
ties,” and of the March 1988 symposium have been
distributed to more than 1,000 public and school libraries |
across the country. Scholarly volumes, video documenta-
ries, and a radio series are also in preparation.

Office of Public Affairs

Millions of visitors to Smithsonian museums and millions
of others who are unable to visit the national museums
learn about the Institution’s research, exhibitions, collec-
tions, and programs through the media. To help print
and broadcast journalists tell the Smithsonian’s story, the
Office of Public Affairs provides news releases, back-
grounders, publications, photographs, videotapes, and
logistical support. The office also oversees Institution-
wide information and advertising programs.

During the past five years, the Office of Public Affairs
has strongly supported the Institution’s commitment to
reach a more diverse audience, including Afro-Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native
Americans. In 1988 the theme of the office’s activities was
“The Smithsonian. It’s for everyone—and for you.”

The office’s Black Outreach Media Program prepared a
coordinated media campaign designed to attract Afro-
American families to the Smithsonian. Two television
public service announcements, one featuring author Alex
Haley inviting visitors to the Anacostia Museum’s exhibi-
tion on the black church in America, were part of this
effort. The announcements were widely used in major
East Coast cities. Other elements of the campaign in-
cluded radio advertising during Black History Month (at-
tracting more than 1,000 calls); print advertisements in
New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago newspa-
pers; and colorful posters for the interior and exterior of
Washington’s Metrobuses. In cooperation with the D.C.
Committee to Promote Washington, the office prepared
full-color ads for Ebony, Essence, American Visions, and
Black Enterprise magazines, which brought well over
4,000 written requests for information about the Institu-
tion’s Afro-American programs. The office also began
publishing its full-page monthly calendar of events in
Washington’s Afro-American newspaper. Support for
these activities came in part from the James Smithson
Society through the Office of the Committee for a Wider
Audience and from the Smithsonian Educational Out-
reach Program.

Activities in the Hispanic Outreach Media Program in-
cluded the publication of the monthly calendar in Spanish
in E/ Latino newspaper, the distribution of calendar re-
prints to Hispanic organizations, and expanded distribu-
tion of the Spanish edition of the Smithsonian News
Service in the United States and Latin America. To de-
scribe Smithsonian resources for Latinos, the office pro-
duced Spanish- and English-language versions of a
television public service announcement and a bilingual
brochure. An Educational Outreach Program grant ena-
bled the office to hire a Native American intern to help

Alex Haley generously donated his time and talents to the
Smithsonian in the production of a public service announcement
for television promoting the exhibition at the Anacostia Mu-
seum on the history of the black church in America. Here he is
shown in one scene of the spot announcement holding a historic
hymn book.

design a media program directed to the national Native
American community. Three additional public service an-
nouncements were prepared: two about the multicultural
nature of Smithsonian exhibitions and programs and one
targeted to senior citizens.

During 1988 the Office of Public Affairs provided pub-
licity assistance to other Smithsonian bureaus and offices.
The office planned and implemented major publicity
campaigns for such activities as the Columbus Quincen-
tenary Program; the fifth anniversary of the Museum

1§7
Support Center; the National Museum of Natural Histo-
ry’s landmark exhibition, “Crossroads of Continents”;
Archives of American Art symposia in San Francisco and
Chicago; a symposium, “Afro-Americans and the Evolu-
tion of a Living Constitution”; and the Festival of Ameri-
can Folklife. In cooperation with several offices, the
Office of Public Affairs coordinated a special promo-
tional effort for the exhibition, “Tropical Rainforests: A
Disappearing Treasure.”

The office’s publications, which report on behind-the-
scenes activities at the Smithsonian, continue to be recog-
nized for their excellence. Research Reports, a three-times-
a-year periodical, received an award from the Society for
Technical Communication, and the Smithsonian News
Service, a monthly feature story service for daily and
weekly newspapers, was honored by the National Associa-
tion of Government Communicators. The Torch, a month-
ly newspaper for Smithsonian staff, received the highest
honor from the Society for Technical Communication.

Office of

Telecommunications

Through nationally broadcast television and radio pro-
grams, educational films, and home video, the Office of
Telecommunications extends the reach of the Smithson-
ian. The office collaborates with Smithsonian research-
ers, historians, and curators to produce quality programs
that present the Institution’s wide-ranging activities to the -
American public.

This year the office joined with the Smithsonian Film,
Television, and Radio Communications Council to
launch the Smithsonian Video Collection, a new series
directed at the growing home video market. Production
of the programs, which will concentrate on the Institu-
tion’s own collections and research, is funded by East-
man Kodak Company, which will also be the principal
distributor. The programs’ subjects, content, and produc-
tion teams have been selected by the Smithsonian. The
first three one-hour programs—“Dinosaurs,” “Insects,”
and “Gems and Minerals”—are scheduled for release in
early 1989.

Work moved forward on a large-scale radio project, an
expanded version of “Radio Smithsonian,” designed to
provide a broad picture of the Institution’s research and
exhibitions, featuring music and cultures from around the
world. In cooperation with public radio station WETA-
FM in Washington, D.C., the office produced a pilot pro-

that was completed in 1988.
gram that received high praise from public radio program-
mers nationwide. Efforts are now under way to raise
private funds to support the series. The series would re-
place the current half-hour “Radio Smithsonian,” which
reaches a potential audience of 3.5 million people each
week.

“Here at the Smithsonian” launched its seventh season,
airing on 175 subscribing television stations that serve
more than half the prime-time viewing audience in the
United States. The program is a series of short features
that highlight exhibitions, research, and performances
throughout the Institution.

As part of its effort to reach wider audiences, the office
conducted marketing research to assess the feasibility of a
Smithsonian television series for Hispanic audiences. The
research identified a need for more cultural and informa-
tional programming about the United States for Spanish-
language television. As a result, the office is exploring the
development of a pilot for a series of short, Spanish-lan-
guage television features about the Smithsonian. To in-
crease awareness of Smithsonian programs among black
Americans, the office helped plan a series of short pro-
grams for black commercial radio stations. Joining with
the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies, the office assisted
in producing a live teleconference on “Afro-Americans
and the Evolution of a Living Constitution.”

The office completed a number of video and film pro-
jects in 1988. For the National Museum of American His-
tory’s exhibition, “A Material World,” the office
produced a major interactive video project, which incor-
porates video animation, puppetry, and on-location pho-
tography. Also for NMAH, the office produced an
exhibition videotape on the music of Irving Berlin, mark-
ing the composer’s rooth birthday. “The Reel Jungle,”
showing the myths and misconceptions that artists and
filmmakers have created about tropical rainforests, was
produced to accompany “Tropical Rainforests: A Disap-
pearing Treasure,” an exhibition organized by the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. For the
Museum Support Center, the office created a new video-
tape for museum professionals that gives a comprehensive
overview of this innovative facility.

Work also progressed on a half-hour video for the Vis-
itor Information and Associates’ Reception Center that
will play continuously in two theaters in the new Smith-
sonian Information Center in the Castle. The office is
also producing the video programming for another aid to
visitors—nine interactive video stations, operated by
touchscreen. These video highlights will be available in
several languages and captioned for the hearing impaired.

Working in cooperation with Bank Street College of
Education, the office is proceeding with a major project
for children aged nine through twelve. “Smithsonian
Quest—1492” is an interactive videodisc and a videotape
series that will focus on the worldwide events of the cen-
tury surrounding that date.

In February 1988 Paul Johnson was named director of
the Office of Telecommunications. Producer of numerous
films and video and radio programs, Johnson was previ-
ously the office’s associate director.

Smithsonian Institution Press

The Smithsonian Institution Press, the publishing arm of
the Smithsonian, produces the works of scientists, schol-
ars, researchers, art historians, and other authors in a
wide spectrum of disciplines. Manuscripts may be ac-
quired from the Institution’s staff as well as from a
worldwide array of institutions and individuals in diverse
fields of endeavor. Publications include research mono-
graphs, technical and scientific series, exhibition cata-
logues for Smithsonian museums, informational and
educational pamphlets, as well as trade books, sound re-
cordings, and archival videodiscs.

University Press Division

Books published this year by the General Publications
section continued to receive critical acclaim. Galapagos:
Discovery on Darwin’s Islands, by David W. Steadman
and Steven Zousmer, and Fragonard in the Universe of
Painting, by the leading scholar and art critic Dore Ash-
ton, were among the lead titles. One of the division’s
most important publications was Crossroads of Conti-
nents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska, by William W.
Fitzhugh and Aron Crowell, published in conjunction
with the major international exhibition, which opened in
September. The Recovery of Meaning: Historical Archae-
ology in the Eastern United States, edited by Mark P.
Leone and Parker B. Potter, Jr., was also prominent on
the trade list in conjunction with the Anthropological So-
ciety of Washington. Among the Press’s new titles in the
sciences were North American Owls: Biology and Natu-
ral History, by Paul A. Johnsgard; The Bald Eagle:
Haunts and Habits of a Wilderness Monarch, by Jon M.
Gerrard and Gary R. Bortolotti; and Grass Systematics
and Evolution, by Thomas R. Soderstrom, et al.

The University Press Division also inaugurated “Ex-
ploring the American West,” a series featuring reprints of
rare and out-of-print reports, with two titles: The Ex-
ploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, by John C.
Frémont, with a new introduction by Herman J. Viola
and Ralph E. Ehrenberg, and Exploration of the Valley
of the Great Salt Lake, by Howard Stansbury, with a
new introduction by Don D. Fowler. New books in avia-
tion history included From the Ground Up: The Autobi-
ography of an Aeronautical Engineer, by Fred E. Weick
and James R. Hansen; Pacific Air Race, by Robert H.
Scheppler; and Test Pilots: The Frontiersmen of Flight,
by Richard P. Hallion.

On the anthropology/ archaeology list, The People of
the Bat: Mayan Tales and Dreams from Zinacantan, ed-

160

ited by Carol Karasik and collected and translated by
Robert M. Laughlin, received excellent reviews in the
public press. New titles published in the Smithsonian Se-
ries in Ethnographic Inquiry include Raramuri Souls:
Knowledge and Social Process in Northern Mexico, by
William L. Merrill, and Raiders & Refugees: Trends in
Chamba Political Development, by Richard Fardon.
Three new titles were published in the Smithsonian Series
in Archaeological Inquiry: Prehispanic Settlement Pat-
terns in the Lower Santa Valley, Peru, by David J. Wil- _
son; Status and Health in Prehistory: A Case Study of the
Moundville Chiefdom, by Mary Lucas Powell; and Stylis-
tic Boundaries among Mobile Hunter-Foragers, by C.
Garth Sampson.

In this year of expanding cooperation with other
bureaus, a book of special interest published with the
Anacostia Museum was Climbing Jacob’s Ladder: The
Rise of Black Churches in Eastern American Cities,
1740-1877, by Edward D. Smith. Giacometti, by Valerie
J. Fletcher, was published in collaboration with the |
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. |

The Series section of the University Press Division pub-
lishes the federally funded Contributions and Studies, |
consisting of ten series of monographs that report the |
research of Smithsonian staff. All of the editing, design,
and typesetting for these publications is accomplished on —
Smithsonian Press computers.

Among the eighteen publications in these series during
1988 series were: “A Monograph of the Lichen Genus
Parmelia. . . .” by Mason E. Hale, Jr. (Smithsonian Con- ©
tributions to Botany, no. 66); “Hydrographic and Mete-
orological Studies of a Caribbean Fringing Reef at Punta ©
Galeta, Panama... ,” by John D. Cubit et al. (Smith-
sonian Contributions to the Marine Sciences, no. 32);
“The Cretaceous Birds of New Jersey,” by Storrs L. Ol-
son and David C. Parris (Smithsonian Contributions to
Paleobiology, no. 63); “A Survey of Internal Oral Fea-
tures of Leptodactyloid Larvae (Amphibia: Anura),” by |
Richard J. Wassersug and W. Ronald Heyer (Smithson-
ian Contributions to Zoology, no. 457); and “Late Holo-
cene Fossil Vertebrates from Burma Quarry, Antigua,
Lesser Antilles,” by Gregory K. Pregill et al. (Smithsonian
Contributions to Zoology, no. 463).

Smithsonian Collection of Recordings |

The Recordings Division produced and released three
new albums under the Smithsonian Collection (SCR) la-
bel, each with extensive liner notes in an accompanying

book. The largest of these was the six-record, six-com-
pact-disc, and five-cassette set entitled Beethoven: Early
Years through the “Eroica,” distributed by direct mail to
Smithsonian Associates. The recording contains Beethoy-
en’s first three symphonies as well as his Opus 18 quartets
and his two cello sonatas, performed on original instru-
ments by, respectively, the Smithsonian Chamber Orches-
tra, the Smithson String Quartet, and James Weaver and
Kenneth Slowik. These are the first recordings issued on
compact disc by SCR.

Piano Music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk, performed
by pianist Lambert Orkis, and Smetana/Dvorak Piano
Trios, performed by the newly formed Castle Trio, are
the inaugural releases in an “Instruments of the Smithson-
ian” series and include extensive notes about the instru-
ments from the collection. Also released in 1988 were the
first two records launching a Smithsonian/ deutsche har-
monia mundi series: Mozart’s Concertante K.364/Con-
certone K.190 and Servais’s Souvenirs and Caprices. The
Mozart is performed by the Smithsonian Chamber Or-
chestra and the Servais by cellist Anner Bylsma. This se-
ries will be available to the retail record trade in the
United States through Angel Records.

Last year’s release Singers and Soloists of the Swing
Bands, annotated by Mark Tucker, was nominated for
two Grammy Awards, for Best Historical Album and
Best Album Notes. Jimmie Rodgers on Record: America’s
Blue Yodeler, by Nolan Porterfield, was also nominated
for Best Album Notes.

Smithsonian Books

A highlight of this year for Smithsonian Books was the
publication of Exploring the West, by Herman Viola.
This beautifully illustrated story of the exploration and
mapping of the West by Smithsonian scientists and others
was distributed to Smithsonian Associates by direct mail
and to the retail book trade by Harry N. Abrams. It was
also a Book-of-the-Month Club dividend selection. Fol-
lowing on the success of Exploring the West was the
publication in August of In the Age of Mankind: A Smith-
sonian Book of Human Evolution, by Roger Lewin. Smith-
sonian Institution Press distributed this volume to the
retail book trade, as well as to Smithsonian Associates by
direct mail.

Book Development

The newly formed Book Development Division produced
full-color postcard books featuring works in the collec-
tions of Smithsonian museums. They are intended pri-
marily for sale in the Museum Shops. The first postcard
books feature the collections of the National Museum of
African Art, the National Museum of American Art, the
National Museum of Natural History, and the National
Air and Space Museum and the National Portrait Gal-
lery. Several more are planned for release by the spring
1989 tourist season.

For the first time, three museums have their own
guidebooks, each coordinated and published by the Press.
Guides for NYAH, NMNH, and NASM are enormously
popular with visitors, especially through the busy sum-
mer months.

Optical Publishing

The Optical Publishing Division, established this year un-
der the direction of Glen Hoptman, is exploring projects
that use interactive educational technologies. The divi-
sion is working with Smithsonian Books staff, for exam-
ple, on Treasures of the Smithsonian and, with the
Smithsonian Collection of Recordings and the Office of
Folklife Programs, has begun a cooperative venture in-
volving the recently acquired Folkways Collection.

In a related development, planning has begun for the
Press to serve as the electronic publisher of Smithsonian
research data bases, such as the Index of American Sculp-
ture, the Hymenoptera Catalog, and bibliographies in
several fields. The result could be the distribution of re-
search information by floppy disks, by CD-ROM (which
combines visual and textual material on laser disks), or
by telephone dial-up. The target audience will be librar-
ies, research institutions, and individual scholars.

161
Smithsonian Internship
Council

The Smithsonian Internship Council, formed in 1981, sets
standards for internship programs and coordinates these
programs throughout the Institution. Its members, who
meet monthly, represent each Smithsonian museum and
office. During 1988 more than 500 individuals partici-
pated in the Institution’s internship programs, which
ranged from working with exhibit designers on an exhibi-
tion at the National Museum of Natural History to or-
ganizing special events with the Resident Associate
Program.

The council has produced three publications for in-
terns: Internships and Fellowships describes the majority
of internship and fellowship programs at the Smithson-
ian. The Handbook for Smithsonian Interns provides in-
formation about Smithsonian procedures, facilities,
services, and activities available to interns. Housing In-
formation for Interns and Fellows is a guide to short-term
housing in the Washington metropolitan area.

The Internship Council cochairs for 1988 were Bruce
Craig of the Office of Museum Programs and Mary Dyer
of the National Museum of American History. The staff
assistant to the council registers interns, provides identifi-
cation credentials and orientation, and produces reports
about interns and internship programs throughout the In-
stitution. The staff assistant also provides services for in-
terns at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars.

This year the council directed most of its energies to-
ward two goals: the establishment of a central stipend
fund and the standardization of application procedures.
To gather background information for both efforts, the
council conducted a multiyear survey of internship pro-
grams that yielded data on Smithsonian staff who work
with interns, demographic information on program par-
ticipants, and types of supplementary activities available
to interns. The survey revealed the extent of services that
various programs offer and indicated areas needing
greater effort.

The council has long advocated a central stipend fund
to attract members of minority and socioeconomic
groups who traditionally have not considered museum
work as a career. Using the survey data, the council de-
veloped a proposal for such a fund. The proposal met
with great interest throughout the Institution, as the
council cochairs met with bureau and office directors and
other staff to seek feedback and discuss methods of ad-
ministering the fund. The Office of Museum Programs
agreed to include the stipend fund in its budget request;
approval of the request is pending.

At the end of the year the council began work on a

162

standardized application form that would be used for in-
ternships carrying stipends. Looking ahead, council mem-
bers will develop a standardized application review
process and increase their efforts to help staff identify
internship opportunities.

Smithsonian Magazine

Smithsonian, the official magazine of the Institution, has
the largest circulation of any museum-affiliated magazine
in the world. To many of its four million primary readers
and its pass-along audience of an additional three mil-
lion, it is their only experience of the Institution.

In the last year, Smithsonian magazine covered a wide
range of institutional activities both in feature stories and
in regular monthly departments. A balanced and thought-
ful treatment of India’s current problems with helping ti-
gers and humans to coexist dealt with an issue of direct
concern to the Institution. A feature on the artist Andrew
Jackson Grayson coincided with the exhibition of his
work at the National Museum of Natural History, and
an article on Alberto Giacometti coincided with an exhi-
bition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.
Zoo director Michael Robinson wrote about his work
with spiders, and Smithsonian researcher Eric Dinerstein
did an article on the Institution’s working elephants in
Nepal. Smithsonian published a major excerpt from the
new space history book by former Under Secretary Mi-
chael Collins. A cover story on the National Museum of
Natural History’s “Crossroads of Continents” exhibition
appeared in the October issue. The cutting of the world’s
second largest diamond, now on display at the National
Museum of Natural History, was a three-year process
described in detail in a Smithsonian article.

Reflecting continued interest in the issues of tropical
forest destruction, the magazine treated the World Wild-
life Fund’s minimum critical habitat project in Brazil, as
well as Janis Carter’s chimpanzee rehabilitation efforts in
Gambia. Other environmental stories included those on
plastic pollution in our seas, current research into the
ozone hole over Antarctica, and the attempts by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to reintroduce the red wolf in
the wild.

In the arts, the magazine did major treatments, com-
plete with gatefold illustrations, on Hieronymous Bosch
and Georgia O’Keeffe, as well as substantial stories on
Georges Braque, Paul Gauguin, and the Art Institute of
Chicago. In the performing arts, the cover story on the
Dance Theater of Harlem was notable.

History, of course, was part of the main menu of every
issue, with stories on such subjects as Henry Christophe
of Haiti, the East India Company and the Great Blizzard
of ’88. Especially memorable was a feature on what hap-
pened to one Newfoundland regiment during the Battle
of the Somme in World War I. The magazine continued
its coverage of the Constitution with a stimulating article
speculating on what would have happened to the United
States if that document had not been ratified.

The sciences were represented with stories on Kenya’s
center of research on destructive insects, the Marine Bio-
logical Laboratory at Woods Hole, current research into
lightning, and the cause of headaches. On the business
side, the magazine enioyed a successful year, on a par
with 1987. The first half was especially strong in advertis-
ing, while the last half was weaker than the previous
year. Circulation was stable.

During 1988 a promising new plan of integrating infor-
mation about membership services and products was con-
ceived and funded by the Institution. This plan, known
as the Smithsonian data base or master file, will collate,
organize, and standardize names and addresses of Smith-
sonian Associates as they take advantage of services pro-
vided by various divisions of the Smithsonian.
Smithsonian Project
Discovery

Smithsonian Project Discovery (formerly the University of
the Air) was established in 1986 by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and television producer Adrian Malone to create a
new, integrated, multimedia curriculum on the history of
ideas of the twentieth century. The goal of Smithsonian
Project Discovery is to have a positive influence on the
quality of U.S. education by integrating high-caliber
broadcast television dramas and documentaries, books,
and interactive, multimedia computer programs and
videodiscs.

The Project’s television programs will dramatize the
lives of twentieth-century intellectual and cultural leaders
and link those lives by documentary series hosted by the
great teachers of our time. Together, the dramas and
documentaries will offer viewers the best attributes of
each: people, dramatic and vital, and ideas brought to
life by artifacts, place, and time. Smithsonian Project Dis-
covery will use books, learning guides, and the latest
technology—interactive videodiscs—to encourage each
student to take his or her own path. Students will be able
to experience the excitement of discovery, the drama of
human stories, the context of time and place, and that
old-fashioned aim of classical education—synthesis.

By 1991 Smithsonian Project Discovery intends to have
completed four dramas (on Albert Einstein, Werner Hei-
senberg, Nadia Boulanger, and John Maynard Keynes),
one eight-part documentary series, and accompanying
computer programs, videodiscs, and books.

Smithsonian Project Discovery has established coopera-
tive relationships with Apple Computer, to complete the
prototype interactive multimedia disc, and with The Dis-
covery Channel, to produce and present the television
component on cable, followed by broadcasts on Ameri-
can public television and abroad. The Project is also
working with other offices at the Smithsonian, including
the Resident Associate Program and Smithsonian Institu-
tion Press.

“Smithsonian World”

As the year ended, “Smithsonian World,” the prime-time
Emmy Award-winning television series coproduced for
the Public Broadcasting Service by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., entered its
fourth season with a growing audience, substantial un-
derwriting, and strong critical acclaim. More than four-
teen million viewers watch each program of “Smithsonian
World,” including repeat telecasts, with audiences for the
repeats sometimes outnumbering those who tuned in for
the original programs.

“Smithsonian World’s” fourth season is funded in part
by the series’ original supporter, the James S. McDonnell
Foundation. The series also welcomed its first corporate
sponsor, the Southwestern Bell Corporation, as the sole
corporate underwriter for the season’s five new pro-
grams, together with five encore programs from earlier
seasons.

The following new programs were produced during
1988 for the coming season:

@ “The Living Smithsonian,” which celebrates the peo-
ple committed to creating a center for exploring the past
in order to understand the future (air date: October 24,
1988)

@ “American Dream at Groton,” an examination of
one of the diverse ways of learning in a multicultural
society (air date: November 21, 1988)

@ “The Way We Wear,” a look at the impact of fash-
ion on society and the impact of society on fashion, lean-
ing heavily on the backdrop of history (air date:
December 26, 1988)

@ “Web of Life,” which is based on the National Mu-
seum of American History’s “Search for Life” exhibition
on genetics and examines the quest to understand and
control the genetic basis of life on earth (air date: Janu-
ary 25, 1989)

@ “The Vever Affair,” a look at the Smithsonian’s
magnificent Henri Vever collection of Persian and Indian
paintings from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries
and at the intriguing tale behind its acquisition. Secretary
Adams calls the Vever Collection “perhaps the most im-

Visitor Information and
Associates’ Reception Center

The Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Cen-
ter (VIARC) operates Institution-wide information and
assistance programs for the public, Associate members,
staff, volunteers, and interns. VIARC volunteers and
staff provide a wide range of services seven days a week,
including staffing museum information desks, answering
public inquiry telephone lines, providing daily informa-
tion on the Dial-a-Museum and Dial-a-Phenomenon re-
cordings, and responding to written inquiries from the
public. VIARC also operates mobile outdoor information
units during the summer months and conducts behind-
the-scenes tours of the Smithsonian Castle building.

Other support services include recruitment and place-
ment of volunteers behind the scenes, registration and
orientation of interns, and operation of an outreach pro-
gram to promote membership and previsit education.
The center also administers the Institution’s exterior
graphic information system.

Renovation, construction, and program activities for
the new Smithsonian Information Center in the Castle
went into full swing in 1988. The project is on schedule
for the anticipated July 1989 opening date.

The Commission of Fine Arts approved the design con-
cept and materials for the Institution’s Exterior Graphic
Information System, and the National Capital Planning
Commission has given its endorsement. Work on one as-
pect of this project—updating and refurbishing the gen-
eral information directories on the Mall—was initiated
this year in cooperation with the National Park Service.

Since the opening of the National Museum of African
Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the S. Dillon
Ripley Center, museum information desk services have
expanded substantially. To staff the sixty-two daily as-
signments at sixteen desks in eleven buildings, the volun-
teer information specialist ranks swelled to 534. The
overall minority participation in this program rose to
13.8 percent.

The Telephone Information Service handled more than
430,000 calls during the year. Annual events such as the
Resident Associates Kite Festival, the Washington Craft
Show, and the open house at the Paul E. Garber Preser-
vation, Restoration, and Storage Facility all resulted in
thousand-call days. The popular Dial-a-Phenomenon re-
cording on short-lived celestial events attracted 47,000
interested callers. Special recorded information was also
provided to highlight Smithsonian activities during Black
History Month, Women’s History Week, Asian-Pacific
American Heritage Week, and Hispanic American Heri-
tage Week.

VIARC’s Public Inquiry Mail Service received and

of-doors visitor assistance program sponsored by the Visitor
Information and Associates’ Reception Center.

processed some 55,000 pieces of general information and
research mail during 1988. The service also packaged and
mailed more than 4,700 information packets to indivi-
duals responding to the Institution’s efforts to expand its
minority constituency.

The pylons used outdoors during summer months to
orient and inform visitors of extended summer museum
hours were redesigned and enthusiastically received by
the public. Mobile information carts made more than
120,000 information leaflets available to visitors on the
Mall. Through SI Shutterbugs, a pilot program, volun-
teers helped visitors record their trip to the Smithsonian
by taking group photos using the visitors’ cameras.

Year-round, some 1,088 volunteers were active behind
the scenes at the Smithsonian. Four hundred thirty-seven
volunteers provided short-term assistance on special pro-
jects. The translation services group expanded to sixty
participants who have capabilities in thirty-eight lan-
guages. In all, volunteers translated 167 documents for
Smithsonian departments and divisions.

VIARC’s Information Resources Division oversaw the
development, production, and review of a range of
printed materials, including internal reference sources

165
and, jointly with the Office of Public Affairs, visitor-ori-
ented publications prepared by individual museums and
program offices. More than seventy printed pieces were
completed, including the principal public information
brochure for the Quadrangle complex.

Results of the center’s annual Institution-wide volun-
teer survey indicated that 5,763 volunteers contributed
485,084 hours of service during 1988.

James Smithson Society

The James Smithson Society was founded in 1977 as the
highest level of the Contributing Membership of the
Smithsonian National Associate Program. Since then, the
society has granted more than $2.3 million in support of
Smithsonian projects and acquisitions.

The Smithson Society’s annual meeting was held on
September 23-24 in conjunction with the fall meeting of
the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates. At a
formal dinner at the National Museum of American His-
tory on Friday, September 23, Secretary Adams welcomed
the group, and Charles D. Dickey, Jr., chairman of the
National Board, announced the projects receiving 1988
Smithson Society grants.

In 1988, through the contributions of Smithson Society
Annual Members, the society made awards totaling
$344,700 to support the following projects.

National Museum of American Art: To mount the ex-
hibition, “The Art of Paul Manship (1885-1966)” and, in
conjunction with the National Portrait Gallery, acquisi-
tion of a Wild stereomicroscope.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: Purchase of
a pair of 35-millimeter projectors.

National Museum of American History: Acquisition of
six Audubon engravings, publication of three catalogues

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory: Updating and
conversion of the film, Mirror on the Universe: The
MMT Story, and funds to conduct a two-week summer
institute for high school astronomy teachers.

National Board of the
Smithsonian Associates

The National Board of the Smithsonian Associates was
established to bring the Institution into closer association
with corporate, professional, community, and cultural
leaders from throughout the country. The Institution
looks to guidance from the National Board in stimulating
appropriate forms of cooperation among these sectors
and for assistance with regional Smithsonian activities,
educational services, and private support for these and
other programs.

At their spring meeting in Philadelphia, members heard
from Secretary Adams about significant developments at
the Institution. Afterward, the board took advantage of
the opportunity provided by chairman Charles D.
Dickey, Jr., to visit museums and participate in other
cultural activities in the Philadelphia area. The eleven
new members elected to the board were W. J. “Jack”
Bowen, Houston, Texas; Dan W. Burns, Los Angeles,
California; James H. Evans, New York City; Peter E.
Haas, San Francisco, California; Frank W. Hoch, New
York City; Robert Van Cleef Lindsay, New York City;
Antony Merck, South Carolina; Anne Murray Morgan,
Worcester, Massachusetts; Thomas J. Pritzker, Chicago,
Illinois; Lloyd G. Schermer, Davenport, Iowa; and A.
Alfred Taubman, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

The board’s autumn meeting was held, as usual, in
Washington, D.C. At the Friday, September 23, session,
members and spouses heard Joseph Bonsignore, publisher
of Smithsonian magazine, and Adrian Malone, chairman
of the Smithsonian Communications Council, describe
their respective areas of responsibility. The annual Na-
tional Board—Smithson Society dinner was held at the
National Museum of American History that evening. On
Saturday, September 24, Secretary Adams discussed cur-
rent issues at the Smithsonian. Mrs. Gay Wray was
elected unanimously to succeed Mr. Dickey as chairman
of the National Board.

Office of Membership and
Development

The Office of Membership and Development (OMD) car-
ries out fund-raising activities in support of Institution-
wide priorities and assists individual bureaus in their
development projects. A major focus in 1988 was the re-
organization of the office in response to the continuing
decentralization of development functions at the Smith-
sonian. As development offices were established at the
National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum
of Natural History, and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
and Freer Gallery of Art, some members of the central
office staff took on additional duties oriented toward the
broader needs of the Institution. This larger, more dis-
persed network of development activity requires greater
planning and coordination. To this end, the OMD of-
fered a series of development workshops to staff in other
Smithsonian offices and bureaus.

In October 1987 James McK. Symington retired as di-
rector of membership and development. During his eleven
years of Smithsonian service, he led the office as it grew,
in response to expanding funding needs, from seven staff
members to twenty-one. Deputy director E. Jeffrey Stann
acted as director during most of the year. In September,
Thomas McCance, Jr., joined the Institution as deputy
assistant secretary for external affairs/director of mem-
bership and development after eight years as managing
director of the Yale Alumni Fund at Yale University.

The OMD staff began refocusing its energies on a
number of Institution-wide fund-raising activities, with
an an emphasis on individual donors and planned giving.
Two development officers began building a program that
is expected to produce considerable results for the Institu-
tion and for individual bureaus in the future.

The National Museum of African Art’s acquisitions
funds received a major gift from the Annie L. Aitken
Trust early in the year; the Brown Foundation under-
wrote a major acquisition by the Archives of American
Art; and the Enid and Kemper Crosby Foundation con-
tinued its support of acquisitions at the National Mu-
seum of American Art.

Several exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery
were made possible through corporate and foundation
gifts. The law firm of Morgan, Lewis, and Bockius will
provide partial support for “Distinguished Jurists” and
has taken the lead in identifying cosponsors, including
the firm of Vinson and Elkins. An exhibition of the work
of Winold Reiss will be made possible through the gener-
osity of the Burlington Northern Foundation and the An-
schutz Foundation. “Then and Now,” the gallery’s first
overseas exhibition, was made possible by Bay Apparel
Limited (Hong Kong), American Express, and with in-

169
kind support from Emery Worldwide and All Nippon
Airways. Thanks to the Nihon Zooki Seiyaku K.K. of
Osaka, the exhibition catalogue was printed in Japanese.

The Cooper-Hewitt Museum announced an agreement
with the Comité Colbert of Paris to sponsor a major his-
torical look at French decorative arts. The museum was
also able to offer extended hours through the support of
Mobil Oil Corporation. Another major gift was made by
the Jacob and Charlotte Lehrman Foundation to the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, which has
named the reflecting pool in honor of Mr. and Mrs.
Lehrman.

In the public service area, “The Buried Mirror,” a tele-
vision series planned as the cornerstone of the Institu-
tion’s observance of the Columbus Quincentenary,
moved forward with promises of underwriting from a
consortium of Spanish and Mexican interests. Brother In-
ternational, in honor of its thirty-fifth anniversary in this
country, has agreed to sponsor a curriculum kit for high
schools based on Smithsonian collections; the kit is ex-
pected to be the first of a series. The Gannett Foundation
continued its support of the symposia on the bicentennial
of the Constitution organized by the Office of Interdisci-
plinary Studies. The Clark-Winchcole Foundation sup-
ported a second year of curriculum development for the
Smithsonian Child Care Center.

The National Museum of American History and the
National Air and Space Museum have continued work to
fund their respective exhibitions about computers and the
information age. New supporters include AT&T, NCR,
Hitachi, and Computervision corporations. At the Na-
tional Air and Space Museum, the Alfred M. Sloan Foun-
dation completed funding of a videohistory on science in
national life. The National Museum of American History
received a commitment from the National Cosmetology
Association to sponsor an exhibition about clothing and
sexual stereotypes.

Another aspect of American culture is being treated in
an exhibition about baseball, “Diamonds Are Forever,”
thanks to the assistance of American Express; this project
is being organized by the Smithsonian Institution Travel-
ing Exhibition Service. The Smithsonian Museum Shops
were pleased to accept a gift from the Island Pacific Sys-
tems Corporation.

The Smithsonian was grateful for the interest of the
Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation in supporting
an extensive examination of a possible experimental gal-
lery at the Smithsonian. The Rockefeller Foundation has
also provided funding for investigating experimental ex-
hibitions about minority and non-Western cultures. The

170

J. N. Pew, Jr., Charitable Trust made possible the con-
tinuation of the Wildlife Conservation and Management
Training Program at the National Zoological Park.

Among the bequests to the Institution, Joseph Hirsh-
horn’s long-term generosity continued in the form of a
major gift from his estate and another from the Holenia
Trust Fund to the museum bearing his name. The Smith-
sonian was also grateful to receive a major bequest from
Charles H. Ettl.

The Smithsonian was fortunate in having two interna-
tional representatives to help in global activities this year.
In Japan, Mrs. Hanako Matano provided coordination
and support for the National Portrait Gallery’s “Then
and Now” exhibition. In Paris, Sir Valentine Abdy’s
long-term efforts with the Comité Colbert came to frui-
tion for the Cooper-Hewitt. A third representative, Luis
Gomez-Acebo, the Duke of Badajoz, has agreed to assist
the Institution’s efforts in Spain, thus extending the Insti-
tution’s reach to that important country as planning con-
tinues for the Quincentenary.

Office of Special Events

Mrs. S. Dillon Ripley acknowledges the dedication of the new
Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, opened May 25, 1988, in
honor of her more than twenty years of service to the Smith-
sonian.

Special events are essential for developing and maintain-
ing important constituencies. As the principal office re-
sponsible for organizing Institution-wide events and
programs, the Office of Special Events coordinated sev-
eral hundred activities in 1988. These included the dedi-
cation of the Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, the
celebration of Lady Bird Johnson’s seventy-fifth birthday,
the fifth anniversary celebration of the Museum Support
Center, the Institution’s first annual garden party for
members of Congress in the Enid A. Haupt Garden, and
several receptions in the International Gallery exhibition,
“Tropical Rainforests: A Disappearing Treasure,” to in-
form special groups of the plight of the world’s rainfor-
ests. In addition to such events, the office handled more
than 1,000 requests from outside organizations seeking to
use Smithsonian facilities.

Smithsonian National
Associate Program

Serving more than two million members, the Smithsonian
National Associate Program offers innovative educational
opportunities throughout the nation, expanding the
boundaries of the Institution to encompass all fifty states.
The program’s far-flung membership is kept abreast of
the Institution’s activities through Smithsonian magazine.
In cooperation with other Smithsonian bureaus, the pro-
gram has organized a diverse range of activities for mem-
bers. As a result, the program has, since its beginning in
1970, fostered a strong national constituency for the
Smithsonian’s work.

A sampling of the activities and accomplishments of
the program’s four units follows.

Contributing Membership Program

The Contributing Membership of the National Associate
Program, established in 1976, provides unrestricted and
restricted funds to support Smithsonian research, educa-
tion, and outreach programs. This financial support is a
combination of annual membership dues and corporate
matching funds, plus the Contributing Members’ gener-
ous response to special fund-raising appeals for specific
Smithsonian projects or the Institution’s ongoing work.

Members may participate at six levels: Supporting
($60; available only to members who live outside the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area); Donor ($125);
Sponsoring ($300); Sustaining ($600); Patron ($1,200);
and the James Smithson Society ($2,000).

The Contributing Membership Program continues to
grow steadily, numbering 47,400 households in 1988, or
6 percent more than in 1987. Ninety percent of these
members reside outside the Washington, D.C., metropol-
itan area. Total membership income also continues to
increase: this year’s $2.85 million in net unrestricted gain
to the Institution topped the 1987 unrestricted net by 13
percent.

The Institution expresses its appreciation to Contribut-
ing Members through a variety of benefits and special
programs. In 1988, members were invited to attend eight
exhibition previews and receptions at a variety of Smith-
sonian museums. Among the other special events held for
Contributing Members were an evening hosted by
Thomas E. Lovejoy, Assistant Secretary for External Af-
fairs, at the exhibition, “Tropical Rainforests: A Disap-
pearing Treasure,” and a private tour for James Smithson
Society members of the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Res-
toration, and Storage Facility. Contributing Members
also received several complimentary publications in 1988,

penguins. (Photograph by John Tveten)

including A New View from the Castle, People of the
Tropical Rainforest, and the Smithsonian Engagement
Calendar.

Contributing Members in the Washington, D.C., met-
ropolitan area are enrolled automatically in the Resident
Associate Program (RAP). Members outside Washington
receive Smithsonian Research Reports, published three
times a year by the Office of Public Affairs to highlight
special research and educational projects throughout the
Institution.

Twice during 1988, members participated in “Smith-
sonian Treasures,” an exclusive, behind-the-scenes visit

172

to the Institution. The highly popular five-day tour is
planned by the Associates Travel Program, which also
coordinated the first international study tour exclusively
for Contributing Members, “Voyage to Hudson Bay,
Greenland, and Iceland.” Accompanying members on the
voyage were Smithsonian scholars, including Dr. Robert
Hoffmann, Assistant Secretary for Research, who lec-
tured on the polar Ice Age, the cycle of Arctic seasons,
and current Smithsonian research priorities. Other bene-
fits are offered in conjunction with the Lecture and Semi-
nar Program, which organizes educational activities in
communities nationwide and abroad. Contributing Mem-
bers are offered priority registration, complimentary tick-
ets to one lecture, and often an invitation to an informal
reception following the lecture.

Research Expedition Program

The Smithsonian Research Expedition Program was initi-
ated to enthusiastic response in 1988 as another impor-
tant benefit of National Associate membership. Through
this program, Associate members volunteer their financial
support and their labor to participate in two-week field
experiences led by Smithsonian scientists or curators.

The purpose of the program is twofold: to offer Asso-
ciates the opportunity to become personally involved
with the Institution by working closely with Smithsonian
professionals, and to provide Smithsonian scientists with
an additional source of field assistance and funding for
their research projects.

This year sixty-four Associates participated in five re-
search expeditions in Costa Rica, Colorado, Idaho, and
Washington, D.C. Topics included volcanology, botany,
archaeology, oral history, and archival processing. The
program is expected to expand in coming years.

Lecture and Seminar Program

The Lecture and Seminar Program, now in its thirteenth
year, highlights the research and collections of the Smith-
sonian for National Associate members and the general
public nationwide. Under the program’s auspices, Smith-
sonian curators, scientists, and research associates pres-
ent lectures, seminars, and hands-on workshops in
approximately twenty U.S. cities each year.

During the past year, the Lecture and Seminar Program
visited for the first time Billings and Helena, Montana;
Tacoma, Washington; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Wichita,

Kansas; Huntsville, Alabama; New Paltz, New York;
and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Following successful events
in previous years, the program returned to Missoula and
Bozeman, Montana; Seattle, Washington; Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota; Honolulu, Hawaii; Tampa, St.
Petersburg, and Sarasota, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and
Santa Barbara and San Diego, California. The mayors of
Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Boone, North Carolina, is-
sued proclamations honoring the Smithsonian visits to
their communities. The Smithsonian also received the key
to the City of Hattiesburg.

The success of activities organized by the Lecture and
Seminar Program depends in part on collaboration with
local and national organizations. During 1988, the pro-
gram worked in tandem with 120 local organizations
throughout the country, including museums, universities,
zoological parks, and botanical gardens. National organi-
zations that cosponsored Smithsonian events were United
Airlines, the National Trust for Historic Preservation,
Sigma Xi—The Scientific Research Society, EAA Avia-
tion Foundation, and the World Wildlife Fund—U.S.

Thirty-two new programs were developed this year.
Among these were “Computers in Aerospace,” taught by
Paul Ceruzzi of the National Air and Space Museum;
“African Art at the Smithsonian,” taught by Roslyn
Walker of the National Museum of African Art; “Splen-
dors of Asian Art,” taught by Patrick Sears of the Arthur
M. Sackler Gallery; and “Meteorites and the Origin of
the Solar System,” taught by Glenn MacPherson of the
National Museum of Natural History.

The Lecture and Seminar Program also offers week-
long seminars in Washington, D.C., which enable Associ-
ates from across the country to study with Smithsonian
curators during lectures and special behind-the-scenes
tours. Nine Washington seminars were held during the
past year, including “African Art at the Smithsonian,”
“Splendors of Asian Art,” and “Adventures in Archae-
ology: Caesarea on the Sea.”

The Lecture and Seminar Program enjoyed continued
success with its week-long residential seminars, held at
Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina;
in Vail, Colorado; at the University of Southern Missis-
sippi in Hattiesburg; and at Mohonk Mountain House in
New Paltz, New York. Among these seminars were “The
Art and Craft of Creative Writing,” “Salute to American
Popular Song and Jazz,” “Exploring the Heavens and the
Earth: Past and Present,” and “Creative Photography.”

The Lecture and Seminar Program presented two inter-
national series during 1988: a six-day series in Melbourne
and Sydney, Australia, in celebration of Australia’s Bicen-

Program survey the archaeological discoveries of Caesarea dur-
ing the special viewing of “King Herod’s Dream: Caesarea on
the Sea,” at the National Museum of Natural History on March

tennial and a six-day lecture program in five cities in
Denmark. Continuing the program’s strong ties to Japan,
ten Japanese high school and junior high school students
visited the Smithsonian in the summer of 1988 under the
auspices of MYC Cultural Exchange Institute. During
their visit, the Japanese Minister of Education officially
praised the bond that has been established and encour-
aged continued development through these Summer Edu-
cational Enrichment Programs.

Associates Travel Program

The Associates Travel Program organizes educational
tours that mirror the many and varied interests of the
Institution. In 1988, more than 7,000 National Associates
participated in 142 foreign and domestic tours. Since the
program’s inception in 1975, more than 80,000 Associates
have embarked on these journeys. The educational value
of each outing is enhanced by carefully chosen study
leaders. One or more Smithsonian staff members also ac-
company each trip.

Foreign Study Tours span the globe, offering a wide
variety of destinations and many unique learning experi-
ences. For example, a tour focusing on the wildlife and
national parks of Argentina was one of the new program
offerings in 1988. Also introduced was a tour of Indone-
sia, where Associates met with craftspeople, performers,

173
and political leaders, and a tour of Nepal, Ladakh, and
Bhutan, with emphasis on history, culture, traditional
crafts, and religious festivals.

Associates also retraced historic sea routes and learned
about early explorations as they sailed on the four-
masted barque Sea Cloud in the southern Caribbean. On
their journey, Associates traveled from Costa Rica to the
San Blas Islands, Cartagena, and on to Curagao. They
enjoyed the lectures of historian and anthropologist An-
thony Maingot and author James A. Michener, who is
writing a book on southern Caribbean history. On an-
other study voyage, participants traveled on the cruise
ship Argonaut around Italy and Sicily, from Venice to
Genoa. The tour featured lectures on the region’s cultural
history, art, and architecture.

On other study cruises, Associates explored history and
modern-day political and social concerns while traveling
on the Volga River. During a cruise along the coast of
Europe from England to Portugal, they learned about art
and literature. A trip from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, around
Cape Horn, and to Santiago, Chile, examined the history
and current politics of Latin America.

Among the thirteen tours offered in China were the
popular “China by Train,” “Decorative Arts and An-
tiques in China,” and “Hiking China’s Sacred Peaks.” As-
sociates also explored Tibet on a tour that included an
overland trip to Nepal. Other travelers flew to Moscow,
traveled to Tashkent and Samarkand in Central Asia,
and then crossed the recently opened Soviet border region
from Kazakhstan into China’s Xinjiang Autonomous Re-
gion. They continued tracing the Silk Road to Kashgar,
Dunhuang, and Xian, before reaching Beijing.

Countryside programs in 1988 provided the opportu-
nity to live in small towns in The Netherlands, Hungary,
England, Wales, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, or France.
Residential seminars included programs on history and
art in Florence; on decorative arts, literature, and culture
at Trinity College in Dublin; and on ancient history in
Cairo. At the tenth annual Oxford/Smithsonian Seminar,
Associates could choose from a variety of specially de-
signed courses in the arts and sciences.

The fifty Domestic Study Tours offered in 1988 ena-
bled Associates to experience the natural wonders and
regional heritage of America. Three domestic cruises
were new; the fourth—on the popular Delta Queen—was
offered for the fifth time in four years. Gardens and his-
toric homes were featured on a cruise from New Orleans
to Campobello, Maine. Marc Pachter, chief historian at
the National Portrait Gallery, accompanied Associates on
a summer cruise in New England. His lectures on the

174

history of America’s resorts developed interest in stops at
Provincetown, Nantucket, Woods Hole, and Newport.
Associates learned about the importance of the Sacra-
mento River from Gold Rush days to the presen: on a
cruise through the waterways of the California Delta.

The “sojourn” programs offered participants the op-
portunity to spend a week in one city to explore all as-
pects of the area with guest lecturers and on field trips. In
addition to programs in San Francisco and Tucson, a
new program to Santa Fe, featuring Pueblo Indian cul-
ture, was designed as a sequel to another study tour of
Spanish art and culture in the Southwest.

Associates also had a wide variety of outdoor des ‘ \a-
tions from which to choose in 1988. Popular hiking pro-
grams were planned to Hawaii, Alaska, and New
Hampshire. Associates camped in Idaho on a Salmon
River rafting trip and floated through the Grand Canyon
on a Colorado River adventure. Study leaders lectured on
the geology and natural history of these wilderness areas.
Coral reefs, tropical fish, and other marine life were the
focus of a week-long study tour in the Florida Keys at
Seacamp on Big Pine Key. These active outdoor pro-
grams help to increase understanding and appreciation
for conservation of our natural resources.

Special weekend programs at the Institution—including
the sixteenth annual “Christmas at the Smithsonian Week-
end”—were planned not only for National Associates, but
also for Contributing Members and National Air and
Space Associates. In addition, Associates participated in
the “Washington Anytime Weekend,” organized in coop-
eration with the Visitor Information and Associates’ Re-
ception Center. The program includes a behind-the-scenes
tour of the Castle and offers guidance and information to™|
visiting Associates.

Smithsonian Resident
Associate Program

As an important link between the Smithsonian Institution
and the metropolitan Washington community, the Smith-
sonian Resident Associate Program (RAP) engages area
residents\in the life of the Smithsonian. During 1988—its
first full year of presenting programs in the S. Dillon
Ripley Center—RAP offered nearly 2,000 innovative,
high-quality, and timely activities for more than 296,700
adults and young people. RAP programs and activities
enhance and complement the Institution’s collections, ex-
hibitions, and research while upholding the Smithsonian’s
role as the national museum complex. A privately sup-
ported continuing education, membership, and public
outreuth arm of the Smithsonian, RAP is a model for
museum and university programs around the world.

The year 1988 was a time of growth for the program.
With the help of a direct-mail marketing campaign and
successful programming, more than 16,000 new member-
ships were achieved, a record number for RAP. Registra-
tion for adult courses grew, too, showing an increase of
more than 20 percent over last year. The total RAP mem-
bership (including Contributing Members) exceeded
64,800 households, up from 60,000 in 1987. In 1988 the
preliminary work was completed and the contract
awarded for the long-anticipated integrated registration
and membership software, which will be in operation in
fiscal year 1989.

Attending the premiere gala of The Last Emperor, with recep-
tion at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and screening at the Na-
tional Air and Space Museum’s Langley Theater, were Xu
Jiaxian, cultural counsellor, Embassy of the People’s Republic
of China, Mrs. Han, His Excellency Han Zu, ambassador of
the People’s Republic of China, director Bernardo Bertolucci,
and film stars Joan Chen and John Lone.

In an effort to reach new constituencies, the Resident
Associate Program, with the support of the Institution,
established a Development Office in March. The office
will spearhead expanded outreach efforts in an effort to
build new audiences and attract new members from
Washington’s minority communities.

RAP received an award for creative and innovative
programming from the National University Continuing
Education Association for the course, “The Best of The
New Yorker,” which featured some of the magazine’s
best-known writers and artists. RAP was also honored by
the National Association of Government Communicators
with a Blue Pencil award for its informational brochure.

The year was marked by the successful sale of the
RAP-commissioned, limited-edition silkscreen, In Cele-
bration, by Washington artist Sam Gilliam. The print cel-
ebrated the September opening of the Smithsonian’s new
museum complex and generated support for Discover
Graphics, RAP’s free printmaking project for area public
high school students and their teachers. Last summer,
RAP commissioned Washington artist Willem de Looper
to create a limited-edition serigraph—his first print—
Tunis on My Mind. Proceeds from the sale of the print
will also benefit Discover Graphics.

Volunteers

More than 400 volunteers gave approximately 25,000
hours of invaluable assistance to the Resident Associate
Program by monitoring activities and performing vital of-
fice tasks. They were recognized at a spring luncheon for
office volunteers and at an awards reception held in the
Arts and Industries Building Rotunda in September.

Cooperation within the Smithsonian

During 1988, RAP continued to draw on the rich re-
sources of Smithsonian museums to create programs and
activities that span the arts, history, and science. A sam-
pling of this collaboration includes the four-part chamber
music series cosponsored with the National Museum of
American History; the 2oth-Century Consort music series
cosponsored with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden; and a concert and lecture offered to complement
the Hirshhorn exhibition “Russian and Soviet Paintings:
1900-1930.” With the National Air and Space Museum,
the program presented Soviet space scientist Roald Sag-
deyev in a lecture about the Soviet mission to Mars. And

175
“Crossroads of Continents,” the first jointly curated So-
viet-North American exhibition, was the focus of an all-
day seminar, cosponsored with the National Museum of
Natural History and featuring Soviet, American, and Ca-
nadian anthropologists and ethnographers. RAP also or-
ganized a ten-session course, “South Africa Today: Life
in a Divided Society,” which featured South African lead-
ers and scholars. This course was cosponsored by RAP,
the National Museum of Natural History, the Smithson-
ian Office of Folklife Programs, the Smithsonian Educa-
tional Outreach Program, and Howard University.
Other Smithsonian-oriented programs for adults and
children that showcased museum exhibitions included
“The Chinese Scholar’s Studio,” with the Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, and “Visions of Paradise: Travels in the
Tropical Rainforest,” in cooperation with the Smithson-
ian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. In addition,
the Museum Shops regularly sponsored parties for RAP
members and book-signing receptions following lectures.

Outreach

Through scholarships and special projects, RAP actively
seeks to involve wider audiences—from inner-city young
people to single adults—in its programs. The annual Dis-
cover Graphics program, for example, provides free etch-
ing and lithography training on Smithsonian presses for
nearly two hundred talented area public high school stu-
dents and their art teachers. The culmination of the pro-
gram is a juried exhibition of student prints held at the
National Museum of American History. The Gene Davis
Printmaking Studio, the program’s home in the Arts and
Industries Building, also serves as a printmaking and
bookbinding complex for Smithsonian members and
staff.

In 1988 seventy young people and 299 adults from the
inner city were awarded scholarships to Young Associates
and adult courses through the District of Columbia pub-
lic school system. Under the auspices of the Smithsonian
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education’s Career
Awareness Program, eighteen inner-city young people
served as teacher assistants for Young Associate Summer
Camp.

Now in its sixth year, RAP’s weekly lecture series,
Tuesday Mornings at the Smithsonian, is designed to ap-
peal primarily to the area’s large population of retired
adults, who are able to participate in daytime activities.
Leading Smithsonian scholars presented thirty lectures to
7,300 people in 1988 on a wide range of topics.

176

Singles Evenings, the widely publicized and emulated
series featuring lectures by Smithsonian scholars followed
by champagne and hors d’oeuvre receptions, was pre-
sented this year at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden, the Grand Salon of the Renwick Gallery, and
the S. Dillon Ripley Center. Each of the programs, at-
tended equally by men and women, attracted capacity
registration, with a total of 4,100 participants.

Outside Collaboration

RAP cosponsored its fifteenth annual lecture series with
the Audubon Naturalist Society of the Central Atlantic
States and the Friends of the National Zoo, attracting
7,800 people. Throughout the year, RAP collaborated
with other organizations to produce lectures, seminars,
films, concerts, and courses for adults and young people.
These organizations included the National Geographic
Society, National Gallery of Art, Filmfest D.C., Meridian
House International, World Wildlife Fund, National Aer-
onautics and Space Administration, Council for the Ad-
vancement and Support of Education, Baltimore-D.C.
Institute for Psychoanalysis, Washington Post, Washing-
ton Project for the Arts, George Washington University,
Levine School of Music, and major museums in New
York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. New collaborations
were initiated to produce adult courses with the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science and the
Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill. New collaborations with
publishers, particularly Harry N. Abrams and Double-
day, have resulted in outstanding programs, including re-
ceptions and book signings, with writers Allen Ginsberg,
Chinua Achebe, Isaac Asimov, John Kenneth Galbraith,
and Reinaldo Arenas.

In February RAP organized and produced its second
annual seminar in collaboration with the National Uni-
versity Continuing Education Association, “Gorbachev’s
Initiatives: Implications for Our Time.” Forty deans from
major universities throughout the United States attended.
The seminar featured lectures by eminent scholars; din-
ners, luncheons, and receptions at the Soviet, Finnish,
Dutch, Czech, and Yugoslavian embassies; meetings at the
Hillwood Museum and Intelsat headquarters; and visits
to exhibits on early Soviet aviation and the Apollo-Soyuz
space mission at the National Air and Space Museum.

Foreign embassies that have collaborated with the Resi-
dent Associate Program include the Embassy of Canada
for a film series, concert, and course; the British Embassy

for an adults’ and children’s tour of the ambassador’s res-
idence; and the embassies of Australia, Czechoslovakia,
Finland, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Yugo-
slavia, Israel, and Mexico for courses, all-day seminars,
films, and concerts.

Courses

RAP’s Smithsonian Campus on the Mall is the center of
continuing education at the Institution, offering six- to
eight-week lecture series and intensive weekend courses
on topics ranging from interior design to the natural sci-
ences. In four terms during 1988, the program provided
more than 200 lecture courses and attracted approxi-
mately 10,000 students. With the goal of building a cur-
riculum that gives participants both continuity and
guidance, RAP launched a new certificate program, a
seven-course series in Western civilization to be given
over one and one-half years. Three of the seven courses—
on ancient Greece, Rome, and the Middle Ages—were
offered in 1988 to capacity audiences. Other certificate
programs are planned for the near future.

Among the year’s most well-received new courses were
several that represented creative partnerships with the
business and scientific communities. With the Washing-
ton Post, RAP presented a course on “Inside the Wash-
ington Post.” “New Frontiers of Science: Discoveries
That Could Change Our Lives” was organized in cooper-
ation with the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science.

Studio Arts

Two hundred fifty-seven studio arts courses and work-
shops were presented in 1988, with a total attendance of
17,100. Monthly workshops feature hands-on experience
in contemporary arts and crafts and both color and
black-and-white photography in RAP’s state-of-the-art
photography laboratory. Notable among the courses,
which are offered four terms per year, were “Glazed Fin-
ishes: Marbling and Graining”; “Natural Science IIlustra-
tion,” cosponsored with the Guild of Natural Science
Illustrators; and “Papermaking.” Internationally known
instructors and lecturers included New Zealand designer
Lee Andersen, painter Jacob Lawrence, and master Japa-
nese woodblock printer Un’ichi Hiratsuka.

Actress Ellen Burstyn reads the poetry of D. H. Lawrence as
part of the Resident Associate Program’s International Poetry
Forum series.

Lectures, Seminars, and Films

Lectures, symposia, and all-day seminars featuring distin-
guished experts addressed a wide range of current topics
in the arts, the humanities, and the sciences. A total of
30,800 people attended 104 lectures during 1988; 2,000
attended 17 seminars; and attendance at 56 films was
15,400. Notable speakers included Lebanese ambassador
Abdallah R. Bouhabib, art critic Robert Hughes, science
author James Gleick, economist John Kenneth Galbraith,
former Egyptian first lady Jehan Sadat, Pulitzer Prize-
winning author and journalist David Shipler, violinist
Isaac Stern, poet Allen Ginsberg, anthropologist Mary
Catherine Bateson, physicist Paul Chu, and novelists
Chinua Achebe and Isaac Asimoy.

All-day seminars focused on such topics as biblical ar-
chaeology, a vicarious tour of Prague, new genetics
breakthroughs, creativity, Buddhism, and the current

177
concern with professional ethics in the American work-
place.

Films and film series during 1988 featured both U.S.
and Washington premieres. Series included six films from
the People’s Republic of China and a five-part premiere
series showcasing new Australian cinema. RAP hosted
the American premiere of Bernardo Bertolucci’s award-
winning The Last Emperor, with Bertolucci and actors
John Lone and Joan Chen in attendance. Soviet ambassa-
dor Yuri Dubinin introduced a screening of the Soviet
film, Repentance.

Performing Arts

In its fifth season of sponsoring ticketed performing arts
events, RAP presented 115 concerts and performances at-
tended by 32,600 people. Highlights were a dance and
music program from Mongolia to mark the opening of
the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery; appearances by Broadway
and cabaret star Eartha Kitt, French guitarist Pierre Ben-
susan, the a cappella vocal ensemble Chanticleer, and Ire-
land’s traditional music band Patrick Street; new music
from the West Coast featuring the Bobs; and the first
annual Thelonious Monk International Solo Jazz Piano
Competition.

Major series offerings included four jazz concerts,
“Round Midnight . . . and After,” assembled by jazz
expert and Smithsonian Institution Press special projects
editor Martin Williams. A new summer jazz series was
inaugurated, and the Pro Musicis Foundation series put
the spotlight on outstanding young musicians on the
threshold of important careers. A highlight of the Inter-
national Poetry Forum series, now in its fourth season,
was actress Ellen Burstyn reading D. H. Lawrence.

Study Tours

More than 18,000 people participated in 544 tours during
1988. These firsthand learning experiences in art, archi-
tecture, archaeology, history, industry, and science
ranged from overnight excursions to afternoon walking
tours, all kept small for the benefit of the participants.
Two-day trips took RAP members to Newport, Rhode
Island; Wheeling, West Virginia; New York City; and
the Hudson River Valley, New York. Tours in six states
traced battles and troop movements from the Revolution-
ary, French and Indian, and Civil wars. A series of inten-
sive rail technology and history tours, offered with the

178

cooperation of major rail corporations such as AMTRAK
and CSX, included such sites as the AMTRAK northeast
corridor computerized control center in Philadelphia and
the endangered remnants of turn-of-the-century rail yards
and equipment shops in Brunswick, Maryland. Visits to
nearby areas, led by experts, featured walking tours of
historic neighborhoods, parks, and cemeteries and be-
hind-the-scenes tours in museums. Among the most pop-
ular local tour sites were Blair House, Congressional
Cemetery, the Smithsonian Museum Support Center, and
Intelsat headquarters.

Young Associate and Family Activities

In 1988, 15,200 young people—aged four to fifteen—and
their families enjoyed workshops, classes, monthly free
films, tours, performances, family lecture programs, and
summer camp through RAP. Workshops and classes de-
signed for adults and children together continue to be
valuable learning tools. In all, there were 211 Young As-
sociate and family activities, kept small for maximum
learning. “Dinosaurs Galore and More” was the theme of
this year’s Family Halloween Party, which was held in
the National Museum of Natural History. Other annual
events are a winter film and reception in conjunction
with the Trees of Christmas display in the National Mu-
seum of American History, the summer “Evening Picnic
at the Zoo,” and a family program during Children’s
Book Week.

Discovery Theater

After a year in Baird Auditorium at the National Mu-
seum of Natural History, Discovery Theater returned to
its home in the Arts and Industries Building in April
1988. Live theater performances for young people and
their families are presented from October through June
each year. Sixty-five thousand people—about 50 percent
of whom were members of minority populations—at-
tended 215 performances during 1988. In March, Discov-
ery Theater produced Unto These Shores, a highly
praised original production about recent emigrants to the
Washington, D.C., area.
Women’s Committee of the
Smithsonian Associates

Through grants to Smithsonian museums and bureaus,
the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates
supports a wide variety of creative and practical efforts
that might not otherwise be possible—from educational
programs to scientific research equipment to the care and
restoration of objects in museum collections. Sixty-three
active members and seventy resource members contrib-
uted more than 7,000 volunteer hours to the Smithson-
ian. Net proceeds from the annual Christmas Dinner
Dance and the 1987 Washington Craft Show enabled the
committee to award forty-one grants totaling $140,210 to
sixteen museums and bureaus. Projects were supported in
amounts ranging from $700 to $9,000. The year also
marked the establishment of the Women’s Committee En-
dowment Fund with an initial contribution of $20,000.

The inherent variety of the Smithsonian Institution is
reflected in even a partial list of the projects funded by
the Women’s Committee. Awards were used to fund
workshops for elementary school teachers titled
“Weather” and “The Solar System”; scholarships for mi-
nority participants in seminars sponsored by the Smith-
sonian National Associate Lecture and Seminar Program;
a pilot education program on African art and culture for
District of Columbia high school students; the purchase
of a modern Japanese Nabeshima-ware bow] for the Ar-
thur M. Sackler Gallery; construction of acid-free boxes
to store rare American Indian language publications; es-
tablishment of an ecological buffer zone around the
Barro Colorado Nature Monument in Panama; and res-
toration and conservation of a family portrait of William
Jervis Hough, an early Regent of the Smithsonian.

The National Museum of American History received
support for an exhibit to mark Irving Berlin’s centennial
year, for research and architectural drawings of the facade
of Chicago’s Hull House, and for the restoration of the
Appleton organ. The National Zoological Park was given
funds for a transparent beehive and video monitoring
equipment for the Beaver Valley exhibit, radio tracking
equipment for a new exhibit of free-ranging golden-lion
tamarins, and seed money to establish a quantitative test-
ing program for poisonous plant compounds. The Na-
tional Museum of Natural History received support to
purchase a collection of Cretaceous decapods from the
Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, to construct an exhibit
on the Aldabra Atoll Research Project, and to purchase
specimens and tools to enable the Naturalist Center to
offer a hands-on high school anthropology program.

On May 25, 1988, the Smithsonian Institution dedi-
cated the Mary Livingston Ripley Garden in honor of the
founder of the Women’s Committee. Located between the

Arts and Industries Building and the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden, this garden has long been of spe-
cial interest to Mrs. Ripley and the Women’s Committee,
which provided initial funding for its establishment in
1975. Over the years, the committee has continued to
support the development and maintenance of the garden,
most recently with a grant for plants, signs, and an irri-
gation system.

The seventeenth annual Christmas Dinner Dance was
held in the new restaurant of the National Air and Space
Museum. An established Smithsonian tradition, this gala
evening again proved to be a tremendously successful
fund-raising event.

One hundred artist-craftspersons from thirty-three
states participated in the sixth annual Washington Craft
Show, which has been acclaimed as one of the best in the
nation. In conjunction with the April show, a preview
reception and silent auction were organized to raise funds
for the Smithsonian. In addition, the High School Craft
Competition recognized young artisans from local school
districts and offered them the opportunity to meet some
of the country’s finest craftspersons.

ADMINISTRATION

John F. Jameson, Assistant Secretary for Administration
Administrative and
Support Activities

Operating primarily behind the scenes at the Smithson-
ian, a network of administrative and technical support
offices provides services essential to the smooth function-
ing of the Institution. These offices support scholarly and
public activities and ensure central oversight of and ac-
countability for the management and use of financial,
personnel, and physical resources. Fifteen offices and
their divisions serve a range of functions, from personnel
administration to protection services, from congressional
liaison to environmental management and safety. Fund-
ing for central services in 1988 amounted to about

7 percent of the Institution’s total operating expenses, ex-
clusive of maintenance, operation, and facilities protec-
tion costs.

Office of Information Resource Management

In its continuing effort to support Smithsonian computer
users, the Office of Information Resource Management
(OIRM) opened a Help Desk that offers telephone or
walk-in assistance. The OIRM training program has ex-
panded to feature eleven courses, involving over 1,000
Smithsonian staff in more than 100 classes. Consultation
in office automation and scientific applications is also
available, and the user production area provides assis-
tance in computer mapping and graphics, document
conversion, image scanning, and optical character
recognition.

The OIRM continued to coordinate the development
of a Smithsonian information architecture. The com-
pleted architecture, consisting of integrated graphic mod-
els and supporting documentation, will describe the
Institution’s information requirements and provide a tool
for systems planning and development.

Under the OIRM Communications Management
Division, all Mall locations will soon be linked by a high-
speed integrated telecommunications system, which will
join more than 300 personal computers in a network with
the central computing facility.

Office of Protection Services

During 1988 the Office of Protection Services (OPS) was
involved in a record number of escorts for objects in
transit to and from the Smithsonian and other museums
and institutions in the United States and abroad. Close
cooperative efforts between the OPS investigative staff
and the Columbus, Georgia, police department resulted

182

in the recovery of a Smithsonian painting stolen about
twenty years ago.

In the area of occupational health services, the asbestos
monitoring program expanded to include annual physical
examinations for more than 300 staff members. The em-
ployee assistance program has grown and an additional
professional counselor has been added to the staff. Medi-
cal standards for diving scientists were refined so that
they are consistent with other academic and scientific div-
ing medical standards.

The OPS staff is completing a museum security lexi-
con, a technical vocabulary index of more than 500 terms
or concepts relating to security, fire safety, and health in
museums and cultural institutions. Produced in conjunc- \
tion with the International Council of Museums, the lexi-
con will be published in English, Spanish, French, and
German, with plans to publish later in Arabic, Russian,
Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese.

Office of Printing and Photographic Services

Filming is complete for two videodisc projects: updating
the office’s 35-millimeter slide files and adding several
small collections to the videodisc produced for the Na-
tional Museum of American History’s Division of Trans-
portation. Filming is more than half complete for the first
in a series of videodiscs of 35-millimeter black-and-white
negatives. To protect and identify the growing number of
Smithsonian videodiscs, the Office of Printing and Photo-
graphic Services (OPPS) has designed and printed a stan-
dard videodisc jacket and label.

OPPS staff is active in teaching programs inside and
outside the Institution. The office hosts a photographic
workshop for museum professionals each year and cos-
ponsors, with the White House News Photographers As-
sociation, a free one-day workshop for local high school
students.

Other Activities

The Office of Programming and Budget (OPB) continued
to implement improvements in the internal budget formu-
lation process as the result of a review of procedural
changes made in 1987. The office also expanded the use
of automation to collect data and assemble budget narra-
tives for submission to the Office of Management and
Budget and to Congress. The OPB concentrated efforts
on increasing analytical support to senior Smithsonian

managers during the 1990 fiscal year budget formulation
process. The office also issued two releases of the first
Smithsonian Institution Budget Manual and provided In-
stitution-wide training on how to write budget justifica-
tions. Detailed program and financial information is now
more easily accessible, aiding decisionmaking within the
Institution and tightening the relationship between long-
range planning and budgeting.

The Office of Personnel Administration devoted much
of the past year to consolidating and refining its imple-
mentation of the Federal Employees Retirement System,
the Immigration Reform and Control Act, the personnel
and payroll system operated by the National Finance
Center of the Department of Agriculture, and the Trust
Fund benefits program. Union contracts with both the
National Maritime Union and Local 2463 of the Ameri-
can Federation of Government Employees were automati-
cally extended.

The Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) placed re-
newed emphasis on affirmative action efforts, and the
representation of minorities and women in professional
and administrative positions continued to improve. Em-
ployment of disabled persons within the Institution also
continued to increase. OEO-sponsored activities for staff
and the public to highlight ethnic observances and ex-
pand cultural understanding received increased attention
and support throughout the Institution.

The Office of Procurement and Property Management
continues to provide logistical support and acquisition
policy guidance to the varied program areas of the Smith-
sonian. In 1988, contracting projects became more com-
plex and the total dollar value and number of requisitions
increased. OPPM continued to delegate small purchasing
authority throughout the Institution, thus eliminating the
need for processing large volumes of requisitions in small
dollar amounts. To increase the safety of visitors and
employees, contracts were awarded for the replacement
of PCB transformers, the removal of asbestos, and the
renovation and replacement of the terrace of the National
Air and Space Museum.

The Management Analysis Office (MAO) continued to
identify and promote actions to strengthen internal con-
trols. The office conducted several reviews of Institution
units and activities, including those that might reduce
costs and improve efficiency by hiring outside contractors
to perform commercial functions traditionally carried out
by Smithsonian staff. The MAO also coordinated the
placement of graduate and postgraduate students in busi-
ness administration, who worked on important manage-
ment projects at the Smithsonian Museum Shops, the

National Air and Space Museum, and the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Administration. The office pub-
lishes a biweekly employee bulletin, which covers timely
administrative matters.

The Smithsonian Institution Ombudsman, a position
established in 1977, serves as a neutral party to whom
employees may bring work-related problems or concerns
that cannot be resolved through normal channels. During
the past year more than 200 employees have sought help
for problems ranging from policy questions to pay and
personnel matters to conflicts with supervisors.

In addition to assessing the impact of proposed legisla-
tion on the Smithsonian, the Office of Congressional Li-
aison monitored several important Institution-related
initiatives during the legislative process. Bills proposing
the Smithsonian’s affiliation with the Museum of the
American Indian and the repatriation of American Indian
skeletal remains and ethnographic materials demanded
the greatest attention this year.

The Travel Services Office continued to help Smithson-
ian employees and consultants make efficient and eco-
nomical travel plans. Travel was arranged, for example,
for the Festival of American Folklife participants and for
a growing number of people involved in workshops and
symposia.

The Office of Audits and Investigations, which reports
to the Under Secretary of the Smithsonian, continued to
perform regular internal audits of both federal and trust-
funded activities. External audits involving claims, cost
proposals, and cost and pricing data related to contracts,
grants, and other financial agreements resulted in consid-
erable savings to the Institution.

In the Office of Facilities Services, highlights under the
direction of the Office of Design and Construction in-
cluded the completion of the new $15 million restaurant
at the National Air and Space Museum. Construction of
the Mathias Laboratory Wing at the Smithsonian Envi-
ronmental Research Center was also completed. Al-
though there were some delays in projects at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama be-
cause of the political situation there, construction re-
sumed on the Tupper Research and Conference Center,
and major upgrading of facilities on Barro Colorado Is-
land started. Construction also began on the visitor cen-
ter in the Smithsonian Castle Building. Freer Gallery of
Art renovations and construction on the link to the Sack-
ler Gallery were expected to begin in October 1988. The
planning phase of the multiyear, multimillion-dollar heat-
ing, ventilating, and air-conditioning rehabilitation
project at the National Museum of Natural History con-

183
tinued throughout the year. Planning also continued for
an extension to the National Air and Space Museum.
Planning was conducted in connection with the proposal
for a Museum of the American Indian on the last remain-
ing Mall site.

The Office of Plant Services continued to refine its au-
tomated financial, personnel, and program management
systems. The local area computer network has enabled
the staff to standardize and maintain forms, reports,
schedules, and maintenance data. Energy conservation ef-
forts were ongoing throughout the Institution, as the of-
fice began working more closely with utilities companies
on strategies to reduce utility consumption. Comprehen-
sive facility maintenance and repair inspections continued
during the year and included an inspection of the Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute.

The revision of the Smithsonian Handbook on Safety
and Environmental Management was one of the year’s
most important initiatives for the Office of Environmen-
tal Management and Safety (OEMS). The handbook was
rewritten to broaden its scope and its applicability to cur-
rent requirements. Following last year’s successful imple-
mentation of management evaluation/technical reviews,
the OEMS conducted twenty-two facility reviews this
year. The staff also held several important life-safety
training courses and implemented a comprehensive haz-
ardous waste disposal program at all Smithsonian facili-
ties to ensure compliance with Environmental Protection
Agency requirements for identifying, storing, and dispos-
ing of hazardous waste. The office conducted a successful
three-day workshop on program development and prob-
lem-solving in areas such as fire protection, disaster plan-
ning, occupational safety and health, and environmental
management

The Office of Architectural History and Historic Pres-
ervation has added depth to the understanding of Smith-
sonian buildings with two architectural history studies on
aspects of the Natural History Building (1910). Further
study was devoted to the architectural history of the Na-
tional Zoo (1891-1970), including a special section on the
artwork of the zoo. Much was learned about the Smith-
sonian Institution Building (1858) through historical stud-
ies of the windows and the original structure. Studies of
old paint chips resulted in the development of a palette of
historically accurate colors, which will be used in some of
the public areas of the building. As required by the Na-
tional Historic Preservation Act, the staff presented five
major projects to the District of Columbia Historic Pres-
ervation Officer and to the federal Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation.

184

Smithsonian Institution
Women’s Council

Established in 1972, the Smithsonian Institution Women’s
Council identifies and studies the concerns of employees,
advises management on women’s issues, and strives to
improve working conditions. Chaired by Judith O’Sulli-
van and composed of twenty members elected by Smith-
sonian staff, the council is particularly concerned with
ensuring the equal treatment of women at the Smithson-
ian. It holds open meetings on the second Wednesday of
each month in the Regents Room of the Castle.

Four standing committees—Benefits and Child Care,
Newsletter, Outreach, and Programs—carry out most of
the council’s tasks. Ad hoc committees are created when
necessary to further council goals. In 1988 the council
continued to support the establishment of the child care
center for children of Smithsonian employees; the center
opened in October 1988. The council cooperates with the
Child Care Advisory Board, on which two council mem-
bers serve. In addition, the council continued publication
of its quarterly newsletter Four Star, a major communica-
tion link among employees; presented programs on
sexual harassment; and researched a proposed compre-
hensive brochure on the Smithsonian’s affirmative action
programs.
UNDER SEPARATE
BOARDS OF TRUSTEES
