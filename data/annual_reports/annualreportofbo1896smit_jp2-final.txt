CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 930, 1896,

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum.

I.—_GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became
the only lawful place of deposit for ‘all objects of art and of foreign
and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and
geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States.”
These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum
of the United States. For many years this Museum was supported
entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, and a considerable por-
tion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or
purchase.

A “museum” has been defined by Professor Huxley as “a consulta-
tive library of objects.” Not only is the National Museum such a con-
sultative library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people
of the whole country. It keeps in mind the needs of those whose lives
are not occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and
the skilled investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or
reserve to hundreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the
United States who enter its halls every year, and through the distribu-
tion of the duplicate specimeus in the Museum, made up into sets and
accurately named, to public institutions in all parts of the country.

A.—ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been
detailed in previous reports, and was made the special subject of a
paper entitled “The Genesis of the National Museum.”! [or our pres-

‘The Genesis of the National Museum,” Report of the Smithsonian Institution
(U.S. National Museum), 1891, pp. 273-330.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

ent purpose it will suftice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as
there stated. :

The formation of a national museum in the city of Washington was
first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called “The National
Institution,” and afterwards “The National Institute,” which was for
four years exceedingly prosperous and active. The nucleus for a
national museum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office
building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the
Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing
the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive,
and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence. In the meantime the
Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858,
when the so called ‘National Cabinet of Curiosities” passed into the
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term ‘“‘National Museum”
was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to
designate the collections in the Smithsonian building.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the
plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes
of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be pro-
vided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.!

After the ‘‘national cabinet” had been delivered to the Regents,
annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance.
During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were
greatly increased and were made the basis of numerous important
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The
pubhe halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of
the collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain
amount of instruction and pleasure was afforded to visitors. The
appropriations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staff
was so inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collee-
tions in good preservation.

The broad plan upon which the operations of the National Museum
are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor
Henry wrote:

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.?

‘Report of committee on organization, p. 20.
* Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1853, p. 245,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were
appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much
emphasis of the difficulties attending the assumption by the Institution
of the care of the national collections, and in the Report of the Institu-
tion for 1870' he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims
proper to such a museum.

‘There is [he wrote] scarcely any subject connected with science and
education to which more attention is given at the present day than
that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the gen-
eral denominations of museums. This arises from their growing impor-
tance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.”

In the Report for 1873? allusion was made to. the increase in the
national collections, even then very great, “requiring the utmost exer-
tions of the limited force connected with the National Museum for its
proper treatment.”

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been
more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as
ever is needed in the development of its plans for the future.

The Smithsonian Institution, from its foundation, fostered explora-
tions, and its museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological
and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many
gifts were received from private sources, and valuable objects were
deposited in its museum for safe-keeping. The nucleus of its collec-
tions was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the
founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist
of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval
expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized by
the Government, and during their progress large collections of ethno-
logical and natural history objects were made. Important foreign
material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition, Perry’s
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists
attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Sur-
vey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps brought together
great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of
North America.

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of
the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission,
The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission
found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside
the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific
work.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the
United States Government and those of numerous foreign governments
and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum.

6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of
the Smithsonian building were already overflowing with the accumula-
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring
for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requi-
site work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new
and broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of
the country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many
local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and
from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient
methods of museum administration. The exhibition of 1876 had been
indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of the
United States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it
taught as to the possibilities for good in public museums.

The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were
given to the United States for its National Musem were of large intrin-
sic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity
of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expan-
sion of the Museum itself.

In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the
Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all nec-
essary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had
never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganiza-
tion was made in 1881, under the immediate care of the present assist-
ant secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to
establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge
of a curator.

There are now twenty-eight organized departments and sections in
the Museum, the larger number of which are in charge of specialists
who receive no salary from the Museum. There are also seven admin-
istrative offices.

SPECIAL EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the National Museum may be divided into three
periods:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution
to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as
materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to
the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific
description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the cus-
tody of the “National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections
which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient,
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve
an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering
collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an
educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scien-
tific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of
record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added
the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and
education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential
to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material founda-
tions of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those
materials that hatve served as a foundation for the reports upon the
resources of the United States.

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in
the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scien-
tific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group
the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its
officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators as well
as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by
specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of
human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted
to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named
series of duplicates.

In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accom-
plished since the time of reorganization in 1881.

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected, efficient
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occa-
sion may require, and many capable museum experts have been trained
for work in other institutions.

(2) Through the agency of the staff the materials in the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, clas-
sified, and brought under control and arranged in such manner as to
insure their sefety and make them available for study.

(3) The collections have been increased eighteenfold.

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development
of a well-labeled and effectually installed exhibition series, available
for the instruction of the public.

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica-
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and
which will be made available for other institutions from time to time
through the publications of the Museum.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by expert-
ment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed eise-
where have been adopted. Our new methods are being applied in
many similar establishments at home and abroad.

(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models has been
advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of the
experts in the employ of the Museum.

(8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of |
specialists in the production of these papers has greatly enhanced the
value of the national collections.

(9) Popular educational work of unquestioned value has been accom-
plished by participation in the great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin,
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.

(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distrib-
uted to other museums and to colleges and schools.

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

That the United States mnst have a National Museum worthy of the
dignity of the nation is self-evident.

Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital
city—centers of scientific and educational ‘activity—the treasure-house
of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields
of science, art, and industrial progress.!

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museums and libraries, intelligent persons, visiting a country, very
properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili-
zation of the people.

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable
nor desirable to gather together’in this city extensive collections of
ancient medieval art, but a representative series of such objects will
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public taste,
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza.
tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished,
attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geol-
ogy and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the
preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour.
agement of the arts and industries of our own people.

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem-
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation
are divided into several groups, each under Separate administration,

i - . * > '
Most of the older nations have museums devoted to their military achievements
and triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this field of work
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

though often within the general control of some central authority. In
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart-
ment of Science and Art.

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive
names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work
which should properly be done by such museums 1s omitted, because
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand,
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortanate—col-
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different
parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division
of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any depart-
ment is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied
and compared side by side. In Washington the national collections
are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings.
The Army Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with
those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this prox-
imity, in connection with the long-established policy of cooperation
between the two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes,
united in interest.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of the National Museum are small compared with those in
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi-
viduals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contribu-
tions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000
a year, and in some years it has been greater.

Among important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin Indian
gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and ethnologist;
the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley;
the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Phila-
delphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000
conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the
collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the
Rey. L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large
and valuable collections of African mammals, birds, ete., made and
presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr. William Astor Chanler; the
Bendire and Ralph collections of American birds’ eggs, given to the
Smithsonian Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and
the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the
transfer of which from Philadelphia to Washington a special appro-
priation was made by Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not
yet come into its possession. Itis estimated that within the past fifteen
years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to
the Museum to the value of $100 each, or more.
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

The National Museum now contains more than three and a half mil-
lions of objects.

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be ex-
pressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others
worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and price-
less. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their com-
pleteness and to the labor which has been expended on them, can not
be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize
more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their
value would amount to several millions of dollars.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1896 the number of
specimens is more than eighteen times as great as in 1882.

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent,
less perhaps in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or
Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire
Museum is the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions,
andof gifts prompted largely by the generosity of the American people.

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these con-
tributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution
to museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of
the collections for study by specialists and for general educational
purposes.

The need of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly
becoming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly
offered at prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by
collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken
by the museums and institutions of Europe.

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book
from which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narra-
tive is disjointed and incomplete.

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centu-
ries. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since 1891 has averaged less than $7,000 a
year.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum,
from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of
nearly $47,000.

; Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta-
lusties are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her
average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in
London is not less than $500,000 a year.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. len

Our Museum is the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern-
ment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a
museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such
materials our Museum has been built. A museum formed in this man
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome,
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied
might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it
has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies
can only be supplied by purchase.

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by
limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have,
however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed,
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of
the Institution.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the “keeper
of the Smithsonian Museum,” and the assistant secretary, by the usage
of nearly fifty years, its executive head.

In the act of Congress passed in 1846, to establish the Smithsonian
Institution, are contained the following provisions concerning the scope
of the museum to be placed under its charge:

1. The act above referred to provides that ‘all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or
hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city
of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained by
exchange, donation, or ‘otherwise, shall be so arranged and classi-
fied as best to facilitate examination and study.

2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive
them.

3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study.

4, It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to
be erected for the Institution.

5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange
of duplicate specimens and by gift, and directs also that they shall
be appropriately classified and arranged.

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit
for all objects of art, archeology, ethnology, natural history, miner-
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

alogy, geology, etc., belonging to the United States or eolloatan by any
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress.

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily
of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison.

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three directions:

1, The permanent preservation of the collections already in its posses-
sion, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators and the
skill of the preparators. :

2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired—

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in
accordance with law; otek.

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from
foreign governments; > Mee

(3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or for publications;

(4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections
in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special
service of this nature;

(5) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for
that purpose.

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating
the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled
by the best authorities.

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large
extent of the following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumu-
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution.

2. Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian
[nstitution in connection with educational institutions or commer-
cial establishments.

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States
ministers and consuls,

4. The collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

5. Collections made by the scientific officers of Government sur-
veys, Such as the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Bound.
ary Survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of
the United States Army and by officers of the Signal Corps of the
United States Army stationed in remote regions.

6. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey
the United States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the
activities of the United States Department of Agriculture and other
Departments of the Government.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

7. The remnant of the collections of the old ‘“‘ National Institute.”

8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial
Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed
by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at
Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained
from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati
Exposition in 1887, and the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893,

9, The collections given by the Governments of the several for-
eign nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition
at Philadelphia in 1876.

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the
Philadelphia Exhibition and subsequently.

11. The materials received from museums in Kurope and America
in exchange for duplicate specimens.

12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.

The publications of the Museum consist of—

1. The Annual Report.

2. The Proceedings of the National Museum.

3. The Bulletin of the National Museum.

4, The series of circulars.

Papers by members of the Museum staff, based upon the collections,
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States
and in many of those of Europe.

RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, although it bears the name of a for-
eigner, has for half a century been one of the most important agencies
in the intellectual life of our people. It has been a rallying point for
the workers in every department of scientific and educational work
and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of
research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other coun-
tries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes,
are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of
them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientific investigator.
Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of
the national collection at the Capitol, and its museum is the richest in
existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of
the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their
best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science
to whom our country has given birth have passed their entire lifetime
in working for its success.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the
past forty-four years about one and a half million packages of books
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

and other scientiiic and literary materials have been distributed to
every region of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far-
reaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art and literature, or of American institutions
generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound,
vigorous, and progressive.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi-
cations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com-
mission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the
United States as an example of what governments should do for the
support of their scientific institutions.

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it
is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, or more in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address,
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diffusion of knowledge.

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public
opinion, it should be enlightened.

No one has yet explained, except by conjecture, why James Smithson
selected the United States as the seat of his foundation. He had no
acquaintances in America, nor does he appear to have had any books
relating to America, except two. Rhees quotes from one of these
(“Travels through North America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary of the
Royal Society) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town
of 5,000 inhabitants, in which it is predicted that “the Federal city, as
soon as navigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly,” and that,
at a future day, if the affairs of the United States go on as prosper-
ously as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the
West and rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World.

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation,
realizing that while the needs of England were well met by existing
organizations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years
in a new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England
an institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of
incaleulable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the
United States would have been to-day without this bequest?

Well did President John Quincy Adams say:

Of all the foundations of establishments Jor pious or charitable uses
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Td

which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of
mankind.

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution
has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year
since 1846— intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant
cooperation with the Government, public institutions, and individuals
in every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed advice,
support, or aid from manifold resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the extent
of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them. The
most important of these are the library and the Museum, which have
grown up under its fostering care.

THE LIBRARY.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of
the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive
system of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been
used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all
parts of the world.

The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened,
must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest
of Smithson.’ Many of these publications are now out of print.

In return for these, and by purchase, it has received the great col-
lection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest
in the world in the publications of learned societies, and therefore of
inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress
in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the
human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of every
branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until
the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol,
as a portion of the Congressional Library.

The Smithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred
thousand volumes and parts of volumes, constituting perhaps one-
fourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its
own upon the main floor of the new library building. The rapidity
with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that more than
32,000 titles were added during the past fiscal year.”

The Institution has probably done more toward building up a great
library in Washington than would have been possible had all its
income been devoted strictly to library work, as was at one time seri-
ously proposed.

‘This estimate is based upon the prices which are charged for the books by second-
hand dealers, as shown in their catalogues.

16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though their
number has been so largely increased year by year, now forming one
of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only
remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition
than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which, it is
hoped, will soon be remedied. a:

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con-
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the Institution, in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution, has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest.

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways;
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of
the nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution,
the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus
for a national museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith-
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords
each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addi-
tion to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of
information on scientific topics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object
or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered
promptly and fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are
sent Which will enavle them to find out such names for themselves in
future. This work has not only an educational value, but often a great
economic Importance as well, as, for instance, When some common min-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been
wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some
harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and alinost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively
stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been
given to the Government than has been received. The machinery of the
Institution’s action has been such that it has incidentally, in connec-
tion with its legitimate work for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge, paid over to the Government the equivalent of much more than
the whole original fund.

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be
borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution
has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, prop-
erty acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in
value to the whole amount of the Smithson bequest?

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con.
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution,
it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum,
since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years
it has deposited all the valuable gitts and bequests of specimens it
has received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the
use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of
paramount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers
of the Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous
correspondents.

C.—THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not

NAT MUS 96——2
18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render
the resources of science available to the public at large.

The National Museum is a treasure-house filled with materials for the
use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the
people of the whole country. :

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows:

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few,
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to
maintain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an
attractive as well as an intelligible form.

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than
the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from
all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the dis-
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums.
Every museum in the United States has profited in this way, and by
its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself, con-
tributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum in
the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States
were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and
similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to
national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a
very considerable extent directly and personally.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole
staff of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every
citizen.

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find
no welzome among us.

The experience of Europe, with its magnificent public museums, and
the history of the several expositions in the United States should be
quite sufficient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the
museum is an educational power even more influential than the public
library.

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late
Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five
years, not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building
up the score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of
Great Britain, remarked to the writer:

We educate our working people in the public schools, give them a love for refined
and beautiful objects, and stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave
school, go into the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the gratifi-
cation of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire. It is as much the duty
of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their higher
education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction.

In the same conversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could
not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and exam-
inations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council
of Education, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the
chief agencies.!

1No new general statement relating to the history, organization, and activities of
the National Museum having been prepared by Dr. Goode prior to his death, the
foregoing paragraphs are repeated from the Report of 1895, with a few minor
changes, bringing the subject down to date.—EDITOR.
II.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

THE MUSEUM STAFF.

There has been no change during the year in the number of scientific
departments and sections in the Museum or in the number of adminis-
trative divisions.

Prof. C. V. Riley, honorary curator of the department of insects in
the National Museum, and for many years entomologist of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, died on September 14, 1895. Mr. L. O. Howard,
who was recently appointed entomologist of the Department of Agri-
culture, has also accepted the position held by Professor Riley in the
Museum.

Mr. D. W. Coquillett has been appointed custodian of the collection
of Diptera, Mr. W. H. Ashmead of the Hymenoptera, Mr. O. F. Cook
of the Myriapoda, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz of the Coleopterous larve.

All of the appointments above mentioned were made under date of
October 8, 1895.

Mr. George C. Maynard, of this city, was appointed custodian of the
electrical collections in March, 1896, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the
Department of Agriculture, has been made an Associate in Zoology.

Mr. R, E. Earll, editor of Proceedings and Bulletins, died on March
19, 1896. Dr. Marcus Benjamin was appointed on April 1 to fill the
vacancy thus made.

A complete list of the officers of the Museum will be found in
Appendix I.

ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

There have been 1,299 accessions during the year, an increase of 76
over the record for preceding fiscal year, and of 138 over the record for
the year ending June 30, 1894. These accessions embrace 73,104 speci-
mens, and were included between accession numbers 29535 and 30833.
The appended tables show, respectively, the number of Specimens
received by the various departments of the Museum during the year,
and the total number of specimens in those departments on June 30,
1896. It will be seen that the number of specimens now in the Museum
is estimated at more than 3,500,000.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

The increase in the collections during the year, resulting directly or
indirectly from assistance rendered by the Executive Departments and
Bureaus of the Government, or by officials whose duties have enabled
them to collect for the Museum or to influence and encourage others in
so doing, has been very satisfactory.

The active support which the Museum has always enjoyed at the
hands of American ministers and consuls stationed abroad has been
most gratifying. During the year covered by this report a series of
photographs and etchings were transmitted by Mr. R. M. Bartleman,
United States consul, Antigua, West Indies. Mr. Alfred Krauss,
United States consular agent, Zittau, Germany, has forwarded geolog-
ical material. Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State,
whose generous gifts have been so often alluded to in the reports, has
continued to aid the Museum. Mr. Henry C. Smith, United States
consul, Santos, Brazil, transmitted a sloth, in behalf of Mr. Gustave G,
Beyer.
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

The prompt compliance of the Treasury Department with requests
for the free entry of material from abroad, and the continued courtesies
extended by the collector of customs in connection with its transpor-
tation to Washington, have resulted in saving much time and money
to the Museum, and the assistance thus rendered is very highly
appreciated.

The Museum is indebted to Capt. J. H. Long, keeper of the life-
saving station at Fenwicks Island, Delaware, for the skeleton of a
Finback Whale.

Lieut. J. H. Scott, of the United States revenue-marine cutter For-
ward, has transmitted a specimen of Hawk Moth, Hnyo lugubris.

The War Department has continued to grant the usual facilities of
the Quartermaster’s Department for the transmission of bulky material
from regions where ordinary means of transportation could not be util-
ized, except at great expense to the Museum.

Several officers of the United States Army have interested them-
selves in obtaining material for the Museum from various parts of the
United States, South America, and the West Indies. Prominent
among them are Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Maj. Charles Bendire, Capt.
W.C. Brown, Capt. Henry Romeyn, Lieut. Wirt Robinson, Dr. E. R.
Hodge, Dr. W. M. Brewer, Dr. D. S. Lamb, Dr. Washington Mat-
thews, and Dr. J. C. Merrill. Mr. Isaac C. Noyes, of the Army Med-
ical Museum, transmitted an archeological object from Virginia.

The Museum is indebted to officers of the Navy for several interest-
ing contributions to the Museum collections. Through the aid of
Lieut. Commander 8S. M. Schley valuable additions to the collections
have been obtained. Dr. James M. Flint continues to act as honorary
curator of the section of materia medica in the Museum.

Under the Department of the Interior, the United States Geological
Survey has transmitted a large number of collections made by mem-
bers of its staff while engaged in field duty. Among these should be
especially mentioned Prof. F. W. Clarke, Dr. David T. Day, Dr. T. M. .
Chatard, Dr. W. H. Dall, and Mr. T. W. Stanton. Hon. Charles D..
Walcott, Director of the Survey, has transmitted specimens illustrating
the Lower Cambrian formation from the White Mountain Range, Inyo
County, Cal., and Carboniferous limestone fossils from Berne, Albany
County, N. Y. The collections received from the Survey are enumer-
ated in the List of Accessions (Appendix It).

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of the Indian Office, who for many years has
contributed information concerning Indian ceremonies, as well as
numerous specimens, has continued to manifest active interest in the
ethnological department of the Museum.

Mr. Charles E. Davis, Indian agent, Colorado River Agency, Parker,

Aviz., presented a model of a raft constructed by the chief of the Mojave
Indians,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. al

From the Bureau of Education was received a photograph of twin
Eskimo children at Port Clarence, Alaska.

Perhaps no bureau of the Government has been in closer affiliation
with the National Museum in past years than the United States Fish
Commission. Since its organization in 1871 the Museum has been con-
stantly enriched by the acquisition of large collections, especially of
fishes and marine invertebrate objects. These departments in the
Museum have hitherto been cared for by officers of the Fish Commis-
sion, and their honorary position as curators in the Museum, it is
thought, has been a source of much mutual benefit to the Commission
and the Museum. The collections of special interest from the Commis-
sion during the present year were gathered principally by, or through
the cooperation of, Prof. B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, and
Mr. Charles H. Townsend.

The collections received during the year from the different bureaus
of the Department of Agriculture have been large and varied. The
botanical collections, under the care of Mr. F. V. Coville, Botanist of
that Department, have been greatly enriched. Large quantities of
interesting botanical material have been obtained from different sec-
tions of the country, through the agency of collectors connected with
the Department of Agriculture. In the classification of plants, ete., as
well as in obtaining material, Prof. F. L. Lamson-Scribner, Dr. J. N.
Rose, and Mr. J. B. Leiberg have been conspicuous in their efforts.

The services of Mr. L. O. Howard, entomologist of the Department,
who succeeded Prof. C. V. Riley as honorary curator of the department
of insects in the National Museum, have resulted in the addition of
numerous specimens to the Museum collection. In the classification
and identification of the collections of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and
Diptera he has been ably assisted by Messrs. Ashmead, Linell, and
Coquillett. The Museum is also indebted to Mr. E. A. Schwarz for
large collections of different orders of insects collected by him.

Through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Biological Survey, types
and other specimens of fishes collected by the Death Valley Expedition
and described by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, have been transferred to the
Museum. Fishes, crabs and shrimps, land and fresh-water shells, col-
lected by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman in Mexico and in the western
part of the United States, have been received, as well as large quan-
tities of other material obtained by collectors attached to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

The Bureau of Animal Industry, under the direction of Dr. D. E.
Salmon, has been instrumental in adding to the Museum some very
interesting material. Among the most valuable collections of para-
sites transmitted by the Bureau are those made by Dr. C. W. Stiles, the
honorary custodian of the helminthological collections of the National
Museum.

The collections which have been received from the Bureau of Eth-
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

nology have been not only large in numbers, but of great importance.
Particular mention is here made of the material obtained by Dervis
Walter Fewkes in connection with his exploratious in Arizona and
New Mexico, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.

EXPLORATIONS.

Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his explorations in Africa and
India, and the collections which he has forwarded | to the Museum
during the year have been of unusual interest and importance. The
value of the ethnological objects included in his collections has been
very greatly enhanced by the fulland accurate descriptions accompany-
ing them. A series of skins of lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar
to Madagascar is of special interest. The material is carefully pre-
pared and unusually well preserved.

An interesting collection of antiquities was obtained by Dr. J.Walter
Fewkes during the summer of 1895 from the cliff dwellings and ancient
pueblos near Tusayan, Ariz.

During the travels of Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army,
in the West Indies and South America, he obtained some desirable
natural-history material for the Museum.

For several years Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, has
been an enthusiastic co-operator in the work of the National Museum.
In connection with the Boundary Commission between the United States
and Mexico he made very extensive and valuable collections for the
Museum, and has later been instrumental in various ways in adding
natural-history material to its collections. During 1896 he collected for
the Museum mammals, birds, and other natural-history specimens in
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and along the Gulf of California.

A large collection of human bones was obtained by Gen. A. L. Pride-
more, Jonesville, Va., while engaged in mound explorations in Scott
County. This collection has been generously presented by him to the
National Museum.

Dr. Rh. Ellsworth Call, Cincinnati, Ohio, has explored the Mammoth
Cave and other caves in Kentucky. In the former he obtained several
interesting specimens of bats, which he has presented to the Museum.

COLLECTORS’ OUTFITS.

Outfits to be used in collecting specimens for the National Museum
have been furnished to the following persons during the year: Dr.
Edgar A, Mearns, United States Army, Gettysburg, Pa.; Mr. C. W.
Richmond, United States National Museum, for collecting in Virginia;
Prof. C. H. Gilbert, care of United States consul, Panama, Colombia,
South America; Rev. P. UL. Sérensen, Jakobshavn, North Greenland;
Prof. K. Ellsworth Call, 317 Walnut street, Cincinnati, Ohio; Mr.

of the steamship Galilee, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Mr. Frank Burns, Suffolk,
Va.; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, for collecting in Arizona, and Mr. A, W.
Anthony, San Diego, Cal.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

In the department of mammals the exhibition series is practically
unchanged. A few specimens were withdrawn for a time for exhibi-
tion at Atlanta. The type of Chanler’s Reed Buck was put on a new
stand and added to the exhibition series, and a young lion and young
tiger were also placed upon exhibition.

In the department of mollusks the exhibition series is in good condi-
tion, and has been beautified by the addition of a series of mounted
specimens illustrating the chief families of mollusks exhibited at the
Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. A portion of
the exhibition series in the department of insects is now displayed in
the small room adjoining the hall occupied by the department of com-
parative anatomy. The work of renovating the mounted collection in
the department of birds, which was begun during the last fiscal year,
has been continued. The exhibition series of birds’ eggs and nests is
in good condition, and it would be very desirable to increase it, were
this course now practicable. é

The synoptic series of invertebrates has been transferred from the
department of marine invertebrates to the department of comparative
anatomy, and the space which it formerly occupied will be devoted to
an exhibit of deep-sea fishes. Some slight changes have been made in
the cases in the west hail of the Smithsonian building, and a number
of deep-sea sponges and corals, together with some holothurians in
alcohol and a few starfishes, have been placed upon exhibition. Labels
have been printed for the holothurians, and labels for the starfishes
are in preparation. All of the named sponges on exhibition have also
been provided with printed labels. The table cases in this department
have been provided with casters, so that they may be readily moved
without danger of injuring the specimens. In the department of fishes
there are five cases of plaster casts on exhibition, one case containing
stuffed fishes, a large number of casts on the tops of cases, and a small
group of land Gobies.

The mounting of the exhibition series of Mesozoic and Tertiary
plants is now practically finished. In order to test the advantages of
mounting fossils upon tiles, the historical collection of fossils in the
department of geology was mounted in this manner. The results are
considered to be quite satisfactory. Although the tiles are necessarily
somewhat heavy, they are found to possess decided advantages over
paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The study series of inver-
tebrate fossils has received attention, but much remains to be done
before an intelligent selection can be made for the final exhibition series.

NAT MUS 96 m

34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

A considerable amount of vertebrate material is nearly ready for
installation in the exhibition series, and additional space for this pur-
pose is much needed. ; .

A great deal of detail work has been accomplished in connection with
the exhibition series in the department of minerals, and as a result the
appearance of the collections is much improved.

In the department of geology the historical series, the voleanic and
elementary series, and the collections illustrating rock weathering and
glaciation have been entirely rearranged. A large amount of work has
also been done in the hall devoted to the economic series. That por-
tion of the geological collections which is on exhibition is, all things
considered, in very good condition, although, on account of the over-
crowded condition of the hall and of the cases themselves, the appear-
ance of the collections is not all that could be desired.

In the west hall, which is devoted to the department of ethnology,
are exhibited the objects connected with (1) Negroid Africa, (2) the
Malayo-Polynesian or Indo-Pacific peoples, and (3) various Asiatic peo-
ples. All of the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican
collections in the department of prehistoric anthropology have been
placed upon exhibition. This work necessitated the rearrangement of
the cases already devoted to objects from these countries. As many as
possible of the unbroken vessels from mounds in the United States
were placed upon exhibition.

The collection of boats has been overhauled, the larger ones being
suspended from the ceiling. Many models of boats have been repaired.

In the east hall two new cases have been erected for the accommoda-
tion of the electrical collections and the series illustrating methods of
land transportation.

The condition of the exhibition series in the section of graphic arts
remains practically the same as at the close of the preceding fiscal year.
Although the collection is not considered complete, it probably illus-
trates better than any other collection of its kind, either in this country
or abroad, the technical development of the reproductive processes.

_ ‘The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects
are exhibited in the east and west halls immediately adjoining the
rotunda, In the northeast aleove the Egyptian collection is installed,

LABELS.

During the year nearly 150 requisitions for printing labels and blanks
were received from the various departments in the Museum.

There were printed on the Museum press 74,831 labels, representing
eight hundred and three forms; 49,000 blanks, representing twenty-
two forms; 6,047 circulars, representing twelve forms; and 6,090 copies,
representing thirty-six forms, of other matter, making a total of 135,968
copies.

At the Government Printing Office there were printed upon requi-
sition by the Museum 52,200 blanks and circulars, representing ten
forms, and 31,772 labels, representing one hundred and eighty-one
forms, making a total of 83,972 copies.

LIBRARY.

The librarian, Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions during the
past year have been as follows: Periodicals, 5,542; books, 810; pam-
phlets, 1,209; total, 7,561. From the accessions to the library of the
Smithsonian Institution there have been retained tor the use of the
Museum 7,596 periodicals, 333 books, and 1,047 pamphlets, making a
total of 8,976. A list of the accessions to the Museum library by gift
and exchange will be found in Appendix III,

The number of books borrowed during the year was 7,182, while
5,330 were returned, about 1,800 having been retained in the sectional
libraries. Nearly 1,200 books were bound, of which, however, only
about 200 belonged to the National Museum. Owing to lack of funds,
it was impossible to have any more Museum books bound, although
a large number require binding.

The transter of the periodical record to the standard library record
has been continued, the new record containing at the close of the fiscal
year 4,500 cards. There are 6,000 cards in the standard catalogue of
books other than periodicals.

It is the desire of the hbrarian to have the catalogue unified, but
the pressure of current work has been so great that progress in this
direction has necessarily been slow.

There has been no change in the number of sectional libraries since
the last report, the list being as follows:

1. Administration. 12. Marine invertebrates.

2. Birds. 13. Materia medica.

3. Botany. 14. Mesozoie fossils.

4. Comparative anatomy. 15. Mineralogy.

5. Ethnology. 16. Mollusks.

6. Fishes. 17. Oriental antiquities and reli
7. Geology. gious ceremonials.

8. Helminthology. 18. Paleobotany.

9. Historical collections. 19. Photography.

10. Insects. 20. Prehistoric anthropology.
11. Mammals. 21. Reptiles.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Report of the Museum for 1893 was published early in the year,
and the papers in the appendix have appeared in separate form. The
Report for 1894 is nearly all in type and much work has been accom-
plished in the preparation of the volume for 1895.

Volume xvi of the Proceedings was distributed in July, and active
progress has been made in printing and distributing the separate papers
in Volume xvii. Nos. 1033 to 1082, with three exceptions, have
appeared, and also paper No. 1032, belonging to Volume XVII, but not
received from the press in time for distribution before the close of last
year. Volume xvitt, in bound form, will probably be ready for dis-
tribution in the autumn, Advance sheets of the following papers have
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a”

been published: No. 1087, ‘‘ Preliminary description of a new genus and
two new species of Crustaceans from an artesian well at San Marcos,
Tex.,” by James E. Benedict; No. 1088, ‘Description of a new genus
and species of Blind Tailed Batrachian from the subterranean waters
of Texas,” by Leonhard Stejneger; No. 1103, ‘Preliminary diagnoses
of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United States,” by
Edgar A. Mearns. Manuscripts of fourteen additional papers to be
published in the Proceedings were in the hands of the printer at the
close of the fiscal year, and nineteen more have been accepted for
publication.

The following additional parts of Bulletin 39 have been issued: Part
H, “ Directions for collecting minerals,” by Wirt Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Diree-
tions for collecting rocks and for the preparation of thin sections,” by
George P. Merrill; Part J, ‘Directions for collecting specimens and
information illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants,” by Frederick V.
Coville; Part K, ‘‘ Directions for collecting and preparing fossils,” by
Charles Schuchert.

Circular 47, in regard to the identification of mollusks by the National
Museum, has been issued.

The titles of all the papers which have appeared in the form of sepa-
rates during the year are given in Appendix V.

Bulletin No. 47, “The Fishesof North and Middle America: A Descrip-
tive Catalogue of the Species of Fish-like Vertebrates found in the
Waters of North America North of the Isthmus of Panama,” by David
Starr Jordan and Barton Warren Evermann, a volume of 1,240 pages,
is entirely in type and will be shortly put to press. The present Bul-
letin constitutes Part 1 of the work. <A second volume of text and an
atlas of plates will be published later.

Bulletin No. 49, “A Bibliography of the Published Writings of Philip
Lutley Sclater, F. R.S., Secretary of the Zoological Society of London,”
prepared under the direction of Dr. G. Brown Goode, has been set in
type. It contains 135 pages, with a portrait of Dr. Sclater as a frontis-
piece. Mucheare has been given to the typography, with a special view
to securing compactness and clearness. This work is not included in
the series of Bibliographies of American Naturalists, of which five have
been published (Bulletins 20, 23, 30, 40, and 41), since the scope of this
Series is necessarily limited to the work of naturalists living in the
United States; but, inasmuch as Dr. Sclater’s contributions to the
systematic ornithology of the American continent have exceeded in
extent those of anyone living in this country, it was deemed proper
that the U. 8S. National Museum should publish his bibliography.

It was hoped that the second and third numbers of the Special Bul-
letin, the first of which appeared in 1892, would be ready for distribu-
tion before the end of the year, but owing to certain unavoidable delays
this was impossible. No. 2 of the series, entitled ‘“ Oceanie Ichthyol-
ogy: A Treatise on the Deep-sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, based
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

chiefly upon the collections made by the Steamers Blake, Albatross,
and Fish Hawk in the Northwestern Atlantic,” by George Brown Goode
and Tarleton H. Bean, is an elaborate work of 553 pages, in quarto
form, with an atlas of 417 figures arranged on 123 plates. The work
of composition on Special Bulletin No. 3, which was partly put in type
last year, has been completed, and the Bulletin is now ready for the
press. This Bulletin constitutes the second volume of “The Life His-
tories of North American Birds,” by Maj. Charles Bendire, and relates
only to land birds, extending, in the classification given in the check-
list of the American Ornithologists’ Union, from the parrots to the
erackles. The volume will contain 518 pages, and will be illustrated
by seven chromo-lithographic plates of birds’ eggs.

WORK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM.

A number of students and investigators examined the collections in
several departments of the Museum during the year, for the purpose
of identifying specimens or of studying the characteristics of certain
families or orders. A few of those who have availed themselves of
this privilege are here mentioned.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Atl

Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army, continued his study of the
interesting and valuable collection of mammals, obtained by himself
and Mr. F. X. Holzner on the Mexican boundary, with a view to pub-
lishing an elaborate paper based upon this material. On account of
the valuable service which he has rendered to the Museum he was
accorded all of the privileges enjoyed by a regular curator in the prose-
cution of his work. Advance editions of two papers by Dr. Mearns have
been published during the year, one of which is entitled ‘‘ Preliminary
diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United
States,” and the other ‘“‘ Preliminary description of anew subgenus and
six new species and subspecies of hares from the Mexican boundary of
the United States.”

In the department of birds Mr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian
Museum, was engaged for a time in certain investigations; Mr. L. M.
Loomis, of the California Academy of Sciences, studied various Pacific
Coast species of Shearwaters, Gulls, and. Horned Owls; Dr. Louis P.
Bishop, New Haven, Conn., studied the Western Night Hawks, Bit-
terns, Horned Larks, Song Sparrows, ete., in connection with speci-
mens which he collected in North Dakota; Mr. G.S. Miller, jr., of this
city, made an examination of the Mexican Jays of the genus Aphelosoma;
Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,
inquired into the status of various Horned Owls; Mr. H. C. Oberholser,
of the Department of Agriculture, made an investigation of the Downy
Woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens and subspecies) and arranged several
families of neotropical Passeres in the study series; Mr. R. M. Ander-
son, Forest City, lowa, spent two or three days in examining species of
North American birds, and Mr. J. H. Riley and Mr. C. G. Rorebeck,
Falls Church, Va., were occupied for several months in performing volun-
teer work and in familiarizing themselves with the birds of North
America.

Although no one has been engaged in a regular course of study in
the department of mollusks, many persons have been permitted to
examine specimens in the study collection, and have received verbal
information from the curator or his assistants. Dr. R. R. Gurley having
been requested by the Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the United
States Geological Survey, to prepare a monograph of the American
Graptolites, all the facilities which the Museum affords in this direction
were placed at his disposal. Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass.,
spent some time at the Museum, in April, looking over the Paleozoic
Cephalopoda, and Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of
Natural History, studied the skulls of Titanotherium.

Miss Etta Braly and Miss Amanda Braly were engaged for about two
months comparing the insects collected by them in Arkansas with spe-
cies in the Museum collection. The former had in view the preparation
of a list of the Coleoptera found in that State, and the latter the prep-
aration of a list of the Hemiptera.
4? REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University of America, made
frequent visits to the herbarium for the purpose of conducting investiga-
tions in certain orders; Prof. C. F. Wheeler, of the Michigan Agricul-
tural College, spent several weeks in the spring of 1896 studying the
genus Carex; Dr. N. L. Britton, of Columbia College, New York City,
was engaged in the herbarium about the same time in making critical
observations on certain eastern species; Mr. C. 8. Sargent, Jamaica
Plain, Mass., examined tiie Conifere and Palmacee, and Mrs. EK. G.
Britton, of New York City, was engaged for about two weeks in May
in the study of mosses, especially those from Alaska.

Dr. Theodore Gill has had access to the collections of fishes while
prosecuting his work upon the families and their relationship. Prof B.
W. Evermann, of the United States Fish Commission, has examined
the collections in the same department in connection with his work
upon material recently collected by the Commission, and also in con-
nection with the preparation of Bulletin 47 of the United States
National Museum entitled “The Fishes of North and Middle America,”
by David S. Jordan and B. W. Evermann. ‘This work was nearly all
in type at the close of the fiscal year. Prof. A. E. Verrill, New Haven,
Conn., who is engaged in the preparation of a report on the West
Indian starfishes, spent about a week in the laboratory of the depart-
ment of marine invertebrates, during which time he identified a large
number of specimens, and selected others which he desired to have
sent to him for more critical examination.

Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the United States Geological Survey, was
engaged for a time in an investigation of the fluorescence of wollaston-
ite, and Prof. R. L. Packard has continued to make use of the collections
in the department of geology.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman of this city has prepared for publication a paper
on the ‘Graphic Art of the Eskimos,” the work being based upon a
study of the collections in the Museum. Mr. J. D. McGuire, Ellicott
City, Md., who published a paper in the Report for 1894, entitled
“Primitive Methods of Drilling,” has been engaged during the present
fiscal year in the study of the pipes used by the American aborigines,
with a view to the preparation of a paper on that subject. Dr. J.
Hampden Porter has in course of preparation a paper on the foods of
primitive people, and has made use of the Museum collection in this
connection. Mr, H. A. Hazen of this city was granted the privilege of
examining the collection of kites. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was engaged
during the winter in the preparation of an illustrated catalogue of the
material collected by him in Arizona during the previous summer.

44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

MATERIAL RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT.

There have been 542 lots of material of various kinds received dur-
ing the year for identification. These were included between Nos.
3236 and 3777, and represent an increase of 75 over the receipts of
the preceding fiscal year. A detailed list of these sendings, arranged
alphabetically by the names of the persons transmitting the material,
is printed in Appendix VI.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTON DURING THE YEAR.

On September 5, 1895, the Society of Agricultural Chemists met in
the lecture hall of the Museum. The sessions extended over three
days.

The American Ornithologists’ Union met on November 12 and held
three sessions on that day and the day following.

The eleventh annual meeting of the American Historical Association
was held in Washington on December 26 and 27.!

On January 2, 1896, the second annual meeting of the National
Science Club opened.!

A lecture was delivered in the office of the Assistant Secretary, on
March 16, by Rear Admiral 8. Makaroff, of the Russian Navy, on “ The
specific gravity of the waters of the North Pacific Ocean.”

The National Academy of Sciences has for some years held its annual
meeting in the Museum building. The sessions for the present year
lasted from April 21 to 24. The business meetings were held in one of
the offices and the lecture hall was used for the public meetings.!

A lecture to the pupils of the High School of Washington on
“India” was delivered in the lecture hall of the Museum on May 22
by Mr. H. N. Wilson.

The Saturday lectures were continued during the season of 1896
under the auspices of the joint commission of the scientific societies of
Washington. The subjects of these lectures are given in Appendix
vu. Many of the lectures were illustrated by the stereopticon, and

.others by maps, diagrams, and specimens. The series delivered during
this year was arranged with a view to illustrating the relations of
life to environment. Two courses were provided, the first pertaining
chiefly to vegetal and animal life, the second to human life in its rela-
tious to lower organisms and to the inorganic world. The five lectures
constituting the second course were printed in the Appendix to the

teport of the Smithsonian Institution for 1895.

CIVIL SERVICE.

Under an order issued by the President on May 6, 1896, the National
Museum was made subject to the law regulating appointments and
promotions in the civil service of the United States.

NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

On December 10, 1895, Senator Morrill introduced a bill for the
erection of an additional building for the use of the National Museum.
This bill was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, and favorably reported on February 27, 1896. An amend-
ment embodying the substance of the bill was afterwards made to the
Sundry Civil bill, but was not retained.

COTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.

The Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, Ga.,
opened on September 18 and closed on December 31, 1895. The
Assistant Secretary represented the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Museum on the Government board of management. Mr. R. E.
Earll was appointed special agent in charge of the exhibit.

The following departments and sections in the Museum prepared
exhibits for this Expostion: Mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, compara-
tive anatomy, marine invertebrates, mollusks, insects, paleontology,
geology, minerals, botany, ethnology, prehistoric anthropology, materia
medica, technology, oriental antiquities, and religious ceremonials
Collections of musical instruments and of ceramics were also exhibited.

The official report upon the participation of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the National Museum in the Exposition will be found in the
Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1896.
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

NECROLOGY.

Prof, Charles Valentine Riley, honorary curator of the department
of insects in the United States National Museum, died September 14,
1895.

The following is an extract from a biographical sketch by the Assist-
ant Secretary, read at the annual meeting of the Joint Commission of
the Scientific Societies of Washington, January 18, 1896, and afterwards
published in Science:!

Professor Riley was born in Chelsea, London, September 18, 1843. His schoolboy
days were passed in France and Germany, and he was but 17 when his restless spirit
led bim to America.

“He went West and settled with Mr. G. H. Edwards, whom he had met in London
and who had made arrangements to open a stock farm in Kankakee County, Il.
Here, during three years, he acquired that experience of Western agriculture that
can be gained only by farm work. Fond of all life as manifested on the farm, young
Riley devoted himself enthusiastically to the calling he had chosen. Of an inquiring
and experimental turn of mind, he aimed to improve on the methods in vogue, and
soon won the esteem of all who knew him; and, though so young, was sought for in
counsel and honored at public gatherings, at which he became intimate with Emory
Cobb and other prominent farmers of Illinois. Under these circumstances, and with
a deep love of nature in all her manifestations, it was no wonder that Professor
Riley, as we have heard him avow, looked back to the farming days in Illinois as the
happiest of his life,

“The experience gained on the farm enabled him, more than anything else, to
understand the position and needs of the farmer. In writing of Professor Riley’s
farm life and the reasons why he abandoned it, a Kankakee friend who knew him
well remarks: ‘Young Riley was simply too enthusiastic and too bent on excelling
in everything. He took no rest. Often he would be up, actually getting breakfast
ready, to relieve the women folk, and milk half a dozen cows, before the others were
about. When others were resting at noon in the shade, he would be working at his
flowers under a July sun, There was not a sick animal of the three hundred on
the place that he did not understand and help. He kept a lot of bees, got hold of
the best bred colts, and some of the best heifers in the county, secured a good
quarter-section, and spent his Sundays reading, sketching, and studying insects.
Three years of this unceasing effort under the trying climatic extremes of central
Illinois broke the young fellow’s health, for it was a great contrast to his previous
life, and with every one telling him that he was wasting his talents, he finally con-
cluded to give up the idea of farming. But had his health not failed him, my opinion
is that he would be a farmer to-day, and a successful one too, for he has intense
love of rural life.’

“He went to Chicago in his twentieth year, with no definite trade or profession
and with little experience of city life. Money was scarce among farmers in those
days, and his little property was so invested that it was not available. The trials
of his first few months in Chicago are familiar to only a few of his intimate friends,
but the manner in which he overcame them while yet in poor health was character-
istic. Pride prevented him from asking help from his Kankakee friends, but did
not prevent him from donning blue overalls and doing manual labor in a pork-
packing establishment, or from adding to his slender income by making portraits of
fellow boarders, or sketches which he himself disposed of at evening in the abodes
of wealth on Michigan avenue. After a while he obtained an engagement as a
reporter on the Evening Journal, but finally became connected with the Prairie

‘Vol, 111 (N.S.), No. 59, 1896, pp. 1-8.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. AT

Farmer, then the leading agricultural paper of the West. Besides a close applica-
tion to the duties of his position as reporter, delineator, and editor of the entomo-
logical department of this paper, he devoted his time and energies to the study of
botany and entomology. His industry and versatility soon made him not only
popular with his associates upon the paper, but gave him a widespread reputation
as a writer upon natural history, especially on his specialty of economic entomology,
the importance of which he soon made apparent.” !

His adventurous temperament led him to enlist as a private in the One hundred
and thirty-fourth Illinois Volunteers, in which he served for several months during
the civil war, in Kentucky and Tennessee.

Before entering the army he had made the acquaintance of the man whom he
joined in 1868 in establishing the American Entomologist. This friend, who was
senior editor until his death, was Dr. Benjamin D. Walsh, State Entomologist of Il-
nois, and it was Walsh to whom Riley always alluded as his master and the man
to whom he was most indebted for his early training and inspiration. Mr. Walsh
was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, in the class with Darwin, a inan of
weight and scholarly attainments and a most careful and painstaking investigator.
During the few years of his residence in Illinois he had done much to develop the
interest in economic entomology, which resulted in the establishment of the position
of State Entomologist of Missouri in 1868, which was the beginning of Riley’s
public labors.

An important outgrowth of Riley’s personal activity in connection with his official
work was the formation of the Riley collection of insects, upon which he began
immediately after he left the army in 1864, and which at the end of twenty-five years
included over 20,000 species and over 115,000 mounted specimens, besides much
other material. The collection is in many respects unijue, especially so because of
the complete manner in which the life-history of numerous individual species is
represented. It is the legitimate outgrowth and complement of Riley’s investiga-
tions, and is a voucher for the accuracy and fullness of his personal work in ento-
mology. This collection he gave in 1882, without condition, to the National Museum,
at that time without a collection of insects. His purpose in doing this was to place
iz the Museum a worthy nucleus, and to be instrumental in the formation of a col-
lection which would be worthy of the nation. He was appointed at once honorary
curator of the department of insects in the Museum, and gave much attention to the
department, which thereafter made rapid advances.

It was as an economic entomologist that Riley was most widely famed. In this
field he was eminent in two respects—in administration as well as in his direct
contributions to the science of practical entomology, and to the art which is its
outgrowth.

As an administrator, he was associated with three promineut undertakings: The
entomological work of the State of Missouri, the United States Entomological Com-
mission, and the establishment of the Division of Entomology of the Department of
Agriculture.

He held the position of entomologist to the State of Missouri for nearly ten years,
entering upon this work at the age of 23.

The United States Entomological Commission was in existence for five years, Riley
having been its chief from the beginning.

“We all remember,” said the Pacific Rural Press in 1887, ‘‘ the sad experiences
which our Western States and Territories passed through from 1873 to 1877, from
locust or grasshopper ravages, which resulted in destitution and precipitated a
financial crisis. These ravages seliously affected the western portion of his own
State, and Professor Riley took hold of the problem with that originality and vigor
which have characterized all of his work. His last three reports to the State con-
tain the first positive and accurate knowledge on the subject that has been published.

1 Colman’s Rural World, St. Louis, May 12, 1892.
48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

But he early saw that the subject was one of national importance and could not be
fully dealt with by work in any one State. To feel a necessity was sufficient for
him to act, and consequently we find him, in public lectures, in leading articles,
through resolutions offered at societies’ meetings, memorials to Congress, and in
every other way urging the creation of a National Entomological Commission. After
various hills had been introduced and discussed, Congress finally created the Ento-
mological Commission, with a special view to investigating the Rocky Mountain
Locust, or so-called grasshopper, and Professor Riley was tendered the position as
chief of the Commission, a distinction which his investigations into this insect had
justly earned, for he had already not only made most important discoveries as to its
habits and the best means of subduing it, but had ascertained sundry laws that
govern it, so as to be able to predict the time of its coming and going and the limits
of its spread. Consulted by Secretary Schurz as to the other appointments, it is no
wonder that the members chosen were Dr. A. 8S. Packard, jr., a naturalist of eminence,
one of the finest entomologists of the world, and a prominent author and editor, and
Prof. Cyrus Thomas, who had likewise labored for the creation of the Commission,
and who was the authority on the family of insects to which the locusts belonged.
Both of these gentlemen, like Professor Riley, had been chosen by their respective
States as official entomologists, and had a large personal experience in the West.
Accepting charge of the Commission thus constituted in March, 1877, we find Riley
traveling that year over most of the western country, from the Gulf to the South
Saskatchawan, in British America, now in company with the governor of the State,
and again with other special officials, but everywhere exhorting the farmers to
action, making careful observations and experiments, and inspiring confidence.”

He was the first to demonstrate the practicability of checking the ravages of an
important species of insect by enlisting the aid of the insect enemies which had kept
itin check in its native habitat. This was effected by the introduction from Aus-
tralia in 1888, at his instance and by two agents sent out from his office, of the
Australian Vedalia, a species of lady-bird, which is the natural enemy of the ‘‘ Fluted
Seale,” an insect which had found its way from southern Australia to California,
and was fast destroying the orange and lemon groves.

His studies in connection with Phylloxera, the French vine pest, although not more
important than many others more purely American in interest, may well be referred
toon accountof the attention which they attracted in France, and the honors conferred
upon him as a result. To him is generally attributed the idea of reviving etiolated
French vineyards by using certain American Phylloxera-proof stocks to graft upon.

As long ago as 1873 the vine growers of France presented him with a gold medal,
struck in recognition of his investigations into the history of the Phyllorera. In
1889, as a further proof of their appreciation of his services, they presented to him
a beautiful statue in bronze, while the French Government conferred upon him the
cross of the Legion of Honor.

Associated prominently with his name are certain practical methods for the destruc-
tion of insects: the use of kerosene emulsions to protect plants and trees from the
attacks of suctorial insects, and the invention and perfection, aided by Mr. W. S.
Barnard, of a very ingenious series of mechanical devices for spraying insecticides
and fungicides in a liquid form—often called the Riley system.

The vast amount of work which Professor Riley accomplished is shown
by the catalogue of his published papers, of which there are more than
1,600, many of them of very considerable extent, and the whole equiva-
lent to at least 20,000 octavo pages.

Professor Riley bequeathed to the United States National Museum,
through a trustee, all entomological and other natural history speci-
mens which had come into his possession during reccnt years. A
large collection of his pamphlets, relating to the subject of entomology,
has been deposited in the Museum by Mrs. Riley.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49

Mr. R. S. Matthews, aid in the department of mammals, died on
on November 13, 1895, in Atlanta, Ga., where he had been detailed for
duty in connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition.
Although Mr. Matthews had been connected with the Museum only a
short time, he had shown marked ability, and would have undoubtedly
become a naturalist of prominence.

Mr. R. Edward Earll, editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins, died
on March 19, 1896. The following brief account of his life, prepared
by the Assistant Secretary, is reprinted from Science: !

Mr. Robert Edward Earll, who died on March 19, at Chevy Chase, near Washing-
ton, was one of the oldest and most trusted members of the staff of the Smithsonian
Institution, with which he had been connected in various capacities since 1877. He
was born at Waukegan, Ill., August 24, 1853, educated in the Waukegan public
schools, the University of Chicago, and at the Northwestern University, where he
was graduated in 1877 with the degree of B.S. He entered the service of the Fish
Commission, under Professor Baird, as a fish culturist; in 1878 was transferred to
thescientifice staft, and from 1879 to 1882 was engaged in the fisheries division of the
Tenth Census.

From 1885 to 1888 he was chief of the division of statistics in the Fish Gommission.
He was sent in 1883 to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, as a mem-
ber of the staff of the United States Commissioner, and rendered very efficient sery-
ice as executive officer and deputy representative. His aptitude for exposition work
was so fully demonstrated on this occasion that he has been designated chief execu-
tive officer at all the expositions which have since been held, for the exhibits of the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Maseum—at Louisville and New Orleans in
1884 and 1885, Cincinnati in 1888, Chicago, in 1893, and Atlanta in 1895. At the time
of his death he had just completed the unpacking of the exhibits returned from the
South.

Since 1888 he had been connected with the National Museum, with the grade of
curator, and for three years had been editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the
Museum.

He was recognized by his associates as a man of fine administrative ability, which,
combined with great force of character, had brought him into the position of one of
the most efficient expositiou experts living. His unselfish devotion to his work and
his absolute trustworthiness were appreciated by all who knew him, and he was
exceedingly popular among his associates.

Notwithstanding his constant occupation in executive work, he produced and
published a considerable number of important papers in regard to the methods of
the fisheries and the habits of dishes. He was one of the best authorities upon the
natural history of the shad and herring, and made exhaustive studies of the fishery
statisties of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and of the Great Lakes. Several new
fishes were discovered by him, one of which, an important food species of the south-
ern coast, obtained by him at Charleston in 1881, is called in his honor Earll’s hake,
Phycis earlii. He was also a skillful fish culturist, and had much experience in the
early experimental work in the propagation of the shad and in the establishment of
the cod hatching station at Gloucester.

He was a man of the purest personal character. His loss will be deeply felt by
many in Washington. By reason of his peculiar abilities and his great experience,
his death creates a yoid which it will be practically impossible to fill.

IlI.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC
DEPARTMENTS.

During the early part of the fiscal year the curators of many of the
departments were engaged in completing the preparation of their
exhibits for the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta,
Ga. This Exposition opened on September 18 and continued until the
close of the year 1895, Another month or more was required for the
return of the exhibits and their installation in the Museum, so that for
at least one-half of the period covered by the present report the cura-
tors were occupied more or less with Exposition matters. This is usually
the case, however, during those years in which Expositions occur, and
as the resulting disadvantages have been dwelt upon in previous
reports, no extended reference to them need be made at this time.
Nevertheless, it is gratifying to state that satisfactory progress has
been made in all the departments, notwithstanding the difficulties
encountered. The record of the present year compares favorably with
that of other years in which similar conditions existed.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS.

As stated in the last Annual Report, the curator, Mr. F. W. True, was
detailed in May, 1895, to accompany an expedition to Alaska and the
adjacent islands for the purpose of studying the seal rookeries. While
thus engaged he was attached to the staff of the United States Fish
Commission. |

The most interesting accessions to the collections of this department
have been received from Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for several years has
forwarded very large and valuable collections of mammals, birds, ete.,
from various parts of Africa and Asia. His contributions in the present
year consisted of valuable skins of lemurs and other small mammals
from Madagascar, and a collection from Kashmir, including a stag and
amusk. In all, ninety-two specimens were received from him.

About forty skins of the very rare mole Neiirotrichus gibbsii, from
British Columbia, were purchased by the Museum. Eighty-eight mam-
mals from the Pribilof Islands, ineluding fifteen fur-seals, were col-
lected by the curator (while in the service of the Fish Commission) and
Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr. A mounted skin of the Chile deer, Cariacus
chilensis, was presented by the La Plata Museum. Lieut. Wirt Robin-
son, U.S. A., collected fourteen small mammals in Margarita Island

and La Guayra, Venezuela. These he kindly presented to the National
50
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 51

Museum. About fifty mammals, which died from the effects of confine-
ment in the National Zoological Park, have been received. They were
chiefly representatives of North American species. From Dr. EK. A.
Mearns, U.S. A., were received several small mammals from Fort Clark,
Tex., and Fort Myer, Va., and Prof. R. E. Call donated between three
and four hundred bats, which he obtained from the Mammoth Cave in
Kentucky.

Mr. True states that, while the accumulations of the year included
some very valuable specimens, so far as scientific value is concerned,
the general average is probably below that of the last three or four
years. The number of specimens received is also less. There were
fifty different contributors, four of which were Government Bureaus.
The total number of specimens received and entered was 1,048, includ-
ing 365 bats of one or two species only.

Very little work was accomplished in the exhibition hall, owing to
the absence of the curator. A considerable number of specimens were
withdrawn for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Expo-
sition at Atlanta, but these were returned before the expiration of the
fiscal year.

Regarding the study collections the curator says:

The study series has not degenerated, so far as I am aware. A large number of
skins have been taken from the vats and made up dry, and many old but valuable
skins have been made over. From the want of an assistant, little has been done
towards classifying and putting away the larger skins.

There are still many skins of the larger species which are in very bad form for
study purposes and ought to be made over, so that they can be handled. At present
they are stored in boxes.

New cases were provided in the third-story laboratory, but little has yet been put
into them.

Some progress was made in transferring the valuable study series of small skulls
from trays to boxes, but more remains to be done.

The alcoholics have been looked after and roughly classified in the alcohol room,
but the lack of an assistant made it impossible to do much in that direction.

A paper entitled ‘“ Revision of the American Moles,” by the curator,
was completed and sent to press during the year. He has also con.
tinued his work on the “ Antlers of the Deer Family,” although this
has been constantly interrupted by special assignment to executive
duties.

The curator calls attention in his report to several explorations
which have resulted in the acquisition of some very desirable material.
Thus, Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., was detailed to accompany the curator
to the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, in the summer of 1895, and in the
three months spent there they collected eighty-eight mammals, a large
number of plants, some anatomical specimens, insects, birds, and other
natural-history objects. Among the mammals are fifteen fur-seals of
varying ages, including a very fine old bull. Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has
continued his travels in Kashmir, sent some very interesting mammals
to the Museum from that country. He also made a collecting trip in
southeastern Madagascar, and as a result a splendid series of skins of
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar to that island were added to
the Museum collections. Prof. R. E. Call explored the caves of Ken-
tucky and obtained in the Mammoth Cave a large number of bats for
the Museum. Mr. William Palmer made an expedition to the Dismal
Swamp, Virginia, and collected a few mammals.

It is pleasant to refer here to the enthusiastic cooperation of Dr,
BE. A. Mearns, U. S. A. Both in the field and in the laboratory his
energies and intelligent aid have been of very great value to the
Museum.

Three papers based upon collections made by Dr. Mearns and Mr. F.
X. Holzner have been published by the Museum. These contain
descriptions of eighteen new species and subspecies.

The curator thus outlines the general course which it seems desir-
able to follow in the future in connection with the development of this
department:

The collections of mammals made by the Department of Agriculture in the last
few years being cited in the publications of that Department as belonging to the
National Museum, it is taken for granted that they do now and always will form a
part of the Government collections of the Museum. Such being the case, it seems
inadvisable to spend money in procuring North American mammals at this time,
except of such species as are not collected by the Department of Agriculture or of
which specimens are needed for exhibition purposes.

On the other hand, all kinds of foreign mammals ate greatly to be desired. The
tendency of work in America at present is to follow broader lines than hitherto, and
the foreign species are needed for comparison with our own.

We ought to be on the lookout, furthermore, to secure specimens of large foreign
species which are threatened with extinction. Some which were obtainable twenty-
five years ago are no longer to be had.

Additions to the groups of North American mammals are in view,
but there is great discouragement in this direction, it being impossible
at the present time to find exhibition space for five groups already pre-
pared. A fur-seal group is now being provided for.

Mr. True, in addition to his duties as curator of mammals, has served
during the year as chairman of the Committee on Publications, and
has frequently been called upon to act as Executive Curator in matters
affecting the general administration of the Museum.

The department suffered a severe loss in the death of Mr. R. 8S.
Matthews, which occurred on November 13, 1895.

The appended statement shows the number of specimens in the col-
lection and the number of catalogue entries made during the year:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS.

During the year just closed a large proportion of the time of the
curator, Mr. Robert Ridgway, has been devoted to the prosecution of
his work on the ‘“ Birds of North and Middle America.” In a special
report regarding the progress of this work he makes the following
statement:

There have been completed during the year the synonymy, family diagnoses, and
concomitant matter pertaining to 54 families, 335 genera, and 1,061 species. During
the preceding period since the work was commenced 15 families, 165 genera, and 747
species were covered.

This statement does not by any means show the proportion of the work which has
actually been completed, since a large number of genera and individual species,
thoroughly ‘‘ worked up” in other connections, are in shape for the printer. How
many and what proportion of the whole these would represent, it is, however, impos-
sible to estimate.

At the present rate of progress the synonymatie portion of the work will be com-
pleted by December, 1896—possibly sooner. Much of the most difficult portion of
the task will then be out of the way. In the meantime a determined effort will be
made to thoroughly rearrange the collection, so as to facilitate access to the speci-
mens, and then the finishing touches will be given the work without unnecessary
delay.

Other investigations carried on by the curator included a study of the
genera of the Tringillide; a study of the affinities of Procnias viridis;
a partial compilation of a list of type specimens in the department of
birds; determinations of some-Galapagos species, of a species of Peuce-
dramus trom Guatemala, and of a species of Geothlypis from Mexico.
He also prepared a paper on the birds collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott
in the Seychelles and other islands near Madagascar. The curator was
detailed for two months in southern Florida, for the purpose of studying
the bird life of that region.

The routine work has devolved very largely on Mr. Charles W.
Richmond, assistant curator. The latter has determined collections of
birds made by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, in eastern Turkestan, and
in Madagascar. He has also commenced the study of a collection of
birds from Kast Africa, a collection of birds from Margarita Island,
Venezuela, made by Lieut. Wirt Robinson, and a series from eastern
Mexico.

The number of specimens received during the year was about 3,000
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

in excess of the receipts for the preceding year, the number of acces-
sions or “lots” of material having been eighty-six. The scientific
value of the accessions for the year just closed exceeded that for the
year 1894-95, including, as they did, a rare and extinct parrot (Nestor
productus), presented by Dr. W. L. Ralph; one species doubifully
extinct, many types of new species, and a number of rare specimens.
Specimens or collections of unusual importance have been received from
more than forty individuals and establishments during the year. The
list of important contributors for the preceding year was headed by
Mr. A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England. He has been a very gener-
ous contributor, having presented during this year more than 2,800
specimens from various parts of the world. His liberality toward the
Museum is very highly appreciated.

Among other important accessions the following may be mentioned:
From Dr. W. L. Abbott, 217 specimens, representing 85 species, from
Madagascar, and 67 specimens, mainly eagles and hawks, from Kashmir
(gift); Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, 167 specimens from
Margarita Island, Venezuela, and Bogota, Colombia, including types of
11 species (gift); Rev. H. T. Heyde, 1404 Erato street, New Orleans,
La., 183 bird skins from Central America (purchase); H. P. Attwater,
San Antonio, Tex., 367 specimens from Texas (purchase); Dr. A. Fényes,
Hélouan, Egypt, 79 specimens from Egypt (gift); 190 birds collected
by Robert Ridgway, in Florida and other States, for the U.S. National
Museum; 8S. Dannefaerd, New Zealand, 9 specimens from Chatham
and Snares Islands (purchase); F. Stephens, Witch Creek, Cal., type
of Speotyto cunicularia obscura (gift); William Brewster, Cambridge,
Mass., 141 specimens from Mexico and Lower California (gift); Charles
KE. Kern, Washington, D. C., 85 specimens from Costa Rica and Nica-
ragua (gift); F. W. True, U. S. National Museum, and D. W. Pren-
tiss, jr., Washington, D. C., 142 specimens collected in Alaska; Richard
C. McGregor, Palo Alto, Cal., 119 birds from California and Colorado.

The material received during the year has been catalogued and dis-
tributed in the various series of the collection, and a considerable
number of unidentified species have been determined. Mr.J.H. Riley,
of Falls Church, Va., gave his services gratuitously for about six
mouths, during which time valuable assistance was rendered in the
matter of cataloguing. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Department of
Agriculture, has been engaged for a year or more in rearranging the
neotropical series, and several families of Passeres have received atten-
tion. This work is also done gratuitously, and has been performed out-
side of office hours.

Mr. Ridgway states that a large amount of incidental work has
been performed, such as furnishing information of a technical character
in response to requests received through the mail ; the preparation of a
card catalogue of the sectional library; the preparation of data relat-
ing to the type material in the department, and the reading of proof
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. By

and the verification of references in the Bibliography of Dr. P. L. Sclater,
which will shortly be published by the Museum as No. 49 of the Bulletin.

A number of additional cases for the storage of specimens have been
provided. Several of these cases will be placed in the west basement,
and the remainder in the gallery. The extensive additions to the col-
lections during the last two or three years have rendered an entire
rearrangement necessary. Such a readjustment is made the more
urgent by the fact that the collections in the west basement are more
or less inaccessible, and to some extent exposed to the ravages of
insects. That portion of the study series which is installed in the
bird gallery is in good condition.

The material exhibited at the Cotton States and International Expo-
sition at Atlanta was returned and placed in position during the year.

Mr. Richmond made a collecting trip to Smiths Island, Va., and Mr.
William Palmer, chief taxidermist, collected birds in Florida. Explo-
rations resulting in additions to the collections have also been under-
taken by twenty-four other persons, the names of some of them having
already been mentioned in this review. The names of the others will
be found in the accession list (Appendix 11).

Material for investigation has been sent to thirteen different individ-
uals and establishments, and eight persons not connected with the
Museum have visited the building and made use of the collections.

Thirty-six papers based upon material in this department have been
published during the year by the curator, assistant curator, and other
collaborators. In these papers one new family, four new genera, and
thirty-four new species and subspecies are described.

The number of specimens received, including those added to the
Department of Agriculture collection, was 8,488. This is the first year
in which any large number of specimens from the Department of A gri-
culture have been entered. Although the material is the property of
the Museum, it is, as a matter of convenience, installed and catalogued
separately for the present. The total number of specimens in the col-
lection is now over 86,000. The addition of the duplicates would bring
the figures up to about 100,000.

The catalogue entries for the year were as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS’ EGGS.

The honorary curator of this department, Maj. Charles Bendire,
States that the number of accessions was slightly less than during the
preceding year, but that the scientific value of the material received
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

during both years was about equal. The largest accession was from
Dr. W. L. Ralph, Utiea, N. Y., who has long been regarded as one of
the most valued contributors to the Museum. This collection con-
sisted of 88 nests and 911 eggs, representing 206 species. Other
important contributions were received from the following: Dr. James
©. Merrill, United States Army, Fort Sherman, Idaho, 6 nests and 99
eggs, representing 12 species; Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States
Army, Cambridge, Mass., 5 nests and 65 eggs, representing 14 species;
United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross, through Mr, F. W.
True and D. W. Prentiss, jr., 35 specimens, representing 10 species;
Elmer J. Judd, Cando, N. Dak., 25 eggs, representing 3 species;
United States Department of Agriculture, 32 specimens, representing
8 species. Twenty-eight eggs and 6 nests were purchased from Mr.
H. P. Attwater, San Antonio, Tex.

All of the material received has been properly catalogued and
labeled, and the exhibition and study series are in excellent condition.
It would be very desirable to increase the former if the necessary
space were available.

The honorary curator mentions the names of thirty-five persons
whose cooperation has resulted in enriching the collections. The
Department of Agriculture and the United States Fish Commission
have also made valuable contributions to the collections of this
department.

The number of eggs received during the year was 1,729, and of nests
154. The last catalogue entry in June, 1595, was 27655, and in June,
1896, 28138.

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

As stated in the last annual report, the curator of this department,
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, was detailed in the spring of 1895 to accom-
pany a Government expedition to Alaska and the adjacent islands for
the purpose of studying the seal rookeries. Dr. Stejneger was absent
for a considerable portion of the fiscal year covered by the present
report, and in June, 1896, he again left for the north, having been
appointed by the President a member of ‘a special commission, author-
ized by joint resolution of Congress, to investigate the condition of
the seal herds. For these reasons the regular operations of the
department of reptiles and batrachians have been considerably inter-
fered with.

The number of specimens received and entered on the catalogue has
been smaller than during the preceding fiscal year, although this 1s
partially accounted for by the fact that the year last referred to was one
of unusual activity. The scientific value of the material is no less in
proportion than that attaching to the accessions of the previous year,
some very interesting collections having been received from South
America and Madagascar, as well as from various parts of the United
States. Hight specimens of a blind batrachian from an artesian well
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. sy!

at San Marcos, Tex., were received from the United States Fish Com-
mission. They represent anew genus and species, described by Dr,
Stejneger as Typhlomolge rathbuni. This is regarded as one of the
most remarkable herpetological discoveries of recent years. Other
accessions by gift included one from Dr. W. L. Abbott, consisting of a
series of reptiles collected by him in Madagascar, and one from Lieut.
Wirt Robinson, United States Army, consisting of a collection of rep-
tiles and batrachians from La Guayra and Margarita Island. A series
of reptiles and batrachians from Argentina was received from the
Museo de la Plata, in exchange.

The curator’s visit to the islands in Bering Sea yielded very little in
the way of collections for this department, owing to the absence of
batrachians and reptiles in the localities visited. A specimen of a
rare salamander (Salamandrella wossessenskii) was, however, obtained
in Kamchatka. It is the only species occurring there, and had not
been previously represented in the Museum collection. Mr. F. W. True
secured some specimens of snakes and toads on Vancouver Island, and
an interesting collection of snakes from the Dismal Swamp, Virginia,
was obtained by Mr. William Palmer of the National Museum.

Regarding the condition of the various series in the department, the
curator Says:

The collection was gone over systematically several times, and the alcohol
“strengthened and replenished as required, The exhibition series still consists only
of the separate casts, the yellow-boa group and the group of North American turtles
and poisonous snakes. Thestudy series is divided into the North American series,
the exotic series and the duplicates. The former are all in separate jars and bot-
tles; a portion of the exotic series is still in storage jars, while most of the duplicates
are kept in tanks.

Owing to the prolonged absence of the curator, and the fact that
after his return he has been engaged principally in bringing the routine
work up to date, but little has been done in the way of conducting spe-
cial investigations upon the material under his care, beyond the descrip-
tion of the new genus and species of batrachian already referred to.

Specimens have been sent to a number of individuals for study,
as indicated in the chapter devoted to transactions of that character,
and special facilities were accorded to Prof. EK. D. Cope for study-
ing material in the department in connection with his forthcoming
monograph.

Among those whose cooperation has been of value to this department
mention should be made of Mr. Julius Hurter, St. Louis Mo., and Mr.
W. L. Sherwood, New York City.

Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by
the curator during the year.

There were 329 specimens received and eutered, the last number in
the catalogue on June 30, 1895, being 22482, and on June 30, 1896,
22811. The total number of specimens in the collection is estimated
at over 35,000.
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES.

The number of accessions to the department of fishes during the
year was not so great as during the preceding year. Their scientific
value was also somewhat less. A collection of fishes from Nebraska,
Wyoming, and South Dakota was received from the United States
Fish Commission; also from the same source a collection of types of
fishes from the Albatross collections in the North Pacific, as well as
soe material obtained by the same vessel in that locality and in
Bering Sea in 1890 and 1891, A collection made by Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger in Bering Sea and the vicinity of Kamchatka deserves special
notice. A few specimens obtained from the Island of Yesso by Mr.
Grebnitzki were also received.

The honorary curator of the department, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, is
still in New York City, as superintendent of the New York Aquarium.
_ Mr. Barton A. Bean, the assistant curator, states that during the
year the collections have been carefully attended to, the bottled speci-
mens having been kept covered with alcohol, and the old labels replaced
by new ones where necessary. The collections on the shelves in the
fish hall have been condensed by placing several specimens of the
same species in one jar. Considerable additional shelf space was thus
secured. Some large and valuable collections resulting from explora-
tions in the North Pacific by the steamer Albatross were installed
during the year. An unusually large number of specimens were dis-
tributed, including several sets of deep-sea fishes, which were sent to
some of the principal museums in Europe.

The honorary curator and assistant curator have prepared reports
upon the fishes collected in the vicinity of the Commander Islands by
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. N. Grebnitzki; also upon the fishes
collected by the latter in Kamchatka and Japan. At the close of the
fiscal year Dr. Bean had in course of preparation a report upon the
fishes collected in 1887-88 by the Albatross, in South American waters.
Mr. Barton Bean is assisting in this work.

In January, 1896, Messrs. B. W. Evermann and W. A. Wilcox, of
the United States Fish Commission, and Mr. Barton Bean, made an
investigation of the fish and fisheries of Indian River, Florida. A
report upon these investigations was made to the United States Senate.

Among the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collec-
tions, those already referred to indirectly were probably of the most
importance, namely, those of the steamer Albatross, in the North
Pacific, of field parties sent out by the Fish Commission to the western
portion of the United States, and the expedition to Florida. A small
collection was also made by Rey. P. H. Sérensen, in Greenland.

Material has been sent out for study on a number of occasions, and

several ichthyologists have examined the collections in the Museum
laboratory.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

Dr. Theodore Gill, Associate in Zoology, has published a number of
papers on fishes during the year. These are based upon Museum
material, some of them containing descriptions of new species. De-
seriptive papers, based on the collections, have also been published by
other collaborators.

Strenuous efforts will be made to improve the condition of the collec-
tions by setting aside surplus or duplicate material. The preparation
of an exhibit of deep-sea fishes, from 1,000 feet and lower, is contem-
plated. This exhibit, it is expected, will prove of great interest.

About 3,000 specimens were received during the year, the catalogue
entries embracing Nos. 47505 to 47687, inclusive. The total number of
specimens in the collection is estimated at 150,000.

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS.

The honorary curator, Dr. W. H. Dall, states that there was a slight
increase in the number of. accessions during the year, the total having
been 118, while the total for 1894-95 was 111. On the whole, the year
has not been marked by anything unusual in the growth of the collec-
tions, although many valuable specimens were added. An excellent
local collection of shells from Texas, made by Mr. J. A. Singley, was
purchased with funds supplied by Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York
City. Many very valuable foreign Unios, and other specimens new
to the collection, were derived from the same source. In addition,
some works have been purchased for the sectional library during the
year through Dr. Chamberlain’s generosity. Others who have steadily
contributed to the collections in this department, and who are thereby
entitled to be regarded as regular contributors, are Hon. J. D. Mitchell,
Victoria, Tex., who presented a number of species of Unios and other
specimens from his locality; Mr. and Mrs. T. 8. Oldroyd, Los Angeles,
Cal.; Mr. F. F. Crevecceur, Onaga, Kans., who sent in a number of
species of land and fresh-water shells; Mr. Henry Hemphill, San Diego,
Cal., from whom between thirty and forty species of marine mollusks
from San Diego, and other material, was received; Mr. P. B. Randolph,
Seattle, Wash., who sent many specimens from his locality; Dr. C. F.
Newcombe, Victoria, B. C., from whom marine shells were received;
and Dr. W. L. Abbott, who sent material from eastern Madagasear.
The addition of greatest importance was the Fish Commission mate-
rial transferred from the Peabody Museum, New Haven, Conn. This
material has been in the hands of Prof. A. E. Verrill for some years
for study, and is now being gradually transmitted to the National
Museum.

As stated elsewhere, the exhibition series is in good condition, and
much has been done in connection with the study series. The excel-
lent system adopted in the installation and registration of these collec-
tions will be fully appreciated only when the entire work has been
completed.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

This matter is thus referred to by Dr. Dall:

The entry of additions to the collection in the register of the department has been
carried on as usual. The principal item of work accomplished during the year has
been the thorough revision of the basement storage room, in which alcoholics and
duplicates are kept. All the bottles have been cleaned and filled up, when necessary,
with additional alcohol, the contents catalogued, and each bottle given a number
referring to the catalogue, which has been made on cards arranged alphabetically,
so that by reference to the cards it can at once be seen whether any particular species
is on hand in spirits. If so, the bottle can be reached in a moment, the jars being
arranged in numerical order on the shelves. In cases where there was an excessive
amount of material in alcohol, the excess has been removed, dried, and cleaned, and
placed in the series of dry duplicates, of which a similar card catalogue has been
made, the specimens being placed in numbered covered boxes, so that by reference
to the cards any species can be reached in a few moments.

The number of jars of alcoholic specimens catalogued so far is 2,002.

The number of dry duplicates in boxes, catalogued, is 4,174 species or lots. All
are in perfect order, and with a view to preserving the jars better from dust, which
soils them and obscures the labels, the shelves have been provided with covers of
enameled cloth. ;

There is also a considerable number of jars of alcoholics in the north tower, which
it is hoped to catalogue and label in a similar manner during the coming year.
When these are completed, the entire collection of alcoholics and duplicate recent
shells will have been put into excellent order.

Various installments of specimens have been received from Prof. A. E. Verrill dur-
ing the year. These, as they were received, have been checked off on the lists, the
species segregated, and transferred to the standard sizes of tubes and papertrays. I
have deferred incorporating them with the reserve collection until the whoie series
shall be received, so as to make one job of the transfer, which even then will
involve a great amount of work.

The series of mounted specimens, illustrating the chief families of mollusks, which
was prepared by Mr. Marshall and Mr. Simpson for exhibition as part of the Museum
material at the Atlanta Exposition, has been placed in one of the exhibition cases in
the main hall.

We have still a large amount of unregistered material, especially in the Jeftreys
collection, which will be handled from time to time, as opportunity serves, until all
arrearages are made up; but in the absence of expert assistance the progress in this
direction will necessarily be slow.

In order to make sure that each specimen in the collection is cor-
rectly identified, and to unify the nomenclature, a large amount of work
will eventually be required. Work of this character must be per-
formed by a specialist in each group.

Dr. Dall states that he has completed a report upon the collections
of land shells made during the progress of the Mexican Boundary
Survey, by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army. This collection
contains the largest additions to our fauna of this region for many
years. A number of additions to the fauna of the coast of Texas, col-
lected by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, have been described or elucidated; also
collections made at San Pedro, Cal., by Mr. and Mrs. T.S. Oldroyd, and
in Puget Sound and vicinity, by Messrs. P. B. Randolph, of Seattle,
and Dr. ©. F. Neweombe, of Victoria, British Columbia.

A discussion of the land-shell faunas of voleanie oceanic islands,
forming a report on the collections made at the Galapagos Islands, by
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

Dr. G. Baur, of the Chicago University, has been completed. The
type specimens upon which it is based are in the Nation:] Museum.

Mr. Robert John Lechmere Guppy, Port of Spain, Trinidad, whose
collection of Antillean fossils was purchased by the Museum some years
ago, forwarded descriptions of some supposed new species, to be printed
in the Proceedings, the types being part of the National Museum collec-
tion. The new forms have been figured, and a joint paper by Dr. Dall
and Mr. Guppy, on Antillean Tertiary fossils, has been completed, and
is now in the hands of the printer.

Work on the Neocene fauna of Florida has been carried on as oppor-
tunity served, and will be continued until the study is completed. Mr.
Charies T. Simpson has continued his studies on the Naiades. The
superficial anatomy of a considerable number of species has been exam-
ined, and notes and descriptions prepared. Much time has been spent
in searching the literature and preparing cards of synonymy for use
in a synopsis of the Naiades.

A number of persons have been engaged in making collections with
a view to working out the fauna of their respective localities, submit-
ting all puzzling or doubtful forms to the department for examination.
These correspondents in most cases donate types of new or interesting
material to the national collection. Explorations carried on by Hon.
J. D. Mitchell, Victoria, Tex.; Dr. C. F. Newcombe, Victoria, British
Columbia; Mr. leap 6 be erabipn. Seattle, Wash., and Mrs. T. 8S. Oldroyd,
Los Angeles, Cal., were especially productive of good results. Collec-
tions were also made by F. F. Crevecceur, Onaga, Kans.; Dr. Charles
L. Gwyn, Galveston, Tex.; J. A. Singley, Giddings, Tex., and the Young
Naturalists’ Society, Los Angeles, Cal. Reference has already been
made to the material obtained.

Dr. Dall states that during the year one hundred and forty applica-
tions for the identification of specimens, for advice as to conchological
literature, ete., were received from more than one hundred different
individuals. The furnishing of this information involved the identifica.
tion of over three thousand species, and the writing of over one thou-
sand pages of correspondence by the honorary curator and Mr. Simpson.
It has always been the practice to grant requests for the identification
of material, but the number of applications in recent years has been so
great that it has become necessary to formulate a set of rules! by which
individuals sending specimens for this purpose should be governed.
In these regulations it is stipulated that the material must be sent free
of expense to the Museum, unless otherwise agreed upon, and that the
localities from which the specimens were obtained, must be given. The
Museum reserves the right to retain, except under special arrange-
ment, specimens needed to complete the national collection.

No one, other than those connected with the staff, has been engaged
in a regular course of study in the department. Probably as any as

1 Cireular 47, U.S. N. M.
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

a hundred have, however, received verbal information or have been
accorded the privilege of examining specimens in the study series.

‘Twenty-one papers, based upon material in the department, have been
published by Dr. Dall, and five by Mr. Charles T. Simpson. One paper
has also been published by Mr. G. D. Harris. The titles of these
papers appear in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv), and in the supple-
ments to the latter will be found the names of a large number of species
described, as well as of one family and several new genera.

It is proposed to continue the work on the collections now in pro-
eress until the arrears have been registered and catalogued, the Jef.-
freys and Verrill collections administered upon, and the duplicates
eliminated from the reserve series. This will require a considerable
amount of time, owing to the extreme pessure of current work.

The total number of specimens received during the year, exclusive
of fossils, was 3,173. The number of entries made in the regular cata-
logues of recent mollusks was 5,449. The following paragraphs contain
information as to the other clerical work performed, and also as to the
present extent of the collections:

Besides the entries in the register of the reserve collection there have been 175
entries in the register of drawings, 1,628 entries in the register of duplicates, and
3,630 entries on cards for card calalogues, showing a total of 12,103 entries of all
kinds during the year ending June 30, 1896.

The additions to the reserves sum up 20,010 specimens, making, when added to
last year’s figures, a total of 544,398 specimens in the reserve collection. <A very
low estimate of the number of duplicates will place them at 12,522 specimens. The
specimens in alcohol, already catalogued, amount to 20,020, while the unregistered
material will add, when catalogued, about 28,000 specimens, making a grand total
of about 600,000 specimens in the department of mollusks, exclusive of fossils.

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS.

There have been several changes in the personnel of this department
during the year. Prof. C. V. Riley, who had served as honorary cura-
tor since 1882, and who rendered very valuable service to the Museum,
died on September 14, 1895. A biographical sketch of his life and
work will be found under the head of Necrology.

Mr. L. O. Howard, who succeeded Professor Riley as entomologist of
the Department of Agriculture, has been appointed honorary curator
of the department of insects in the National Museum. Four honorary
custodians have also been appointed during the year, each having
charge of a special branch of work, as follows: Mr. W. H. Ashmead, the
Hymenoptera; Mr. D. W. Coquillett, the Diptera; Prof. O. F. Cook,
the Myriapoda, and Mr, E. A. Schwarz, the Coleopterous larva. Mr.
M. L. Linell continues to act as aid.

The accessions during the year numbered one hundred and thirty-
five, an increase of thirty-six over the preceding year. It is believed
that, taking the accessions as a whole, they were five times as valua-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

ble as those received in 1894-95. The most important accessions were
as follows:

Collection of Arachnida of Dr. George Marx, on deposit from Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Collection of insects of all orders from Texas, made by Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and
C. H. T. Townsend, and presented by the Department of Agriculture.

Microhymenoptera from Grenada, West Indies (eighty-three species including fifty-
five types), presented by the British committee for zoological exploration of the West
Indies.

Types of thirty-eight species of North American Empidx, presented by D. W.
Coquillett.

North American Melanopli (twenty-one species, including seventeen types), from
Dr. 8. H. Seudder, Cambridge, Mass. (Gift.)

North American Noctuidie (seventeen species including tifteen types), from Prof.
J. B. Smith, New Brunswick, N. J. (Gift.)

Collection of parasitic Hymenoptera of Ceylon, from E. Ernest Green, Punduloya,
Ceylon. (Gift.)

Collection of Coleoptera from Egypt and Europe, consisting of about three hun-

The biological collections in Lepidoptera have been completely re-
arranged in cabinet drawers, and the collection of Melanopli, lent by Dr.
Scudder, and the African Lepidoptera, lent by Dr. Holland, were
installed. A rearrangement of the North American Coleoptera has
been commenced, the families Scarabieide and Cerambycide having
already been finished. The recent accessions of Hymenoptera and
Lepidoptera have been incorporated in the collections. A portion of

the exhibition series is displayed in the lower hallway leading to the
offices of the department. The systematic series, since its return from
the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, has been
placed upon exhibition, while the exotic showy insects prepared for
the same Exposition have been distributed in the study collections.
The reserve collections for study are, generally speaking, in good con-
dition. In order to properly classify the Lepidoptera, however, much
work must still be done. The types have not yet been catalogued
except in this order.

A large amount of scientific work has been accomplished by the
members of the staff during the year, as will be seen from the following
extract from Mr. Howard’s report:

The curator has published a revision of the Aphelinine of North America, and a
paper on the “Grass and Grain Joint-worm Flies and their Allies,” in Technical
Series Nos. 1 and 2, United States Department of Agriculture. These papers are
based upon Museum material. He has also completed, but not yet published, a
report on the Chalcididie of the Island of Grenada, and, conjointly with Mr. Ash-
mead, a brief paper on some reared parasitic Hymenoptera from Ceylon.

Mr. Ashmead has completed and published his report on the parasitic Hymenoptera
of the Island of Grenada, comprising the families Cynipidw, Ichneumonide, Braco-
nid and the Proctotrypidx, submitted by Dr. David Sharp on behalf of the com-
mittee for investigating the flora and fauna of the West Indian islands. He has
also described a new genus and two new species of Proctotrypide from Trinidad,
submitted by Mr. F. W. Urich; and in a paper published in the Transactions of
the American Entomological Society, Philadelphia, June, 1896, he described a large
number of new parasitic Hymenoptera. During the year, besides rearranging some
of the families of the Aculeate Hymenoptera and Hemiptera, he identified several
hundred species of Hemiptera and between two and three thousand species of
Hymenoptera for correspondents of the Department of Agriculture. Monographic
work is also being done on the families Braconidee, Cynipid, and Chalcidide.

Mr. Coquillett has published a revision of the North American genera and species
of Empide, in which four new genera and sixty-six new species are described.
Types of all of these new forms are now in the National Museum. He has also
identified the Culicide in the National Museum, and described three new species
in the Canadian Entomologist for February, 1896, and in a paper on the Diptera
of Florida, published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia for 1895, he described a new species of Platywra and one of Drosophila
from specimens in the National Museum. He is now engaged in identifying the
Tachinid in the National Museum collection, and has nearly completed a monograph
of the same.

Mr. Linell has completed reports on the Japanese Coleoptera (Acc. 27854), on the
Coleoptera of the Chanler and Héhnel expeditions, and on the insects collected by
Dr. W. L. Abbott on the Indian Islands, north of Madagascar. A restudy of the
North American Coleoptera of the families Scarab:eide and Cerambycids has resulted
in two descriptive papers, now being published in the Proceedings of the National

Museum.

Of the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections,
nearly all were confined to localities outside of the United States. The
material obtained is referred to in the list of important accessions given
above, and only a brief reference will therefore be made in this place.
The British West India Committee for Zoological Exploration conducted
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

explorations on Grenada Island; Dr. W. L. Abbott collected in Mada-
gascar and Turkestan; the Chanler-Hoéhnel expedition to Jombéné
Range, East Africa, collected insects and other material; the United
States Department of Agriculture sent Messrs. EK. A. Schwarz and
C. H. Tyler Townsend to Brownsville, Tex., to investigate the Cotton
Boll-weevil; Dr. Leonhard Stejneger visited the Commander Islands
and Kamchatka and incidentally collected a number of insects; Mr.
F. W. True, of the United States National Museum, and Mr. D. W.
Prentiss, jr., of this city, visited the Pribilof Islands while temporarily
in the service of the United States Fish Commission; Prof. C. V. Riley
and Mr. H.G. Htubbard went to the West Indies in the spring of 1895;
Mr. W J McGee collected during his trip to Tiburan Island, Gulf of
California, and Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and H. G. Hubbard collected in
the vicinity of Salt Lake, Utah.

Material has been sent from the department to fourteen individuals,
including several prominent specialists in various orders. In some cases
the specimens were transmitted for identification, and in other instances
they were desired for comparison. <A few investigators not connected
with the Museum have made use of the collections in the department.

The honorary curator mentions the names of eight correspondents who
have made contributions and who have received publications in partial
exchange. Exchanges of specimens have been arranged with nine
other individuals in this country and abroad, The correspondents who
have sent material for identification which has been retained in the
Museum number fourteen.

Thirty-three papers based upon Museum material have been published
during the year by members of the staff, and seventeen by other
collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in the Bibliography
(Appendix Iv). A very large number of new species are described.
The names of these are given in the supplements to the Bibliography.

About 7,000 specimens were added during the year, exclusive of
the Marx collection, which was received on deposit and embraces
about 10,000 specimens. The last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895,
was 1584, and the last on June 30, 1896, 1789, giving 205 entries for the
year.

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

This department remains in charge of Mr. Richard Rathbun as hon-
orary curator, with Mr. James EK. Benedict and Miss Mary J. Rathbun
as assistant curators.

During the year a study of the Annelids of the west coast of tropical
America was commenced, and work on a monograph of the American
Brachyura and special researches on the genera Pseudothelphusa and
Sesarma have been carried on. Mr. Benedict made a study of some new
svecies of blind Crustacea taken from an artesian well in San Marcos,

NAT MUS 96 5

66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Tex., preliminary descriptions of which have already appeared in the
Proceedings. Complete descriptions will be published later. Miss
Rathbun has prepared an annotated list of the Decapod Crustacea of
Jamaica, for publication by the Institute of Jamaica. A paper con-
taining descriptions of the new forms will be published in the Proceed-
ings, and is now in press. Miss Rathbun spent about two weeks in
the summer of 1895 examining literature relating to the Crustacea
in the libraries of Boston and Cambridge.

There were sixty-nine accessions to this department during the year.
Generally speaking, the accessions for the present year were not so
large or so important as those of the preceding year, although the
material received from the United States Fish Commission exceeded
in value that of the accessions obtained from the same source during
1894-95.

The principal additions to the collections during the year are thus
described by the curator:

From the United States Fish Commission were received six accessions, compris-
ing a large amount of material collected by the steamer Albatross, chiefly in the
Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea; also the following: Crustacea collected during the
cruise to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, representing groups Podophthalma, Copep-
oda, pelagic Schizopoda, Pantopoda and larvie of Stomatopoda; medusze and.
hydroids studied by Prof. J. Walter Fewkes; Crustacea from St. Paul Island, Bering
Sea, collected by Messrs. F. W. True and D. W. Prentiss, jr.; invertebrates from
Kamehatka and the Commander Islands, collected by Dr. L. Stejneger, and inverte-
brates from Japan, collected by N. Grebnitzki. (Gift.)

From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria, through Dr.
Franz Ritter von Hauer, fourteen species of echinoderms dredged by H. M. 8. Pola
in the eastern Mediterranean, 1890-1894. (Exchange.)

From the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, through Dr, Ehrenbaum, forty-six
species of Crustacea from the North Sea. (Exchange.)

From Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Waterworks, South Australia, four acces-
sions of Crustacea and other invertebrates from Australia. (Exchange. )

From Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, N. Y., through L. M. McCormick, curator,

water crabs, including several new species. (Gift.)

From H. Pittier, director, Instituto Fisico-geografico Nacional, San José, Costa
Rica, twelve lots of Crustacea from Gulf of Dolce, Costa Rica, several species being
rare. (Gift.)

From P. W. Jarvis, Colonial Bank, Kingston, Jamaica, specimens of crabs, includ-
ing many new and rare forms. (Exchange. )

From Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, twelve species (one new) of
erustaceans and echinoderms from Venezuela  (Gift.)

From H. F. Hughes, Harbor, Oreg., specimens of two undescribed species of
hydroids. (Gift.)

From H. A. Lafler, Dewitt, Nebr., three accessions of fresh-water Crustacea. (Gift.)

From Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., three species of Brazilian
crabs (Callinectes). (Exchange. )

From Samuel J. Holmes, Chicago, IU., three anomuran crustaceans. (Exchange.)

From Prof. A. Dugeés, Guanajuato, Mexico, eight specimens of crabs (Pseudothel-
phusa jouyi, Rathbun). (Gift.)

Material resulting from explorations, as will be noted from the above
statement, embraced that received from the United States Fish Com-
mission; from the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna;
from the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, and from the United
States Department of Agriculture.

A great deal of time is consumed by the scientific force of this
department in the selection and preparation of collections sent out in
exchange or as gifts. The composition of the sets of the regular series
of duplicates has been set forth in previous reports. The last set of
Series Iv was sent out during the year just closed, and seven sets of
Series v were distributed. Twelve special sets were prepared, several
of which were for exchange with foreign museums or individuals. In
addition, nine collections of unassorted foraminiferous material were
distributed.

A fine collection of miscellaneous invertebrates, including a number
of commercial sponges, was lent to the United States Fish Commission
for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at
Atlanta. For the exhibit of the National Museum at the same Exposi-
tion a large and showy collection of invertebrates, consisting chiefly of
dried specimens mounted on tablets, was prepared by Mr. Benedict,
who was assisted in this work by Prof F. M. Comstock, of the Case
School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio. The work of installing
this exhibit at the Exposition and of repacking it for shipment to Wash-
ington occupied Mr. Benedict’s time for one month.

About 4,200 lots of specimens, consisting chiefly of mollusks, have
been received from the Peabody Museum, New Haven, where the work
of separating and classifying the material collected by the Fish Com-
mission in past years has been continued by Professor Verrill.

The following statement regarding matters incident to the care of
the collections is taken from the curator’s report:

The former ‘‘reptile room” in the west basement was reassigned to this depart-
ment early in January. New and commodious shelving was erected in the middle
of the room, and the extra accommodation afforded for alcoholics permitted a more
systematic arrangement of the collections in storage in the basement. The groups
are now arranged in the main as follows: The echini, starfishes, and holothurians
are in the west room; the anthozoa and crinoids in the reptile room; the crusta-

ceans, bryozoans, ascidians, and ophiurans in the main basement room, and the
sponges are arranged in exhibition cases.
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

In transposing the collections the small tower room leading from the gallery was
abandoned, and also all the cases in the hall of the west basement. Se

The northwest tower, opening from the exhibition hall, was fitted with additional
shelving, and certain collections of annelids and anomurans which were needed for
study, and other material, has been stored there.

During the year the alcoholic collections have been examined, alcohol added to
replace that lost by evaporation, and stoppers and rubbers renewed where necessary.

A new card catalogue has been started, with cards of the library bureau size.
Labels printed on red paper are now used for jars and bottles containing type speci-
mens, and a white label with the word ‘‘type” printed in large red capitals is placed
inside the jar.

An exceedingly interesting addition to the exhibition series in this
department consists of a type series of Foraminifera mounted for micro-
scopic examination in such a manner as to make it readily accessible
to the public. This series was prepared by Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S.N,,
who has prepared for publication a description of the method of mount-
ing and also of the specimens included in the series.

An article containing instructions for the preservation of specimens,
and intended especially for collectors on board ship, was prepared for
publication by the Fish Commission.

In addition to the paper already mentioned as having been published
by Mr. Benedict, five others, based upon Museum material, have been
published by various collaborators. Several new genera and some
thirty-five new species are described in these papers.

The work already planned for the future includes the placing upon
exhibition of one or more specimens of each species of invertebrates in
the Museum collections whose bathymetrical range exceeds 1,000 feet;
the preparation of an educational series embracing all of the principal
groups of invertebrates, for distribution to high schools and academies,
and the preparation of a complete card-catalogue of the types in the
department, with reference to the original description, type local-
ity, etc.

The number of specimens received during the year exceeded 4,800.

HELMINTHOLOGICAL COLLECTION.

Several series of specimens have been added to this collection during
the year, the most important being the one deposited by the Bureau of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture. The accessions
include some very valuable specimens.

Owing to lack of space, it has been impossible to make much prog-
ress in the work of administering upon the collections, although new
labels are being installed throughout. An effort is now being made to
collect types and cotypes from Europe and America.

The work of the custodian, Dr. C. W. Stiles, has included a revision
of the adult tapeworms of hares and rabbits.

Pending the entry and cataloguing of the specimens received from
the Bureau of Animal Industry, no estimate can be given of the num-
ber of specimens in the collection. More than 1,400 entries have been
made in the catalogue since the last report, making a total of 1,550
entries to June 30, 1896,

Several papers have been published by Dr. Stiles during the year,
the titles of which will be found in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The accessions have been fewer than during the preceding year,
although the material received is reported by the curator, Mr. F. A.
Lueas, to possess considerable scientific value. A skeleton of Ponto-
poria blainvillei, for a long time a special desideratum, was received
from the La Plata Museum in exchange.

Toward the close of the fiscal year it became necessary to remove
all the cases from the exhibition hall, in order to lay a new floor. This
effectually prevented, for the time being, any additions to or improve-
ments in the exhibition series.

Regarding the actual work upon the collections, Mr. Lucas says:

Aside from the moving of specimens, necessitated by changes in the workroom,
exhibition hall, and basement of stable where alcoholics are stored, little has been
done, the greater part of the time of the preparator having been devoted to the
preparation of specimens for the department of mammals and the Department of
Agriculture, and work connected with the Atlanta Exposition. Copy has been
prepared for many labels, and some additions have been made to the synoptic series
of invertebrates. A number of additions have also been made to the exhibition
series in the way of skeletons and models acquired for the Atlanta Exposition.

The study series is in good condition, except that the specimens
are crowded. This is due in part to the fact that it has been necessary
to assign considerable space to the Department of Agriculture deposit,
necessitating the storage of some of the Museum material, and the
transfer of nearly all of the cetaceans to the rooms occupied by the
department of mammals.

Mr. Lucas has commenced a study of the changes in the skull of
the cormorants, and has continued his studies of the tongues of birds
and their modification and adaptation to various kinds of food and
the manner of obtaining it. A study of the skull of the extinct Pallas
Cormorant has been completed. Other investigations, which are being
conducted by Mr. Lucas in connection with his work in vertebrate
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

paleontology, are referred to in the review of the department of paleon-
tology.

Ten papers have been published during the year by the curator. He
also completed and edited a posthumous paper of Dr. Joseph Leidy on
“Fossil Vertebrates of the Alachua Clays of Florida.”

Among those who have cooperated with the department, Lieut. Wirt
Robinson, United States Army, and Mr, A. W. Anthony, San Diego,
California, should be mentioned, the former having contributed several
species of humming-birds in alcohol, and the latter some specimens
of petrels.

Referring to the further development of the department, Mr. Lucas
submits the following plans:

It would be very desirable to fill up the gaps in the exhibition series of birds, rep-
tiles, and fishes, to extend the tooth series and that showing the modifications of the
dermis and epidermis, and to add to the synoptic series of invertebrates.

A few changes of irons and pedestals are needed among the mammals, and a large
number of labels should be supplied where they are now lacking. Finally, the
exhibition series needs much rearrangement, as also does the study series.

In regard to scientific work, the curator would like to complete the study of the
development of the skull among the cormorants, and, if material can be obtained,
to finish work on the osteology of the cormorants in relation to the origin and dis-
tribution of the group. It is hoped that the paper on the fossil bisons of North
America may be completed and work begun on the Dinosaurs of the Potomac. | It
is also desirable to continue the study of the swifts and of the modifications of the
tongues of birds, while the paper on the Zeuglodon, undertaken in conjunction with
Mr. True, should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.

About the middle of June, 1896, Mr. Lucas started for the Pribilof
Islands as a member of a special commission appointed by the Presi-
dent to investigate the present condition of the fur-seal herds on the
Pribilof, Commander, and Kurile islands.

The number of specimens added during the year is as follows:
Fishes, 51; reptiles, 62; birds, 69; mammals, 17; models, 8; total, 207.
There are now over 15,000 specimens in the collections. The last cat-
alogue entries at the end of the year just closed and at the end of the
preceding year are shown in the following table:

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY.

This department remains in charge of Mr. Chas. D.Walcott, Director
of the United States Geological Survey, who holds the position of hon-
orary curator.

it bake

The scientific value of the material received has been far greater
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. G1

than that of the accessions in the preceding year. An increase is also
noted in the number of accessions. A collection of vertebrates, made
under the direction of Prof. O. C. Marsh, which has been on exhibition
in the Museum for several years, was formally transferred from the
United States Geological Survey. There were also received from the
same source one hundred and fifteen boxes of unprepared vertebrate
material from Kansas, a valuable collection of Green River fishes, a
series of specimens studied by Professor Leidy and Mr. Lucas, a few
fossil insects collected by Mr. David White, and an identified collee-
tion of Cephalopoda, studied by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge,
Mass. Mr. Charles Schuchert, the assistant curator, collected for the
Museum an extensive series of Devonian fossils, embracing about six-
teen thousand specimens. These were obtained in New York, Ontario,
and Michigan. Over two thousand six hundred specimens of Middle
Cambrian fossils from Newfoundland and from St. Davids, Wales, were
purchased from Mr. E. E. Howell, of this city. Another installment of
fossil plants, together with a series of fossil fishes, was received from
Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. A large and valuable collection of
fossils from various horizons, collected by the late Dr. Daniel Breed,
was transmitted through Prof. B. T. Janney, administrator of the
estate. This material was received in part as a gift and in part as an
exchange. Mr. George Kernahan, Thedford, Ontario, contributed an
excellent collection of Middle Devonian fossils, embracing 442 speci-
mens. A collection of teeth and bones of mammals, exhibited at the
Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, was given to
the Museum by the Peace River Phosphate Company of Florida.
From Princeton College there were received in exchange skulls of
Ischyromys typus, Leptauchenia major, and Eucrotaphus bullatus. From
Dr. Herman Credner, Leipsic, Germany, fourteen specimens of Branchio-
saurus amblystomus were obtained in exchange. In the same manner a
collection of fossils and casts was secured from the Museo de la Plata,
La Plata, Argentina; a large collection of Clinton and Niagara fossils,
including many graptolites, from Col. Charles C. Grant, Hamilton,
Ontario; thirty-six species of Russian Cretaceous fossils from Prof. A.
Pavlow, Moscow, Russia; and a collection of characteristic Middle
Devonian fossils from Mr. R. Macintosh, Thedford, Ontario. Four fine
fossil meduse, from the Jurassic of Germany, were purchased from
Dr. F. Krantz, Bonn, and other material worthy of mention was con-
tributed as follows: Several collections of fossils from Galveston, Tex.,
from Mr. J. A. Singley; a collection of Lower Carboniferous fossils from
Dr. J. H. Lemon, New Albany, Ind.; two collections of interesting
fossils from the Choteau formation of Missouri, from Mr. R. A, Blair;
and a series of characteristic Middle Devonian fossils from Mr. Maleom
McKinnon, Thedford, Ontario.

present fiscal year. The collection was formally offered to the Museum
in December, 1891, and its extent and extraordinary scientific value
were referred to at length in the report for the fiscal year ending June
30,1892. A brief statement of its contents may not, however, be out
of place. The collection was included in three hundred and fifteen

boxes, as follows:

Two hundred and eight boxes, embracing over seventeen thousand specimens of
Paleozoic plants. These include (1) types, and (2) specimens showing variation
of species and geographic and geologic distribution. The contents of thirty-four of
these boxes have not yet been determined.

Two boxes of Paleozoic plants.

Ninety boxes of duplicate Paleozoic plants.

Two boxes of Triassic fishes.

Two boxes of Paleozoic fishes.

One box of Paleozoic Crustacea.

Three boxes of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary plants.

Seven boxes, including eight hundred and four specimens of plants from the
Dakota group, described in Monograph xvu, United States Geological Survey.
One hundred and twenty-five of these specimens are types, and fifty-five were
figured in the Monograph.

The motive of the donor in presenting this material, as stated by
himself, was the belief that this disposition of it would best fulfill his
purpose in the formation of the collection, which was to accumulate as
complete a series as possible of the older fossil flora for use in paleon-
tological research. No conditions were imposed which would in any
way interfere with the proper use of the collection. It was desired,
however, by the donor that it should be known as the ‘ Lacoe Collec-
tion,” and that it should be kept entire, with such additions as might
be made to it in the future by further contributions from himself or by
the exchange of duplicates. That the material should be made acces-
sible to students generally is in accordance with the established rules
of the Museum, and that every effort should be made for the proper
preservation of so valuable a collection was a foregone conclusion.
This collection represents the results of the scientific labors of Mr.
Lacoe for twenty years or more. Not being satisfied, however, with
the time which he could devote to the work in person, he employed col-
lectors in various States and in the Canadian Provinces, and also
expended large sums of money in the purchase of private collections.
About seven hundred and fifty published types are embraced in that
portion of the collection which has been described. The series illus-
trating the morphology of species and their geographical and geolog-
ical distribution includes over seventeen thousand specimens. While
the collection represents more thoroughly than any other in existence
the fossil flora of the Pennsylvania anthracite regions, there are, in addi-
tion, good series from Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, and other States, as
well as from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Brazil. Besides the
plants from the Paleozoic formations, there are examples of the Creta-
ceous and Tertiary flora of Colorado, a series of Triassic and Paleozoic
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

fishes and Crustacea, and a collection of eight hundred and four plants
from the Dakota group. <A portion of the latter was, as already men-
tioned, described by Professor Lesquereux, in Monograph xvi of the
United States Geological Survey. Professor Lesquereux also studied
the material from the Cretaceous and Tertiary of Colorado reterred to
above, and the Triassic and Paleozoic fishes and Crustacea have been
studied by Cope, Hall, Whitfield, and others.

Itis not too much to say that the National Museum has never received
a giftof greater scientific valueor importance than that acquired through
the generosity of Mr. Lacoe.

Interesting data concerning the number of published types of Paleo-
zoic plants in the Lacoe collection, and in the other collections of the
National Museum, are presented in the following tabulated statements:

The collections of this department are also to be enriched by Mr.
I, H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, who has signified his intention of
presenting to the National Museum his magnificent series of fossils.
This collection is the result of the labors of Mr. Harris during the past
fifty years, and is very rich in rare fossils, such as trilobites, crinoids,
and starfishes. It includes also a fine collection of mollusca from the
upper portion of the Cincinnati formation. Mr. Harris and Mr. Schu-
chert are engaged in the preparation of a monograph of American
fossil starfishes, based upon this material.

The present condition of the paleontological collections and the
progress made in caring for and installing the material are indicated
in the following extract from the report of the assistant curator, Mr.
Charles Schuchert:

Much of the time during July was devoted to preparing the Zeuglodon material
gathered by the assistant curator last year. It was chiefly from this material that
the restoration of Zeuglodon was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition. During
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

July and August a small series illustrating some of the characteristic plants and
animals of the various geological horizons was selected, and the specimens mounted
upon tiles in an attractive manner for exhibition at the Be Exposition. This
collection received honorable mention.

From October 22 to about May 15 attention was given to the exhibit and study
collections, but nothing could be done toward the contemplated mounting of the
exhibition series in this department, excepting the Mesozoic and Tertiary plant col-
lections, which are now practically finished. The time from May 15 to July 1 was
devoted to mounting the ‘‘ Historical collection of fossils” in the department of
geology. It was deemed best, before attempting the mounting on tiles of the gen-
eral exhibition collection of fossils, to experiment upon a smaller collection. The
first trial was that of the fossils exhibited at Atlanta, and a second and far larger
test was made with the ‘‘ Historical collection” in the department of geology. It
is now certain that the mounting of fossils upon tiles has decided advantages over
paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The only disadvantage observed is
that tiles, because of the somewhat greater thickness necessary for their stability
and flatness, are heavier than the other kind of tablets. This disadvantage, how-
ever, is not a fatal one. Considerable time during the year was given by Mr. David
White, assisted by Messrs. Williard and Whipple, toward the further arrangement
of the study series of the Lacoe collection. This work is not yet completed, and
will not be until another case is built in the east room of the south tower. That
portion of the Lacoe collection on exhibition remains in the same condition as last
year. It is, however, hoped to complete, mount, and label this series during the
next fiscal year.

While considerable time has been devoted to the invertebrate study series, much
more work will have to be done before any intelligent selection can be made for
the final exhibition series. The exhibit collection of vertebrates is in fair order,
but more space is required to relieve it of its present congested condition. In
the last annual report it was suggested that permanent cases be built along the
north wall of the southeast court. Much vertebrate material is nearly ready for
installation, and more will soon be at hand, for all of which additional space is
necessary.

Eight hundred and eighty boxes of fossils are in storage, awaiting development
and installation in the exhibition or study series.

The duplicate fossils are being removed from the study series as fast as possible,
and laid aside for future exchange and distribution.

The Director of the United States anaes Survey has recently appointed Mr.
H. E. Dickhaut, and the Museum, Mr. T. E. Williard, as preparators under the
direction of the assistant curator. ee sil progress hereafter far more rapidly
with the material in the Museum building, and it is hoped that some of the fossils
now in storage will be removed during the year. However, the staff of this depart-
ment has had in the past all it could do to arrange the collections as they came in
from the field or from individuals.

Each summer various Geological Survey parties send in collections, and it is the
custom for this department to assist in their preparation for study and in recording
the material upon the Museum catalogues.

The Lacoe collection is not yet completely housed. This is due, in part, to the
fact that the Museum has no paid officer directly in charge of fossil plants. How-
ever, Mr. David White has made considerable progress in this direction, and it is
hoped, with the assistance of Mr. Williard, to complete the installation of the col-
lection during 1896-97.

Considerable scientific work, based upon material in this depart-
ment, has been accomplished during the year... The preparation of a

monograph on American fossil starfishes, by the assistant curator, Mr.
Charles Schuchert, and Mr. I. H. Harris, has been referred to. Mr.
76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Schuchert has also completed a study of the American fossu Apodide,
the manuscript of which has been turned over to the editor. The “Syn-
opsis of American fossil Brachiopoda,” by the same author, referred to
in the last Annual Report, was completed during the present year,
and is now being revised. A short summary of this work has already
appeared in Science. The titles of two or three other papers by Mr.
Schuchert are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Mr. F. A.
Lueas has begun a study of the character and affinities of the spe-
cies of Zeuglodon, and a study of the species of the North American
bison, with synopses of their salient characters, is well advanced. A
posthumous paper of Dr. Joseph Leidy, edited by Mr. Lucas, has been
published. It is entitled ‘Fossil Vertebrates from the Alachua Clays
of Florida.” Mr. David White has made considerable progress with
the description of new species in the Lacoe collection, regarding which
Professor Lesquereux left some manuscript. Dr. R. R. Gurley has in
preparation a revision of American Graptolites. This work will be
published by the United States Geological Survey, but is based upon
material which will become the property of the Museum. Mr. T. W.
Stanton has published a work entitled ‘‘Contributions to the Creta-
ceous Paleontology of the Pacific Coast.” This is an illustrated work,
and contains descriptions of about fifty new species and one new genus.

The explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections
include those of Mr. Schuchert in New York, Ontario, and Michigan,
already referred to indirectly in the statement regarding important
accessions, and those made by the United States Geological Survey.
Much of the material collected by the Survey during the present year
has not yet been transferred to the Museum. It includes, however, a
fine collection of Lower Silurian fossils from Valeour Island, Lake
Champlain, and a collection of trilobites from Rome, N. Y. Although
the Zeuglodon material collected by the assistant curator in 1894 was of
great interest and value, no good skull and none of the bones of cer-
tain portions of the skeleton were secured. For this reason it is very
desirable to continue these explorations with a view to securing the
missing parts, if possible.

Material for study has been sent to ten specialists during the year.
Dr. R. R. Gurley, Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass., and Prof.
H. F. Osborn, American Museum of Natural History, New York City,
conducted investigations in the department. These matters are refer-
red to more at length in the chapters entitled “Material Lent for
Investigation” and “The Work of Students and Investigators at the
Museum.”

A preparator of plants and invertebrate fossils has been employed
during the year. It has not yet been possible, however, to appoint a
preparator of vertebrate fossils, although the need for such an assistant
is greatly felt. The necessity for additional cases to relieve the crowded
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 77

condition of the collections is also pressing, and is referred to in the
report of the department as follows:

It is urgent that cases be provided at an early date to relieve the present congested
condition of the vertebrate collections and to provide space for the rapidly accumu-
lating material. There are two hundred and twenty-five boxes of vertebrate material
now in storage, awaiting a preparator. The preparation of this material for study
and exhibition will occupy all the time of one man no less than three years, and it is
to be hoped that means will be available during 1896-97 to secure such a person.

* * * * * * oy

All the rooms now occupied by the various sections in the department of paleon-
tology are crowded, and, while here and there small areas are available for additional
cases of standard drawers, more exhibition space is required. This is especially so
in the section of vertebrate fossils, since nearly all of the organisms are large and
can best be housed in the exhibition series. Space for these collections can be
secured if permanent cases are built around the walls of the southeast court and the
standard cases now occupying that space be placed upon a gallery. Ifsucha gallery
is built in the southeast court, ample exhibition and storage space will be at hand
for the natural increase of the collections during the next few years.

Further drawer space is necessary to complete the housing of the Lacoe study
collection. More than two-thirds of this collection is now stored in the two upper
rooms of the south towers of the National Museum building. The west room is
completely occupied with cases provided with standard drawers, while the east
room is but half occupied. “f

DEPARTMENT OF PLANTS (NATIONAL HERBARIUM).

The number of accessions for the year was two hundred and _ thirty-
six, aS against six hundred and seventy for the preceding year. There
was, however, no falling off in the number of specimens included, but,
on the other hand, a slight increase. The question of scientific value
is of greatest importance, however, and when the accumulations of the
year are measured by this standard the results are very gratifying.

Among the important accessions were five lots of Mexican plants,
purchased from Mr. E. W. Nelson, and aggregating two thousand four
hundred specimens; five hundred and eleven specimens presented by
the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, India; fifty-eight specimens presented
78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

by Baron Ferd. von Miiller, Melbourne, Australia; one hundred and
thirty-five ferns presented by Hugo Fink, Cordova, Mexico; two hun-
dred and thirty-eight specimens from the United States Fish Commis-
sion, and thirty specimens from C. F. Sonne, Truckee, Cal. Valuable
material was received in exchange from the Royal Gardens, Kew,
England, consisting of two hundred and fifty specimens of Umbelli-
ferwe, and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger collected eighty specimens for the
Museum in the Commander Islands.

Many important accessions were also received through the United

The space which can be devoted to the herbarium in the Museum is
much too small for its proper accommodation. Means have been found,
however, for providing a limited amount of additional space, and con-
siderable progress has been made in caring for the collection, as will
be seen by the following statement made by Mr. F. V. Coville, the
honorary curator, It is especially gratifying to be able to report that
the collection is in better condition than at any previous time,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. . 19

One tower room, 12 by 10 feet, has been fitted up with shelves on four sides. This
room is for storing unmounted material. One new balcony has been built, adjoining
the main balcony on the south and running at right angles, covering a floor space
6 by 48.5 feet. This has been furnished with long shelves for the distribution of
specimens; also an herbarium case extending along its entire length. The case con-
tains eight hundred pigeon-holes, and will hold eighty thousand specimens. This
has relieved somewhat the congested condition in the main balcony, although we
shall soon need additional space if the present growth of the collection continues,

Much work has been done in readjusting, relabeling, and shifting of the packages
of plants. While much remains yet to be done, all parts of the collection are read-
ily accessible to the assistants and to visiting botanists. It is not improper to state
here that the collection has never before been in such good condition.

The stamping of the herbarium, which was referred to in last year’s report, has
extended from the Malvacex to the Anacardiacere. The number of specimens thus
stamped is four thousand. It is very important that the whole collection be stamped
as early as possible, but with our present force we are not able to make much progress.

The transportation to the main herbarium of the collection now stored in the
south balcony has been continued, although little progress has been made owing to
other duties. Six thousand specimens have been transferred. This work ought to
be completed during the coming year.

The Department of Agriculture transferred to the Museum in March the collection
of alge, lichens, hepatics, mosses, and ferns. The grasses, conifer, and parasitic
fungi are still in charge of the Department of Agriculture.

The work of selecting and marking the type specimens in the herbarium has been
continued. Thus far nine hundred species have been marked with a type label,
indexed, placed in special sheets, and returned to the herbarium.

During the year thirty-six thousand specimens have been stamped and added to
the permanent collection. This includes twenty-two thousand which have been
mounted during the year and fourteen thousand which were not quite ready for dis-
tribution at the end of last year.

There is no exhibition series in this department. The need of still
more space for the study series will soon become imperative.

Mr. J. N. Rose, one of the assistant curators, has published a report
on Mexican Umbelliferze, mostly from the State of Oaxaca. ‘This paper
contains descriptions of four new genera and twenty-seven new species.
Mr. Rose has also published a number of shorter papers containing
descriptions of new or rare species. During the year he determined
the Polypetale of Mr. C. G. Pringle’s Mexican collection, continued
work upon the collections made by Mr. E. W. Nelson and Dr. Edward
Palmer in the same locality, and began a monograph on the Commeli-
nacee of the United States. In the latter it is intended to include
colored drawings of all the species.

Mr. Charles L. Pollard, assisted by other Washington botanists, has
continued his revision of Professor Ward’s ‘‘Guide to the Flora of
Washington and Vicinity.” It is hoped that the manuscript will be
ready for the printer during the coming winter.

Mr. Coville states that no explorations have been made directly under
the auspices of the Museum which resulted in additions to the collec-
tions in this department, although important material was obtained by
Mr. I’. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger while they were in the
service of the United States Fish Commission. Mr. W J McGee, of
80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

the Bureau of American Ethnology, made a small collection in western
Sonora, Mexico, and considerable material collected by Mr. J. B. Lei-
berg, a field agent of the Department of Agriculture, has been received.

Pleven persons have received material for examination or determina-
tion during the year, and six specialists, not members of the staff,
have prosecuted investigations in the herbarium.

Among those who have rendered valuable service to the department,
the following are mentioned by the curator:

Mr. E. G. Baker, of the British Museum, London, England, named and compared
specimens with types in the British Museum.

Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, critically
determined many Umbelliferie.

Mr. George E. Davenport, of Medford, Mass., critically determined Mexican and
Alaskan ferns.

Mr. M. L. Fernald, of Cambridge, Mass., made many critical determinations.

Mr. J. M. Greenman, of Cambridge, Mass., rendered much assistance in deter-
mining Mr. Nelson’s large collection of Mexican plants.

Mr. George E. Osterhout, of New Windsor, Colo., sent some interesting plants
from his State.

Mr. C. G. Pringle, of Charlotte, Vt., furnished many valuable notes and speci-
mens of Mexican Umbellifere.

Mr. P. A. Rydberg, of Columbia College, New York City, lent specimens and
determined critically a number of large genera, especially Physalis and Potentilla.

Prof. J. M. Coulter, of the University of Chicago, assisted in the determination of
a number of new species of Umbellifere.

Mr. W. N. Suksdorf, of White Salmon, Wash., sent specimens of Umbellifere.

The material in the herbarium has served as the basis of thirty-seven
papers, which have been published during the year by members of the
staff and by other collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in
the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). They include descriptions of six new
genera and sixty-seven new species and subspecies.

More than 17,000 specimens were received during the year, the cata-
logue entries numbering 236.

TRANSFER OF THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM TO THE MUSEUM BUILDING.

When the herbarium was transferred to the National Museum build-
ing in 1894, it was with the understanding that the force engaged in
caring for the collection should be continued upon the rolls of the
Department of Agriculture so long as the appropriations permitted it.
The appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, was largely
reduced, however, and the Department of Agriculture was obliged to
decline to retain these employees on its rolls any longer. It then became
necessary for the Museum to ask for an additional appropriation for
the maintenance of the herbarium, and this has been provided for in
the appropriations for the coming fiscal year. The matter was pre-
sented to the Committee on Appropriations by the Assistant Secretary
of Agriculture and the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-

tion. The letters to the committee urging the necessity of action are
here presented:
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

APRIL 22, 1896.
Hon. W. B. ALLISON,
Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate.

DeEaR Sir: In response to your desire, communicated through Mr. Coville, for
further information as to the purpose and effect of granting to the National Museum
an additional sum of $10,000 for the maintenance of the National Herbarium, I have
to reply as follows:

When, nearly two years ago, the Secretary of Agriculture found the Department
buildings entirely too small, and it was brought to his attention that a large amount
of space was occupied by a collection of plants estimated to be worth $250,000, and
liable at any time to be destroyed by fire, arrangements were made with the Smith-
sonian Institution to house the collection in the fireproof building of the National
Museum. The Department agreed to retain on its rolls, so long as the appropriation
permitted it, the force of assistants necessary in caring for the ec Uection, but the
unexpected reduction in the botanical appropriation, recently made, has forced the
Secretary to ask that he be relieved of this charge.

If the proposed appropriation be made, the force of assistants and mounters now
engaged in caring for the herbarium in the National Museum building will be trans-
ferred to the rolls of that institution, and the places thus made vacant upon the
statutory roll in our division of botany will be filled by the transfer of employees
now on the botanical lump sum. No new employees will be appointed as a result of
the change, and the statutory position of assistant curator will be left vacant
during the coming year, either to be abolished in the next agricultural appropria-
tion bill or to be changed to assistant botanist.

Besides the emergency reasons just cited for the transfer of the herbarium, the
Department holds that the care of the collection is properly the function of the
Smithsonian Institution, but that it should always be open te the botanists of
the Department for reference and consultation in any investigation in which they
need it. The object, and the sole object, of the proposed change is to place the
herbarium in good hands and in its legitimate place, so as to enable the Department
to organize all the botanical work on a directly practical basis.

Respectfully,
CuHas. W. DABNEY, Jr.,
Assistant Secretary.

N. b.—This letter is written in connection with that of the Acting Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, dated April 22, 1896, addressed to the Hon. W. B. Allison,
Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, which is our author-
ity for the above statement with regard to the part to be performed by the National
Museum and Smithsonian Institution.

APRIL 22, 1896.
Hon. WILLIAM B. ALLISON,

Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate.

Sir: I deem it my duty to bring to your attention the fact that unless some special
provision is made for its maintenance, the National Herbarium, recently transferred
from the care of the Department of Agriculture to that of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, will become comparatively useless.

This is one of the largest collections of American plants in the world, and one of
the most important, embracing as it does the collections of all the Government sur-
veys from the time of Fremont and Wilkes to the present day. It contains about
two hundred and fifty thousand specimens, mostly American, and constitutes for
American botany a consultative library of specimens of the very greatest impor-
tance. Init there are many types of American plants not to be found elsewhere,
and it is constantly consulted, either personally or through correspondence, by all
working botanists in America.

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Although the Smithsonian Institution has always been responsible for the admin-
istration of this herbarium, it was for many years relieved of the care and expense
of this work by the Department of Agriculture. In the fall of 1894, however, the
present Secretary, finding himself unable to give it proper accommodation, and also
thinking it might suffer destruction if kept longer in a building which is not fire-
proof, requested the Secretary of this Institution to resume its direct custody ;
promising, however, that so long as funds should be available for the purpose in
the hands of the Department of Agriculture, he would be responsible for its support
and maintenance.

The value of the collection was so great that the Secretary did not feel at liberty
to refuse to receive it, and it was at once transferred, although at a very great
inconvenience, since our Museum building is so crowded that several of its depart-
ments were seriously discommoded by the change.

From that time until now the herbarium has been maintained from the appropri-
ation of the Department of Agriculture; but the appropriation for botanical work
has been so much decreased by the present Congress, that, as I am informed, this
can no longer be done.

The Secretary of Agriculture has already addressed a letter to you, calling your
attention to this fact, and suggesting that the sum of $10,000, which was withdrawn
from his appropriation, be added to our appropriation, ‘‘for the preservation and
increase of the collections in the National Museum,” in order to provide for the util-
ization of this great collection of plants.

I need scarcely say to you that the collection is of special importance tothe Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and is necessarily in constant use by many of its staff.

Should this addition to our appropriations not be made, I do not see how it is pos-
sible to do more for the herbarium than simply to preserve it from destruction. It
can not be kept in such shape that it will be conveniently available for reference;
it can not be increased in order to keep pace with the growth of botanical knowl-
edge and the necessities of American botanists and of the Department of Agricul-
ture. Nothing can be done with the great amount of material which is already on
hand, which requires special treatment for its preservation and utilization. It will
also be impossible to carry on the system of exchange, long practiced, by which not
- enly the National Herbarium but all the herbariums of the country are constantly
benefited.

Should the sum of $10,000 be provided, it would be utilized in the first place by
the retention of the staff of skilled assistants, clerks, and preparators already
engaged upon this work and now on the rolls of the Department of Agriculture.
The direct charge of the herbarium would be, as now, in the hands of the Botanist
of the Department of Agriculture, who, by permission of the Secretary of Agricul-
ture, serves in this capacity without compensation, with the title of honorary cura-
tor in the National Museum. There are also two skilled assistants, one at $1,800
and one at $1,200, and it is desired to add another at $1,500 to take charge of the
collection of cryptogamic plants. There is also a typewriter and clerk at $900, one
preparator at $720 and three at $600, making in all $7,920.

Supplies and materials for preservation cost annually about $1,000, about $800 of
this sum being required for the purchase of paper for mounting and covers.

A certain sum is required each year for the acquisition of new material, the types
of new investigations, and the results of explorations of the year. For this a sum
of about $750 is required. This would leave a contingent sum of $330.

Should the desired sum be granted, it will be possible to maintain this vast collec-
tion, which is of much importance to botanical science, in a manner befitting the
dignity of the nation.

I am, sir, with great respect, G. Brown GOODE,
Acting Secretary.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS.

Special attention has been given to the work of securing material
illustrating the associations, occurrence, and typical development of
minerals of specific localities. This has indirectly been the cause of a
great increase in the scientific value of the collections during the year.
The report of the honorary curator, Prof. I’. W. Clarke, states that all
the collections show a steady and highly gratifying growth. Three of
the accessions comprised material deposited by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution for addition to the Lea collection. These included a collection
of gems, semi-precious stones, and minerals from the southern states;
a nugget of native silver, weighing 448 ounces, from Pinal County,
Ariz., and a specimen of green tourmaline—a cut stone weighing 574
carats and valued at $1,500. This material was presented by Dr. lL. T.
Chamberlain to the Smithsonian Institution, and by the latter deposited
in the National Museum. It is another evidence of Dr. Chamberlain’s
unstinted generosity by which the Museum has benefited so largely in
the past.

Of the other accessions by gift the following are deemed worthy of
special mention: A collection of minerals from the Copper Queen Mine,
Bisbee, Ariz., presented by the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining
Company, New York City; specimens of lawsonite from F. L. Ransome,
through H. W. Turner, United States Geological Survey; a specimen
of lorandite, a new species of mineral, from George L. English & Co.,
New York City; specimens of Georgia bauxite and associated minerals
from the Georgia Bauxite and Mining Company, Linwood, Ga.; a
specimen of caswellite, a new species of mineral, from Franklin, N. J.,
presented by Col. G. Cesar; a collection of minerals from Marion County,
Ark., exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition
at Atlanta; a collection of distorted selenite crystals and other minerals
from Hants County, Nova Scotia, presented by Dr. M. C. Smith, Lynn,
Mass., and specimens of quartz crystals, distorted and highly moditied,
from Arkansas, presented by Charles F. Brown, Hot Springs, Ark. A
large slab of agatized wood from Chalcedony Park, Arizona, was depos-
ited by the Drake Company, St. Paul, Minn., and a specimen of thau-
masite from a new American locality was purchased from George L.
English & Co.

The time of the honorary curator is occupied to so great an extent
in connection with his position as chief chemist of the United States
Geological Survey that the care of the collections has devolved very
largely upon the assistant curator, Mr. Wirt T'assin. The many minor
details of installation, consisting of reblocking, mounting, developing
crystals, etc., have been carried on continuously, with the result that a
marked improvement in the appearance of the collections is noticeable.

An investigation of the minerals of Italian Peak, Colorado, is now
in progress, while earlier in the year a large amount of time was spent
in the study of comparative mineralogy.
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Under the head of explorations mention is made in the curator’s
report of the material secured by the field parties of the United States
Geological Survey, and also of the collections obtained by the assistant
curator in the zinc regions of New Jersey. A nearly complete set of
the minerals of this region was secured.

Reference to the work of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the United States
Geological Survey, who prosecuted certain investigations in the depart-
ment during the year, will be found in another place.

The honorary curator has published three papers during the period
covered by this report.

Among the plans proposed for the future, special reference is made
by the curator to the establishment of a series illustrating mineral
technology.

Nearly 1,100 specimens were added to the collection. The last cata-
logue entry in June, 1895, was 83613, and in June, 1896, 83761.

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY.

The number of permanent accessions during the year was eighty-
eight, as against seventy-nine for the preceding year. There were also
one hundred and sixty “temporary” accessions, consisting of material
received for examination and report. This is an increase of thirty-eight
over the preceding year. The value of the material received during the
year covered by this report is considerably greater than of that received
in 1894-95, owing to the character of the specimens obtained by pur-
chase for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition
at Atlanta.

Among the important accessions, the following are mentioned by the
curator, Dr. George P. Merrill:

(1) Collection of gold and silver minerals, purchased for the Atlanta Exposition.
Value, $600.

(2) Two slabs of serpentine marble from Westfield, Mass.; septaria nodules from
England; alabaster from Tuscany, and obsidian from Lipari.

(3) A collection of nonmetallic minerals, rocks, ete., and five hundred and six
thin sections of iron ores, collected during the work of the Tenth Census, but just
turned over to the department by Prof. R. Pumpelly.

(4) One stalactite from the Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Ariz. (Purchase.)

(5) Amphora and other vessels of stalagmite from Egypt. (Purchase.)

(6) Collection of one hundred and sixteen specimens of gold and silver ores from
North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, received from the United States
Geological Survey.

(7) Collection of rocks and soils from Bermuda. (Gift of Dr. D. W. Prentiss. )

(8) Columnar sandstones from Zittau, Germany. (Gift of A. Kraus, United States
consular agent.)

(9) Lithological collections, representing some five hundred specimens, collected
in various parts of the United States. (From the United States Geological Survey.)

A portion of the material received during the year was collected by
the curator personally.

Regarding the care of the collections, Dr. Merrill says that over six
hundred printed labels for the exhibition series have been received from
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85

the printer during the year, and that copy has been prepared for about
five hundred more. The card catalogue of the exhibition series has been
kept up to date, and a limited number of cubes of building stones have
been cut. About two hundred thin sections were prepared, and over
three thousand five hundred duplicate specimens identified, labeled, and
laid aside for future use. It is proposed to sort out and prepare for dis-
tribution all the duplicate material in the storeroom, with a view to
utilizing this space for the study series, the latter having outgrown its
present accommodations. A large proportion of the exhibition cases
in this department are floor uprights, and have no space for storage.

A number of the exhibits require rearranging, but this matter will
be deferred until the question of erecting balconies shall have been
decided. The exhibition series is fairly well labeled, although many
typewritten labels are at present in use.

The investigations of the curator have consisted mainly of studies
relating to rock weathering and to the composition, character, and
origin of material belonging to the nonmetallic economic series. He
has devoted special attention to asbestus, ochres, and soapstones.
About fifty analyses have been made in connection with investigations
relating to rock weathering and the formation of soils.

A considerable number of specimens, including many thin sections
of rocks, have been lent to various persons for study, Reference to
these transactions will be found in another place.

Among those whose cooperation has been of value during the present
year the name of Mr. F. W. Crosby, of this city, should be mentioned.
The department is also indebted to the United States Geological Sur-
vey for a large proportion of the most valuable material acquired.

Five papers have been published by Dr. Merrill during the year,
three of which appeared in publications of the National Museum.

Regarding the future development of the department, the curator
States that the quality of the material in the collections could in many
instances be improved by substituting new specimens, but that desir-
able specimens can, as a rule, be obtained only by purchase or by the
employment of a paid collector. Occasionally, however, such specimens
are to be secured by exchange.

The present condition of the collections is indicated in the following
Statement:

The catalogue entries show that one thousand one hundred and sixty-two speci-
mens have been received during the year. This includes both exhibition and study
material. It does not, however, include the five hundred and oda microscopic slides,
which are never catalogued. Several of the entries are those of collections includ-

ing from one to several specimens each.

The last entry in the catalogue on June 30, 1895, was 62781, and on
June 30, 1896, 63469.

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY.

The value of the accessions during the fiscal year just closed is not
so great as during the previous year, owing to the fact that in 1894-95
a considerable quantity of material was obtained especially for exhibi-
tion at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta.
Since the return of these exhibits the curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason,
has been occupied in installing such as could be placed upon exhibition,
the remainder having been put in storage.

The most important accession of the year was from Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, consisting of more than one thousand five hundred specimens
of antiquities from the Pueblo region. This is regarded as the most _
valuable material ever received by the National Museum from the
southwest. An important collection of ethnological specimens was also
sent in by Dr. W. L. Abbott. This material was obtained in the Vale of
Kashmir. Dr. Washington Matthews, United States Army, presented
« small but valuable collection of paints and dyes used by the Navajo
Indians, and from the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy, through
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, an interesting series of specimens was received in
exchange. Among other accessions the following may be noticed: A
collection from New Guinea, made by Dr. A. C. Haddon; a collection
of objects designed to illustrate the cannibal ceremonies of the Fort
Rupert Indians, made by Dr. Franz Boas; a series of two hundred and
six specimens from the Lubny Museum, Poltava, Little Russia; and a
small collection obtained by the United States Fish Commission in
Alaska.

Upon the return of the coilections sent to the Atlanta Exposition, a
radical change was necessitated both in the exhibition halls and in
the storage rooms. In the chapter entitled ““‘The Development and
Arrangement of the Exhibition Series” will be found a paragraph
relating to the rearrangement of the halls. In the upper story of the
north tower on the west side of the building are stored such objects as
can not be arranged in cases or drawers, while in the third story
the entire collection of Eskimo costumes, snowshoes, and objects con-
nected with personal adornment and with travel are packed away. In
the small room on the lower floor of this tower a large portion of the
Dorsey Mohun African collection is stored, together with the collection
of breech-loading firearms, the series of foods and medicines, and a
number of other objects. The corresponding room in the south tower
is filled with swinging screens and unit boxes. All manuscripts, cata-
logues, drawings, and photographs relatin g to the collections have been
placed in the rooms in the second story of the south tower. The curator

States that the material not on exhibition is in better condition than
ever before.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87

The ancient pottery, not including that from the Pueblo region, hav-
ing been transferred to the department of prehistoric anthropology,
the work of preparing, in the northwest court, an exhibit illustrating
the life of the Pueblo tribes, has been continued. In this the curator
has had the assistance of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and Mr. Frank
Hamilton Cushing.

A great deal of time has been spent in preparing a catalogue of the
material received by the department of ethnology during the last fifty
years. The task has now been finished. Not every specimen has
been catalogued separately, but, in the words of the curator, ‘every
specimen that would seem to have any value in a comprehensive and
comparative study.” The work of checking off on this catalogue the
material sent out by the department, through exchanges with other
museums, still remains to be done. <A large number of specimens have
also been withdrawn from time to time for the purpose of establishing
the various sections included under the department of arts and indus-
tries. These should be checked off in a similar manner, but in order
to perform this task, additional clerical help is needed.

The preparation of a comprehensive work on the practical arts of
the American Indians is at present occupying the attention of the
curator. He has in view the work of establishing a series of types
characterizing the arts practiced in various culture-regions. In this
undertaking he is making use not only of the material in the National
Museum, but is also utilizing trustworthy data obtained from other
sources. A systematic plan has been laid out, and a large number of
illustrations have been already prepared.

Under the head of Explorations, and in addition to the valuable
material obtained by Dr. Fewkes in Arizona, which has already been
referred to, reference should be made to a collection obtained by Mr.
James Mooney, illustrating the various phases of life among the Kiowa
Indians.

Only a small quantity of material has been sent out for study during
the year. It is the effort of the department to induce investigators to
conduct their studies in the building, where the student finds many
things which would otherwise escape his observation. The curator
also is frequently enabled by this method to obtain information from
those who have prosecuted extensive investigations along certain lines.
In another chapter reference is made to the researches of some of these
students. A study of the Eskimo lamp has occupied the attention of
the assistant curator, Dr. Walter Hough, for a considerable length
of time.

The department has profited by the generous cooperation of many
persons. Through the offices of Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Sec-
retary of State, a large number of specimens have been secured for the
Museum, and among others who have rendered service in various ways
Mr. W.S. Hill, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Tacoma, Wash. ;
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

Prof. F, W. Putnam, Cambridge, Mass.; Rev. H. C. Mabie, Boston,
Mass., and Dr. Franz Boas, American Museum of N atural History,
New York City, should be mentioned.

Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by
the curator during the year, and one by the assistant curator. The
titles of these are included in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Six
lectures were delivered by Professor Mason at Columbian University on
“Primitive arts in their relation to Sociology as illustrated by the col-
lections in the United States National Museum.”

Regarding the plans of the curator for the further development of
his department, the following paragraphs are quoted from his report:

The curator would respectfully make the following suggestions with regard to the
development of the department of ethnology: First, that hereafter collections from
the American continent should be made with especial reference to completing, as far
as possible, illustrations in things of the technical life of all the principal tribes
and families of America. * * * In order to understand the true life of the abo-
riginal tribes of the Western Hemisphere, this Museum ought to contain a typical
specimen from each of them belonging to every one of the great domestic indus-
tries; for instance, there should be a model of every kind of house ever lived in by
any large number of people on this continent. There ought to be in every one of
these collections, in miniature, in picture, or in description, the prevailing and cus-
tomary furniture of the kitchen, the dining room, the bed room, the living room, and
the social gathering room or its equivalent, indoors or out of doors. There should
be in picture, in miniature, or in actual specimens, every kind of costume worn by
a large number of individuals in every one of these tribes. Of course, it would be
impossible to represent, in such a collection, all the little eccentricities of dress
among savage people, where great varieties prevail among individuals of the same
family. After all, in every tribe there is a composite dress, a dress which would
take in pretty much all the dress of the tribe, and of this typical dress there should
be in this Museum one example from each tribe.

There should also be gathered the tools used by all those tribes for all sorts of pur-
poses ; for pounding, cutting, boring, smoothing, and various other purposes of common
use. The metric appliances of all the tribes should be here, and in sufficient numbers
to set forth the characteristics of each tribe. There should be a comprehensive
series relating to the great industries of their lives; quarrying, mining, fishing, hunt-
ing, planting and gleaning, the intermediary arts by which the substances gathered
in the primary arts are transferred to the uses of life, and the final arts and activi-
ties by which these products of industry are turned into the channels of consump-
tion or enjoyment. Also the apparatus by which substances are moved from
place to place upon the backs of men or beasts, whether on land, on water, or on
snow. ‘This, of course, would make an ideal collection, but instead of gathering
in a desultory way duplicates of material already in hand, the curator is now in
possession of information which enables him to say whether a specimen which
it is possible to acquire will fill one of the gaps herein indicated, or will add one
more to a collection already containing a superabundance of such material.

There were 1,556 entries made in the catalogues during the year,
embracing 2,828 specimens.

DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

The curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, states that the scientific value of
the collections received during the past year compares favorably with
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89

tne genera average of preceding years. He believes that a comparison
which takes into account only the number of specimens acquired would
be of little value, inasmuch as during the preceding year the extensive
collection deposited by Dr. Roland Steiner was catalogued, besides
several other large lots of material, which resulted altogether in
making the year 1894-95 one of the most notable in the history of the
department.

The accessions during the year covered by this report embrace
another collection of archeological objects from Dr. Roland Steiner;
a number of paleolithic implements, fragments of Roman pottery
and of Samian ware, fourteen specimens of animal bones, and a skull
of a victim of the plague of 1549, from the Horniman Museum, Lon-
don (exchange); a collection of human skulls and bones from a
burial cave near Duffield, Scott County, Va., received from Mr.
A. L. Pridemore, Jonesville, Va.; a polished stone implement found
near Olympia, Wash., from Mr. R. H. Hannah, of that city; a series of
implements obtained from the gravels of the Thames and from the
chalk plateau of Kent, England (purchase); a number of specimens
from W. P. Damon, West Auburn, Me. (exchange); implements, orna-
ments, vessels, etc., presented by Mr. Newton H. Chittenden, Mill
River, Berkshire County, Mass.; pottery and vessels from mounds in
Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee, sent by Capt. J. R. Johnson, Pitts-
burg, Pa., in exchange; large chipped digging implements and other
specimens of flint from Kentucky, presented by Mr. Paul Weir, Owens-
boro, Ky.; three bone whistles from an ancient grave on San Clemente
Island, Cal., presented by Mr. J. Neale Plumb.

A coliection of more than eight hundred archzeological objects from
Michigan and Alabama was lent to the department for study and
examination by Mr. Percy IF. Matthews, Florence, Ala., and Mr. War-
ren K. Moorehead, Columbus, Ohio, sent a small number of specimens
for the same purpose.

The following statement regarding the progress made in caring for
the collections is quoted from the report of the curator:

Two additional storerooms have been fitted with shelves during the past year. One,

in the south tower, has been utilized for the reception of North American pottery,
mostly fragmentary, but still useful for study and exchanges. The other, in the
southwest tower, has been filled with pottery from Central and South America, con-
sisting principally of entire vessels.

All the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican collections were
placed on exhibition, necessitating a rearrangement of the cases already devoted to
objects from these countries.

As many as possible of the entire vessels from mound explorations in the United
States were also placed on exhibition, and the remainder stored on shelves in the
rear of the long wall case at the east end of the hall, All this material was received
from the Museum building.

In addition there were packed and sent to storage 71 boxes containing stone
implements, fragments of pottery, human bones, etc. These were part of the collec-
tions received from the Bureau of Ethnology and were temporarily stored on the floor
of the anthropological hall, The aisles and passageways are now entirely clear.
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

There is no separate study series in this department. The exhibi-
tion series is in as good a condition as at any previous time. <A series
of transparencies, to be placed in the windows of the anthropological
hall, is in course of preparation.

A paper on the Swastika sign, by the curator, was published in the
Museum Report for 1894. The preparation of several other papers by
Dr. Wilson has now been nearly completed. The titles of those pub-
lished during the year, so far as they are based upon Museum material,
are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). A number of lectures
have also been delivered by the curator.

Mr. John W. Emmert, of Bristol, Tenn., a former employee of the
Bureau of Ethnology, and Gen. A. L. Pridemore, of Jonesville, Va.,
conducted certain explorations, on a small scale, under the auspices of
the Museum, and a considerable quantity of material was secured. The
curator, also, spent a few days in July, 1895, in exploring caverns in
Ross and Hocking counties, Ohio. The time devoted to this work was
necessarily very limited, but the observations made show that the caves
had never been occupied by man, or that all traces of such occupation
have been destroyed or effaced.

Material for study and for the purpose of illustrating lectures has
been sent to persons outside the Museum on several occasions during
the year, and some of the members of the scientific staff of the Museum
have also borrowed material for use in their investigations. Mr. J. D.
McGuire, Ellicott City, Md., has studied specimens belonging to the
department in connection with the preparation of a paper on prehistoric
pipes.

In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned,
twelve others are referred to as having cooperated with the department
during the year.

The views of the curator with regard to the policy which he believes
should be followed in the future are here given:

Within the last ten years the collection in this department has increased from
65,000 to 209,346 specimens. This material is all useful, not to say necessary, in aid-
ing to perfect our knowledge of the origin, growth, and culture of prehistoric man.
But to use it for this purpose requires not a change, but an enlargement of the plan
heretofore pursued. It is proposed by this enlargement to classify the implements
and objects as rigidly and in as much detail as possible. This classification or
division should deal with the object, its form, material, and function, and extend to
localities, narrowing them as much as possible. This scheme applied, for example,
to the State of Pennsylvania, would divide the State into the localities of the Valley
of the Delaware and Susquehanna on the east, and on the west the Allegheny and
Monongahelarivers, following them and their branches to the head waters, if need be,
independent of State lines, In this way it would be possible to compare the imple-
ments of these valleys in three different sections of the State and see what differ-
ences were manifested. It is hoped, also, that it would be possible to determine the
differences in the industry or culture of these localities. The classification of mate-
rial would probably enable us to assign the stones of which the various implements
were made, to their respective quarries and localities. A comparison between the
implements of the various localities thus divided would show the commerce, if it did
not show the migration, between the various peoples who occupied these localities.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 91

This scheme should be carried out with all the implements and extended to all
localities, and they should be described correctly, fully, and in detail, each different
kind having two illustrations, one the large and the other the small size, and one or
the other of them should have an edge view as well as a side view. When this is
done, we shall have a fairly accurate knowledge of the number and kind, with the
various differences of form and material, of every implement in the Museum, from
every locality.

This can be done only by personal inspection of each object, wherein the cases
must be opened and the objects handled and counted as they are segregated and
classified. This being accomplished, many of the specimens now encumbering the
cases can be retired, and only the type or representative specimen of each class of
implements be retained and displayed; the rest of them may be either boxed and
stored, or may be made up into sets for exchange. The effect of this would be to
reduce the number of objects on display, but, naturally, the best specimens would be
chosen, and therefore the beauty and effectiveness of the display would be increased.
The specimens should be properly figured and described, either in a guide-book or
label, and each implement exhibited would be the representative of a certain num-
ber of other implements not in sight. Thus, they would stand as though the entire
number were on display, and the gorging process now going on would be materially
relieved.

We have, during the existence of the Museum, been preparing for this classifica-
tion and enumeration by the acceptance of all kinds of implements in as great a
number as was obtainable. No fault is found, or to be found, with the policy by
which this great aggregation of the commoner implements was made. It was neces-
sary for the purpose indicated; it is still necessary, and should be continued until
the plan herein suggested shall have been carried out.

There were 5,826 specimens received during the year, the total num-
ber now in the department being 209,346. The last catalogue entry in
June, 1895, was 172315, and in June, 1896, 173061.

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

Technological collections.—Although the number of accessions was not
large, several very interesting series and single specimens were added
during the year. A collection of models illustrating the various meth-
ods of land transportation, and incidentally the development of the
wheel, was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, and installed in
the Museum after its return to Washington. This series embraces
thirty-nine models, and includes also a number of lithographs and pho-
tographs of foreign and American vehicles. The electrical collection
was enriched by the Western Union Telegraph Company, which depos-
ited the original of the first instrument used to record a message trans-
mitted to a distant point by means of electricity. Models illustrating
two electrical wheels, made by Benjamin Franklin in 1748 and described
in his autobiography, were constructed. Mr. Edward L. Morse depos-
ited various decorations conferred by foreign sovereigns upon his
father.

A fine specimen of balsa, used by the Seri Indians, was received
from the Bureau of Ethnology, through Mr. W J McGee, who collected
it in Socorro, Mexico. This specimen was added to the collection
illustrative of naval architecture. Among the models of steamboats
92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

prepared for the Atlanta Exposition and now installed in the Museum
halls, is a series showing early experiments in steam navigation, includ-
ing models of steamboats made by Fitch, Rumsey, Fulton, Stevens, and
Ericsson. A complete model of the steamship Savannah was’ built
under the supervision of Capt. J. W. Collins. In the cases containing
these models are also exhibited important historical relies relating to
the vessels themselves.

‘A valuable series of tanned skins of animals, collected in Panama by
Mr. R. T. Hill, of the United States Geological Survey, was added to
the collection of animal products.

Regarding the progress made in caring for the various coliections, the
following is quoted from the report of the curator, Mr. J. KE. Watkins:

The collection of boats has been overhauled, and a number of models repaired.
The full-sized boats—kaiaks, dug-outs, etc.—have been rearranged upon the ceiling
of the hall to a height great enough to admit an additional amount of light.

Two new cases have been erected in the east hall, and in them the collection illus-
trating the electrical industries and the collection illustrating methods of land
transportation, which was received at the close of the Atlanta Exposition, have
been installed.

The textile collection, which has been scattered for a number of years, has been
brought together with a view to revising it and reinstalling such portions as may be
deemed advisable.

The collection of animal products was not put under the care of the curator until
some weeks after the death of Mr. R. Edward Earll, which occurred in March last,
and since that time it has not been possible to give very much attention to the
collection.

The following statement shows the number of specimens received
during the year, the number of catalogue entries made during the
same period, and the total number of specimens in the collection:

The graphic arts collection—Owing to the absence of the curator, Mr.

5. R. Koehler, during a considerable portion of the preceding fiscal
year, and also during the first half of the year covered by this report,
comparatively little has been done toward the development of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 93

collection. The most interesting addition was a “photo-autocopyist”
outfit, illustrating a method of printing from gelatinized parchment.
Fifty-nine specimens were received during the year, most of these hav-
ing been obtained by the curator during his recent trip to Europe.
Highteen specimens of half-tone work in black and in colors were pre-
sented by Messrs. John Swain & Son, London. Mr. N.S. Amstutz,
who during the preceding year presented a number of copies of photo-
graphs transmitted by means of electricity, has offered to donate some
models of machinery used by himself.
Regarding the condition of the collection the curator says:

The specimens on exhibition speak for themselves. ‘They present the best illus-
tration of the technical development of the reproductive or multiplying arts to be
found on exhibition anywhere, whether here or in Europe. It is not intended to
imply, however, that the collection is complete. The division illustrating the
various methods of drawing and painting is still very incomplete, although full
of interest even in its present state. In the division illustrating the application of
printing to the industrial arts, only a beginning has been made.

A ‘‘study series” hardly exists, the specimens in the storage cases being mostly of
a kind similar to those on exhibition. The collection of patents might be made use-
ful to students, or rather to seekers of information of a practical kind, but it has
been almost abandoned, for the present at least, and under the prevailing condition
of things it is inaccessible to the public.

The collection has now reached such a stage that, according to the
curator, it is impossible to make satisfactory progress without the
expenditure of considerable money in the purchase of specimens; and
even if funds were available for this purpose, lack of room would seri-
ously hamper the efforts of the curator.

Mr. Koehler refers to this matter in the following language:

The section of graphic arts has reached a point where it must rest, unless it is
supplied more liberally with money. The ground to be covered is as well covered
as the facilities so far furnished will permit. The collections need piecing out in
many places, and it is very desirable, also, that some of the specimens now on exhi-
bition should be replaced by better ones. But this can be done only by the aid of
money.

The above applies more especially to the illustrations of the reproductive or mul-
tiplying arts. The development of the collection illustrating the methods of draw-
ing and painting must be left to the future. To make it what it might be or ought
to be, would cost altogether too much money to allow it to be thought of at present.

Whether it is worth while to continue the effort to illustrate the applications of
painting in the industrial arts may remain an open question. With a proper expen-
diture of time and of money, much interesting material could probably be obtained
for this department from manufacturers. But as there is no room to exhibit the
specimens that might be thus obtained, it would be useless to make further eitorts
in this direction, even if the money needed were available, until the erection of a
new building will permit of an enlargement of the section of graphic arts.

After the reconstruction above outlined, of the division embracing the reproduc-
tive or multiplying arts, which is and will probably always remain the main division
of the section, the preparation of a handbook will be in order. Several beginnings
toward such a handbook have been made, but they had to be abandoned, as the col-
lections were too incomplete and the changes in them too rapid to make it likely
that a handbook fitting them would have permanent value.
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

The number of the last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895, was 5561,
and on June 30, 1896, 5620, The total number of specimens now in
the collection, not including duplicates, is 5,620.

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.—
The collection of oriental antiquities is under the honorary curatorship
of Dr. Paul Haupt, while Dr. Cyrus Adler occupies the position of
assistant curator and is also custodian of the collection of religious cere-
monial objects. There were twenty-eight accessions during the year,
this being more than three times the number for the preceding year.
A collection of facsimiles of important codices of the Bible, historical
editions, and manuscripts was acquired by purchase. Twelve manu-
scripts and editiens of the Bible were deposited by Dr. Adler and
three by Dr. Goode. A series of Hittite casts was purchased; also a
cast of a human-headed winged bull, and one of a lion.

A collection of musical instruments, coins, and gems referred to in
the Bible has been formed from material transferred from other depart-
ments in the Museum.

A series of carved ivory plaques was obtained, in exchange, from
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, director of the Royal Zoological Museum, Flor-
ence, Italy; and specimens of pottery from the Cotton Grotto at Jerusa-
lem were presented by Dr. Adler. The accessions also included
twenty-six photographs from Miss EK. R. Scidmore, Washington, D. C.; a
Bible from Dr. S. M. Burnett; seven marble fragments of Greek mytho-
logical figures from Professor Jerichau, Washington, D. C.; and two
Bibles from Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, of the United States National
Museum. A model of a Babylonian temple tower was made in the
Museum. °

An exhibit of biblical objects, comprising about two hundred and
fifty specimens, was prepared for the Cotton States and International
Exposition at Atlanta. This is described more in detail in a paper
published in Part 0 of this volume, in which the results of recent
discoveries and researches in the domain of biblical and oriental arche-
ology are also discussed.

The various objects received during the year have been placed upon
exhibition, and the present arrangement of the collection is set forth
in the chapter on the ‘“ Development and Arrangement of the Exhibi-
tion Series.”

A study of Assyrian and Babylonian seals, based upon the collec-
tions in the Museum, has been begun by Dr. Adler, and two papers
based upon Museum material have been published by him during the
year.

It is proposed to rearrange the Jewish and Mohammedan collections
and to rearrange, classify, and complete the installation of the collec-
tions illustrating the religions of Eastern Asia.

The total number of specimens now in the collection is 3,020, of which
300 were received during the year just closed. The last catalogue entry
in June, 1895, was 154990, and in June, 1896, 155122.

Little Russia; instruments from Borneo and other localities, acquired
through exchange with Mrs. J. Crosby Brown; a virginal from Italy,
secured by purchase; five musical instruments presented by Dr. Wil-
liam L. Abbott, Bombay, India; a single-headed drum from the island
96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

of Gilolo, and a three-jointed trombone from Sumatra, obtained in
exchange from Mr. M. F. Savage, New York City; a small bird-shaped
earthenware whistle, presented by Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant
Secretary of State; and a musical instrument transmitted by Mr. E.
O. Schuyler, New York City, in exchange.

There were 43 entries made in the catalogue during the year,
embracing the same number of specimens. The entire number of
instruments in the collection is now more than 1,300.

Materia medica.—Owing to the rearrangement of the collections in
some of the exhibition halls and the temporary removal of the cases
containing these exhibits, the materia medica collection was rendered
unavailable for exhibition purposes during the greater part of the year.
No special effort to increase the collection was made, therefore, by the
honorary curator, Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. N., and his efforts therefore have
been largely directed to the care and preservation of the specimens
already on hand, and the routine work of the office incident thereto.

This temporary diminution of active work in this section allowed
the curator to devote some time to microscopic work, in which he has
for many years been interested, and in this connection he paid special
attention to identifying, mounting, and arranging for exhibition a
series of Foraminifera for the department of marine invertebrates. A
paper, by the curator, describing a large number of species of Forami-
nifera, is being prepared by Dr. Flint for publication by the Museum.

Coincident with his microscopical studies the curator has devised a
plan for exhibiting microscopical objects not requiring the use of very
high magnifying powers. The instruments used are shown in plates
1-4, and they are best described in Dr. Flint’s own words:

The following description and illustrations of apparatus for public exhibition of
microscopic objects are presented as being pertinent to the subject of the installation
of museum exhibits. The apparatus described is believed to be the first practically
successful attempt to make a series of such objects available for examination by the
public, without extravagant expense or extreme watchfulness.

The first appliance for this purpose, devised by the writer, was an accessory to
the ordinary microscope stand. It consisted of a circular plate of pasteboard made
to revolve upon a pivot attached to the stage, the plate carrying a series of objects
mounted upon small disks or small squares of glass (Plate 1). This accessory was
made in 1885, and described in the American Monthly Microscopical Journal for
November of that year.

This arrangement was only suitable for class use under the immediate supervi-
sion of the instructor, For public use the principle of the rotary stage has been
developed by enlarging the circular plate, inclosing it securely in a box with a glass
top upon which the microscope is fastened, giving a rotary motion to the stage by
means of a friction roller operated by a milled head on the outside of the box, and
a to-and-fro movement effected by a rack and pinion controlled by another milled
head in close proximity to the former. By a combination of the two movements any
portion of the plate may be brought under the microscope, and any number of objects
arranged thereon be brought into the field in succession. The objects being inclosed
in the box are secure from injury; the movement of the microscope for focal adjust-
ment is limited by stops so that the object can not be entirely lost to view; the eye-
pieces are screwed in so that they can not be stolen, and the instrument is practi-

cally safe from everything but malicious mischief. Special mounts are required in
order to increase the carrying capacity of the stage, and for transparent objects the
stage must be perforated in order that the light may pass upward from the reflector
below. The instrument now in use in the Museum (Plate 2) was made in the year
1890, has been modified in a few details since, and has successfully endured manip-
ulation by thousands of inexpert hands—of children as well as adults—without
injury, and this without attendant supervision of any kind.

For the purpose of exhibiting a series of preparations mounted in the usual way
upon glass slips or ‘“‘slides,” an entirely different. form of apparatus has been de-
vised (Plates 3 and 4). An indefinite number of slides—from 10 to 100—are attached
to an endless band of linen by means of thin brass holders which allow the slides to
be changed when desired. This linen band passes over two rollers mounted upon a
light brass frame which occupies the place of the ‘‘stage” of an ordinary micro-
scope. The loops-of the band hang free. One of the rollers has a projecting pivot
with a milled head by means of which it may be rotated, and the two rollers are
connected by a narrow belt at each end. As the rollers are made to revolve, the
band carrying the slides passes horizontally under the microscope, resting mean-
while upon the two narrow belts and being kept at a definite distance from the
objective of the microscope by two guides, which press upon the slides from above.
The brass frame rests upon a grooved bed-plate which permits a lateral movement
of the frame. This lateral motion is controlled by a screw operated by means of a
second milled head in convenient proximity to the one giving the to-and-fro motion.
As in the other instrument, the specimens and nearly all parts of the mechanism are
inclosed in a box secured by a lock, the only exposed parts being the microscope and
the two milled heads controlling the motion of the slides. The advantages of this
form of apparatus are that the usual glass slide, 3 inches long by 1 inch wide,
upon which microscopic objects are usually mounted, may be used, and especially
that the focal] distance is not disturbed by differences in thickness of the glass slides.
The only disadvantage is that the mechanism is somewhat more delicate and com-
plicated than in the other instrument and requires some little protection from the
thoughtless violence of curious children. Microscopes copied from the original here
described have been in use for several years, and no irremediable difficulties have
been found in the way of their perfectly successful operation.

It is safe to say, from present experience, that these methods of installation of
microscopic exhibits promise to open a new and interesting field of observation and
study to museum visitors.

Physical apparatus.—Mr. W. C. Winlock remains in charge of this
section as honorary curator. During the year there were deposited in
the Museum by the Smithsonian Institution twelve pieces of elec-
trical apparatus supposed to have been used by Professor Henry in his
laboratory work at the Institution; also sixteen photographs of early
electrical apparatus. These photographs were made under the diree-
tion of Miss Henry and were exhibited at the World’s Columbian
Exposition in 1893. A number of pieces of apparatus were purchased
by the Smithsonian Institution and deposited in the Museum, includ-
ing a pocket dial with compass, five sand-glasses, a Japanese clock,
an iron clock dial, a hexagonal clock with three dials, and an hour-
glass.

IV.—_REVIEW OF WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENTS.

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES, AND ACCOUNTS.

In Appendix vit will be found a statement showing the amount of
the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the dis-
bursements under said appropriations, and the disposition of the unex-
pended balances remaining on hand from the appropriations of previous
years. These statements are taken from the report of the chief clerk,
Mir; WV. Cox.

The routine work of the office, consisting of the preparation of finan-
cial statements, of orders for the purchase of supplies and for the
performance of services, the approval and registration. of requisitions
for supplies, the examination of vouchers, etc., has been carried on.
More than 1,500 letters were prepared.

The preparation of a suitable subject index to the letters sent from
this office since 1885 was also taken up during the year. Seventeen
thousand pages have been indexed on slips and are now being arranged
for revision, after which they will be transcribed on cards for permanent
reference. A complete record, on index cards, of all legislative matters
of interest to the Institution has also been kept.

The building at the corner of Third and B streets, S. W., used for
workshops and storage for the Museum, did not prove satisfactory for
the purpose required, and a large warehouse on Ninth street, about
three squares south of the Museum, was leased instead.

Congress having made an appropriation of $800 for the better pro-
tection of the Smithsonian and Museum buildings from fire, four new
hydrants. were placed in position during the year and a quantity of
new hose purchased. The hydrants were put in under the supervision
of the engineer department of the District of Columbia. As an addi-
tional safeguard, a number of fire extinguishers has been procured,
and the watch force is drilled regularly in fire duty.

A granito floor was laid in the exhibition hall of the department of
comparative anatomy, and a mosaic floor in the vestibule at the north
entrance of the Museum building.

In connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition
at Atlanta, Ga., there were issued a large number of orders for the
purchase of material and for services. Nearly three hundred accounts
were audited for payment, involving expenditures amounting to
$24,246.73, and more than three hundred letters were written. All

claims on account of the Museum exhibit have been settled, with a
98
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 99

balance of $3.27 remaining from the allotment of $24,250 for the prepa-
ration, installation, maintenance, and return of the exhibit.

Mr. Cox assumed charge of the exhibit at Atlanta from November
9 to December 10, 1895, during the absence of Mr. R. E. Earll.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This division remains under the charge of Mr. Rh. I. Geare. The
office force includes two stenographers, one accession clerk, four index
and record clerks, one file clerk, one compiler and proof reader, two
typewriters, and one messenger. The technical correspondence of the
Museum has steadily increased each year, and in 1895-96 more than
12,000 letters and other official papers were prepared in this office.
The formal acknowledgment of, and official correspondence connected
with, accessions to the Museum collections forms a special feature.
This division is also charged with the preparation and proof reading of
the administrative portion of the Annual Report of the Museum and
the proof reading and general editorial supervision of the papers in the
Appendix. For several years also the distribution of all Museum
publications has formed part of the work of this office. This entails a
large amount of routine work, such as the preparation of labels, the
revision of the mailing lists, ete. As arule, about 15,000 volumes and
40,000 separates are distributed each year to libraries and individuals
on the regular mailing lists. In addition, 3,000 to 4,000 applications
for special papers and volumes are received annually.

During the year were distributed the Report of the Museum for 1893,
Volume xvi of Proceedings of the National Museum, the separate
papers in Volume xvirl (No. 1033 to 1082, excepting three papers which
were delayed), and the last paper (No. 1032) in Volume xvi. Advance
Sheets of two papers containing descriptions of remarkable new genera
and species of batrachians and crustaceans obtained by the United
States Fish Commission from an artesian well at San Marcos, Tex., and
a third, containing preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the
Mexican border of the United States, collected by Dr. E. A. Mearns,
United States Army, of the International Boundary Commission, have
been printed and distributed. These papers will appear in Volume
XVII of Proceedings.

A supplemental edition of Part “F” of Bulletin No. 39, ‘Directions
for Collecting and Preserving Insects,” by the late Prof. C. V. Riley,
was received from the printer in September, and hardly a day passes
in which several requests for it are not received; nearly 4,000 copies
have been already distributed.

Circular No. 47 was issued during the year. The purpose of this
pamphlet is to specify the conditions upon which the Museum will
undertake the examination of mollusks sent for identification. The
sending of material of this kind to the Museum has increased very
greatly during recent years, and as in almost every instance its return
100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

was expected, the curator of the department of mollusks found it very
desirable to at least impose certain conditions upon persons desiring to
obtain expert determinations from the Museum in this direction.

Special effort is now being directed to the work of revising the mail-
ing lists.

The list of libraries is being carefully scrutinized with a view to utiliz-
ing the small editions to the best advantage. It is proposed to include
libraries which have attained to the number of 10,000 volumes since
the list was first prepared, as well as to insure the representation on the
list of all towns which contain more than 10,000 inhabitants.

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.

The registrar, Mr. 8S. C. Brown, states that there were received dur-
ing the year 25,249 packages of all kinds, including material for addi-
tion to the collections, publications, and supplies.

There were 3,195 packages sent out, of which 637 contained speci-
mens transmitted to educational institutions as gifts, or sent to
individuals or institutions in exchange or for study. A few specimens
returned to owners are also included in this number. The entries
made on the incoming transportation record numbered 2,910 and on
the outgoing transportation record 1,487, there being an increase of
about 250 entries in the case of the former record and of more than
700 in the latter.

The number of accessions or ‘‘lots” of material received was 1,299,
an increase of 76 over the record for the preceding year. There was
also an increase of 75 in the “temporary” accessions, consisting of
material received for identification, the total for the present year hay-
ing been 542. About 27,000 specimens of all kinds have been sent out
as gifts or in exchange, and about 3,000 specimens have been lent for
study.

Of the entire number of objects donated to educational establish-
ments perhaps two-thirds consisted of fishes and marine invertebrates.
The remainder was composed largely of geological specimens and casts
of prehistoric implements.

Several special collections of fishes were prepared in the fall of 1895
from material received from the United States Fish Commission.
These were transmitted to the following institutions: Oberlin College,
Oberlin, Ohio; State Normal School, Mankato, Minn.; High School,
Duluth, Minn.; Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, Ark.;
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.; Iowa State University, Iowa
City, Iowa; Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.; Museum of Com-
parative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass.; Leland Stanford Junior Univer-
sity, Stanford University, Cal.

A few months later eight special collections of fishes, prepared from
specimens obtained by the United States Fish Commission in the North
Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were sent to the following establish-

ments: Royal Zoological Museum, Berlin, Germany; Museum of
Natural History, Paris, France; British Museum (Natural History),
London, England; Zoological Museum, Christiania, Norway; Imperial
Zoological Museum, Vienna, Austria; University of Indiana, Bloom-
ington, Ind.; Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass. ;
University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.

The storage record shows that 305 packages were placed in storage,
while 145 were withdrawn. z

In Appendix Ix will be found a statement, arranged geographically,
showing in detail to what individuals and institutions specimens have
been sent during the year, either in exchange, as gifts, or for study.

The number of lots of specimens sent out is here shown:

BUILDINGS AND LABOR.

In Appendix x a condensed statement is presented, showing in a
general way the character of the work performed during the year by
the mechanics and laborers, under the supervision of Mr. Henry Horan.

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.

TAXIDERMISTS.

Mr. William Palmer continues to fill the position of chief taxidermist.
He reports that five mammals were mounted during the year, three of
them being intended for exhibition at the Cotton States and Inter-
national Exposition at Atlanta. Thirty-seven mammals were cleaned
for this exhibit, and several were placed upon new stands. The groups
of Rocky Mountain sheep and goats were dismounted and packed for
shipment to Atlanta.

In addition to the exposition work above mentioned, ten specimens
were cleaned, poisoned, and placed upon new stands.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 103

During the year ninety mammals were received and skinned. Of
this number more than one-half came from the National Zoological
Park, as will be seen from the following table:

In addition, thirty-seven specimens of mammals, birds, reptiles, ete.,
were received from the Zoological Park and transferred immediately
to other departments in the Museum.

Many of the bodies of the mammals skinned were turned over to the
Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, for examina-
tion as to the cause of death, and for the purpose of ascertaining if
they contained parasites. A few were sent to the Army Medical
Museum, and others were retained by the department of comparative
anatomy in the National Museum.

A large number of skins were received to be remade, mounted, ete.
Some of these were dry, while others were fresh or salted.

Of the large amount of miscellaneous work performed during the
year the following items may be mentioned: Sixteen seal skins and a
number of other large skins were cleaned preparatory to mounting; an
antelope and several smaller mammals were mounted, although not
entirely finished; a large sea lion was skinned; more than one hundred
mounted mammals were crated, with a view to placing them in storage,
and a large model of the National Zoological Park was made.

Casts were made of the following objects: Nine Egyptian inscrip-
tions, two gold ornaments for the new Congressional Library building,
two lizards, and a stone tablet.

Mr. Joseph Palmer was engaged for nearly the entire year on work
for other departments in the Museum and for the Atlanta Exposition.

Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned
and renovated about 700 specimens in the exhibition series. Although
this is a much smaller number than was attended to last year, the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 105

decrease is readily explained by the fact that the birds now being
cleaned are larger and require a greater amount of care and labor.
Four birds were mounted, and several poorly mounted specimens were
reduced to skins. Twenty-seven birds, received in the flesh, including
two young ostriches, were skinned for the study series.

OSTEOLOGIST.

There were cleaned for the department of mammals during the year
607 skulls, and for the Department of Agriculture 539 skulls (many of
them being of the larger mammals), making a total of 1,146. Thirty-
two other specimens were also cleaned, 29 of them having been received
in the flesh. Eighteen specimens were mounted, exclusive of the work
done for the exhibit at the Cotton States and International Exposi-
tion at Atlanta. Reference was made last year to the preparation of a
skeleton of Zeuglodon for this exhibit. This work was completed, and
several other skeletons were prepared for the same purpose.

The synoptic series of invertebrates and the series of wax models
showing the development, from the embryo, of the trout, frog, chicken,
etc., were packed up and sent to Atlanta. This work required excep-
tional care, owing to the nature of the specimens. Considerable time
was necessarily spent in repacking the material for return to Wash-
ington at the close of the Exposition, and in installing it in the Museum.

A summary of the osteological work is given in the following table:

The workshops of the osteologist were transferred during the year
to the new quarters on Ninth street, S.W., which have been leased by
. the Museum for storage and other purposes.

PHOTOGRAPHER,

The photographer, Mr. T. W. Smillie, reports that 1,638 negatives
have been made during the year. Many of these were for the depart-
ments of ethnology, mammals, geology, anthropology, oriental antiqui-
ties and religious ceremonials, botany, and technology. In addition,
106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.

1,022 platinum prints, 316 siiver prints, 321 cyanotypes, and 5 lantern
slides were made. Considerable miscellaneous work was also done,
such as numbering and filing negatives, testing inks, restoring large
pictures for exhibition, and developing negatives brought in by col-

lectors.
COLORIST.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has continued the work of cleaning and restor-
ing such of the paintings in the Catlin Indian gallery as required
attention. He has also continued work upon the series of paintings
representing the races of men, nine pictures having now been com-
pleted. In addition, two life-size casts of Indians have been painted,
and other incidental work attended to.
