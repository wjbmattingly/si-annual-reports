The Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
‘“‘to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an ‘‘establishment,’’ whose statutory members are “the President,
the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

A listing of the professional staff of the Smithsonian Institution, its
bureaus, and its offices, appears in Appendix 7.
The annual report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution appears
under the general title Smithsonian Year.

It contains the reports of the bureaus and branches of the Institution, including
that of the United States National Museum. This report on the activities of its
component Museums of Natural History and of History and Technology,
was last issued as a separate publication for fiscal year 1964, appearing in 1965.
Issuance of the annual report of the Secretary is no longer followed by appear-
ance of a greenbound volume containing a General Appendix of articles in
the sciences and the arts. The last of the old series is that for 1964.

Reprints of each of the bureau reports are available. To some of them are
appended tabulated, statistical, and other information of primary interest to
those concerned with the particular field covered, and which for reasons of
space can no longer be carried in this volume.

Statement by the Secretary

S. Ditton RIPLEY

OME YEARS AGO, IN CONVERSATION, the late Robert Oppen-

heimer remarked to me that he felt that men in the future
would find the single area of greatest discovery in biology.
Oppenheimer was of course thinking primarily of the then ex-
citing discoveries in molecular biology, the end effects of which,
while perhaps inevitably upon us, will not be revealed for many
years.

As a biologist, one might now question whether there is
not another area where discoveries rather than refinements
await us. I’o me it seems that the single area which needs the
greatest amount of attention from discoverers is that uncharted
and almost unknown field which might be called social biology.
The field is unknown and uncharted because it is not a specialty,
and today most scientists are trained for narrow specialties.
Biologists are concerned primarily with laboratory or field
studies of animal and plant species. Sociologists are concerned
primarily with the study of the origins and history and constitu-
tion of human society. In universities the departments of the
two disciplines are usually in separate buildings, and in libraries
the books they use tend to come from different parts of the
stacks.

In fact, sociologists labor under the disadvantage of being
somewhat luxated; are they scientists or are they humanists?
It is a symbol of the age that they should feel thus dislocated.
It is of course unnecessary. Similarly, some thoughtful biologists
tend today to feel slightly uncomfortable about being scientists.
Science in the public mind has come to be associated almost
exclusively with the physical sciences or with medicine. Scien-
tists are white-coated men, either possessed of a Batman-like
syndrome, about to fly off into space, or else all-knowing, wise
versions of Dr. Kildare. In any case, biologists who have to do
2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

with physico-chemical processes involving the components of a
single cell, or those who are involved with medical science, can
perhaps feel closer to the physical scientists and to medicine.

But biologists associated with natural phenomena in gross,
external terms, with population biology and the dynamics of
large systems, and with much of what is today called ecology
(a badly misused word in most cases) as well as paleobiologists
and evolutionists—many of these sorts of biologists find them-
selves somewhat dislocated. Perhaps they are in danger of be-
coming humanists? Perhaps indeed the scientific sociologists and
the humanist biologists are approaching each other, figures on a
darkened and uncharted stage.

When one says that there is an area here which perhaps
contains the single, greatest problem that man faces today, one
is referring to problems of human survival and of morality.
Here it must be said that many scientists are greatly troubled
about the responsibilities and the integrity of science. Scientists
and sociologists alike work in disciplines where study brings
them a knowledge of the social consequences of the discovery
of new technologies and of new principles about behavior. By
training, however, most scientists tend to be cautious about
ascribing broad implications to the results of narrowly defined
and controlled experiments. Science-minded sociologists tend to
have kindred feelings, and often prefer to remain aloof from the
dangerous area where theoretical results are correlated with non-
controlled situations.

And yet there is a responsibility to speak out. As the condi-
tions of the environment deteriorate, as the social disorders of
the age deepen, the special relationship between the scientist’s
social responsibilities and his general duties of citizenship grows
critical. As Commoner says, “‘If the scientist, directly or by infer-
ences from his actions, lays claim to a special responsibility for
the resolution of the policy issues which relate to technology,
he may, in effect, prevent others from performing their own —
political duties. If the scientist fails in his duty to inform citizens,
they are precluded from the gravest acts of citizenship and lose
their right of conscience.”’*

*Barry Commoner. Science and Survival. New York, 1966, p. 130.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 3

In 1847 Joseph Henry, meditating upon the course of the
Smithsonian Institution, wrote: ‘“To effect the greatest amount
of good, the organization should be suchas to enable the Institution
to produce results in the way of increasing and diffusing knowl-
edge, which cannot be produced by the existing institutions in
our country.” What is there that we in the Smithsonian can
think upon which would illumine the basic problems confronting
social biology?

There are certainly three paths along which we might travel
toward illumination: one leads to the study of terrestrial environ-
ment, another to the study of our social environment, and the
third to the study of man as an evolving species.

The disorder of our age is graphically illustrated by the slow
degrading of man’s terrestrial environment. There is something
inherently wrong with man’s relations with his environment.
Nature suffers continually in an undeclared war. Man, animated
by hunger for profit or for spectacular action, continually erodes
our landscape. Many feel indeed that this is appropriate, that
man and nature can never live in harmony. Thomas Hardy said,
“nature and man can never be friends.”? Must we then kill off
our enemy and in so doing kill off ourselves?

Biologists have a social duty to alert citizens to the inescap-
able results of such mass suicide. In this Institution we have in
particular one great scientific resource to bring to bear upon
this problem. Our sorts of biologists are concerned with the
quality of the environment, for they are concerned with sys-
tematics, with setting into categories organisms that are inescap-
ably a part of the particular environments within which they,
as species, live. The assembled data about species in relation to
their environments assumes an historic and important relevance
to the environment as it is today. That is, the recordings of sys-
tematists become a series of benchmarks against which modern
environments can be gauged. To put it in crude terms we know
for example that the American mountain lion was exterminated
from all the eastern seaboard States by the late 1800s, except
for the fastnesses of Florida and parts of West Virginia and Ver-
mont. Today the principal population of mountain lions survives
precariously only in parts of the Sierra Nevada and the high
mountains of the West. We also know why. We know the food
habits, the predator-prey food chain, the range requirements,
4 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

the amount of “leaving alorie’”’ which a mountain lion requires
in order to live and reproduce its kind. In a similar way we know
the requirements of a whole series of animal and plant species,
and what happened to them when these requirements were not
met.

All these situations are similar in that a certain formula is
involved. A proportion of one or another sets of conditions is
required, without which a certain species will not occur. The
declining ratio of natural to man-made conditions over the con-
tinent creates multiple effects which can be measured or simu-
lated through models. The results, when arrayed against the
resources of the planet, surely could tell us much of the ability
of various species to survive. The results also tell us something
of man’s plasticity and tolerance, and of his ability to survive —
the changes he is introducing into the environment.

One of the keys to American success in foreign aid and indeed
in foreign relations will be the degree to which American plan-
ners pay attention to the knowledge of environmental problems
already possessed by American scientists. At present there is
little if any indication that aid planners or foreign policy planners
have ever heard of ecology or would know how to talk to a
systematic biologist if they met one. And yet in areas of the
tropical world today ecologists and systematists are far more
capable of predicting the effects of change in the environment
than are engineers and dam builders or agriculturists. The
proposed International Biological Program—unknown to most
planners or policy makers—has within it the capacity of mobiliz- .
ing field biologists into a concerted effort to understand the
present state of our terrestrial environment all over the world.
The resulting information could be utilized in a way which
might provide vital criteria, real benchmarks against which to
set our standards for survival for the future. Our traditional
economic and political aims, keyed to commercial development
and the promotion of consumer consciousness, have blinded us to
our own survival.

Another disorder of this age is graphically illustrated by the
decline of social and moral values in our cities. The problems of
deteriorating environment and of social disorder are related.
As the landscape suffers, man becomes less humane. As Hoffer,
speaking of our increased command over nature, says, “In many
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 5

parts of the world the taming of nature by rapid industrialization
gave rise to degrees of social barbarization.”’* If man cannot live
in cities as a humane individual, then he cannot survive. Thus
social biologists have a duty to alert citizens to the inescapable
results of urbanization.

In this Institution, a world center for anthropology, there
should be a whole series of benchmarks which, interpreted by
social anthropologists, could produce models of stress, crowding
phenomena, aggression and hostility. Our view derived from
these data could be of great use, indeed ensynoptic.

The Institution contains within it the national archives for
anthropology. It is the greatest actual repository of data on
American Indians. It should be the home for urgent anthropol-
ogy activities throughout the world, the salvage of ethnographic
and linguistic records before they become extinct. We are
answering Professor Levi-Strauss’ challenge to us at our Bi-
centennial Seminars in 1965. Already the Wenner-Gren Foun-
dation for Anthropological Research has responded with a
grant to the Institution for commencing these studies. Within
these materials lie the seeds of invaluable comparative research
on man’s ability to survive the disorders of this age.

It may be germane here to refer to the fact that the Smith-
sonian’s Office of Anthropology is emerging as a center of inter-
national anthropology through its organization of imaginative
new programs. In the past two years the consolidation of the
former Department of Anthropology and the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology has been accomplished. A survey, in consultation
with a distinguished panel of anthropologists, has helped us
establish urgent tasks and set guidelines for the future. With
the help of Professor Sol Tax, special advisor for anthropology,
the chairman of the Office—Richard Woodbury until early
this year, now Saul Riesenberg—and the curators have been
planning three basic programs. One of the most fundamental
of these programs is that already mentioned, in urgent anthro-
pology. A second is a new, badly needed, cooperative project,
the revised Handbook of North American Indians, which will
require perhaps ten years to complete and may run to fifteen
volumes. A third and unique program is in ancient technologies.

*Eric Hoffer. The Temper of Our Time. New York, 1967.
6 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Using modern scientific techniques in the study of such crafts
as metal working, textile manufacture, and pottery making,
and working in conjunction with laboratories such as the Battelle
Memorial Institute as well as our own Conservation-Analytical
Laboratory, we hope for great increases in our ability to learn
from archeological finds.

As an archive for anthropological science, the Smithsonian
must mobilize every resource to support anthropological in-
formation exchange, cooperative teaching, and the coordination
of our basic understanding of man’s place in the world. In this
connection we should review the possibility, raised over the
years by our leading anthropologists, of creating a modern
Museum of Man. The emergence of new nations, as Professor
Tax has pointed out, signals the end of the era when there was
“civilized man” who ruled another kind of man called ‘‘natural
man,” and often displayed him in a museum along with precious
jewels, rocks, and dinosaurs. All cultures and all humans should
be accorded equal dignity and respect, and for this they deserve
a museum of their own.

Man has not changed genetically in fifty thousand years.
Man is, however, extraordinarily plastic and tolerant in his
individual response to life itself. The key to much of this occurs
in the experience of the maturing individual. Here again this
Institution has an enormous untapped resource, our visitors,
who each year devotedly come in their millions, bringing their
children. None of us has successfully discerned the way toward
asking the questions of our visitors which might teach us of their
inherent or innate interests. Here lie seeds for a fertile study .
which we intend to pursue. From it perhaps we may learn
something of the processes of conceptualization and synthesis
that lie at the very heart of the problem of the use of knowledge.

Ultimately, if we are to increase knowledge, it must be dif-
fused. This year marks the renaissance of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution Press as an earnest of our intent to adhere to first princi-
ples. As Professor Henry envisaged, the Institution should publish
treatises consisting ‘‘of valuable memoirs translated from foreign
languages, or of articles prepared under the direction of the
Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the best ex-
position of a given subject.’ The state of knowledge of social
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 7

biology will be enhanced this year, we hope, through the pub-
lication of the second Smithsonian Annual, the results of the
February 1967 conference on ‘“The Quality of Man’s Environ-
ment,” partially supported by grants from the Ford Foundation
and the Taconic Foundation. The first catalog of publications
of the Smithsonian Institution Press has just been issued.

Last summer, in August 1966, under the innovative leader-
ship of Charles Blitzer, Director of the Smithsonian programs
in education and training, a conference, supported by a grant
from the U.S. Office of Education, was held by the Institution
on the subject of museums and education. The results, edited
by Professor Eric Larrabee, will be published shortly by the
Smithsonian’s Press. Meanwhile, a suggestion emanating from
discussions at that conference is about to be put into effect.
One’s concern with museums is partly directed toward the prob-
lem of who goes to see them. Most people go to museums be-
cause they are already won over to the proposition that a visit
is worthwhile. Many go in classes. Still others go because it is
a social duty or, like taking a vitamin pill, a nostrum for culture.
But many people who could be greatly benefited by going to
museums—who could have latent interests aroused or who would
be ripe for open education, undidactic, unstressed—never get to
museums. Some live in poor neighborhoods out of which they
do not travel. Some are inherently hostile toward marble pal-
aces. The suggestion is, then, that we help a local committee
in some urban area plan a neighborhood museum.

With the stimulating aid of grants from the Carnegie Cor-
poration of New York, the Meyer Foundation of Washington,
and the Richardson Fund of Connecticut, we are helping a
neighborhood council to create the Anacostia Neighborhood
Museum in southeast Washington. Already plans for exhibits
and participation programs have been advanced by the Neigh-
borhood Museum Committee and the Director, John Kinard.
These seem full of promise and interest, and the Museum is
opening officially September 15, 1967.

Another important experiment in education is that of an
exhibit for the blind, or, as the term is, sightless persons. With the
aid of a planning grant from the Vocational Rehabilitation
Administration, Mr. Blitzer has been working with Dr. Brian
8 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

O’Doherty in planning an exhibit which will be stimulating
not only to sightless but also to sighted persons.

As Professor Derek Price has recently stated, in the field of
the history of science the Institution is preeminent for its re-
sources in objects and in skilled research staff. Among its greatest
treasures is a notable collection of letters and manuscripts of
Joseph Henry, who was selected by the National Historical
Publications Commission of the National Archives as the first
scientist whose papers should be published under national
auspices. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Smithsonian, in
happy conjunction with the American Philosophical Society
and the National Academy of Sciences, should have determined
to publish the papers of Joseph Henry. Aided by a vital grant
from the National Science Foundation, this project has now
commenced under the editorship of Dr. Nathan Reingold. A
guiding committee of associated specialists has been formed. In
this connection, it has also been heartening to observe the
progress made by the Institution’s talented archivist Samuel T.
Suratt in developing our manuscript collections for use by
historical scholars.

Members of the staff of the Museum of History and Tech-
nology themselves continue to produce important work, such
as Robert Multhauf’s The Origins of Chemistry (Oldbourne, 1966).
In addition, work at the forefront of modern technology con-
tinues with a comprehensive study aimed at documenting the
development of the art of the computer through interviews with
scientists and inventors, as well as through collecting printed
and manuscript material relating to the subject.

Additional monographs of our historians include Walter
Cannon’s Social History of Science in Victorian England (to be
published by Routledge and Kegan Paul); Bernard Finn’s
Sources of Thermoelectricity (to be published by Johnson); and
Sami K. Hamarneh’s Catalogue of Arabic Pharmaceutical Manu-
scripts in the British Museum; as well as Monte Calvert’s The
Mechanical Engineer in America, 1830-1910 (The Johns Hopkins
Press).

The Smithsonian Institution has been asked on numerous
occasions this year to join in planning for the bicentennial
observances of the American Revolution in 1976. The Secretary

charged by the Congress to plan for national celebrations of an
historic nature. In addition the Secretary is a member ex officio
of the President’s ‘““American Revolution Bicentennial Com-
mission.” In its April 21, 1967, report, the House Appropriations
Committee reiterated its desire and intent that the Smithsonian
Institution shall take an active part in the celebration of the
bicentennial of the American Revolution.

There are two central physical frames of reference for the
Institution’s participation, one the new Museum of History and
Technology on the Mall, the other the authorized but still
unconstructed Armed Forces Museum and Park. In the first, a
series of exhibits and commemorative publications over the next
eight years will gradually document the coming of the Revolu-
tion. Already, two years ago, a first exhibit was held commem-
orating the Stamp Act, and this year an exhibit on George
Mason and the Bill of Rights was prepared. Next year an
exhibit covering the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the arrival of
the British Customs Commissioners will be shown. In this way, a
gradual procession of special exhibits relating to the development
of the Revolution will be constructed. In addition it is hoped
that Congress will authorize the construction of two small special
pavilions to encompass additional historic exhibits of the greatest
importance for the Bicentennial year.

The National Armed Forces Museum and Park could in
itself be a valuable adjunct to the visitor’s traversing of the
eastern seaboard from Boston to Williamsburg for the commem-
oration of the events of 1776. On the road from Washington via
the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to Mount Vernon and on to
Williamsburg, the Park, to be situated near Fort Foote, would
be a valuable intermediate point. It is hoped that a series of
important discussions on the causes of war and peace can be
held during the next year which might help to set the themes of
this Congressionally authorized museum.

In the coming year two events of artistic and historic im-
portance will occur in Washington. The first, in the spring of
1968, will be the reopening in new quarters in the old Patent
Office building of the National Collection of Fine Arts. This
should be a momentous event. Moving operations, commenced
in early 1967, will have consumed a year. Meanwhile, because of
14 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

the energetic work of Director David W. Scott and his staff, and
because of enhanced public understanding of the role of this
important art gallery, substantial augmentations to the collection
have been made, most notably the S. C. Johnson Wax Company
collection of contemporary American artists’ works, valued at
approximately a million dollars, and the Paul Manship collec-
tion, as well as many individual gifts. The National Collection
of Fine Arts, now to be finally in a home of its own, will create
a major new artistic influence in the life of the capital.

In the latter part of 1968 an event of historic importance
will be the opening of the United States’ first National Portrait
Gallery. This is still an organization in its infancy, but given
handsome and stylish quarters and its nucleus of important
paintings and sculptural likenesses, it is the earnest hope of the
National Portrait Gallery Commission, endorsed by the Regents,
that the Gallery will attract gifts as well as Congressional interest
appropriate to its nascent stature and central importance as a
repository for historical and biographical iconography.

The work of the U.S. National Museum under its Director,
Frank Taylor, is central to some of the critical problems of our
age. Never before have museums enjoyed such a wealth of
opportunities or faced such trials as those contained in the
worldwide crisis in education and the bewildering search for
life values and standards. Educators are beginning to recognize
that museums provide much of the reality—lacking in classroom
and books—needed to stimulate curiosity and the will to learn.
Museums provide opportunities for people of all ages and con-
ditions to continue to grow with the inspiration of the works of
great artists, scholars, and patriots, the products of past and
present civilizations, and the physical evidence of the wonders
of nature.

On June 20, 1967, President Johnson wrote to the Secre-
tary—in his capacity as Chairman of the Federal Council on the
Arts and Humanities—requesting the Council to study the
status of American museums and to recommend ways to support
and strengthen them. The President’s letter, which showed his
awareness of both the problems and the potentialities of museums,
presents us with an immensely exciting challenge:

America’s five thousand museums are among our most precious
cultural and educational resources. Their collections, their trained
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 15

staffs, and their facilities contribute immeasurably to the enrich-
ment of the nation’s life and to educational advancement at every
level.

Not only do imaginative museum exhibits excite the curiosity
of millions; many scholars—in science, in the arts and the humani-
ties—rely upon museum collections for their raw material.

Attendance at U.S. museums has already passed 300,000,000
visits a year. In many places, inadequate museum budgets and
facilities are under severe strain. In the future, the nation’s museums
will be expected to reach and serve additional millions. Accelerated
research programs will cause more and more scholars to seek access
to museum collections.

Our museums have shown their willingness to join with other
institutions to promote the “increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” Certainly they should have the wherewithal to do
that great work effectively.

We are eager to respond to this challenge.

For 125 years the Smithsonian has shared its experience and
resources with museums of the United States and abroad. In the
past year an entirely new volume and quality of museum assist-
ance was reached. A start was made to investigate the funda-
mentals of the interaction between the museum visitor and
exhibited objects, and to reach, through neighborhood museums
and traveling exhibits, those people who do not visit museums.
Evaluation of the museum experience, experimentation with
communication through senses other than sight, and a study of
museum audiences and their needs, were undertaken.

The National Museum Act of 1966, passed by the Congress
and approved by the President in October 1966, reaffirmed the
Smithsonian’s role of assistance to museums and authorized
appropriations to meet needs and to study problems common to
all museums. In the Act, Congress recognized that museums are
important elements of the cultural and educational development
of the United States.

Though no appropriations have yet been made under the
Act, it has stimulated requests for aid from every State and a
score of nations. In the spirit of the Act, the Smithsonian has
entered into agreements with other museums to train science-
museum technicians, has participated in the first Museum Con-
ference for Small Museums, in Texas, and has provided many
on-the-spot consultative services ranging from the direction of
Secretary Ripley presents photographs of Korean exhibits in the Museum of
Natural History to His Excellency Il Kwon Chung, Prime Minister of Korea,
at a reception in his honor in the Museum of History and Technology.

the planning of acquisitions and interpretation for a large
museum department (at Oakland, California) to the structuring
of a workshop on exhibits preparation for a community (in
Charleston, West Virginia) of small museums which are con-
ducted largely with volunteer services.

In cooperation with officers of the American Association of
Museums representations have been made to Government
agencies justifying direct Federal aid for the construction of
museum facilities on the basis of the increased demands made
upon museums by educational institutions stimulated by the
Federal aid available to schools. In addition new Federal aid
has prompted schools to take advantage of museums as supple-
mentary teaching centers and to use them for curriculum
improvement and enrichment.

At the request of the Minister of Education of the Republic
of Korea and of the Director of the Pacific Science Board of the
National Academy of Sciences, the Smithsonian participated
in the Symposium on a Korean National Science Museum
and supported the attendance at Seoul of a number of museum
professionals from other institutions. The report of the Sym-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 17

posium recommended a planning study for which the Korean
Government has since appropriated the equivalent of $25,000.
A newly formed foundation, The American Friends of the
Korean National Science Cultural Center, under the direction
of Joseph A. Patterson, former Director of the American Asso-
ciation of Museums, is endeavoring to obtain the balance of
the support required for the study.

The attendance of the Chairman of the United States
National Committee of the International Council of Museums
at the ICOM Cairo Conference on Museum Exhibition was
supported. Progress in the planning for a regional laboratory
to produce exhibits on science and technology for developing
countries was set back by the war in the Middle East. The
Secretary of the Smithsonian is now a member of the ICOM
Executive Committee and one of its Vice Presidents.

The cooperative publishing program with the American
Association of Museums was continued, with the Smithsonian
Institution Press undertaking distribution of the Museums
Directory of the United States and Canada and with an agreement
to share the cost of the publication of the revision of
the manual, Museum Registration Methods, by Dorothy H.
Dudley and Irma Bezold. A more substantial share was assumed
in the work of tabulating the returns from the questionnaire on
museum education which was sponsored jointly by the American
Association of Museums, the United States Office of Education,
and the Smithsonian Institution.

One year of use of the series of teaching exhibits on the
elementary physics of light for 4th- to 6th-grade students was
completed in three schools of the Fairfax (Virginia) County
School System. The results obtained from these exhibits were
universally approved by the teachers and principals who
observed them. Many side effects resulted from the experiment,
such as increasing the self-reliance of students who had their
first learning experiences as individuals away from the classroom,
and the stimulation of determined nonreaders to learn to read.
The Prince William County Schools have requested the exhibits
for next year and have undertaken to provide a thorough and
credible evaluation test as part of the County’s program under
Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
1965.
18 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

The Smithsonian Council assembled twice, in October and
again in March, for discussions with the Secretary and members
of the professional staff. Dr. Ralph E. Alston, one of the initial
Council members from the University of Texas, died February
17, 1967. Jan LaRue, Professor of Music at the Graudate
School of Arts and Sciences of New York University, and Elting
Morison, Acting Master of Ezra Stiles College at Yale Univer-
sity, joined the Council during the year.

At the October meeting members discussed the development
of a center for scholars in Washington and the relations of such
a center to the consortium of local universities. Subcommittees
met with members of the department of science and technology
and heard reports of current Smithsonian activities from the
National Portrait Gallery and the staff of the Office of Anthro-
pology. Among other subjects treated by the Council were: the
problem of managing special exhibits and public service projects,
the selection of post-doctoral research associates, the possibility
of forming a union library catalog within the center for scholars,
and the extent to which museum staff members should engage
in graduate-level teaching. The Secretary led a discussion of the
attributes of museum scholars compared to their university
colleagues and the problem of the place of museum objects in
scholarship.

At the second meeting there was further discussion of the
Smithsonian libraries and of the proposal for a union catalog
serving all Washington libraries. The Council heard reports
from Eugene Wallen on Smithsonian oceanographic activities
and from Peter Farb, designer of the hall of insects for the
Museum of Natural History. Frank Taylor presented a report
on recent experiments in museum practices and the organiza-
tional changes indicated by a modernized exhibits program. At
the dinner concluding the meetings, Mrs. Adelyn Breeskin, our
distinguished consultant in modern art and education, spoke on
the present role of our galleries and museums in fostering an
appreciation of art.

The long continuing effort of the Smithsonian Institution
and other institutions and individuals to effect United States
membership in the International Centre at Rome for the Study
of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property has
made notable progress. The Department of State has said that
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 19

it will support United States membership in the Centre (which
is an international organization of member states) and sug-
gested that the Smithsonian undertake to obtain the legislation
authorizing the membership. ‘To this end the Smithsonian held
a number of meetings of representatives of interested institutions
and agencies who have indicated a uniform support of U.S.
membership. The legislation necessary to authorize membership
has been drafted for introduction in Congress during the current
session. Both the United States and the Centre would gain from
U.S. membership and the worldwide task of preserving cultural
objects and paintings would be greatly aided by an increase of
research, training, consultation, and the dissemination of knowl-
edge of advances in scientific conservation.

A start has now been made in developing the Arts and
Industries building as the renamed Smithsonian Exposition
Hall. Exhibits which are outside the scope of the interests of
particular Smithsonian elements but which have substantial
social interest were held: the exhibit of work of the young men
and women of the Job Corps was one; another was the collection
of present day appliquéd molas produced for sale by the San
Blas Indians.

The Smithsonian Institution’s Traveling Exhibition Service
has circulated 108 exhibitions during the year, including the
tremendously successful ““Art Treasures of Turkey.”? Among its
innovative projects, the Service has implemented an art program
for District of Columbia schools on a matching-fund basis with
with the National Endowment for the Arts, through the D.C.
Recreation Department. Seven schools were involved, with
seven exhibitions redistributed five times.

The general public’s insatiable quest for information on
every subject was reflected again this year in letters of inquiry
and letters transmitting items for identification. These communi-
cations, coming particularly from elementary and secondary
students and numbering 250 to 275 a week, were received and
processed through the Office of the Registrar. Dinosaurs re-
mained the most popular subject, with American Indians run-
ning a close second, followed by Stradivarius violins, coins, and
requests for information on early Americana. The NBC Smith-
sonian television series generated a sizable influx of questions
relating to the subject matter of the programs. Typically, one
20 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

young man wrote, “I love your television shows but I like the
one on meteorites best. Please send me... .”

The shipping office completed a most active year, having
processed 14,947 incoming and outgoing pieces, totaling
1,079,702 pounds. Among the interesting and significant types
of cargo handled were 16,000 pounds of whale bones and skulls
carried by motor freight from California; the 15,000-pound El
Taco, Campo del Cielo meteorite, shipped back to the Smith-
sonian from Germany after cutting, and later, by special arrange-
ment, returned to Argentina together with a model of the original
specimen; and a collection of Mexican coins weighing 4,000
pounds that was successfully moved by combined air and
armored car service on a rigid schedule and security basis.
Valuable pieces of art for the National Collection of Fine Arts’
special shows, a 25,000-pound McMillan synchrotron, a chariot
dated 1825, and a fragile Flemish marquetry cabinet were also
transported through careful and painstaking efforts of the staff.

Maintaining the high quality and level of exhibits produc-
tivity of the past several years, the Office of Exhibits of the United
States National Museum opened six new permanent exhibition
halls to the general public during the year—including the first
two halls of the Institution’s unique Growth of the United States
exhibition in the Museum of History and Technology, a com-
prehensive visual survey of every aspect of United States history.
In addition, the Office completed supplementary portions of 25
other permanent exhibition halls and produced 29 temporary
and special exhibits—some of them of major national and inter-
national importance, such as the special exhibit on Chile, in
conjunction with that country; the large-scale Alaska Centennial
exhibit; the World Exposition of Photography exhibit; the
Vinland Map exhibit, which with its accompanying symposium
drew scholars from all over the world; and the breathtaking
Wedgwood exhibit, produced in conjunction with the 1967
Wedgwood International Seminar.

Continuing in its role of service for the development and
application of exhibition techniques throughout the museum
world, the Office of Exhibits received into its laboratories—for
purposes of observation, instruction, and advice—more than 200
professionals from museums all over the United States and more
than a score of foreign countries.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 21

The Bill (H. R. 6125) authorizing the construction of a
new Air and Space Museum building on the Mall was signed
by President Johnson on July 19, 1966. This legislation expanded
the name officially to National Air and Space Museum and,
among other provisions, also expanded the membership of the
Museum’s Advisory Board to include all Federal and Defense
Agencies dealing with aerospace activities. During the year the
President appointed an additional civilian member, Mr. James
Wilmot of Syracuse, New York.

Since no construction funds have yet been considered by the
Congress, budgets for current operations are being held at levels
approximating those of prior years, seriously restricting efforts
to build up the necessary professional staff and to improve the
character and quality of current exhibits. Within the available
dollar and manpower limitations, however, work has progressed
toward sorting, preserving, and cataloging specimens for display
and documentary material for inclusion in the growing histori-
cal research center. The Museum has also acquired for its aero-
space collections a number of new specimens of importance.

An important step in this direction was taken in March 1967
with the signing of a joint agreement between the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration, as a result of which the historically important air and
space artifacts developed by NASA will be transferred to the
National Air and Space Museum after technical evaluation. To
allow this program to get under way, NASA provided a $200,000
fund on a nonrecurring basis.

A number of nationally important aerospace award cere-
monies were held in the Smithsonian during the year. These
included two presentations of the Robert J. Collier Trophy; the
1965 award to the late Dr. Hugh Dryden and Mr. James E.
Webb, and the 1966 award to James McDonnell. The Smith-
sonian’s own Langley Medal was presented to Dr. Wernher
von Braun on June 6, 1967.

Central to the issue of the new Museum are two questions
of importance to scholars of the future. The first revolves around
the presentation of the exhibits, which must be creative and
stimulating, revealing to the layman and the specialist alike new
insights into man’s quest for mastery of the air. At the same time
the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum, if it is to be appropri-

gins of kites, their types,

24 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

ately creative and innovative, must become a pioneer force in a
new aspect of history, the history of air and space. Little is
being done in the Nation at large, either with archives and rec-
ords or with objects, to create such a branch of history—the
history of aeronautics as a branch of the history of science
and technology and of social history. In conjunction with other
Smithsonian scholars, the Air and Space Museum staff should
prepare for teaching and the publication of research in this new
field. A tangible incentive to such activity has been the receipt
this year of a most generous bequest from the estate of Mrs.
Juanita Ramsay, late widow of Admiral DeWitt Clinton
Ramsay, the income of which may be used to support publica-
tions in the field of historical scholarship in aviation. Much
more of this needs to be creatively attempted if the Air and
Space Museum is to live up to its important obligations.

In this year the Joseph H. Hirshhorn collection has formally
come under the aegis of the Institution. A site on the Mall for
this unique new museum and sculpture garden has already been
authorized by Congress; the architect, Gordon Bunshaft, is at
work; and funds for operation have already been appropriated
by the Congress. Abram Lerner has been appointed Director
of the new gallery and has continued his busy role as curator
of the collection in preparing materials for loan, one of which,
a collection of 53 pieces of sculpture, is currently on exhibition
at Dartmouth College (see Sculpture in Our Century; selections
from the Joseph H. Hirshhorn collection, 1967, Hopkins Center,
Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire). Mr. Hirshhorn
is continually adding important works to the collection. Since
the formal presentation of the collection to the United States,
an abbreviated list of acquisitions includes works by Cassatt,
Cornell, Stuart Davis, Ernst, Falguiére, Fontana, Sam Francis,
George Grosz, Ipoustéguy, Zoltan Kemeny, Moore, Nadelman,
Nicholson, Olitski, Picasso, Pomodoro, Rauschenberg, Rodin,
Sargent, Sheeler, and Frank Stella. Mr. Hirshhorn’s continued
enthusiasm and personal spirit and energy know no bounds. The
Nation will long have cause to remember him.

In some of the Institution’s special science fields the past
year has been one of notable achievement. In the work of the
Radiation Biology Laboratory, a “‘first’? has been the successful
measuring of the relative sensitivity of the control of growth and
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 25

bending responses of moss cells by various regions of the visible
spectrum. These data, obtained by plant physiologist Bernard
Nebel, indicate that light control occurs through continuous
excitation of both absorbing forms of the well-known pigment
system phytochrome. This role of phytochrome has not been
reported previously, and may have general significance in under-
standing plant development under natural environmental condi-
tions.

Plants were grown under newly developed artificial light
sources having a constant color quality but capable of mimicking
natural daily variations in sunlight intensity and daylength.
Normal daylength responses, such as time of flowering, known
to occur in these plants, were greatly altered, depending upon
the direction of incremental change in daylength. For example,
the critical photoperiod to induce flowering could be changed
by several hours depending upon whether the daily photoperiod
was decreasing or increasing. Such data, obtained by Laboratory
Director William Klein, assisted by plant physiologists Leonard
Price and Victor Elstad, indicate that the concept of a specific
critical photoperiod for any given species of plant may be in-
correct, and these data may change entirely our present views of
the mechanism of light control of flowering.

During the winter a graduate-level seminar series of 13
lectures in photobiology attracted an average of 160 participants
weekly. Experts in the major areas of photobiology lectured and
then informally answered questions and discussed their current
research. The program was jointly supported by the Smithsonian
and the Consortium of Washington Area Universities. Graduate
credit was offered and new research interests of both students
and professionals were greatly stimulated.

At an ecology seminar held with a visiting group of ecologists
from the University of Michigan, led by Professor Lawrence
Slobodkin, biochemist David Correll of the Radiation Biology
Laboratory suggested a new method for measuring gross primary
productivity in aquatic ecosystems. The method involves the
measurement of the rate of incorporation of 3?P-phosphate into
imidodiphosphate compounds, which are the first products of
photophosphorylation in algae. Combined with net primary
productivity, as measured by 'C-carbon dioxide incorporation
or bomb calorimetry, an estimate of the efficiency of primary
26 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

productivity could be obtained. The proposed determinations of
productivity would be rapid and could be applied to streams,
lakes or oceanic situations, a suggestion which should be of
immediate value to the International B-ological Program.

The appearance of Professor Slobodkin and his students
for a week-long visit provided a welcome infusion of vigorous
discussion into the Smithsonian laboratories. As he himself
observed, ‘“The Smithsonian, like almost all institutions con-
cerned with pure research, stands permanently balanced
between emphasis on intellectual quality, intellectual styles
and social demands. With luck these three can be served simul-
taneously. Sufficiently profound intellects create intellectual
currency, both by refusing to become bogged down in trivial
problems, and by refusing to deal with any problems in trivial
ways. At the same time socially significant problems are typically
difficult to solve and therefore constitute interesting challenges
to important intellects.”

This Institution has been remarkably lucky to hold on to a
talented staff. One of the increasingly difficult problems is the
continued falling behind of laboratories, such as those of the
Smithsonian, in the competition with the universities to hold
distinguished intellects. Civil service salaries, while still roughly
equivalent for certain categories of scientists, are woefully
deficient in the area of the social sciences (which includes
anthropology) as well as in the humanities. Government-salaried
employees of the Smithsonian of faculty rank outside the
scientific categories are treated like proverbial stepchildren
under present Government regulations. The universities, in
spite of their own financial difficulties, continue to beckon with
important grants, surrounding facilities, and amenities ranging
from guaranteed tuition support for scholars’ children to the
most extraordinary appeals to personal idiosyncrasies and
desire for academic prestige.

Above all there are the students, for better or worse, a
constant lure and an intellectual stimulus. This Institution
strives constantly to make our laboratories and field stations
available to students at all levels, knowing how crucial such
interactions can be not only for the staff but also for the students
themselves, and our desire is to expose them to the specialties
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY ai

in science and related scholarly fields uniquely developed in
the Institution. Last year some 86 students were brought to
the Smithsonian for extended periods of research; others visited
in special groups such as the rewarding visit of the Michigan
ecologists. Visiting research appointments were given to 19
distinguished postdoctoral scientists and scholars.

One of the great national resources of the United States is
the National Herbarium, maintained in the Museum of Natural
History. Since the days when it sponsored Asa Gray’s classic
Synoptical Flora of North America, the Smithsonian Institution
has been an important contributor to our knowledge of indige-
nous plants of North America. Now it is joining in a large inter-
national project that will utilize its vast collection of dried
specimens and library sources in a brand new effort to survey the
American flora. When the American Society of Plant Taxono-
mists on August 14, 1966, decided to organize the ‘Flora
North America Project,’ Stanwyn G. Shetler was named
executive secretary, and the Smithsonian Institution agreed
to serve as headquarters for the Secretariat. In his new capacity,
Mr. Shetler has spent considerable time during the year laying
groundwork for the project. In January 1967 the first meeting
of the nine-man editorial committee was held in the department
of botany to establish the framework of the project and to
appraise its financial and manpower requirements. The project,
which is being sponsored and managed by the American
Institute of Biological Sciences, will be a fifteen-year, cooperative
effort by American and Canadian taxonomists to produce a
four-volume manual of the 15-20 thousand native vascular
plants of North America north of Mexico. In addition to the
publication which will result, the project is expected to result
in the training of many new taxonomists and to attract many
potential young students in the field. With the completed
Flora U.S.S.R. for the Soviet Union and the developing Flora
Europeae, which together: will cover all of Eurasia, this new
North American treatise will fill the last gap in our knowledge
of Boreal and Arctic floras of the world.

Another of the great resources of the Natural History Mu-
seum is its historic strength in marine biology collections, both
recent and fossil. A study of the taxonomically difficult and very
28 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

poorly known coralline red algae in the eastern North Atlantic
has kept Walter H. Adey aboard ship for most of the year. This
is part of a broader study of the systematics and ecology of
these algae in the entire North Atlantic area from the Tropics
to the Arctic. During the past year, Adey has worked in Iceland,
Scandinavia, and the British Isles; he will next proceed south
to the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, and thence westward
to the tropical Caribbean area.

Crustose corallines are the:dominant benthic organisms in
shallow northern waters. In the Tropics, however, they are fre-
quently prime contributors to reef formations. Being calcified,
they are potential fossils, and as such they are potentially im-'
portant time-stratigraphic and paleoecological indicators. In the
130 years since their plant nature was generally understood, the
group has had only two major students—largely because of their
heavy calcification and the difficulty of preparing them for study.

The study includes data from investigations of the anatomy,
cytology, and morphology, with conclusions being drawn on a
population basis. In addition to demonstrating a number of
hitherto unrecognized but important cytological, anatomical,
and morphological characteristics, Adey has been able to obtain
for the first time quantitative ecological data for crustose coral-
lines and to show correlations with physical variables, especially
temperature and substrate. In addition to the materials which
he is obtaining from shipboard, he spent the winter months,
when it was not practical to work at sea, studying type materials
in Scandinavian museums.

The Smithsonian Institution has long been concerned with
the problems of classification and identification of nonhuman
primates. The dramatic and still-increasing use of such animals
in medical research and other scientific studies has exposed
repeatedly the confusion and inadequacy of primate classifica-
tion. In the latter part of 1967 the Smithsonian Institution will
establish a center for the study of primate animals from the view-
point of their morphology, anatomy, genetic constitution, pale-
ontology, and behavior. Professor John R. Napier, from the
University of London, has been invited to participate with the
Institution in organizing such a program, which will benefit
both European and U.S. institutions of higher learning, mu-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 29

seums, primate centers, and biomedical research units generally.
As it is currently planned by Napier and curator Charles O.
Handley of the Smithsonian, the proposed center would include
both research and service functions; for example, a standard
checklist of names and a preliminary guide to the identification
of primates will be prepared as quickly as resources permit. At
the beginning, systematic or taxonomic studies will be con-
cerned with those nonhuman primates of most immediate con-
cern to the various research centers in Europe and in the United
States. In the future, studies will be undertaken of the compara-
tive external structure of these animals, their behavior as it
relates to taxonomic problems, breeding patterns, and such
techniques as may be appropriate from physiology, serology,
and cytology. Ultimately, a descriptive manual of the primates
is ant cipated.

Under the direction of Dr. Handley, two field groups con-
tinued the work of the Smithsonian Venezuelan Project in the
eastern and southern part of that country. They collected
mammals, their ectoparasites, blood sera, and biological and
ecological data. More than twenty scientists in six countries are
participating in this project with the cooperation and support
of several Venezuelan scientific organizations.

Through the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. William S. Cowles,
who contributed their airplane and their time as pilots, it was
possible for Handley to make an aerial ecological survey of
Venezuela. Covering about 10,000 miles from the air, Dr.
Handley studied variations in vegetation and terrain that might
affect the distribution of mammals, as a means of further refine-
ment of the Venezuelan project.

The United States National Museum, beginning in 1964,
has been attempting to pioneer the use of computer techniques
for information retrieval as an aid in handling collections. During
the past year curator James A. Peters has become actively
concerned in the development of computer programs directly
applicable to systematic research in the department of vertebrate
zoology and in the Museum of Natural History generally. Three
teletypes installed in the Museum permit direct access to a com-
mercial computer located outside the Institution. Peters and
others have written programs, permitting rapid calculation of
30 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

standard statistical values, which have already made it possible
to carry out analyses previously impossible because of the amount
of time required. Peters is also developing a computer-key to
the genera of snakes of Latin America, about 75 percent of which
are already included. Insertion into the computer of basic data
on a new collection results in a print-out of the correct generic
name in less than four seconds by the use of the computer-key.
In at least some areas of biology, keys of this kind may permit
rapid sorting and preliminary identification of collections by
research assistants.

Along the same lines, the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey
Program, in collaboration with the Smithsonian information
systems division, has developed a data-processing program for
the analysis of sea bird observations. The data base now includes
more than 100,000 observations of sea birds in the Pacific, along
with associated oceanographic and meteorological data.

During the past few years the theory of sea-floor spreading
and continental drift has received strong support from oceanic
geophysical evidence, especially from magnetic surveys across
the midocean ridges. This theory, long accepted by Southern
Hemisphere geologists, is becoming for the first time widely
accepted by geologists in the Northern Hemisphere. Samples
collected by William Melson and colleagues at St. Paul’s Rocks
on the mid-Atlantic Ridge have been radiometrically dated by
Stanley Hart at the University of California, La Jolla. The
results indicate that St. Paul’s Rocks is an exposure of an
extremely young intrusion, and since sea-floor spreading entails
constant formation of new oceanic crust along the mid-Atlantic
Ridge, the zone at which rifting and spreading should occur, the
young age of St. Paul’s Rocks is clearly consistent with the theory
of sea-floor spreading and of continental drift. This conclusion
is a part of Melson’s study of the rocks from the mid-Atlantic
Ridge, directed toward tracing the development of the oceanic
crust.

In astrophysics the results of a comprehensive space-age
survey of the world, using artificial satellites as triangulation
points, have been published in a special report by the Smith-
sonian Astrophysical Observatory. The three-volume, 686-page
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 31

report, ““The Smithsonian Standard Earth,”* provides one of
the most accurate representations of the earth’s geometrical
figure and gravitational potential ever made. The ten-year
satellite geodesy project is the first to complete a circumferential
measurement of the globe by means of simultaneous observa-
tions of satellites. Intercontinental distances are determined with
an accuracy of better than 50 feet, as compared with previous
errors measured in hundreds of feet. Based on more than 40,000
precise satellite observations made by the Observatory’s net-
work of Baker-Nunn tracking cameras, the research was done
as part of the National Geodetic Satellite Program and was
supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The ‘‘Standard Earth”’ will serve as the foundation for all
future geodetic research at the Observatory. Also, it will provide
a basic reference book for scientists engaged in other inter-
national programs of satellite geodesy. The data may be used
for calculation both of distances between points on the surface
of the earth and of irregularities in the earth’s gravitational
field. The geodetic reference points established by the “‘Stand-
ard” also may help investigators studying the history and com-
position of the earth’s interior.

In the 1966 Smithsonian Year there is a brief discussion of the
Institution’s classic and historic interest in its own environment,
the Washington Mall. This year has seen a continuation of the
program of keeping that environment alive and vital. This we
have attempted in the past two years in conjunction with the
Master Plan for the Mall as well as the operations of overall
stewardship being constantly undertaken by the National Park
Service. It is important to recognize that buildings are not simply
entities in themselves, set down haphazard in an alien environ-
ment. Rather, if they develop a strong interplay with the land-
scape, both are benefited, both come alive.

One of the most interesting examples of this principle
occurred over the July Fourth weekend of 1967, when the
Institution—aided by the State Art Councils of Oklahoma,

Arkansas, and Virginia; the State of New Mexico; Alaskan
Airlines; the State of North Carolina Travel Council; the
Southern Highland Handicraft Guild; the Navaho Tribal
Council; and the Iowa Tourist Council—held a folk festival
on the Mall adjacent to the Museum of History and Technology.
As Congressman Thomas M. Rees of California said in the Con-
gressional Record (July 20, 1967, H 9160-1), ‘“‘For the first
time, thousands of people, over 430,000, experienced a live
museum which exhibited the art of American folklife and they
loved every toe-tapping minute .... Basket weavers, pottery
makers, woodworkers, carvers, doll makers, needleworkers, tale
tellers, boat builders, and folk singers, dancers, and musicians
from all over the country were brought to remind Americans of
their heritage—still a living part of our nation. In this day of
the frug and jerk Americans need to be shown what their own
culture has produced and continues to produce.”

Within—in the Museum—the tools, the products of craft
work, the musical instruments hang suspended in cases, caught
in beautifully petrified isolation. Without, for the space of a few
hours they came alive in the hands of specialists from all over
America, many of them proponents of a dying or little-known
craft or musical art. In all of this, the great sight was the quiet
and immense satisfaction of the people who came to watch and
listen, sitting around and taking it all in, while their children
romped nearby on the grass. It was a moving spectacle and one
that underscored the principle that a museum, to be a museum
in the best sense of the word, must live and breathe both within
and without.

STAFF CHANGES

A number of senior positions throughout the Institution were filled
during the year. Charles L. Clapp was appointed Assistant to the
Secretary for problems concerned with development. He had been
associated with the Institution for five years as the legislative assistant
to Senator Leverett Saltonstall, a former Regent of the Smithsonian.

Carl Fox joined the Institution as Director of the Museum Shops.
During fifteen years as manager of the Brooklyn Museum sales shops,
Mr. Fox became widely respected throughout the museum field for the
excellence of his sales exhibitions. More recently he served as inter-
national art curator for Hallmark, Inc.

The Secretary appointed Abram Lerner to be the first Director of
the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Mr. Lerner
has been the curator of the Hirshhorn collection for ten years and
earlier he was associate director concurrently for two New York City
museums: The American Contemporary Arts Gallery and the Artist’s
Gallery.

Dr. Donald Menzel, retiring Director of the Harvard Observatory,
recently joined the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory as a senior
physicist. —The Observatory gained the services of another senior
physicist, Dr. Winfield W. Salisbury from the Varo Manufacturing
Company, Garland, Texas, who will work on applications of advanced
electronic techniques to astrophysical problems.

Dr. Brian Mason, after serving for twelve years as the chairman of
the department of mineralogy at the American Museum of Natural
History, joined the Museum of Natural History as research curator in
the division of meteorites, in the department of mineral sciences.

James R. Morris came to the Institution with a background in
operatic singing and theatrical production to direct the division of
performing arts. This new unit was formed to assist the existing per-
formance activities of the museums, to develop new performance
programs related to the museum collections and the subjects of scholarly
investigation conducted by the curatorial staff. Outdoor performances
on the Mall will be a special responsibility of this division.

Mrs. Helen L. Hayes has joined the Assistant Secretary (Science) to
serve as his special assistant. Before coming to the Smithsonian, Mrs.
Hayes was Head of the Oceanographic Biological Program in the
Office of Naval Research.

Robert R. Engle came from the District of Columbia government to
aid the Assistant Secretary with engineering and architectural review
of plans for the Institution’s many construction and renovation projects.

After directing the Public Information Office since September 1965,
B. Richard Berg resigned to accept the position of Vice President of
38 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Lindenwood College in St. Louis, Missouri. John Whitelaw was granted
a ten-month leave of absence to accept a fellowship for study of Con-
gressional operations awarded by the American Political Science
Association.

During the year several members of the staff were lauded for their
contributions to the Institution. James Bradley received the Excep-
tional Service Award, the highest award bestowed by the Smithsonian.
Special mention was made of his efforts on behalf of the National Air
and Space Museum and the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden. Frank A. ‘Taylor was commended for his role as statesman
of the museum world as a result of the enactment of the National
Museum Act by which Congress has recognized the cultural and educa-
tional importance of museums.

Also deserving of special recognition are Charles Blitzer, for his
direction of the experimental neighborhood museum, and William W.
Warner, for his skillful negotiation of international research agreements
in the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program.

Three members of the staff who left the Institution for professional
advancement last year should be mentioned. Dr. William L. Stern,
chairman of the department of botany, has accepted an appointment
to the department of botany, University of Maryland. Peter Morse,
acting curator in the division of graphic arts, has joined the Honolulu
Academy of Fine Arts. In September 1966, G. Carroll Lindsay left the
Institution after serving for four years as the Director of Museum
Services and more recently as Executive Secretary of the Smithsonian
Associates. He has become the Director of Museum Services for the
New York State Museum.

Through retirement our professional staff has lost the valued services
of Henry B. Collins, archeologist in the division of cultural anthro-
pology; Paul S. Conger, associate curator, division of cryptogams,
department of botany; and Richard Ettinghausen, head curator of
Near Eastern art at the Freer Gallery of Art, who has joined the staff
of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.

SMITHSONIAN MEDALS

The Smithsonian’s Hodgkins Medal was awarded twice in 1967: on
February 15 to J. Grahame Clark, Disney Professor of Archeology in
the University of Cambridge; and on April 26 to Fritz W. Went,
Professor of Botany at the University of Nevada Desert Research
Institute.

Professor Clark, who received the award ‘‘for outstanding contribu-
tions to the knowledge of the physical environment bearing upon the
welfare of man,” was cited as one—
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 39

Whose archeological studies of settlement and land use in Western Europe
have illuminated the cultural influences of biological and physical factors
in man’s environment;

Whose insights into the mute objects of prehistory have extended to the
entire phenomenon of man; and

Whose teaching and research have contributed to maintaining the unity
of anthropology in all its aspects.

Professor Went was cited as a scientist—

Whose discovery of the photochemical transformation of plant volatiles
led to an understanding of the phenomenon of blue haze, a form of
atmospheric pollution observable in nature as well as in the landscapes
of Leonardo da Vinci;

Whose perfection of the phytotron for precise control of experimental
environments increased our understanding of daily and seasonal rhythms
in the life of plants;

Whose research on growth substances contributed to the earliest knowledge
of hormonal control of plant growth in relation to environmental vari-
ables; and

Whose enthusiasm and example have inspired generations of students and
scientists of the environmental physiology and ecology of plants.

The Smithsonian’s Langley Medal was awarded on June 6, 1967, to
Wernher von Braun, Director of the George C. Marshall Space Flight
Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration: “In recog-
nition of his creative vision of the practical application of rocket power
to space flight leading to the first U.S. satellite, and of his technical
leadership in development of the Saturn class of large launch vehicles
upon which the Apollo moon flight is based.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The membership of the Board of Regents was changed upon the
retirement of Senator Leverett Saltonstall in December 1966. The
Board at the May 1966 meeting recorded its gratitude to Senator
Saltonstall for his distinguished service as a Regent from January 1949
to December 1966. The Members of the Board expressed their admira-
tion for his dedication to the Nation through his many years of public
service.

Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania was appointed as a Member
of the Board of Regents on January 12, 1967. Senator Scott is a recog-
nized expert on Chinese art and is a member of the Oriental Art
Committee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The present membership of the Board is given on page iii.

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was held in the Presi-
dential Room of the Museum of History and Technology on January
25, 1967. After the meeting the Regents dined in the newly com-

Hewvmut K. BuECHNER, Head

Sheva IS BEING JOLTED into a sharp awareness of its environment.
We are concerned over the polluted air we breathe. We are con-
cerned over the physiological effects of biocides in the food we eat
and the accumulation of strontium-90 in our bones. We are concerned
over the mental stresses that develop from living in overcrowded and
deteriorating cities. As a result, we are entering a new era, scarcely
imagined 25 years ago, in which society is facing the urgent need to
adjust patterns of human culture to the physical and biological limita-
tions of the earth’s ecological systems.

For the average citizen, ecology is fast becoming a household word,
as increasingly it is being demonstrated to him that man is in nature
and is a part of nature. No longer can he regard himself simply as a

Ecotocy: from the Greek oikos, abode, dwelling; the study of inter-
relationships among living organisms (as individuals, populations, and
communities) and their environments.

separate creation divinely appointed to manipulate nature at will.
He now begins to understand that a human society with its total
environment functions as an integrated whole in nature—that is, as
an ecological system, or ecosystem.

He sees, moreover, that with his modern technology man is capable
of massive environmental manipulations that were unimagined even a
few years ago; and because he is told that such changes are usually
irreversible and can adversely affect the lives of future generations
as well as his own, he now senses the importance of seeking scientifically
valid means of predicting the consequences of any alteration in the
ecosystems of the world.

He begins to recognize, in short, that he must increase his scientific
understanding of whole ecosystems, taking man as an essential com-
ponent, if he is to establish a viable basis for the cultural and intellectual
development of human society. Leading humanists, scientists, and

45
46 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Congressmen have for some time been keenly aware of this and of
the adverse ecological changes occurring throughout the world today,
and they express mounting concern lest the quality of human life
deteriorate to an unbearable degree through improper management
of the environmental systems which sustain it.

We openly admit that between man and his total environment
unstable relationships have formed, and that under the twin pressures
of an expanding economy and of excessive self-constricting population
growth, competition for the finite resources of the earth almost in-
evitable results in their misuse.

Having accepted the fact that human society is an integral part of
the earth’s ecosystems and that the resources of its environments are
limited, what then must we do? If the critical problem facing humanity
today is the ecological one of harmoniously relating human societies
to sensitive environments of finite scope and potential, we are forced
to conclude that the growth of human society must henceforth be
measured mainly in terms of quality rather than of quantity. The
problem, in its most restricted form, lies within the domain of the
natural sciences. Indeed, from one point of view, we can regard
ecology as the most recent scientific outgrowth of natural history.
But in its most general form the problem involves all the dynamics
of man-in-society. Here it is that ecological principles are confronted
with those of economics, political theory, law, and education—indeed,
with all the institutions and organized structures of knowledge that
deal significantly with the social reality. Clearly, the problem is too
intricate and too important for the ecologist alone to solve.

Putting in perspective the present destructive influences of man
on his environment, and ultimately on his own society, requires a new
approach involving a synthesis of relevant knowledge from the humani-
ties and behavioral sciences as well as from the natural sciences.
Eminent contemporary intellectuals have already pointed out that
we need a new science, ecologically oriented but not ecology in its
traditional sense. The subject matter of the new science is human
society and its total environment. If we think in terms of levels of
biological integration—the molecular, cellular, organismal, popula-
tion, community, and community-plus-environment levels—then we
must regard the highest and most complex level as that dealing with
the human dimension, where human society and its containing en-
vironment exist as a functioning whole in nature. We have seen that
in molecular biology, near the bottom of the spectrum, spectacular
advances in our understanding of the genetic code have resulted from
the integration of ideas found in chemistry, physics, mathematics,
OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 47

and biology. Can we expect anything less exciting and significant to
grow out of our concentration upon the highest levels of organization,
at the other end of the spectrum, where the penalty of ignorance may
well be irreversible and devastating change?

The challenge is enormous and the difficulties immense. In view
of the complexity that presents itself, even at the lower levels of
biological integration, the task of building a conceptual structure that
would enable us to deal effectively with the upper regions of the
spectrum, and with the spectrum in its entirety, seems almost over-
whelming. Some have remarked that the highest ecosystem level
is not only more complex than we think it is, it is more complex than
we can think.

Yet the problem is often one of perspective; and if we are to face
our work squarely, we must make every effort to rid ourselves of that
form of cultural nearsightedness which obscures the total design of
the canvas even while it brings the details into focus. For example, the
cycling of radioactive particles or pesticides through plants and
animals into man—who released these destructive contaminants in
the first place—is an ecosystem phenomenon, the attributes of which
involve decisions in the minds of men as well as the physical movement
of these substances through the air, water, soil, and living organisms.
Thus, recognizing that human values and the motivating forces of
economics and politics can contribute directly to the structural and
functional characteristics of ecosystems in which man is the dominant
force, it is clear that one must direct thought and research toward
searching out the unique and possibly controlling phenomena—in
this case, man’s cultural behavior—that operate at whatever level
in nature is under study.

Within this broad context of the search for solutions to contemporary
ecological problems relevant to or embracing modern society, the
Smithsonian program in ecology is evolving. Its primary goal is to
advance basic ecological theory at all levels of biological integration,
but its emphasis is upon the largely unexplored higher levels—on
such areas as populations and communities of animals, on vegetation
as a structure or pattern of plant communities, and on communities-
plus-environments as total ecosystems. It seeks particularly to study
ecosystems that are least modified by man. These are natural com-
plexes and are self-maintaining when human interference does not
intrude upon the regulatory processes enough to cause the system to
deteriorate; they can therefore provide the means ‘to understand and
measure the effects of such interference. This type of undisturbed area
is becoming increasingly rare in our day and, without protection from
man’s activities, it will soon disappear.
48 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

The Smithsonian program of ecology also, therefore, encourages
and practices conservation, which has two aspects—the aesthetic
and the scientific. With the aesthetic aspect all are familiar—so
familiar, in fact, that the arguments in favor of preserving unmolested
the beauty of the land elicit something like a conditioned reflex, and
we dutifully nod our approval.

But with the other aspect—the scientific values of conservation—
we are much less familiar. From a scientific point of view, conservation
means preserving the capacity of ecosystems to support rich and
varied forms of life. This is a matter of biological necessity if we are
to maintain a diversity of environments in which it is not only possible
to live but also in which it is worth living. The natural area, so-called
because the works of man are not significant elements in its composition,
is an outdoor laboratory and, as such, it is the only apparatus by which
we can gauge the changes that occur in the regions dominated and
modified by man. These reserves are the only frame of reference we
have. In them we can make observations with a minimum of dis-
turbance, or carry out controlled and carefully recorded environmental
manipulations ‘to determine how ecosystems actually function in
nature. This sort of research contributes to our ability to predict
the consequences of man’s alteration of his environment. |

The Smithsonian Institution encourages, and aids where possible,
the establishment of natural areas for research, education, and as a
means of communicating ecological ideas to society. The Chesapeake
Bay Center for Field Biology, under the administration of the Office
of Ecology, reflects this interest and activity. Such areas must be
under the best protection that society can provide through its laws
and institutions; and the 120 years of Smithsonian tradition in pre-
serving objects of cultural and scientific importance provides assurance
that natural areas, which might be thought of as outdoor museums,
will be saved in perpetuity for science and society.

While emphasis is placed on the higher orders of biological integra-
tion and on the conservation and study of natural ecosystems generally,
the Smithsonian ecology program also includes _species-oriented
ecology, and the biological problems related to urban development
are not excluded. And although research is given priority, the ecology
program is also deeply committed to education and to the diffusion
of sound ecological information throughout society. In this sphere its
efforts are directed toward constructing a conceptual framework,
drawing upon the humanities, the behavioral sciences and the natural
sciences, that will enable man to deal purposively with his world on
the level of human-society-plus-its-total-environment. To gather these
strands together, research is being linked with university education at
OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 49

home and abroad, and contemporary ecological thought is being
transmitted through lectures, seminars, and publications.

If we accept the thesis that advancement of scientific theory about
ecosystems and man’s place in these systems is oriented primarily
around the understanding of how they actually behave in nature, then
with sufficient knowledge about how ecosystems work, we may be able
to manage them in the best interests of society by manipulating the
controlling (or regulatory) processes. Increasing our understanding
of how an ecosystem works requires two general types of research.

One type of research is concerned with basic descriptions (1) of the
physical, chemical, and biotic components of the system; (2) of the
structural and functional relationships of these components to each
other and to the system as a whole; (3) of the variations of the system
in time and space; and (4) of the environmental relationships of the
system to other ecological systems. The total systems approach, embrac-
ing climate, soils, hydrology, vegetation, and animal life (including
man), provides a foundation for studies of regulatory processes. These
basic descriptions require a solid foundation in the taxonomy of the
species components: precise identification of plants, animals, and other
organisms is fundamental to the advancement of ecological theory.
Basic descriptions also include preliminary interpretations. These
concern, for example, the ecological interrelationships of the compo-
nent populations, the cause and effect of changes in vegetation and
its associated animal life through time, or the influence of upwelling
ocean currents on the productivity of marine life—and in turn they
often generate ideas for further studies on the functions and processes
of ecosystems.

As was pointed out earlier, ecology is sometimes said to be the
scientific outgrowth of natural history. In the ecology program of the
Smithsonian a strong foundation for research concerned with basic
descriptions is provided by the vast collections and the enormous bank
of taxonomic knowledge in its Museum of Natural History, a bank
to which the Smithsonian has contributed for over 100 years through
its expeditions into the virgin areas of the Western States, the Arctic
regions, the Tropics, and elsewhere throughout the world.

The massive task of curating the collections from these expeditions
leads naturally into systematic and evolutionary biology, and as a
consequence, taxonomists have often become so specialized in the
systematics and biogeography of their own particular group of orga-
nisms that they have had little time or inclination to explore the signifi-
cance of ecological studies. Ecologists, on the other hand, have often
tended to underestimate the importance of these basic descriptions
and the significance of systematic biology and ecology at the species
50 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

level. A related objective of the Smithsonian ecology program, there-
fore, is to bridge the gap that has developed between systematists
and ecologists and to renew the close relationships that formerly
existed between these two disciplines. Obviously, such interdisciplinary
integration is essential if we are to increase our knowledge of how
ecological systems work in nature.

The second type of research required to increase understanding of
how ecosystems work is concerned with interpretive, ecosystem-
oriented studies rather than basic descriptions. Examples of such
studies would be (1) the role of social behavior, or the significance of
predator-prey relationships in the numerical regulation of animal
populations; (2) the principles of vegetation change; (3) the flow of
energy through the system as expressed in rates and amounts of primary
and secondary productivity; (4) the cycling of mineral nutrients; or
(5) the consequences of man’s environmental manipulations. These
examples point the direction in which the new quantitative ecology
is developing. These are the studies at the higher levels of biological
integration, although usually below the level of human-society-plus-
environment, that excite ecologists intellectually, even though they
are often without direct consequence to society.

To sum up: the Smithsonian program in ecological research embraces
both basic descriptions and ecosystem-oriented studies. It emphasizes
studies of significance to both ecological theory and to the under-
standing of man’s place in nature. Its aim is to form a small group of
scholars, each of whom will advance knowledge significantly in his
own specialty—be it vegetation science, animal behavior, the dy-
namics of animal populations, or the energetics of ecosystems—and
who will also help construct a new interdisciplinary framework that
will enable us to assemble a broad spectrum of knowledge relevant
to the current ecological problems of our society. By this means,
it is hoped, a viable scientific basis can be established for maintaining
and improving the quality of man’s environment.

In this challenging new era of multiple, competing demands and
shifting perspectives, the Smithsonian Institution, as a privately
endowed organization with strong governmental relationships, serves
as an important focal point for both national and international
programs in basic research and education in ecosystem-oriented
ecology.

in ecology at the Smithsonian Institution may be found in the following

INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM IN ECOLOGY

Surveys of opportunities for ecological research have been initiated
in countries where Public Law 480 funds are available. The objective
is to make initial contacts with scientists, with university and govern-
ment officials, and with other relevant persons in the country to
5D SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

explain the Smithsonian program, obtain cooperation, and determine
their interests in ecosystem-oriented ecology. Opportunities are
sought for research in basic principles and concepts concerning the
dynamics of animal populations, vegetation change, primary and
secondary productivity, the cycling of nutrients, demography, numeri-
cal regulation of populations with emphasis on social behavior, and
ecological anthropology.

Although emphasis is placed on ecosystem-oriented research,
species-oriented ecology and environmental physiology are also
included, and insofar as possible all research is in meaningful context
to society. Through these preliminary surveys, programs of interrelated
projects within and between countries can be developed. With this
information at hand, scientists in U.S. institutions, including the
Smithsonian, whose research interests echo the opportunities in the
foreign countries, are sought out to develop specific research projects.

Under the program of surveys of opportunities, Jagmohan Sing
Maini, of the Canada Department of Forestry, visited his native India
for six weeks in April and May; professor George A. Petrides of
Michigan State University extended his attendance at the Interna-
tional Conference on Tropical Ecology in New Delhi for preliminary
talks with Indian scientists; and Kai Curry-Lindahl of the zoology
department, Nordiska Museet and Skansen, Stockholm, Sweden, and
Walter Leuthold, Zoological Institut, University of Zurich, Switzer-
land, completed a survey during May and June in the Republic of
the Congo (Kinshasa). Ecological research in the Congolese National
Parks and equivalent reserves is of special high priority. Charles H.
Wurster, Department of Biological Sciences, State University of
New York, Stony Brook, Long Island; George M. Woodwell, Brook-
haven National Laboratory, Long Island, New York; and George E.
Watson visited Israel in early April to initiate arrangements for
studies of the effects of pesticides on bird populations, with special
attention to the movements of pesticides through selected arid and
irrigated ecosystems in Israel.

Preparations were completed for Robert L. Fleming, a postdoctoral
student from Michigan State University, and Robert H. Horwich, a
postdoctoral student from the University of Maryland, to spend one
year in India as consultants to the Smithsonian Office of Ecology,
during which time they will initiate long-term research in avian migra-
tion and mammalian behavior. These studies are related to the interests
of Smithsonian scientists.

In Ceylon a three-year research project on the behavior and ecology
of elephants has been initiated by John F. Eisenberg, resident scientist
OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 53

at the National Zoological Park, and Helmut K. Buechner, using
Public Law 480 funds. This research is directed primarily toward basic
principles in ethology, but it will also provide the scientific foundation
for conservation practices that are compatible with the development
of forestry and agricultural resources. A grant from the World Wildlife
Fund provides for salaries and equipment not covered by Ceylonese
currency, and a gift of two Land-Rovers by the Fauna Preservation
Society of London solved the problem of transport. Field work was
initiated in late January 1967 by Eisenberg and his predoctoral student
George M. McKay, of the University of Maryland. Fred Kurt, a
postdoctoral student from the University of Zurich, joined the project
in March.

A two-year research project on systematic botany, palynology, and
vegetation was also initiated in Ceylon in January by F. Raymond
Fosberg, special advisor on tropical biology. Field work is under way
by Dieter Mueller-Dombois, a vegetation scientist from the University
of Hawaii, and Peter Comanor, a postdoctoral student of palynology
from Rutgers University, on a project complementary to that of the
study of elephants, in that it provides a basis for studies of food habits
and vegetational relationships of the elephant.

An effort is being made to involve Ceylonese students in these studies.
Excellent relationships have been established with the faculty at the
University of Ceylon, with relevant Government agencies (wildlife and
forestry), and with the Wildlife Protection Society of Ceylon.

The studies in Ceylon are now being expanded by Eisenberg and
research associate Suzanne Ripley of the National Zoological Park to
include a comprehensive study of the biology of primates, with emphasis
on behavior, and a study of the behavioral relationships of man to
elephants. The latter study by Ripley, an anthropologist, is likely
to be as significant in the conservation of elephants as the studies of
their behavior and ecology.

In Brazil, where there are no Public Law 480 funds, ecologically
oriented, interdisciplinary investigations of the Amazonian biota are
evolving rapidly under a cooperative program between the Smithsonian
Institution and the Instituto de Pesquisas e Experimentagdo Agropecu-
arias do Norte (IPEAN) at Belém, Brazil, under the guidance of
Philip S. Humphrey, chairman of the department of vertebrate zoology.
This program was initiated by funds from the Office of Ecology, which
continues to provide financial support.

In Africa the Smithsonian Office of Ecology provides partial support
for an ecologically oriented taxonomic survey of mammals being con-
ducted under the direction of Henry W. Setzer, associate curator of
mammals.
Vegetation on eroded hills (above) surrounding a Korean village in the DMZ
Study Area recovers remarkably after being protected from fuel-gathering for

14 years. Normally 60 percent of the rainfall in Korea occurs during the
growing season, favoring rapid recovery of vegetation on watersheds.

OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 5

Buechner, continuing his investigations on the territorial behavior,
reproduction, and ecology of the Uganda kob, one of the African
antelopes, has in preparation a major manuscript summarizing the
results of earlier work. His paper, “‘A Preliminary Estimation of Energy
Flow in Uganda Kob,” prepared jointly with Frank B. Golley of
the University of Georgia, was presented at a conference of the
International Biological Program in Warsaw, in late Summer 1966.

In Korea, under a contract with the U.S. Air Force Office of Scien-
tific Research, a long-range program of research has been initiated,
using as an ecological baseline a study area immediately south of the
demilitarized zone. This area has been rigidly protected over the past
14 years, and provides a key to understanding man’s impact on Korean
environments. Following a visit to the DMZ study area by Buechner,
Talbot, Fosberg, Smithsonian field representative Edwin L. Tyson,
and Harold J. Coolidge of the Pacific Science Board, National Academy
of Sciences, Tyson began working with scientists at various universities
in Korea to prepare a five-year plan of research for presentation to
granting agencies.

Curator of insects Ke Chung Kim, of the University of Minnesota,
spent January 1967 in Korea as a consultant for the Smithsonian Office
of Ecology to assist with the development of the five-year plan. Tyson
and Kim were able to draw together 55 project proposals that will
form the basis for a unified program of research in the study area.
This is the beginning of a 25-year program in ecosystem-oriented
ecology, the objective of which is to acquire knowledge about environ-
mental relationships of living organisms, including man, as a basis for
achieving stable relationships between human societies and_ the
natural resources of Korea. By providing the basic scientific informa-
tion required to assist Korea in its efforts to become self-sufficient, the
program has relevance to the preservation of our own natural resources
here in the United States.

In other countries, opportunities to conduct short-term research
or planning studies for long-range investigations in environmental
physiology and ecosystem ecology are provided under a contract with
the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

Thus there begins to emerge at the Smithsonian Institution an inter-
national program in ecological research in which ecologists in the United
States can collaborate with scientists abroad to develop ecological
theory, to foster graduate studies, and to help construct a scientific
foundation for the harmonious adjustment of human societies to the
environments of which they are integral parts.
56 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

CHESAPEAKE BAY CENTER FOR FIELD BIOLOGY

The Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland
have joined the Smithsonian Institution in establishing the Chesapeake
Bay Center for Field Biology (CBCFB) for ecological research and
the education of graduate students. This cooperative arrangement
increases the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary research program
by enlarging the pool of scientific talent. It is an open-ended con-
sortium that may be joined by other universities as the program
evolves.

The Center is located about 7 miles south of Annapolis, Maryland,
on the western shore of the Bay. Under Smithsonian ownership, it
consists of about 700 acres of land, including over 10 miles of un-
developed shoreline, that are preserved effectively for a program of
studies extending indefinitely into the future. The abandonment of
about half the area from agriculture more than two decades ago
provides unusual opportunities to study changes in vegetation and
associated animal life. With its relatively undisturbed areas of mature
forest, salt marshes, eroding bluffs, sandy beaches, and shallow
estuaries, the CBCFB constitutes an ecological baseline against which
to compare other systems in this rapidly changing region, and offers
a variety of opportunities for long-term ecological studies. The research
information produced can be applied in the development of both
environmental standards and the construction of models for deter-
mining the effects of man’s accidental or premeditated environmental
manipulations in the vicinity of Washington.

Populations of Foraminifera are being studied at the Center and
elsewhere in Chesapeake Bay by Martin A. Buzas, associate curator
of invertebrate paleontology. The purpose of these studies is to under-
stand the factors influencing distribution, numbers, and the structure
of recent populations of Foraminifera as a basis for interpreting the
characteristics of fossil populations and reconstructing their environ-
ments. The systematics of estuarine mollusks are being studied by
Joseph B. Morrison, associate curator of mollusks. Other marine
invertebrates collected with the mollusks are being preserved for
other research workers. The effects of wintering waterfowl on mollusks
and other bottom organisms of estuaries are being studied by Kyle R.
Barbehenn, Director of the CBCFB. His principle study at the Center
concerns the concepts of stability of populations and intercommunity
interactions between the small mammals of a salt marsh and the
adjoining forest. The social organization of the forest community of
small mammals is apparently more integrated than that of the marsh
community, and therefore more resistant to invasion and more
OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 57

moderate in annual fluctuation of numbers as compared to the
mammalian community of the marsh. The marsh community of small
mammals seems to be more strongly influenced by severe weather,
while the numerical regulation of the forest community depends
more on intrinsic behavioral mechanisms.

George E. Watson, curator of birds, with the assistance of Jan Reese
is conducting studies on the dynamics of populations of ospreys and
great blue herons on Poplar Island. The determination of recruitment
rate and mean annual adult mortality rate of these populations is
particularly significant since these predators concentrate quantities of
insecticides large enough to influence reproduction and mortality.
Both birds are keys to evaluating the influence of man’s activities in
contaminating ecological systems with insecticides.

Sedimentation, with emphasis on the estuaries, is being studied by
Jack W. Pierce, curator of sedimentology, using remote-sensing
techniques from aircraft and satellites as well as conventional methods.

The archeology of the Center and vicinity is being studied by
Henry T. Wright, of the University of Michigan Museum of Anthro-
pology, under the direction of Smithsonian curator of anthropology
Clifford Evans. After a survey of sites, limited explorations will be
made to determine the activities of early man in the region.

The effects of the considerable increase in numbers of whistling swans
on Chesapeake Bay are being studied by William J. L. Sladen of Johns
Hopkins University. Apparently these swans feed extensively on soft-
shelled clams and submerged aquatic plants. Movements of these
swans within the Bay area and during their migrations back to the
Arctic breeding grounds are being traced by means of color-marking
with dyes, and it is hoped that biotelemetric techniques can be em-
ployed. Studies of the estuarine ecology, including the distribution of
submerged aquatic vegetation, water quality with respect to tempera-
ture, salinity, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, and mineral
nutrients, are being conducted by Charles H. Southwick and his
students from Johns Hopkins University. The frequent luxuriant growth
of milfoil and its sudden, unexplained disappearance is of particular
interest and significance. The estuaries at the Center are being com-
pared with other estuaries in Chesapeake Bay, especially those of Back
and Middle Rivers near Baltimore, each of which seems to have its
own particular character.

Investigations being conducted by the faculty at the University of
Maryland include Jack P. Hailman’s investigations of the causes and
mechanisms of change in bird populations in correlation with vegeta-
tional change. Epidemiological studies of free-ranging and confined

populations of rodents and investigations of the parasites of catbirds
are being conducted by Leo A. Jachowski, Jr. A survey of the insect
fauna and studies on specific groups of insects are being conducted by
Donald H. Messersmith and William E. Bickly. The behavior, and
the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms thereof, of the turkey
are being studied by Wolfgang M. Schleidt to clarify hypotheses on
the innate behavior of birds. A major objective of this research is to
determine how various behavioral elements are integrated into a
system that serves to control social structure and its relation to the
environment.

It is intended that the ecological systems at the CBCFB become
taxonomically and ecologically among the best known in the United
States, and that research conducted here will contribute toward under-
standing both the mechanisms that underlie changes in vegetation and
associated animal life and the processes that control populations and
the stability of ecosystems. Such knowledge will not only have signifi-
cance in ecological theory but also be of practical importance to the
management of natural systems in man’s best interest.

The flora and fauna are being studied by Smithsonian systematists.
Research is concerned with not only lists of plants and animals but
also the genetic variability and ecologic relationships of the species
present. An initial survey of the vascular plants has been completed
by Daniel Higman under the direction of Stanwyn G. Shetler, associate
curator of phanerogams, and the floristic survey is now being extended
under the direction of Mason E. Hale, curator of cryptogams. Over
1000 specimens, representing 520 species of plants, have been collected,
and an ecologically annotated list with keys has been completed. The
floristic studies provide the groundwork for research on the principles
of vegetation change, knowledge of which is essential for the manage-
ment of vegetation for forestry, wildlife production, control of water-
sheds, landscaping highways and open spaces, and right-of-way
maintenance. Sufficient evidence has been accumulated in the North
Temperate zone over the past 25 years, particularly by Frank E.
Egler, Director of Aton Forest at Norfolk, Connecticut, to challenge
seriously the concept of a 3- to 5-stage pattern of succession in which
one community creates an environment less favorable to itself and more
favorable to the succeeding community. Egler is collaborating with
the Smithsonian in testing his hypothesis of “Initial Floristic Compo-
sition”? at the CBCFB. According to this concept, vegetational change
results primarily from the disseminules (fruits, seeds, roots, rhizomes)
already present on the site at the time of a major change such as
abandonment of cultivation. Vegetation at the Center lends itself well
to these studies of the underlying mechanisms of change.
OFFICE OF ECOLOGY 61

CONSERVATION

The Smithsonian Institution is actively engaged in international
conservation of nature and natural resources. Lee M. Talbot, Smith-
sonian field representative for international affairs in ecology and
conservation, is collaborating with E. M. Nicholson, convenor of the
terrestrial conservation section of the International Biological Program
(IBP), in the development of a worldwide program in conservation.
Under this program an effort is being made to establish a world network
of nature reserves and to evolve international cooperation in conserving
natural resources. The Smithsonian Institution may ultimately be
engaged in assisting with inventories of plant and animal components
of these selected natural ecosystems and the necessary basic general
descriptions of physical characteristics, vegetation, and animal life.
The IBP provides opportunities for attracting funds to support such
inventories, and to support research by systematists and ecologists in
connection with descriptions of these sites. Smithsonian scientists have
a tradition of devotion to conservation of natural resources, and they
now lend their strong support to the world conservation effort under
the IBP.

TROPICAL BIOLOGY

A program in tropical biology is evolving under the guidance of
special advisor Fosberg. In November a conference, in Panama, on
tropical biology was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, support-
ed by a grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, with the
objectives of (1) drawing the attention of the scientific community
and the public to the urgent need for providing a scientific foundation
for the preservation of the productivity of the world’s energy-rich
tropical systems and (2) obtaining advice and guidance from scientists
as to the role of the Smithsonian in helping to develop an effective
world program in tropical biology. A report on this conference appeared
in the August 1967 issue of BioScience, and some of the results are dis-
cussed in the report of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
Qoel7 1):

EDUCATION

The Office of Ecology is concerned with education in ecology at
American universities. As the United States emerges into its new
awareness of the relevance of environmental relationships to man’s
future, we are caught in a critical shortage of ecologists at all levels
of the subject matter. The formal consortium of the Smithsonian
Institution, The Johns Hopkins University, and the University of
Maryland for mutual cooperation in research and education at the
CBCFB is one mechanism through which students are being attracted
into the field of ecology.
62 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

In a study of education and research programs in ecology at American
universities the Office of Ecology is determining (1) how the Smith-
sonian program in ecology can complement university research
programs, (2) how to develop joint programs to attract young scientists
to the field of ecosystem-oriented ecology, (3) what are the interests
of both faculty and students that can be supported through the Smith-
sonian Foreign Currency Program, and (4) how the resources (scien-
tists, collections, and facilities) of the Smithsonian Institution can
contribute to education in the field of ecology. With this information the
Smithsonian can integrate its program in ecology effectively with
those of universities.

GIFTS AND GRANTS

Several gifts and grants have helped greatly in the development
of the CBCFB during FY 1967. Poplar Island (about 70 acres) was
given to the Smithsonian Institution by Dr. William L. Elkins, a
physician from Philadelphia. ‘This island harbors one of the few large
rookeries of great blue herons on Chesapeake Bay and nearly two dozen
pairs of ospreys. The land acquisition program was facilitated by
generous grants from the Research Corporation and the Max C.
Fleischmann Foundation. The Old Dominion Foundation provided
a highly important grant for initial laboratory facilities, living quarters,
equipment, and other basic requirements of the Center. At this early
stage of development all this assistance is particularly meaningful.

I. EUGENE WALLEN, Head

HE OFFICE OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY, which provides co-
ee and assistance to scientists of the Smithsonian in their
diverse studies of organisms and sediments of the World Ocean, was
established separately within the Office of the Assistant Secretary
(Science) in June 1966. Dr. William I. Aron was appointed Deputy
Head in March 1967.

As part of its mission, the office is responsible for the operation of
the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center and the newly estab-
lished Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center.

Research Activities

An agreement has been reached whereby the Smithsonian research
vessel Phykos will be jointly used with the Southern Maine Vocational
Technical Institute in Portland. Under the initial one-year agreement
Phykos will be used in Maine from Labor Day until November 15 and
from March 15 through June 5. The Institute will maintain the vessel,
and it will be available to the Smithsonian for the other seven months,
whenever we can provide operating funds. The Institute can provide
full support for short research cruises in that area during their pos-
session of the ship and would assist in crewing the vessel during our
possession.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey vessel Oceanographer is on an around-
the-world cruise endorsed by the President. At the urging of the
National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Develop-
ment, arrangements have been made for Richard Pieper (former
General Motors associate of Dr. Aron) and Conrad E. Mahnken and
Jack W. Jossi of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Laboratory in
Miami to join the ship in Bombay and make comparative collections
using the Hardy Plankton Recorder, the Indian Ocean Expedition Net,
and the Tropical Atlantic Expedition Net. R. Glover of Edinburgh
will process the Hardy samples in his Laboratory.

To the National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering
Development Secretary Ripley proposed that the United States set

63
64 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

aside an atoll, an underwater tablemount, and a deep trench as pre-
serves for scientific work. Investigation of possible areas centered on
the naming of Rose Island in the American Samoa group, the
Tonga-Kermadec Trench, and Capricorn Tablemount, adjacent to
the Trench. This concept was approved by the President for
implementation.

About 50 dives have been made by 15 Smithsonian scientists in nine
different submarine vehicles. Although most of the dives have been for
familiarization, these vehicles are of interest to many Institution staff
members for biological and geological research on the origin of under-
sea canyons, the identity and behavior of echinoids and other bottom
organisms, the identity and behavior of midwater organisms, the
structure of the mid-Atlantic ridge, and many other projects. Edwin A.
Link provided free use and support of his ship Sea Diver, his Sub-
mersible Diving Chamber, his underwater house, and Ocean Systems’
new vehicle Deep Diver for initial experiments in the south Florida-
Bahamas area.

Marine science activities under the Foreign Currency Program were
initiated in Tunisia, Pakistan, India, Israel, Yugoslavia, and the United
Arab Republic. Most projects have involved planning visits thus far,
but firm programs have been developed in Israel and in Tunisia.
Additional countries on the list are being considered as possible sources
for the production of marine data. Cooperation with individual scien-
tists has been arranged in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand,
Philippines, Ghana, Iran, Taiwan, Japan, Canada, Thailand, Great
Britain, Dominica, Lebanon, and Antarctica.

Support through the Smithsonian from the Vetlesen Foundation
enabled Miss Julie Booth to spend the last 18 months on Fairfax Island
of the Barrier Reef, off Australia. Miss Booth has assembled photo-
graphs, notes on behavior, paintings, and specimens, most of which will
come to the Smithsonian Institution.

SMITHSONIAN OCEANOGRAPHIC SORTING CENTER

The Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center (SOSC) continues
to act as a service organization to the scientific community by receiving,
sorting, recording, and distributing marine biological, and geological
specimens. It also processes material from such international expedi-
tions as those to the Indian, Tropical Atlantic, and Antarctic Oceans.
Research ships are provided with records forms to insure that specific —
categories of data are provided to the scientist in his evaluation of the
sample. Preferred collection and preservation techniques are demon-
strated by SOSC personnel aboard ships. Shipping containers and
other supplies are furnished for shipboard use.
OFFICE OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY 65

Since SOSC began operations, 34,545 samples of marine organisms
and sediments have been received. From 26,717 of these samples,
15,256,659 specimens and 277,895 cc. of an estimated 2,000,000 shell
fragments have been sorted to date. During the year, 6,885,151
specimens were sorted. Shipments made totaled 276, including 3,675
unsorted lots and 21,050 sorted lots, the latter containing 989,595
specimens. A total of 1,000 shipments of marine specimens have been
sent during the four and one-half years of SOSC existence. These
shipments included 7,650 unsorted lots and 41,823 sorted lots, the
latter including 5,542,631 whole specimens and 277,895 cc. of shell
fragments.

Approval by the seven Advisory Committees and/or by principal
investigators has been given 254 specialists to receive biological and
geological material processed at SOSC. Of these, 139 receive benthic
and midwater-trawl invertebrates; 64 (50 duplicates) receive plankton
groups, 80 (6 duplicates) receive fishes; 14 receive algae and 3, other
plant groups; and 10 receive geological specimens.

These authorized recipients have included specialists from the United
States and from 26 foreign countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba (displaced), Denmark, France,

With the technical advice and assistance of a specialist in systems
analysis, William R. Wheeler, an ADP system was prepared to meet
the specific requirements of SOSC. Standard reports will be pro-
grammed for rapid location of data on specific parameters, such as the
determination of geographic areas in which given taxa have been
present. Another report will list all taxa present in each sample proc-
essed at SOSC. These reports will also include information on the
present location of specimens either at SOSC or at other institutions
for identification and study.

With funds from the National Science Foundation, Office of Ant-
arctic Programs (OAP), a centralized record is being assembled of all
marine and terrestrial specimens collected by past and continuing
U.S. expeditions in Antarctica, in accordance with provisions of the
International Antarctic Treaty. A descriptive file is prepared and
maintained of the ocean-bottom photographs taken from the NSF-
funded Antarctic research ship Eltanin. Prints and negatives are
duplicated and sent to scientists studying the topography and bottom
communities of the ocean floor. A file of collecting permits issued by
the International Cooperation and Information -Program, OAP, is
maintained at SOSC as a preliminary record of material removed from
Antarctica.
66 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Under the Antarctic Records Project, two SOSC staff members
visited Antarctic specialists in the University of Southern California,
Los Angeles County Museum, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California at Berkeley, California Academy of Sciences,
and Stanford University. Cataloged were small collections of Ant-
arctic fishes, birds, and mammals at the California Academy of Sciences,
deep-freeze fish collections remaining at the Stanford Museum, and
various fungi now located at Berkeley. References to other collections
in the West Coast area were recorded for future contacts. Under the
same project, Betty J. Landrum and Harrison Sheng obtained data
on Antarctic entomological collections from the Bernice P. Bishop
Museum, Honolulu.

Although much of the information on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic
entomological collections has been distributed to interested specialists,
the remainder of the material was quite voluminous and much of it
was cataloged. The records included data on over 2,200 combina-
tions of taxa samples. The uncataloged material was estimated to
include over 1,200 slides, 25 jars of an unknown number of Acarina
specimens, and a large volume of sub-Antarctic material.

About 900 new black-and-white prints, 900 black-and-white nega-
tives, and 59 color slides were received and processed during the year.
For each of these, station data have been checked and recorded. The
amount of material now processed and stored totals over 7,000 black-
and-white prints, 7,000 black-and-white negatives, and 1,100 color
slides from Cruises 2-27. From these more than 10,000 prints have
been distributed to 22 scientists and institutions.

MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SORTING CENTER

Most of the many countries of the Mediterranean area have made or
are presently making collections of marine plants and animals. Usually
these countries have only a few marine specialists, and much of the
knowledge that could be obtained from the specimens has, as a result,
been lost to science. Also, the burden of maintaining taxonomic
storage often has ultimately led to the disposal of much valuable
material. This is especially unfortunate because of the expense of making
the collections, the impossibility of duplicating the material, and the
existence of specialists in other countries who would be willing to study
the specimens. The cost of processing, moreover, has deterred most
countries from sorting whole collections and distributing sorted speci-
mens to foreign specialists. Exchange of specimens within the area has
therefore been limited.

Responding to the need implicit in these conditions the Smithsonian
Institution established the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center
OFFICE OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY 67

(MMSC) at the Institut National Scientifique et Technique d’Océano-
graphie et de Péche, in Salammbé, Tunisia.

Plans had been made in 1965 to create a facility that would provide
sorting services in the Mediterranean-Red Sea region similar to those
of the Smithsonian’s Oceanographic Sorting Center in Washington,
D.C. Several sites were available for the establishment of this regional
center. Tunisia was chosen primarily for its location in the central
Mediterranean and because of the enthusiasm shown by the scientists
and Government of Tunisia to cooperate with the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in this project.

Representatives of the Smithsonian Institution met with Tunisian
government officials in late 1965 and mid-1966, and with the assistance
of the Embassy of the United States, an agreement to establish the
Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center was signed in September 1966.
The Director of the host Institut, Dr. Z. Ben Mustapha, has, since the
early planning stages, provided indispensable assistance and guidance.
The Institut is situated on the Gulf of Tunis, twelve kilometers north
of Tunis, at the traditional site of the important and ancient seaport
of Carthage.

The Center offers its services to marine scientists of all countries,
especially in the Mediterranean area. New collections, or collections
that have been partly worked, are processed by MMSC. These are
sorted to specimen groups which are then distributed to specialists for
study. Identified series of specimens ultimately return to MMSC,
whence representative sets are returned to the country of origin and to
recognized depositories around the world.

A working principle of MMSC is that the collector owns the collec-
tion. Generally a collector studies one group of specimens, and a few
groups are sent to some of his colleagues, perhaps associated with his
project. MMSC honors all such primary commitments, and distributes
the committed portion of the collection according to the instructions
of the collector. MMSC will, whenever appropriate, ask specialists to
work on the uncommitted, sorted fractions of the collections.

A series of Advisory Committees of recognized scientists of many
nationalities reviews and approves the qualifications of specialists to
receive MMSC specimens and do research on them. Besides sectional
Advisory Committees which guide MMSC on these matters, a General
Advisory Committee views MMSC in the broad framework of Medi-
terranean research. This Advisory Committee, which had its first
meeting January 17-19, 1967, includes members of international
scientific bodies who are responsible for much of the policy and direction
of the region’s oceanographic activities. This Committee will meet
regularly to provide MMSC with administrative and general guidance.

70 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

When samples are received at MMSC, the preservatives and the
labels are immediately examined. If necessary, preservatives and con-
tainers are replaced and new preservative-resistant labels are added.
The sorting of samples is to a degree that effectively balances what
specialists desire and what can be rapidly and accurately done by
trained technicians. Fishes and algae are sorted to families or genera,
but plankton and benthos are sorted to varying toxonomic levels,
depending on the group. All specimens are distributed with copies of
summarized collection data or field notes.

A great many of the specimen groups are expected to be eagerly sought
by specialists, especially when the new material supplements examples
already at hand, provides specimens from areas to which the specialist
has no access, or furnishes rare specimens. For some specimen groups,
however, specialists are so few that they are already overwhelmed with
study material. MMSC will indicate these shortages and encourage the
training of new specialists. Also MMSC will emphasize the importance
of certain collections, and try to persuade some scientists to study
material which might otherwise be overlooked. Finally, there will be
groups for which there are no specialists at all; here, too, MMSC can
indicate the availability of study material, and the lack of qualified
investigators.

A second aspect of the distribution of specimens by MMSC is in the
equitable apportionment of identified series of specimens resulting from
the work of specialists. First priority for such series generally goes to
the collector and his sponsoring institution. Suggestions are obtained
from the Advisory Committees as to appropriate museums for deposi-
tion of duplicate sets of identified specimens. Deposition will be en-
couraged in museums throughout the world where important related
collections are already housed, and where the material will have
permanent care, and be readily available to scientists.

For maximum efficiency, and to better cope with the variety of
organisms and their techniques for processing, MMSC has been
divided into four sections—vertebrates, plankton, benthic inverte-
brates, and algae. Professional scientists are recruited, from Tunisia
whenever possible, to supervise each section.

At MMSC there is a strong atmosphere of working together. Frequent
informal discussions about techniques and identification are held
among the technicians and the Director of the Center, and ideas are
freely exchanged. To continually improve the quality of specimen
handling by learning new techniques, and to introduce the staff and
associates of MMSC to a variety of experiences and training, MMSC
will occasionally bring systematics specialists to Salammbdé. The Ad-
OFFICE OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY 71

visory Committee members themselves have served as consultants for
administrative and general scientific matters.

The Center sorts collections of the Institut National d’Océanographie,
which has continuing sampling programs for fishes, benthos, and
plankton. The sorting of this material will provide Institut specialists
with certain groups for detailed study; other groups will then be
available for distribution to other specialists.

Mediterranean-Red Sea collections from many sources will be
accepted by MMSC for processing and distribution. As demands
increase, priorities will have to be placed on the sorting of collections
from broader survey projects. Highest priority will generally be given
projects which are international in character.

Information about the Center will be given through contact with
specialists, notices in scientific bulletins, and distribution of descriptive
leaflets. MMSC seeks to obtain wide collection coverage, and at the
same time encourages the participation of a maximum number of
countries and specialists in research on the specimens.

The Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center began operations
November 2, 1966, when Director David M. Damkaer, who normally
serves as supervisor for plankton at the Smithsonian Oceanographic
Sorting Center, reported to the Institut National d’Océanographie
et de Péche, in Salammbé, Tunisia.

Two laboratories on the grounds of the Institut are used for fixa-
tion and preservation of newly-collected organisms. A large room at
the Institut houses the office and laboratory of the Director and his
research associate. A villa has been rented 1000 feet from the Institut
to triple the Center’s working area.

H. Adair Fehlmann, Supervisor of the Smithsonian Oceanographic
Sorting Center in Washington, D.C., worked at MMSC from March
15-31, 1967. Fehlmann led two cruises and two shore-collecting
trips in which all technicians were able to participate. M. DiGenova, an
expert in preservation of marine organisms at the Stazione Zoologica
in Naples, served as a consultant to MMSC for five weeks, and in-
structed MMSC technicians in many aspects of specimen-handling,
with particular emphasis on fixation and preservation. Fresh material
was gathered on 10 shore field trips and during 13 daytime cruises.

In FY 1967, Professor Jose Stirn, from the Institute for Sea Research
at Portoroz, Yugoslavia, joined MMSC as supervisor for benthic
invertebrates.

An administrative assistant, five technicians, and two maintenance
men complete the present MMSC staff. All except the latter two have
had university studies in biology and speak some English; some have
studied abroad. They have passed several months in training in every
di SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

aspect of collection-handling. The technicians are imaginative, eager,
and responsible. With the arrival at MMSC of large collections, the
technicians will help in the training of additional technicians, as the
demands for services increase.

In addition to the collections which have been received from Tunisia,
plankton samples have been sent to MMSC by the Stazione Zoologica
in Naples. Quantitative benthos and sediment samples also have been
received from a recent Yugoslavian-Tunisian survey of the Lake of
Tunis, a brackish, eutrophic lagoon.

The Institute for Sea Research at Portoroz, Yugoslavia, has sent
MMSC 174 plankton samples from the northern Adriatic Sea. Three
specimen groups (cladocerans, chaetognaths, and fish eggs and larvae)
were committed by the Institute for Sea Research. MMSC has been
asked to distribute the remaining groups to approved specialists.
This plankton collection has more than ordinary value because of the
detailed concurrent hydrographic data available.
Museum of Natural History

RIcHARD S. Cowan, Director

5 ee SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGIST, whether in a university or in a public
museum, daily faces the unpleasant fact that the cost of maintaining
his essential and ever-growing collections rises continually, that space
and staff seem to shrink vis-a-vis expanding research requirements, and
that other, more glamorous scientific programs compete fiercely and
all too successfully for the never adequate funds available. Small
wonder, then, that he has sensed an alarming trend toward the down-
grading of systematic studies in the United States.

Is a reversal of this trend possible? In our view, it is both possible
and, in view of the ecological problems man is creating for himself,
obviously and urgently necessary.

One recalls that in the last century natural history museums became
inevitable as the private collector’s “cabinet of curiosities” became
inadequate to exhibit, or to contain, even a small part of the diversity
of the world of nature. As private collections grew, their scope tended
to lessen and the selectivity to increase, until only the choicest specimens
could be retained. This condition, plus jealousies among private collec-
tors and, oftentimes, the inaccessibility to science of their specimens,
stimulated development of more generally available research collections
in university centers and in public museums and botanical gardens.
These institutions also became the repositories for biological vouchers
obtained during the early days of exploring this continent, when the aim
was simply to accumulate vast collections—often without critically
assessing the data associated with the specimens or the representation
thus obtained.

Growth of our National Collections is typical of this. Aware of the
need to amass a representation of the Nation’s wealth of natural

73
74 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

‘history and urged by the Smithsonian’s first Secretary, Joseph Henry,
the Federal Government included zoologists, botanists, geologists, and
anthropologists on early exploring expeditions. Agencies such as the
Geological Survey in the Department of the Interior, the old Biological
Survey and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Department of
Agriculture all contributed heavily to the National Collections. In the
areas represented by these agencies, the Smithsonian’s Natural History
Museum is by law the national repository.

Today, for the reasons earlier noted, collectors in all biological
disciplines throughout the country tend more and more to deposit in
the Museum their types and rare specimens. The resulting increase in
the Collections—they have nearly tripled in the last 20 years—has
placed on the Museum staff an increased responsibility for preserving
them. It is, perhaps, a prime reason for the restive concern among the
systematic science community that growing emphasis on research in
the Museum of Natural History may cause it to slight the curatorial
responsibilities entailed in custody of the National Collections, even
though the research is based upon these collections.

To such expressions of concern, answer can be given swiftly and
conclusively: over the past three years, the Museum staff has increased
by forty percent its production of published research, yet in the same
period the National Collections have on the whole become better
housed, better cataloged, better maintained, more accessible, and more
used than ever before.

Custody of the National Collections, it is true, poses a challenge
requiring constant innovation. As prime repository for documentation
of the Nation’s natural history, the Museum cannot limit the Collec-
tions in scope or in numbers of specimens. At the same time it must
heed the quality of the materials accepted, and carefully avoid com-
peting with other centers in any way that would deter the growth of
systematic biology in the United States.

With 51 million specimens already in the Collections, how can their
management improve and research output increase simultaneously? It
is true that for decades the Collections grew so rapidly that a timely
record of accessions often could not be kept by old-fashioned hand
entries in catalogs and day books, and that sizeable backlogs of un-
cataloged and unidentified material accrued. But with the advent of
data processing, the Museum has in the past few years painstakingly
and soundly developed improved techniques for cataloging specimens
and for processing and manipulating the data associated with them.

Today, cataloging is accomplished in less than half the time previously
needed, it is many times more accurate, and the system adopted has a
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY—INTRODUCTION 13

potential for further extensive savings. Data processing, moreover, after
several years of planning has reached the stage where we have under
way several pilot projects that involve collections of various groups of
organisms representing a variety of curatorial problems.

We have thus made a start toward the goal of freeing the staff biologist
from routine curatorial tasks, so that he can function more nearly as a
research scientist. And so that the specimens continue to be maintained
in the best possible condition, “curators” demonstrating an_all-
consuming interest in the care of specimens have been advanced to the
position of our first collections managers. Assisted by technicians and
aids, they make a full-time profession of collections care, thus relieving
the professional scientists for progressively greater research effort.

Sound scientific judgments concerning the growth and manage-
ment of the collections will always have to be provided by the profes-
sional staff, but routine curation is to an increasing extent being
handled by collection management teams. A program is being devel-
oped to seek out and train qualified persons having the natural bent for
collections management. It should in a few years assure a steady flow
of such trained personnel into the entire museum community.

What is the goal of the Museum of Natural History regarding its own
use of the National Collections? To increase the size of the research
staff obviously will not, indeed cannot, serve to keep pace with the
enormous growth of natural history collections that must continue if
man is to gain sufficient knowledge of his environment to manage it.
Perhaps no more than a twenty-five percent increase in the size of
professional staff should be expected: the fond but unrealistic dream of
past generations of museum curators—to have a specialist for every
group of organisms—is simply not achievable in any research center.
Instead, a limited cadre of inspired, productive systematic biologists can
and is being assembled. The work of this staff must, however, be com-
plemented by a vigorous program of research in systematic biology
throughout the country, and that program, in turn, must be strength-
ened by ready access to the National Collections.

Through expanding fellowship programs at the postgraduate and
predoctoral levels, this access to the Collections is already being ac-
corded for extended periods. Each scientific department in the Museum
has, or is developing, facilities for further such research cooperation. In
addition, loans of collections of all kinds have reached new peaks, and
development of new packing and shipping techniques will enable us to
match the increased number of loan requests expected in the future.

In short, the Museum of Natural History reaffirms its mandate to
care for and make available to all serious biologists the natural history
76 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

collections the Nation has entrusted to it, to continue to describe the
components of the world ecosystem and their interrelationships, and to
serve systematic biology generally.

Through joint educational programs, through long- and short-term
loans of collections, and through cooperative research projects, we
stand prepared to assist educational institutions in returning systematic
biology to its central, integrative position in every university curriculum
across the land.

The Summer Institute for Systematics was characterized by lively discussion
and differences of opinion.
Research and Publication

OFFICE OF SYSTEMATICS

The most important accomplishment during the year was the staging
of the first annual Summer Institute in Systematics, with the collabora-
tion of the Society of Systematic Zoology and the American Society of
Zoologists, and the support of the National Science Foundation and
the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Ellis Yochelson, U.S.
Geological Survey, and Robert Higgins, Wake Forest College, repre-
sented the two zoological societies. They planned and carried out the
program with R. S. Cowan, Head of the Office of Systematics.

From 200 applicants the 25 participants were selected on the basis
of the impact they would have on systematic biology on their return
to their home universities; all were active researchers and teachers of
zoological systematics. Each morning for three weeks the participants,
with many members of the staff of the Museum of Natural History
and from Federal science laboratories, gathered with an outstanding
speaker to consider one of the several facets comprising systematic
biology today. Afternoons were free for research in the national collec-
tions, but discussions generated during the morning often continued
into the afternoon and evening as well. A transcript of the speaker’s
remarks and the substantive parts of the discussions will be released
as soon as it can be prepared.

Planning for the Flora of North America project was materially
advanced with the support of the Office of Systematics. Progress on
this 15-year project is discussed on page 88.

A project to develop a manual for neotropical squamata (reported
under Vertebrate Zoology, p. 105), was initiated with support provided
by the office of systematics for bringing Dr. Donoso-Barros from Chile
to work with James Peters.

In addition to these major projects, the office of systematics provided
support and encouragement for field research, for the acquisition of
shared computer time, for the translation of scientific papers and the
preparation of scientific illustrations, and for equipment essential to
the development of several staff research projects.

77
78 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
OFFICE OF ANTHROPOLOGY

With the assistance of professor Sol Tax from the University of
Chicago, who serves as special advisor for anthropology, considerable
progress was made in developing new research projects in which the
staff participated jointly with many colleagues outside the Institution.

One of these projects, the new Handbook of North American Indians,
got under way with William C. Sturtevant serving as editor, assisted
by Samuel Stanley who joined the Office in September 1966 as project
coordinator. As a result of wide publicity by Sturtevant and Stanley,
more than one thousand potential authors of sections of the handbook
have responded. The 12,800 entries in the 1907-1910 Handbook of
American Indians North of Mexico have been analyzed and sorted accord-
ing to subject matter as a foundation for the effort to provide for this
standard work a replacement which will incorporate the results of the
last sixty years of research on the subject. The publication is expected
to occupy twelve or more volumes and is intended to be useful for
audiences from scholars and students to school teachers and librarians.
Geographically, the Handbook will cover Indians from northern Mexico
to the Arctic; topically, it will include physical anthropology, ethnology,
archeology, linguistics, and an assessment of the current condition of
North American Indian societies.

The long-standing commitment of the Smithsonian Institution to the
study of native American cultures was reaffirmed in an International
Conference on Changing Cultures in April 1966. In consequence, a new
urgent anthropology project of international scope has been inau-
gurated. Responses to the questionnaire distributed by the journal
Current Anthropology, requesting anthropologists to list anthropological
research known to be urgent and to name people to undertake it, have
been analyzed. The analysis of these data and those from other sources
will be published in a catalog of research projects on rapidly changing
cultures.

A Wenner-Gren Foundation grant for field work in rapidly changing
cultures provides assistance to many anthropologists over the world
who require small sums for urgent anthropological research. The aim
is to stimulate field research in these areas of urgency and to assist in
developing and strengthening professional anthropologists and anthro-
pological institutions in those countries where cultures are subject to
rapid modification.

The ancient technology project, co-directed by Clifford Evans and
Gus W. Van Beek, with the collaboration of the Battelle Memorial in-
stitute, has initiated a study of ancient metal objects using metallo-
graphic and spectrochemical techniques. Already laboratory tests of
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—-ANTHROPOLOGY 79

several hundred artifacts from Ecuador have been analyzed, revealing
important information concerning aboriginal methods of working
gold, copper, silver, and various alloys. As a part of this project,
research associate Theodore Wertime spent two months in Iran as
part of a team of archeologists and metallurgy historians studying
ancient metal-smelting sites.

With excess currencies and Smithsonian research funds, Hans
Wulff, University of New South Wales, Australia, is conducting a study
of ancient urban technology in Iran. In a joint expedition between
his university and the Smithsonian, Wulff conducted field work for
seven months, gathering data on the technology of pre-industrial crafts.
Among the outstanding discoveries concerning present-day Iranian
crafts is that of the method of making alkaline turquoise glaze, a sub-
stance known since the fourth millenium B.C. and still used by local
ceramicists for the manufacture of small ornamental objects. Details of
the process were recorded and sufficient raw materials were collected to
conduct a series of experiments on the chemical and physical nature
of the material.

Senior ethnologist, John C. Ewers, completed the editing of a cen-
tennial edition of George Catlin’s O-kee-pa, A Religious Ceremony, and
Other Customs of the Mandans, which will be published in fall 1967. He
also completed a manuscript on the development of artistic conscious-
ness of the American West in the 19th century, as his contribution to
a textbook entitled The Artist in America.

In preparation for completion of The Indians of Texas in 1830, Ewers
examined collections of Southern Plains Indian artifacts and records.
This volume involves the translation of a manuscript on the Indians
of Texas written by Jean Louis Berlandier, biologist for the 1828-
1830 Mexican border expedition. In the process of drawing together
this information, he is also evaluating the watercolors which were
prepared under Berlandier’s supervision to accompany his manuscript;
the book will also include descriptions of the ethnological specimens
collected by Berlandier.

Editorial work for the projected volume on physical anthropology
in The Handbook of Middle American Indians occupied T. Dale Stewart
during most of summer 1966. He also presented a paper and chaired
a program at the 37th International Congress of Americanists in
Argentina. After the Congress, on the invitation of the University of
Chile, he went to Santiago for a week to consult with the physical
anthropology faculty and to review their research programs.

In March, Stewart spent several days in Yucatan identifying and
studying the human skeletal remains uncovered by E. Wyllys Andrews
during his excavations in the Mayan site known as Dzibilchaltun. The
80 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

numerous examples of cranial deformity and tooth mutilation were of
particular interest.

Through communication with John R. Groome of Grenada, W.LI.,
Stewart obtained possession of the skeleton of a Negro with teeth
mutilated in a manner known to have been practiced earlier in
Cameroon, Africa. In a paper jointly authored by Stewart and Groome,
a case is made for this having been one of the original African slaves,
and, if so, this is only the second such example on record.

Senior archeologist Waldo R. Wedel resumed his investigations of
the so-called council circles of central Kansas. Long a puzzling feature
in Plains archeology, the council circles each consist of a little earthen
mound surrounded by a shallow ditch or a series of elongated depres-
sions placed end-to-end to form a circular or subcircular pattern 100

Museum by Richard K. Meyer.

RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—ANTHROPOLOGY 81

to 200 feet across. Each is associated with a village complex and no
village has more than one such circle; only five are on record, all
within 20 miles of each other. The sites with which they are associated
date from about A.D. 1500 to 1700, and are believed to represent a
period of Wichita Indian occupancy.

Of prime interest was the finding of human bones at every point
where the archeological trench intersected the circle. Most of the bones
were scattered randomly about the area and occurred essentially in the
same levels as the refuse, bison, and other animal bones. Almost without
exception, the bones were in poor condition, giving the impression of
having lain a long time on the surface before finally being cast into a
pit or trench along with other camp refuse. At or near the center of the
mound which forms the heart of the circle complex, a large fireplace
was uncovered. It seems possible that this was the site of a succession of
large, perhaps ceremonial, fires, rather than a slow accumulation of
ashes from household use over a long period of time. The position of the
hearth near the center of a circle complex suggests that large fires may
have been built as signals to other council circles in the area.

Henry B. Collins, senior scientist, retired from Government service on
December 30, 1966, and soon thereafter was appointed archeologist
emeritus. In this capacity he will maintain his office and continue his
research in Arctic anthropology.

Paul H. Voorhis joined the anthropology staff as a language specialist
in March. Already he has completed initial preparation of his doctoral
dissertation on Kickapoo grammar, he has begun preparation of other
texts for publication, and he has started to obtain a translation of
Kickapoo documents long on deposit in the anthropology archives.
These documents, previously incomprehensible to all but the Kickapoos,
are now yielding both linguistic and ethnological data.

Research on human ecological systems and prehistoric water systems
continued to occupy Richard B. Woodbury who is completing a report
on water-control systems in the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico. Woodbury
relinquished the chairmanship of the office of anthropology at the end
of January in order to devote greater time to research.

Museum specialist George E. Phebus, Jr., has discovered in the
ethnological collections of the Northwest Coast, many objects that help
explain other fragmentary artifacts found in that area. His own strati-
graphic excavations during past years in Oregon and Washington have
enabled him to identify and put in order the Museum’s vast archeologi-
cal collections from the Columbia River drainage. He is preparing
several scientific papers and larger monographs based upon his research.

Research associate C. G. Holland completed a monograph on the
archeology of Southwestern Virginia. This study was conducted under
82 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

auspices of the Museum of Natural History, under a National Science
Foundation grant, and he has turned over all the specimens to the
permanent collections of the Museum.

A program of archeological survey in Brazil under the direction of
Clifford Evans and research associate Betty J. Meggers began in 1965
with funds from a Smithsonian research award and with the official
collaboration of the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas of Brazil. During
summer 1966, they undertook a tour of inspection of the archeological
sites, checking field notes, film records, maps and data assembled
by each field project. In addition to developing a considerable body
of knowledge about Brazilian archeology, the program has served
as the stimulus for archeology in Brazil. A grant from the Wenner-
Gren Foundation provided opportunity for the Brazilian participants
to attend the 37th International Congress of Americanists in Argentina.
Following the Congress, Evans and Meggers formulated plans with
an Argentine archeologist for the development of a coordinated
archeological program similar to that which is so successful in Brazil.
Professor Ramiro Matos M., professor of anthropology at the Univer-
sidad Nacional de Centro del Peru, Huancayo, continued his training
under Evans and Meggers in modern archeological methods of analysis
and interpretation of artifacts, with the support of a fellowship from
the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. With Professor Matos
they have also developed plans for a long-range, coordinated, research-
training archeological program in Peru.

The 37th International Congress of Americanists awarded a gold
medal to Evans and Meggers for their outstanding contributions to
South American archeology. They were also recognized by the Govern-
mtent of Ecuador, which conferred upon them the National Order
“Al Merito,” for their work in that country.

Research associate Olga Linares de Sapir returned at the beginning
of this year from archeologic and ethnographic field work in
Southern Senegal, West Africa. Hers was the first stratigraphic arche-
ology ever attempted in the area and it is hoped that the large number
of charcoal samples collected will permit the development of an
absolute dating sequence and a chronology based on artifact types
and pottery. She also completed for publication a monograph on the
cultural chronology in the Gulf of Chiriqui, Panama.

The three-year project of interdisciplinary investigation into the
prehistoric cultural ecology of the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, continued
under the direction of Kent V. Flannery. In addition to the discoveries
reported last year concerning the geomorphology and ecology of the
valley in Early Formative times, it is now known that habitation of
the dry caves excavated by the expedition extends back to about
7800 B.C.
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—-ANTHROPOLOGY 83

The archeologically later Early Formative period in the Valley of
Oaxaca about 10 kilometers north of Monte Alban appears to be as
rich and complex as any found in Mesoamerica. Deeply buried levels
at one site yielded a series of packed-clay house floors with well-
preserved post-moulds and fragments of wattle-and-daub walls and
storage pits. A number of dry caves from the late phases of the Monte
Alban sequence yielded thousands of cultivated plant specimens, as
well as bits of nets, baskets, textile and sandal fragments, and fire drills.

Future plans include mapping of all edible species in selected vege-
tation areas, faunal studies, and more intensive study of the late pre-
ceramic and Early Formative phases of the valley.

‘The most complete dictionary compiled since the 16th century for
any American Indian language” describes the Tzotzil dictionary
compiled by Robert M. Laughlin. Entries total about 25,000, and
special attention has been given to the Tzotzil vocabulary pertaining
to the plants and animals. With the assistance of Alexander F. Skutch
for the native birds and Peter H. Raven and Dennis E. Breedlove of
Stanford University for plant identification, several thousand native
terms for organisms were recorded.

Compilation of a Bibliography of Anthropological Bibliographies of
Africa was completed during the year by Gordon D. Gibson, who also
served as acting chairman of the office of anthropology from February
to June. Although not exhaustive, this work attempts to provide the
broadest possible coverage, and is expected, therefore, to be useful to
all types of anthropological research on Africa.

In his continuing study of Micronesian ethnohistory, Saul H. Riesen-
berg, who in February became chairman of the Office of Anthropology,
studied ships logs, journals, and other ethnohistorical materials in
various marine depositories in New England. In February he joined
Thomas Gladwin of the National Institutes of Health and Samuel
Elbert of the University of Hawaii in a joint project at Puluwat in the
Caroline Islands to study Micronesian navigation and sailing. Here
the aboriginal methods of navigation are still practiced in voyages of
up to several hundred miles across the open sea. Riesenberg is investi-
gating the complex of ethnographic features—economic, social, and
political—which center upon or are affected by the frequent long
voyages of these people.

Eugene I. Knez revisited Korea to gather additional data for his
illustrated index of Korean material culture, preparation of which is
nearing completion. While there he also participated in the inter-
national conference to reestablish a Korean National Science Museum.

William H. Crocker returned to Brazil to initiate a two-month
comparative survey of the Apanyekra-Canela, closely related to the
Ramkokamekra-Canela which he has been studying since 1957.
84 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Hajar Bin Humeid, the title of a work nearing completion by Gus W.
Van Beek, presents a cultural cross section of a South Arabian farming
town and trading center during the first millennium B.C. and the early
centuries following. Of special interest is the pottery chronology, the
first long-range, stratigraphically based chronology for southern
Arabia.

Van Beek also visited Phoenician archeological sites in Tunisia and,
with the staff of the Tunisian National Institute of Archeology and the
Arts, developed plans for a long-range project to excavate ancient
Carthage, the capital of the western Phoenician empire from 814 to
146 B.C. While basically a conventional archeological excavation,
this project is expected to be interdisciplinary, in that it involves the
paleontological correlation of sea-level fluctuations, as revealed by
microfossils, and closely dated artifacts of man’s culture. This study
will also involve examination of subsistence patterns in a complex
historical site with special reference to man’s use of his environment.
It will also be cooperative in the sense that both American and Tu-
nisian archeologists will participate in all stages of the field work and
publication.

Some selective forces in human evolution are revealed for the first
time in J. Lawrence Angel’s study of the skeletal remains of an ancient
population near Lerna, Greece. Combining evidences of marked
contrasts in fecundity with evidence of greater fertility in family groups
whose skull bones showed high incidence of thalassemia, a disease
which protects against malaria, Angel concluded that thalassemia was
a selective factor in ancient Greece. His monograph on Lerna puts
great stress on the total ecological picture of the time and deals particu-
larly with changes in population density and demography and changes
in malaria which appears chronically to have affected the people of
that area.

Angel, with the collaboration of Donald J. Ortner and others, both
within and outside the Smithsonian, began a research program on
development and aging in human bone, including the biochemical and
micromorphological end results of aging processes. A laboratory for
these studies has been completed and work will begin in the next
fiscal year.

Lucille St. Hoyme, accompanied Jane Phillips of Howard University
on a two-week field trip to Jamaica. She continued work on her study
of changing concepts of fossil man during the last 200 years.

Katharine Luomala, professor of anthropology at the University of
Hawaii, worked most of the year as a research associate on manuscripts
concerned with Gilbert Islands culture and ecology. Gilbertese artifacts
in the museum were studied, photographed, and described, particularly
the shark-toothed weapons.

River Basin Surveys

In contrast with the recent past, only 50 percent of River Basin
Surveys field projects were concerned with archeological problems
within the Middle Missouri area of the Dakotas. This does not indicate
the abandonment of an area long of prime interest; rather, it reflects
the substantial completion of field investigations within the major
reservoirs of the Missouri River. Field investigations will continue, but
at a reduced level. Several areas not adequately sampled are endangered
by shoreline erosion or by recreational developments, but future
investigations here will be completed only as other projects become less
pressing.

A total of twelve field projects were undertaken during the field
season—seven in North Dakota, three in South Dakota, and one each
in Iowa and Wyoming:

1. The Durkin site, a small village of the Extended Middle Missouri
horizon, situated in the upper Big Bend Reservoir of central South
Dakota. The artifact inventory and house pattern are close parallels of
those from the Thomas Riggs site but with a significant increment of
rim sherds symptomatic of the Initial Coalescent horizon.

2. The Ketchen site, in the upper Big Bend Reservoir, proved to be
a close counterpart of the Durkin village and contained similar evidence
of ceramic influences deriving from the Coalescent tradition.

3. The Cattle Oiler site, immediately upstream from the Ketchen
site. The occupation attributable to the Initial Middle Missouri
horizon is closely related to the Anderson component of the Dodd site
in the Oahe Reservoir to the north. In addition, there is good evidence
of a Thomas Riggs component (perhaps no more than a peripheral
development of the Ketchen village) only a short distance to the south.

4. The South Cannonball site, an intensively occupied village in
the upper Oahe Reservoir, central North Dakota. The site is repre-
sentative of the Extended Middle Missouri horizon. A cursory examina-
tion of the ceramic collection suggests close ties with Mississippian de-
velopments in Minnesota, a matter of great significance in view of the
long-standing problems, vis-a-vis the origins of the Middle Missouri
tradition.

5. The Larson site in the Oahe Reservoir in northern South Dakota.
The site manifests a long sequence of occupations extending from late
prehistory to the period of Euro-American contact. Although the
village, at least in its late components, has been labeled as Arikara,
much more work will be required to clarify the cultural situation.

6. The Fort Manuel site, in the upper Oahe Reservoir, North
Dakota. This important post was operated during 1812-1813 by the Mis-
86 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

souri Fur Company for trade with the Arikara. The structures and
palisaded defenses were completely excavated and much of the sur-—
rounding area was cleared by means of earth-moving machinery. Both
European and aboriginal artifacts of the early 19th century were re-
covered but in relatively small numbers. Despite a diligent search,
no evidence was uncovered that would shed light on the remains of the
persons who died at the post during its brief use.

7. The Fisher site, in the Bowman-Haley Reservoir of north-
western South Dakota. The site contains five zones of occupation;
only the two lowermost (both of McKean affinities) produced dis-
tinctive cultural remains.

8. The Red Fox site, also in the Bowman-Haley Reservoir, held a
somewhat similar sequence of components. The lowermost is related to
the McKean complex; the uppermost representative of the Coalescent
tradition of the Middle Missouri area.

9. The Pipestem Reservoir, near Jamestown, North Dakota, was
surveyed but with negative results. While apparently devoid of arche-
ological features, it is possible that a few sites, masked by the heavy
vegetation of late summer, were missed by the reconnaissance party.

10. The lower Garrison Diversion Project of eastern North Dakota.
The area was examined late in the season, thus adding more arche-
ological sites to the growing number already recorded in the area.

11. The Saylorville Reservoir, along the Des Moines River in
north-central Iowa was surveyed as a prelude to large-scale excavation.
Of the 66 archeological sites recorded by the survey party, only 16
were considered to warrant excavation.

12. The Mummy Cave site, near Cody, Wyoming, was excavated
as a joint project of the National Geographic Society — Whitney Gallery
of Western Art — Smithsonian Institution. The deposits within the site
contained some 38 occupational levels extending from before 7000 B.C.
to the ethnographic period. The extensive collection of perishable
objects from the dated McKean levels are deemed to be of particular
importance.

In June of 1967, six additional projects were begun or continued by
River Basin Surveys. field parties;

1. Continued investigation at the South Cannonball site to exploit
areas of the village partially cleared by machinery during 1966.

2. Continued work at the Larson site in the hope of adding to the
fragmentary cultural sequence presently known.

3. Excavation in portions of the Medicine Creek site in the Big
Bend Reservoir now threatened by recreational developments.

4. Excavation at sites threatened with immediate destruction by
construction activity within the Garrison Diversion Project.
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—BOTANY 87

5. An archeological reconnaissance of the Cottonwood Springs
Reservoir, just west of the community of Hot Springs, South Dakota.
With the beginning of the year, the River Basin Surveys initiated a
new series, Publications in Salvage Archeology, to report the results of
excavations completed under the broad aegis of the Inter-Agency
Archeological and Paleontological Salvage Program. The series is
edited by staff members of the River Basin Surveys and printed by
modern offset press in editions of 1,500 copies. As of the end of the
fiscal year, four numbers totaling about 500 pages have been printed
and distributed. It is anticipated that others will follow at the rate of
four issues per year.

BOTANY

The development of broad concepts in systematic botany may be
the culmination of a lifetime career in the study of one particular
aspect of plant life or in the investigation of one particular group of
plants. These concepts often result only after years of intense concen-
tration on the taxa involved, and an understanding of the whole is
something that follows only after a keen appreciation of the parts.

Research associate F. A. McClure has spent a lifetime studying the
bamboos, a most important group of plants which enter into the daily
lives of so many persons in the tropics. From his early days as a teacher
and plant collector in the Orient, through his work with the plant
explorers of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to his intensive
studies of the preserved bamboo specimens in the U.S. National
Herbarium and living plants in his personal garden, McClure has had
his eye upon a single goal—a complete understanding of these plants.

Since the appearance in 1887 of the last systematic revision of the
bamboos, the number of validly published genera has nearly trebled
and the number of species is now nearly eight times as great. A fresh
perspective on the generic patterns currently discernible within this
group of plants is now long overdue. His studies in progress have the
objectives of exploring these patterns, providing revised and uniform
descriptions of the tenable genera among the 60 or more which are
validly published, redefining their boundaries, proposing new genera
where necessary, providing plates to illustrate a typical species of each,
and setting up keys to facilitate generic identifications.

The service performed through the identification of plant specimens
is often integrally associated with the research of the professional staff.
Bryologist Harold Robinson has successfully combined the traditional
service function of providing identifications with his research into the
systematics of tropical mosses. Identification of over a thousand
88 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

bryophyte specimens collected by Robert M. King and José Cuatre-
casas in Colombia became the basis for a preliminary publication on
the bryophytes of that country. While it is far short of being a Colom-
bian bryophyte flora, it is the first major effort in over thirty years at
offering a means of identifying these plants from that part of the world.
Mosses collected by Julian Steyermark from Venezuela are expected
to provide a foundation for a similar moss flora of that country.

Since the days when it sponsored Asa Gray’s classical Synoptical
Flora of North America, the Smithsonian Institution has been active
in research and publication on the indigenous plants of North America,
and it will soon be involved in a new effort to survey the American
flora. When the American Society of Plant Taxonomists decided in
August 1966 to organize the ‘“‘Flora North America Project,’ the
Smithsonian was chosen as headquarters and Stanwyn G. Shetler was
named executive secretary. The editorial committee met at the Smith-
sonian in January and elected William L. Stern temporary chairman
of the steering committee. The principal accomplishment was the
preparation of a draft of the first grant proposal.

Flora North America is a 15-year cooperative effort of American
and Canadian taxonomists to produce a four-volume manual of the
native vascular plants of North America exclusive of Mexico. The
project is expected to result in the training of many new taxonomists,
and the resulting manual should benefit various economic research
activities, as well as biology in general. At its completion, knowledge
of the Boreal and Arctic floras of the world will be largely completed,
since the Flora U.S.S.R., covering the Soviet Union, and Flora
Europeae, covering all of Europe, are either complete or in preparation.

Research activities on plant anatomy were expanded with the arrival
of Edward S. Ayensu whose major interest is in the comparative
anatomy and phylogeny of angiosperms, especially the monocotyledons.
With senior botanist Lyman D. Smith, Ayensu is study'ng the com-
parative anatomy of the Velloziaceae, a plant family that is one of the
most interesting and geographically puzzling links between the floras
of tropical America and Africa. He will also continue his studies in the
Dioscoreales, the order of true yams.

Most of the time of José Cuatrecasas has been used in the completion
of a monograph of the Brunelliaceae, a tropical family of 50 species
distributed from southern Mexico to Peru, Bolivia, and the Caribbean
Islands. It will be published as a part of the international project
Flora Neotropica. Cuatrecasas also participated in a symposium on
geoecology of the mountainous regions of the tropical Americas, held
in Mexico City, and presented a paper on life forms in the paramos.
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—BOTANY 89

In addition to continuing his research on the floral anatomy and
evolutionary history of the dogwood family, Richard H. Eyde studied
the floral anatomy of the Brunelliaceae for Cuatrecasas’ monograph.
His studies indicate that there is validity in the viewpoint of taxonomists
who see an evolutionary link between this family, the Cunoniaceae,
and the Rosaceae.

An extensive paper by Conrad V. Morton on the subgenera and
sections of the filmy fern family will serve to counterbalance and correct
a radical and incomplete study on this family published about 30 years
ago which, for want of a more suitable treatment, has been widely and
uncritically adopted. He has also completed studies of other fern groups
and of the Peruvian species of a genus of the African violet family.

Subsequent to his three-month visit to study types and other historical
collections in Western European herbaria and botanical gardens,
Lyman B. Smith continued to refine his monographic study of the
pineapple family, began a cooperative research project with Ayensu,
completed a revision of the bamboos of Santa Catarina, Brazil, super-
vised the preparation of two doctoral dissertations, and supervised the
research of a former Smithsonian pre-doctoral student on the pineapple
family in Ecuador. In January he was voted honorary citizenship by the
City Council of Itajaf, Brazil, for his valuable contributions to the
knowledge of the flora of Santa Catarina.

William L. Stern, who resigned as chairman of the department at the
end of the fiscal year, concluded his research on the comparative
anatomy of the vegetative structures of Columelliaceae, which resulted
in a more natural taxonomic placement of this curious plant family.
Detailed anatomical studies of the leaf node and xylem indicated clearly
that this family is far more primitive than was supposed, and belongs in
the Englerian concept of the Saxifragaceae. This family is usually
treated by modern taxonomists as several families and Stern began
studies of this complex to determine proper familial boundaries employ-
ing the techniques of comparative anatomy.

Excellence in research in systematic botany is associated very closely
with the availability of adequate library resources. Until recent years
the botany department library has been grossly neglected because of
the sparsity of its holdings, the lack of a card catalog, absence of an
organized program of accession, and scattered deposits through the
offices of the department. With the guidance of several members of the
department, Ruth F. Schallert, a professional librarian, with the
dedicated assistance of research associate William A. Archer, has
already made remarkable strides in providing Smithsonian botanists
with the quality library they require. Although still incomplete, the
various parts have been collected, and cataloging is well under way.
90 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Archer is putting in order and cataloging several hundred collectors?’
field notebooks, some dating from the beginning of the century, con-
taining many important historical and geographical references, as well
as plant observations.

ENTOMOLOGY

This has been a particularly significant year in terms of accomplish-
ments for the department of entomology, including substantial field
explorations, acquisition of important collections, improvement of
curation of the collections, exhibits planning, educational activities,
and the most productive research year since the founding of the
Department.

The progress of current research and curatorial programs, as well as
future goals and the resources to obtain them, were reviewed with an
advisory committee of outstanding entomologists. An excellent report
which has already had significant impact on future planning was
signed by: E. Gorton Linsley, chairman (University of California,
Berkeley), William L. Brown, Jr. (Cornell University), Kenneth W.
Cooper (Dartmouth Medical School), and P. J. Darlington (Harvard
University).

Richard C. Froeschner completed a paper on the Galapagos species
of lacebugs and made substantial progress on an illustrated manual of
the world genera by evaluating morphological characters of 1,800
species in 270 genera. His studies of certain hemipterous families from
Dominica indicates that the Dominican fauna has its principal generic
affinities with Tropical America but that there is considerable isolation
at the species level.

Karl V. Krombein, chairman, devoted most of his research time to
getting into print two large publications, one a second supplement of
the catalog of Hymenoptera of America North of Mexico, and the
second, a large volume on the life histories, nests and associates of
the trap-nesting wasps and bees. The latter work is already being
hailed as a modern classic of insect natural history.

Gerald I. Stage joined the entomology staff in November as a
specialist on the systematics and behavior of wild bees. A monograph
of one genus, emphasizing relationships between a phenetic and
phyletic classification and biological data, was nearly complete and
the study of the bees of Dominica was begun.

J. F. Gates Clarke assembled the plates and completed the manuscript
for volume 6 of his monumental study on the Meyrick types of
Microlepidoptera.

Donald R. Davis nearly completed his revision of New World
Carposinidae and he expanded his earlier project on New World
Incurvariinae to include a general world survey at the generic level,
in an attempt to understand more clearly the entire composition of
this group of primitive lepidoptera.

Field investigations in Colombia and Venezuela occupied much of
the year for W. Donald Duckworth in his long-term study of neo-
tropical Stenomidae. He also completed and published several papers
during the year on genera of this family.

The South East Asia Mosquito Project (SEAMP), a cooperative -
venture between the Smithsonian and the Department of the Army, —
continued its investigations of the mosquitoes of this strategically
important area. Various members of the Project staff made trips to
collect materials and to study specimens in other museums. In addition
to publishing individual research papers, SEAMP issued a revision of
its extremely useful ‘‘Preliminary Keys to the Mosquitoes of Vietnam.”

Oliver S. Flint, Jr., completed and published several papers during
the year on the systematics of the larvae and adults of the New World
caddis flies. An extensive field trip to Mexico and Central America
provided much valuable new material for his studies of this family.

Close collaboration between the Smithsonian Institution and the
University of Maryland School of Medicine has continued, with
research associate Robert Traub and a group of scientists studying |
ectoparasites collected in overseas programs on viral and rickettsial
infections. Collections during the year were made in West Pakistan,
Nepal, New Guinea, and Mexico. Taxonomic and ecological research
on fleas and mites laid the basis for selecting areas for intensive micro-
biological investigations.
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 93

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

The reborn emphasis on research as a primary activity of the Museum
and the stimulus provided by the Offices of Systematics and of Oceanog-
raphy and Limnology are reflected in the diverse research programs of
this department and of the numbers and kinds of publications issued
by it during the year. Monographic studies and revisions continue to be
a major interest, although a large portion of the departmental research
program is concerned with more generalized investigations of the
systematics and zoogeography of invertebrates.

Under the impetus of the Antarctic Research Program, sponsored by
the National Science Foundation, investigations of antarctic inverte-
brates continued to be a focal point for many research activities. David
L. Pawson continued his work on antarctic holothurians and echinoids,
and completed charts of the distribution of the species of these groups,
accompanied by an analysis of distribution patterns in relation to
physical environmental factors.

J. L. Barnard continued studies of antarctic amphipods and com-
pleted a review of one genus. Mary Rice initiated studies of the
sipunculid and echiurid worms collected in the Antarctic by the
Eltanin expedition. Clyde F. E. Roper joined the staff in September and
continued his studies of the systematics, biology, and distribution of the
squids. His studies of Bathyteuthis abyssicola, the dominant squid in the
Antarctic, included conclusions on the effect of water depth, oxygen
content, and other oceanographic parameters on distribution and
morphology of this animal.

Studies of tropical organisms have attracted the attention of most
members of the staff, many of whom conducted field expeditions to
acquire new specimens and to observe the environmental conditions
under which they have developed: Raymond B. Manning collaborated
in West Pakistan on a study of the stomatopod crustaceans of West
Pakistan, Mary Rice studied the biology and development of sipunculid
worms in Puerto Rico, and Klaus Ruetzler studied sponges in the
mangrove association in Puerto Rico and Bermuda.

As a result of the study of collections of sharks in the Indian Ocean
and eastern South Pacific, Roger F. Cressey has been able to show that
a correlation exists between adult parasite copepod size and surface
temperature at the collection station. This relationship has been
demonstrated in free-living crustaceans but never before among
parasitic forms. He also continued his study of the phylogeny of
parasitic copepods on elasmobranch and scombroid fishes.

J. L. Barnard spent most of the year as a Smithsonian Fellow in
invertebrate zoology at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu.
94 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

His studies of certain Hawaiian amphipods has shown a significant
affinity between them and the warm-temperate North American
fauna, a unique condition among marine invertebrates. He believes
that this may reflect the abilities of amphipods to drift long distances
on flotsam, as well as the relative isolation of Hawaii in relation to
other shallow-water areas of the tropical Pacific.

Studies on the biology of planktonic organisms have been continued
by Thomas E. Bowman, who focused his attention on the pelagic
decapod crustaceans, and completed a review of the distribution of
Lucifer in the western North Atlantic. He also published the first report
of self-luminescence in a pelagic gammaridean amphipod.

The aim of Mary Rice’s investigations of the development, systematics
and zoogeography of Caribbean sipunculids, carried out in close
cooperation with scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti-
tution, is to ascertain the life history of members of several representative
genera. Nothing is presently known of the developmental history of
tropical forms.

The studies on North American crayfishes and their ostracod sym-
bionts by Horton H. Hobbs, Jr., included the preparation of a re-
vision of the genus Procambarus which ranges from Canada to Gua-
temala and Cuba. He has also completed a monograph of the Mexican
and Cuban entocytherids. In collaboration with Perry C. Holt, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, and Margaret Walton, Mountain Lake Biological
Station, Hobbs completed a study of the crayfishes and their epizootic
associates from the Mountain Lake area. In addition to taxonomic
accounts of these species, the authors included a discussion of the
habitats of the species, population sizes and fluctuations, food habits,
information on origin and distribution in the area, and a summary of
data on elevations and drainage systems.

The freshwater and terrestrial decapod crustaceans of the West
Indies, with special reference to Dominica, have been the subject of a
collaborative study by Fenner A. Chace, Jr., and Horton H. Hobbs,
Jr. Materials were collected by Hobbs in Dominica under the auspices
of the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of Dominica.
The study promises to be the most comprehensive ever made on the
non-marine West Indian decapods.

Studies on ostracods from Hadley Harbor, Massachusetts, by Louis S.
Kornicker led to the discovery of a high incidence of parasitism of one
of the ostracods. Kornicker and Thomas E. Bowman have collaborated
on a study of the host and parasite, both undescribed species. The
incidence of parasitism is very high, with about one in 15 of the adult
ostracods infested. The copepods have developed a_host-deceiving
egg-mimicry, and deposit their eggs in sacs, each with several eggs,

and of a size similar to that of the ostracod eggs, in the ostracod brood
chamber.

Using serial sections across the hinge area of representative species of
several genera of myodocopid ostracods, Louis S. Kornicker traced
the origin of the ligament, as well as the relationship of the ligament
to the hinge and the shell. Knowledge of the placement of the ligament
in living ostracods may help those working with fossil species to de-
termine the ligament line, particularly in those forms lacking Recent
species.

Histological examination of the circulatory system of the polychaetous
annelid Magelona, conducted by Meredith L. Jones, confirmed field
observations that there is a heart-like pumping action intrinsic in the
dorsal blood vessel. In addition, earlier observations of unusual seg-
mentally arranged capillary beds were confirmed and a separate series
of segmentally arranged valves in the posterior dorsal vessel was found.

MINERAL SCIENCES

The most significant department-wide event during the year was a
two-day meeting with an advisory committee of eminent specialists
‘in earth sciences—Felix Chayes, chairman (Geophysical Laboratory,
Carnegie Institution of Washington), Clifford Frondel (Harvard
University), Hans Suess (University of California, San Diego), and
William Thurston (U.S. Geological Survey). The truly excellent report
of this committee identified goals for the department and the resources
required to attain them, as well as evaluating present research and
service activities.

Research in meteorites was concentrated on the chemical and minera-
logical composition of stony meteorites; detailed studies, based on a
careful review of the Museum’s collection, were carried out on the most
significant specimens. This broad program, involving some 30 indi-
vidual projects, is being carried forward jointly with other institutions
and universities both in this country and abroad with the support of
grants and contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration, U.S. Air Force, National Science Foundation, National
Geographic Society, and the Smithsonian Research Foundation.

Several iron meteorites from Campos del Cielo, Argentina, particu-
larly “‘El Taco” which contains large silicate inclusions, are also being
studied in collaboration with scientists from the Max-Planck-Institut
in Germany, the Lamont Geological Observatory, the California
Institute of Technology, the Ames Research Center, and the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
This meteorite slice, one of the lorgest ever pre-
pored, wos cut from a 4400-pound iron meteorite
recovered in 1963. Several other meteorites and small
craters have been found in the some area.

The dark inclusions are silicates, with varying
mounts of graphite, iron sulfide, and nickel-iron, The
nickel content of the metal is 6.7 percent, os in coarse

_ ectohedrites.

The association of nickeliron with the silicate min-
erals that ore common in stony meteorites may indicote
that iron ond stony meteorites are interrelated ond thot
the types were not completely seporated in the mete-
orites’ porent bodies.

at the Max Planck Institut, Mainz, Germany.

In the new hall of meteorites is featured a slice from the two-ton El Taco,
Campo del Cielo, Argentina, meteorite. This specimen is playing a leading
role in a cooperative international research program involving a number of
centers of meteorite research.

An investigation and review of meteoritic pyroxene was completed
under Brian Mason, who also reviewed the pyroxene-plagioclase
chondrites. A new chondrite, ““Rupota,” from Tanzania was studied
in detail especially by Kurt Fredriksson in cooperation with R. O.
Pepin from the University of Minnesota. It was found that this meteor-
ite is a rather typical olivine-hypersthene (L-group) chondrite, and it
is the first of this group which has been shown to contain primoridal
rare gases. This finding contradicts a recent hypothesis that these
meteorites may have come from Mars while the olivine-bronzite
chondrites (H-group) should have originated on the moon. These
projects benefited materially from the excellent chemical analyses
made by Eugene Jarosewich, who also analyzed several mineral
separates, iron meteorites, and terrestrial rocks.

Robert F. Fudali joined the staff at the beginning of the year and has
begun studies of phase equilibria in meteorites at relatively high
temperatures and under controlled oxygen fugacity, as well as diffusion
studies in olivine and in iron meteorites. Rather extensive studies on
recrystallization of chondrites at temperatures in the range of 700°
C. to 1000° C. are also in progress in cooperation with Dr. A. Reid,
University of California.
98 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Research in petrology during the past year continued to focus on
rocks from the mid-Atlantic Ridge and their use in tracing the develop-
ment of the oceanic crust. These, and other studies, show that the crust
may be viewed as a dynamic product of processes occurring in the
upper mantle. Partial fusion of mantle material evidently has produced
and is’ producing vast quantities of basaltic magma, particularly
beneath the mid-Atlantic Ridge. Eruption and piling up of this material
and emplacement of possibly large basaltic intrusions, some of which
cool sufficiently slowly to become gravity-differentiated, is probably the
dominant manner in which the oceanic crust has formed, particularly
in the undisrupted north-south trending zones of the mid-Atlantic
Ridge, studied by William G. Melson and T. H. Van Andel at latitude
222 N.

At various places the normally undisrupted, north-south trending
mid-Atlantic Ridge is displaced hundreds of kilometers along so-called
“fracture” zones and in these, intrusion of partially serpentinized
peridotite is evidently the major crust-forming process. These intrusions,
based on evidence from studies of samples from St. Peter and St. Paul’s
Rocks by Melson and his colleagues at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, have had a remarkable origin. Evidently, when partial
fusion begins in the sub-oceanic upper mantle, the magma normally is
separated from a refractory, olivine-rich crystalline residua and moves
upward, giving rise to formation of oceanic crust by volcanic eruption
and intrusion, and leaving behind in the mantle a dense, olivine-rich
residua. Beneath the fracture zones, however, the magma and solid
residua evidently become mobilized together as a plastic, low-density,
solid-plus-fluid mass which is rapidly displaced upward and eventually
is emplaced in the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle.

Studies of rocks from island and submarine outcroppings of the mid-
Atlantic Ridge strongly suggest that the oceanic crust will not provide
“primitive”? mantle rocks, that is, mantle-derived rocks which are not
the products of partial fusion or of some other sort of chemical dif-
ferentiation. While oceanic rocks, particularly those from St. Paul’s
Rocks, may not provide examples of ‘“‘primitive” mantle rocks, they
may provide important clues about the details of magma generation in
the mantle, and studies are in the planning stage to focus on this
particular aspect.

During the past few years the theory of sea-floor spreading and
continental drift has received strong support from oceanic geophysical
evidence, especially from magnetic surveys across the midocean ridges.
This theory, long accepted by Southern Hemisphere geologists, is
becoming widely accepted in the Northern Hemisphere for the first
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—-PALEOBIOLOGY 99

time. Samples collected by Melson and his colleagues at St. Paul’s
Rocks indicate that this is an exposure of an extremely young intrusion.
Since sea-floor spreading entails constant formation of new oceanic
crust along the mid-Atlantic Ridge—the zone in which rifting and
spreading should occur—the young age of these rocks, which are on the
mid-Atlantic Ridge, is clearly consistent with the theory of sea-floor
spreading and continental drift.

A new manganese iron phosphate mineral, switzerite, was described
by John S. White and Peter B. Leavens from the Foote Mineral Com-
pany Mine, Kings Mountain, North Carolina.

PALEOBIOLOGY

In February, G. Arthur Cooper resigned as chairman of this depart-
ment and was appointed senior paleobiologist in order to devote more
of his time to his study on the Permian brachiopods of the Glass
Mountains in Texas. The manuscript for this joint study with R. E.
Grant is nearly completed and most of the diagrams have been made.
During March and April, Cooper and Grant extended their field
observations of the Permian from the Glass Mountains westward to the
Del Norte Mountains and determined that an extension of some of the
Glass Mountain formations reach into this area.

Research on the morphology, anatomy and taxonomy of early
Devonian land plants was continued by Francis M. Hueber. Research
progress was reported in a paper on the genus Psilophyton and a second
paper is in press. In addition, Hueber conducted field work in eastern
Canada, northern Maine, and Australia during the year.

The monographic study of the crustose coralline algae of the North
Atlantic took Walter H. Adey to the coasts of Iceland and Norway,
where he made extensive collections of living corallines for anatomical
study and, at the same time, he conducted ecological studies of these
poorly known organisms. By the end of the year, he had extended his
shipboard research program as far south along the European coast as
Great Britain.

C. Lewis Gazin, who served as departmental chairman from February
to July, completed a historical review and a statistical analysis of the
Eocene species of the condylarthran mammal Hyopsodus from the view-
point of their morphology, systematics, and paleoecology.

Exceptional three-dimensional preservation of several fossil fish speci-
mens from the Lower Cretaceous of Texas enabled David H. Dunkle
to describe the cranial osteology that is so useful in systematic compari-
son of Late Mesozoic orders of families of teleostean fishes. He also

continued his compilation of data on the stratigraphic distribution and
correlation of the fish fauna of the Upper Devonian Ohio shales.

A paper on functional morphology of the jaw in Emydops and Lystro-
saurus has been completed for publication by Nicholas Hotton III with
A. W. Crompton of the Peabody Museum at Yale University. Assisted
by his wife Ruth O. Hotton, he is studying the petrology of the Beaufort
sediments of South Africa from the viewpoint of heavy minerals, with
the objective of working out the metamorphic history of the beds.

Clayton E. Ray’s research on Quaternary mammals, primarily
those of the eastern United States, the Antilles, and the Galapagos
Islands, resulted in the completion of a review of the fossil mammals
from Saltville, Virginia, with D. M. Cooper and W. S. Benninghoff.
Another manuscript surveying the mammalian fauna of the Pleistocene
from Ladds, Georgia, was completed in collaboration with paleontolo-
gists at Shorter College at Rome, Georgia.

Research associate Remington Kellogg completed manuscripts on two
new Calvert Miocene whalebone whales, and assembled supplementary
data on a small, previously described Calvert cetothere. He also
prepared a review of the types of Miocene Maryland and Virginia
whalebone whales described by E. D. Cope.

After having served several months as supervisor for the division of
invertebrate paleontology, Porter M. Kier was appointed chairman of
the department, effective July 1, 1967. He has continued his studies of
fossil and living echinoids, and completed a monograph of the fossil
echinoid order Oligopygoida. He undertook research on the evolution
of the Jaw apparatus on both fossil and Recent echinoids, and com-
pleted a preliminary study of the morphology of this apparatus in four
orders. He has also studied sexual dimorphism in fossil echinoids. In
April, for his paper on ‘‘Evolutionary Trends in Paleozoic Echinoids,”’
Kier received the Best Paper Award for 1966 from the Society of
Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists.

By using morphological comparisons of scar patterns in the valves of
Pleistocene ostracodes of Oklahoma, and Kansas and Nebraska,
Richard H. Benson has been able to identify species which are signifi-
cant to the geological search for ground-water deposits in these States.
These fossil remains of animals, which lived in vaileys and hollows in
the landscape just after glaciation and before the deposit of windblown
silts, help to identify these prehistoric depressions which now serve to
trap water; their presence is difficult to predict without knowledge of
ancient topography. In anticipation of deep-sea drilling and coring of
the sediment of abyssal regions of the ocean basins of the world, Benson
is studying ostracode faunas on a worldwide basis. These microfossils
can be used to date the ages of strata penetrated, and to indicate for
102 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

climatic and hydrologic interpretation the changes in bottom
conditions.

Martin A. Buzas completed a study on the population ecology of
Foraminifera in the Choptank River of eastern Maryland. Three
stations were sampled in replicate for 2 years to determine foraminiferal
densities, with six environmental variables being measured at the same
time; these data are now being analyzed by a multivariate technique.
Another study concerning the special distributions of Foraminifera has
just been completed and further investigations are under way to de-
termine population size and special pattern of these distributions.

A new member of the staff, Alan H. Cheetham, a specialist in post-
Paleozoic Bryozoa, has begun the quantitative sorting, preparation,
study, and photographing of fossil and Recent cheilostome Bryozoans
in a new laboratory established for this purpose. Quantitative and
numerical methods will be used in his study of the taxonomy, functional
morphology, paleoecology, and evolution of distributional patterns in
this group.

The systematics, functional morphology, and evolution of the late
Eocene to Recent genus Metrarabdotos have been studied by Cheetham,
using multivariate analysis and numerical techniques, as well as
anatomy and morphology, in order to interpret what appear to be
major climatic fluctuations during late Tertiary and Quaternary time.
This genus is at present restricted to the Tropics but ranged much
farther north in both the West and East Atlantic during earlier periods
of geologic history. Other similar genera are being studied as part of a
quantitative paleoecological analysis of moundlike structures of
earliest Tertiary age in southern Scandanavia.

As part of a monographic treatment of all Caribbean inoceramids,
Erle G. Kauffman, completed a study of the Jamaican representatives
of the bivalve Inoceramus. This study established a refined Cretaceous
faunal zonation for interisland correlation, as well as the first correla-
tion with zones on the North American continent. Another study, on
the paleoecology of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Cretaceous
Colorado group, was completed by Kauffman. Considerations of the

were involved in the study, along with the construction of a model
of sedimentation and formal recognition of the marine sedimentary
cycles shown by the rocks of the area.

Kenneth M. Towe completed a study of wall ultrastructure and
cementation in the arenaceous Foraminifera and, in cooperation with
Richard Cifelli, on the wall and problems of calcification in the cal-
careous Foraminifera. In addition, Towe and his associate, G. H.
Hamilton, are completing a paper on the ultrastructure of the macreous
layer in some bivalve mollusks.

As part of a cooperative project between the Smithsonian Institution,
the National Oceanographic Committee of Argentina, and the George
Washington University, J. W. Pierce, in a cruise on board the Environ-
mental Science Services Administration vessel Oceanographer, obtained
65 samples of sediments from the estuary of the Rio de la Plata. These
samples have been analyzed for clay content and trace elements in an
attempt to define the source of the bottom sediments of the estuary.

Sediment dispersal patterns in submarine canyons are in the re-
search interests of Daniel J. Stanley, who mapped ancient canyon de-
posits in the French Maritime Alps and examined bottom profiles in
cores collected in the Gully, the major modern canyon off Nova Scotia.
Interpretation of morphology and sediment distribution of the coast in
the continental shelf off Nova Scotia continues, and the effects of sea-
level changes were examined in the vicinity of Sable Island on the
Bermuda platform. Studies were completed on the color of sediments
on the continental margin off the United States, and of large calcareous
and phosphorite concretions of Miocene age on Georges Bank.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Emphasis has been given in the department of vertebrate zoology
to studies dependent on computers and automatic data processing.
This has significance in the area of collection management, but its
most exciting applications have been in systematic and ecological
research. |

The systematics and zoogeography of two Indian Ocean stomiatoid
fishes was the subject of a study recently completed by Robert H.
Gibbs, Jr., with Barbara A. Hurwitz. He has also made considerable
progress on the systematics of the scombroid fishes and in this con-
nection he contributed to the development of plans for a worldwide
cooperative monograph on the family Scombridae with the Food and
Agriculture Organization Working Group on Tuna Taxonomy.

Ernest A. Lachner conducted extensive field observations over the
eastern half of the United States to collect specimens and observe
RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION—VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 105

breeding behavior of fishes of the genus Nocomis. With Martin L.
Wiley he completed a study of hybridization among several species.

In addition to studying beach-erosion control on the western shore
of Chesapeake Bay and conducting studies of the biology of sea nettles,
Leonard P. Schultz completed a revision of the serranid genus
Labrinus.

Considerable interest has developed with respect to studies dependent
on computer and automatic-data-processing facilities. James A. Peters
has been very active in the development of computer programs
directly applicable to systematic research in the department and in
the Museum. Through his efforts and the efforts of colleagues, three
teletypes have been installed in the Museum with direct connection
to a distant shared-time computer. Programs have been written which
permit rapid calculation of standard statistical values and Peters is
developing a computer key to the genera of snakes of Latin America.
About 75 percent of the genera have now been included in the key,
which requires less than four seconds to derive a generic name in
response to a series of basic data supplied to the computer. It is possible
that this kind of key will permit rapid sorting and preliminary identifi-
cation of collections by nonprofessional technicians. Peters has also
prepared a set of computer programs for one of the standard textbooks
of biological statistics, making it possible for anyone to utilize any of
the statistical techniques in the book simply by calling up the appro-
priate program from the memory core of the central computer.

Another application of data-proces ing techniques is in the Pacific
Ocean Biological Survey Program under the direction of Philip S.
Humphrey. The data base on sea-bird observation now includes more
than 100,000 observations in the Pacific along with associated
oceanographic and meteorological data.

Stanley H. Weitzman completed papers on the osteology of the
deep-sea stomiatoid fish family Astronesthieae, and on the origin and
relationships of the oceanic fish suborder Stomiatoidei. These are
particularly valuable contributions in that they clarify the evolu-
tionary trends through which primitive teleosts gave rise to more
advanced forms in that group.

Using soft X-ray facilities to reveal skull structure in skins and
skeleton, Richard L. Zusi studied the classification and relationships
of finchlike birds. His work is expected to lead to a better under-
standing of the limits of the cardueline finches and the probable
relationship of the endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers to the carduelines.

During the summer of 1966, with the support of the Smithsonian
Foreign Currency Program and the Naval Medical Research Unit 3
in Cairo, Egypt, George E. Watson began his studies of the migration
106 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

of birds through northeastern Africa. Birds are obtained from Bedouins
near Alexandria and are banded and released or sent to the NAMRU-3
laboratories in Cairo for study. The United Arab Republic granted
permission to band birds in November and more than 5,000 birds
have now been marked with bands bearing code letters and a unique
number.

The Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program has now banded more
than 1,500,000 birds on islands in the Central Pacific and on the
Pribilofs in the Bering Sea in the study of the migration and movement
of birds in the Pacific Ocean.

Two field groups continued the work of the Smithsonian Venezuelan
project in eastern and southern Venezuela under the direction of
Charles O. Handley, Jr. They collected mammals, their extoparasites,
blood sera, and biological and ecological data. More than twenty
scientists (parasitologists, virologists, serologists, mammalogists, and
ecologists) from six countries are participating in the project which
has the cooperation and support of the Consejo de Bienestar Rural,
Museo de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Central de Venezuela, and
the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas in Caracas.
The project is supported by the Office of the Surgeon General, Depart-
ment of the Army, and the Middle America Research Unit.

108 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Through the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. William S. Cowles of
Shelburne, Vermont, who contributed their Helio Courier aircraft
and their time as pilots, it was possible for Handley to make an aerial
ecological survey of Venezuela. In sixteen days of flying, covering
about. 10,000 miles, he studied variations in vegetation and terrain
that might affect the distribution of mammals.

One of the most interesting and significant developments in the
department is the firm establishment of a cooperative program between
Brazilian biologists and counterparts in the Museum of Natural History.
This is the program of Area de Pesquisas Ecologicas do Guama (APEG),
which is administered by the Instituto de Pesquisas de Experimentagao
Agropecuarias do Norte and supported by subventions from the
Smithsonian and a grant from the Army Research Office. The first
annual report includes the information that the Mocambo and main
APEG reserves have been surveyed and subdivided into numbered and
staked quadrates, and basic studies of micrometeorology, soils, vege-
tation, social insects, vertebrates, and epidemiology have been carried
out. Cooperating with Philip S. Humphrey are a number of institutions
and individuals in Brazil. The most active people are Drs. Domiciano
Dias, Fernando Novaes, John P. Woodall, and Murga Pires.

Henry W. Setzer, in addition to his field program for the collection
of African mammals and their ectoparasites, continued the develop-
ment of the “Smithsonian Institution Preliminary Identification Man-
ual for African Mammals.” Sections were completed and distributed
on Rodentia: Sciuridae, Cetacea, Proboscidea, and Perissodactyla.
Additional manuscripts are in hand and will be issued shortly.

Dr. Roberto Donoso-Barros of the Universidad de Chile, Santiago,
has been working with James A. Peters in the preparation of a manual
of neo-tropical squamata. This project, as well as the African mammal
manual, is an approved Smithsonian project for the International
Biological Program.

The Collections
CARE AND CONSERVATION — GIFTS AND ADDITIONS

Anthropology

The processing laboratory, established in 1965 to catalog, accession,
and store archeological and ethnological collections, added to its tasks
the processing of physical anthropology materials. By streamlining
some of the operations, and by assigning museum specialists and
technicians to tasks heretofore performed by the curatorial staff, the
large backlog of uncataloged and unaccessioned collections is being
drastically reduced. The assignment of a full-time secretary familiar
with accessioning, loan, and other procedures has also increased the
efficiency of the Laboratory.

In reworking the China, Philippine, and Northwest Coast eth-
nological materials the collection data have been rechecked and the
specimens stored in a tribal and regional classification system. Special
storage racks for Asian musical instruments and Pacific Island weapons
were designed and constructed, and plans are under way for adding
special storage racks for spears and paddles.

The conservation and restoration laboratory processed almost 2,000
specimens during the year; the nearly 50 percent increase in volume
is Owing in part to special new conservation and restoration processes
being carried out on a wide variety of materials. Museum technician
Bethune M. Gibson experimented with various chemical reagents
to remove stains from Greek pottery, tested various dessication pre-
ventatives, and tried various kinds of waxes for the treatment of wood
surfaces to prevent atmospheric changes in temperature and humidity
which cause warping and cracking. One of the most important projects
completed by the laboratory was the cleaning and restoring of the
Museum’s very valuable Northwest Coast ethnological collections,
consisting of approximately 670 pieces, such as wood and bone carvings,
model boats, wooden masks and dishes, and totem poles.

The anthropology archives, under the management of Margaret
C. Blaker, continues to serve the needs of anthropology by answering
large numbers of inquiries and requests for photographs and reproduc-
tions of anthropological manuscripts. Construction had begun on
new quarters for the archives in the Museum of Natural History.

THE COLLECTIONS—BOTANY 1 i)

A gift of archeological materials from the Spiro Mound in Oklahoma
was made by Richard K. Meyer of Peoria, Illinois. Among the most
important items in this large private collection are some 100 engraved
conch shells, four human and two animal effigy pipes of stone, five
finely carved and remarkably preserved wood effigies, copper beads,
ear spools, and hair ornaments. The Spiro Mound contained numerous
burials accompanied by elaborate ritual objects reflecting the complex
religious systems which characterized the Southeastern United States
in late prehistoric times. The objects also reveal the skilled craftsman-
ship and economic wealth of the Oklahoma Indians.

Unusually rich documentation of a collection of 150 Moroccan ethno-
graphic specimens presented by Mrs. Elizabeth Bailey Wills of Bain-
bridge Island, Washington, made it especially valuable for research
purposes.

Lawrence H. Robbins donated an assortment of household equipment
from members of the Turkana tribe, who lived near the western shores
of Lake Rudolph in Northern Kenya. The collection is especially
valuable because of the rarity of such materials and it will be extremely
useful for comparative studies. Robbins also excavated some mesolithic
skeletons in the same area, and these have been sent by Richard Leakey
to the division of physical anthropology for repair and analysis.

Additions to the collections of physical anthropology include ten
careful portraits of presumed unmixed Carib Indians, a Peruvian skull
willed by Mrs. Clara Thompson; and two Caribbean skeletons of
considerable interest. Both of these are Negro slave skeletons with
tooth mutilation typical of that practied in Cameroon and South-
eastern Africa. One is on deposit from the Government of Grenada,
West Indies, and the other is from St. Croix, Virgin Islands, given by
Lieutenant Commander J. J. Wachtel.

Botany

The National Herbarium has historically concentrated on developing
collections from the New World, but there is also a recognized need
for representation of plants from the Old World. In the past year
several significant additions of specimens from Australia and Papua
were received through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization, Canberra, Australia, as well as Indonesian
plants from the Herbarium Bogoriense, a valuable collection of ferns
from remote parts of Thailand sent through Japan’s Kyoto University,
and several large collections of African grasses from the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew, England.

Additions to the New World collections included a large set of
critically selected United States and Mexican plants from Stanford

University, a set of specimens collected in the Brazilian planalto by
Howard S. Irwin of the New York Botanical Garden, and a large
collection of specimens from the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina made
by Padre Raulino Reitz, a collaborator with Lyman B. Smith on the
flora of that state.

Staff additions to the collections included specimens from the West
Indian island of Dominica made by William L. Stern and Dieter
Wasshausen, the Colombian wood collections made by José
Cuatrecasas, and Panamanian wood collections made by Stern and
Richard H. Eyde. Noteworthy cryptogamic collections continued to
arrive, including a large lot of algae received from Isabella Abbott
of Stanford University, moss specimens from the Rijksmuseum in
Leyden, and a collection of lichens’ from the western and southern
United States, from Mason Hale.

Specialists on the grass family will be pleased to find the grass
herbarium rearranged with the genera in alphabetical sequence.
Previously they had been arranged by tribes and “phylogenetically”
within the tribes. In addition, several thousand sheets which have been
in storage will shortly become available to researchers.

Through Dr. Chester Benjamin, 122 used metal herbarium cases were
transferred to the herbarium from the national fungus collections at
Beltsville, Maryland. The new storage space permitted the expansion
of a large block of flowering plant families so that they are more easily
used without risk of breakage.

The collections were used by a large number of visiting scientists
from the United States as well as from elsewhere in the world. Inter-
national visitors included Syo Kurokawa, National Science Museum,
Tokyo, who studied lichen collections for seven months; Brother
Alain Liogier, Manhattan College, who studied herbarium specimens
in preparation for his fieldwork on the Island of Hispaniola; Armando
Dugand, Barranquilla, Colombia, who completed his term as a Guggen-
heim Fellow working on the Catalpa family and on the flora of semiarid
northern Colombia; and Julian Gonzales Patifio (Brother Daniel),
Rector of the Colegio de San José, Medellin, Colombia, who continued
his investigations of the medicinal plants of Colombia and the flora
of the Departmento de Antioquia.

Entomology

The addition to the staff of two museum technicians, Marc Roth
and Ronald Faycik, permitted a small reduction in the enormous
backlog of insect specimens awaiting processing. Gloria House sorted
to family more than 270,000 specimens of Coleoptera from Bolivia.
114 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

The addition of Glenn Taylor as a preparator of Hemiptera and of
Gerald I. Stage as a specialist on Hymenoptera resulted in substantially
reducing the large accumulation of unmounted, unlabeled, and un-
sorted specimens of these orders, as well as their rearrangement for
use by the staff and by visiting researchers.

W. H. Rowe prepared, labeled, and sorted for distribution more
than 36,000 specimens of Lepidoptera, sorted to family 190 museum
drawers of butterflies, and assisted in arranging over 600 species of
arctiid moths for photographing. William D. Field completed about
75 percent of the task of reclassifying and rearranging the collections
of Indo-Australian Papilionidae.

Mrs. Sophie G. Lutterlough, with Ralph Crabill, restored, relabeled,
and rehoused great numbers of dried specimens of Myriapoda, in-
cluding many unsuspected type specimens.

Preparator Nancy Heath transferred the collection of papered Neo-
tropical Odonata to new transparent plastic envelopes; previously
these had been stored in any convenient container, resulting in a
collection almost impossible to arrange or to use. In addition, she
mounted and labelled more than 25,000 specimens, sorted and dis-
tributed over 150,000, and carried forward reference work toward a
catalog of Neotropical Trichoptera.

Under a grant from the National Science Foundation, Mrs. Phyllis
Spangler pinned, dissected genitalia, labeled, and sorted to genus
10,500 aquatic beetles and recorded data from 9,000 identified speci-
mens of the genus Tropisternus; she also completed cataloging one
family and made considerable progress on cataloging three others,
as well as rearranging the entire collection of aquatic beetles.

The entomological collections continued to grow through gifts
from generous donors, through field collections by staff members,
by purchase, and by exchange of critical specimens with corresponding
scientists and other museums.

Almost 40,000 Neotropical beetles were accessioned, of which more
than half were obtained by purchase. Among the notable donations or
exchanges were some 7,500 collected by O. S. Flint, Jr., in Mexico
and Central America; over 4,000 Brazilian beetles from M. Alvarenga;
more than 500 aquatic beetles from the British Museum (Natural
History), including critically important type material; and 23 paratypes
from R. Mouchamps, Belgium. J. F. G. Clarke contributed more than
3,000 specimens from Ceylon and Sarawak; P. J. Spangler, nearly
9,000 from the United States; D. Owens, nearly 6,000 from Mississippi;
A. Blanchard, 4,400 from Texas; and L. O. Warren, over 1,000 from
Arkansas.
THE COLLECTIONS—INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 15

A very generous gift of more than 88,000 Irish Hymenoptera,
donated by A. W. Stelfox of Newcastle, County Down, is the first
important acquisition of this group from the British Isles. Its value is
greatly enhanced by the inclusion of holotypes of species described
by Stelfox and of topotypic material from areas in which Haliday
described numerous new species and genera.

G. E. Ball enriched the collections of Myriapoda and Arachnida
by donating more than 1,300 specimens of Mexican chilopods; through
his efforts over a number of years, the national collections now have
the finest extant collection of Mexican centipedes. O. S. Flint, Jr.,
working in the Antarctic, collected some 22,000 mites and 109,000
Collembola and Mallophaga.

As in previous years, Museum entomologists and U.S. Department
of Agriculture colleagues were active in the Bredin-Archbold-Smith-
sonian Biological Survey of Dominica in the West Indies. Through the
efforts of O. S. Flint, Jr., A. B. Gurney, and R. J. Gagne, more than
22,000 specimens from that Island were added to the collections.

The Department of Agriculture transferred 59,056 specimens of
insects and their allies to the Smithsonian, of which a number were
of more than ordinary interest or value. They represented the choicest
materials submitted to USDA and Museum specialists for identifica-
tion and many represented species not previously in the national
collections. Others were reared series consisting of immature and adult
stages.

The collections were also enriched by the addition of thousands of
mounted and labeled insects collected through Department of Agri-
culture contracts with several universities and individuals, and USDA
preparators sorted, mounted, and labeled many additional specimens.

In addition to the use of the collections by the research staff of the
Museum and the USDA, the collections were studied by nearly 400
visiting scientists from universities and other museums in the United
States and abroad.

Invertebrate Zoology

The diversity and extent of the Museum’s holdings of invertebrate
animals, other than insects, is reflected in the large number of investi-
gatois who visited the department of invertebrate zoology during the
past year. More than 170 visitors, including graduate students and
established researchers as well, from the United States and numerous
foreign countries utilized the collections. Crustaceans, echinoderms,
and mollusks were most attractive, because of their good systematic
and geographic representation.

planktonic organisms aboard the Woods Hole Research Vessel, Aélantis II.
More than a thousand color transparencies were made as reference materials
for the hall of ocean life.

Among the more significant additions to the crustacean collection
during the year was the gift of an extensive collection of North Ameri-
can freshwater amphipods accumulated over many years by Leslie
Hubricht of Meridian, Mississippi. Also significant were a series of
more than 34,000 ostracods from Texas, collected by L. S. Kornicker
of the Museum staff; approximately 70,000 specimens of brackish
water and marine mollusks from Louisiana, received from the estate
of the late Percy Viosca, Jr.; and a collection of almost 25,000 marine
mollusks from Polynesia, acquired as a result of Harald A. Rehder’s
field study there.

In curatorial work, largely handled by a capable supportive staff,
particular attention was paid to organizing the collections, reducing
the backlog of unidentified and uncataloged holdings, and cataloging
and filing, so that specimens and data were more readily available to
the staff and to visitors as well. The Smith-Corona-Marchant Type-
tronic machine, a partially automated typing system equipped with a
microtypewriter, as well as a standard one, proved to be very effective
in reducing cataloging time. With the machine, the specimen labels,
in microtype, and all necessary data cards can be filled out in one
operation. The machine, acquired last year, was put into full-time
operation this year with the addition of a cataloger.

THE COLLECTIONS—MINERAL SCIENCES 117

Mineral Sciences

Cataloging of the meteorites and minerals in the Carl Bosch collection
continued through the year. Of the 587 specimens representing 305
different meteorites, 24 were of particular importance to the collection
because they were not previously represented. Specimens of 80 to 90
other meteorites constituted important additions to the collection and
the remaining specimens added much needed depth. The addition of
28,000 specimens of minerals from this collection represents a 20 per-
cent increase in the total holdings of such materials; a large increment
like this will require two to three years to integrate into the national
collections. Already the Bosch collection has provided much valuable
research material.

Two important freshly fallen meteorites were obtained and made
available to researchers in several laboratories studying shortlived
radioisotopes. The Barwell, England, chondrite was obtained through
the cooperation of the British Museum (Natural History). The St.
Severin, France, amphoterite was obtained from Jacques Labeyrie,
of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, with the coopera-
tion of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. A specimen from the
largest individual meteorite known, the Hoba, Southwest Africa,
meteorite, was obtained through the cooperation of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. Other important specimens of meteorites
obtained were the Nakhom Pathom, Thailand, meteorite; the Essebi,
Congo, carbonaceous chondrite; and the Faucett, Missouri, and
Social Circle, Georgia, meteorites.

Among many important gifts by individual donors to the mineral and
gem collection were a 265-carat, complexly twinned group of diamond
crystals, by J. M. Wachtler; a set of 22 colored, irradiated diamonds,
by Theodore and Irwin Moed, Inc.; and a white jade teapot of the
Chien Lung period, by Mrs. Mildred Taber Keally.

Through exchange many fine specimens were added, such as the
largest and finest known crystal of kunzite, from a recent discovery in
Brazil; a large and beautiful group of smoky quartz crystals from
Goscheneralp, Switzerland; a specimen, with extraordinarily large
crystals, of uvarovite garnet from Outokumpu, Finland; and a 911-carat
aquamarine, and a 172-carat tourmaline, both from Brazil.

The collections were also enriched by the purchase of a very fine
group of morganite crystal from the White Queen Mine, San Diego
County, California; excellent specimens of apatite, wolfamite, and
arsenopyrite from Panesqueria, Portugal; a very fine 178-carat mor-
ganite from California; and an unusually good specimen of sphene
from a new occurrence at Capelinha, Brazil.
118 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Other important additions were an outstanding series of eclogites
from diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes, obtained as a result of George
Switzer’s trip to Africa last year; several described suites of rocks from
the U.S. Geological Survey; and additional samples of oceanographic
rocks, mainly from the mid-Atlantic Ridge.

A pilot program for automatic information retrieval was begun on
data attached to the rock collections, in order to answer the increasing
demands by outside researchers for information on described specimens.

Paleobiology

The task of getting the fossil plant collections into usable condition
continued with cleaning and sorting of specimens from the Tertiary
and Pennsylvanian, checking of type specimens of Tertiary plants
against the published literature and catalog data, and the reorganiza-
tion of the collections in systematic order.

Holotype specimens of the fossil fern Jtopsidema vancleaver and the
coniferous tree root Araucariorhiza joae were received as a transfer from
the Museum of the Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. Professor
J. Harlan Johnson of the Colorado School of Mines added other type
specimens by his gift of four slides containing three primary and seven
secondary types of fossil algae from the Mississippian of Alberta.
Sixteen polished slabs of well-preserved petrified wood from Washing-
ton, Oregon, and Nevada were prepared for use in the new exhibit
planned for the paleobotanical section in the hall of fossils, with support
of the Roland W. Brown fund.

Near completion of covered storage racks now permits proper care
and arrangement of the many rather large specimens of vertebrate
fossils. This facility permits large slabs of fossil fish, portions of dinosaur
skeletons and the collection of Oligocene titanothere skulls, many of
which had been on display and a number of which are type specimens,
to be arranged in accessible, protected storage.

Teeth of Pleistocene mammoths and mastodons, and remains of
Pleistocene walrus from as far south as New Jersey, were among the
interesting collections of vertebrate fossils recovered by dredging opera-
tions near the Atlantic seaboard. Some of these were contributed by
private individuals but several came to the Institution from the Depart-
ment of the Interior’s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.

Some exceptionally fine specimens of vertebrate fossils, to be featured
in the hall of Pleistocene vertebrates, include a composite skeleton of
the mammoth Mammuthus primigenius from frozen deposits near Fair-
banks, Alaska, and several fine specimens of glyptodonts from the early
Pleistocene of Arizona; these specimens were obtained from the Frick
Laboratories at the American Museum of Natural History either on

THE COLLECTIONS—PALEOBIOLOGY 119

open exchange or as a gift. Another outstanding acquisition, also to be
featured in the Pleistocene exhibit, is a skeleton of the extinct ground
sloth Megalonyx. from Blackstone Cave near Gate City, Virginia, which
was purchased through the Walcott fund.

Among the several specimens of marine mammals obtained during
the year, principally from the Miocene beds in the Maryland-Virginia
region, is an unusually good representation of a fossil whale (cetothere)
from the Choptank Formation along the Potomac River in Westmore-
land County, Virginia. The collection of this specimen, featured in one
of the Smithsonian Institution television programs, was accomplished
by Albert C. Myrick, Jr., of the vertebrate paleontology laboratory,
Charles F. Buddenhagen of the U.S. Geological Survey, and William B.
Sonntag of the Smithsonian buildings management department.

Curatorial activities related to the collections of invertebrate fossils
have been mainly involved with type specimens, of which more than
4,000 were processed during the year. Each type has been checked
against published literature, labeled, recorded, and placed in systematic
order in the collections. The first chapter of the catalog of type speci-
mens of invertebrate fossils was completed by Louis Purnell, and work is
progressing on subsequent chapters that will ultimately result in a
complete catalog of the Museum’s invertebrate types.

Using funds from the Walcott bequest, Richard A. Robison collected
more than 5,000 invertebrate fossils of Early Ordovician age in the
vicinity of Nochixtlan in southern Mexico. This collection is of partic-
ular significance because faunas of unquestioned early Paleozoic age
were unknown from rocks south of the northern border states of Mexico.
The trilobites studied thus far are a mixture of genera containing ele-
ments that have been reported from Asia, North America, South
America, and Europe, a situation which will make the collection of
great importance in making intercontinental correlations.

The Walcott bequest also enabled Erle G. Kauffman to make a col-
lection of 20,000 specimens from the Mesozoic of Jamaica and the
Cretaceous of the Western Interior. These collections, together with
the existing one, constitute the largest and best-documented Mesozoic
faunal representation in the Western Hemisphere.

Other noteworthy additions to the collections were more than 50,000
sorted and labeled specimens of mollusks from the Tertiary of Maryland
and Virginia, from Charles Buddenhagen; many lots of type specimens
from the U.S. Geological Survey, including a collection of more than
4,500 smaller foraminifera types; and a collection of several thousand
identified specimens of cheilostome Bryozoa representing species of
Cretaceous through Recent age from all over the world, donated by
Alan Cheetham, who recently joined the Museum staff.

THE COLLECTIONS—-VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 121

Cataloging the backlog of sediment samples accumulated over the
years has absorbed most of the curatorial effort of the division of sedi-
mentology. Using the cataloging system of the National Oceanographic
Data Center the samples are being recorded so that collation of a speci-
men in the collections can be made with the analytical data stored in the
Data Center for that sample.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography donated to the Institution all
their cores and samples from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California;
the Marine Mineral Technology Center of the Bureau of Mines trans-
ferred more than a hundred samples from Monterey and Carmel Bays,
California; and the Coast and Geodetic Survey transferred more than a
hundred samples from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island.

Vertebrate Zoology

Collection management of bird specimens was streamlined by
use of a Typetronic machine on which the operator simultaneously
types the data on a label and generates punched-paper tape, which is
then used to prepare additional labels and a permanent museum
catalog page with no further manual labor. The tape is also available
for incorporation into a Smithsonian-wide, automatic-data-processing
system. George Watson has finished preliminary format and coding for
the labels and catalog pages, and all curators are actively working on a
definitive species list of birds of the world for use in processing the data.
All new specimens will be cataloged by this system and it is anticipated
that the entire seabird collection will soon be incorporated.

The seabird skin collection is growing in importance. New dis-
tributional records were incorporated, based on specimens from the
central Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, western South America, and
Macquarie Island. Large general collections of bird skins also came
from North and South America, the Aegean Islands, Kenya, Rhodesia,
Bechuanaland, and New Guinea. During the year 25 species and four
genera new to the collections were added.

The bird skeleton collection was improved by the addition of storage
space, additional work surfaces, and new boxes designed to facilitate
the use of the specimens and at the same time reduce the possibility of
breakage of delicate skeletons. An index collection of skeletal elements
of most avian families has facilitated identification of fossil and arche-
ological material by visiting investigators. The anatomical collection
of birds also continued its rapid growth with the addition of spirit
specimens from the West Indies, Venezuela, Egypt, and the Pacific
Ocean.
122 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Museum technician Edgar N. Gramblin positioning fishes (groupers) under
x-ray with a range of approximately 30 to 115 kilovolts. This machine is
used in the study of large fish specimens. Another, ranging from about 5
kilovolts upward, is used in the examination of small, delicate specimens.

In an extensive program of improving the condition of the collections
of fishes, the result of an energetic program of activity by the museum
aides in the division of fishes, specimens in the small evaporation-prone
ground-glass jars are being transferred to more secure clamp-top jars,
and large collections of fishes previously unsorted and unidentified
have been integrated into the regular collection.

The collection of fish specimens grew considerably by the addition of
approximately 5,000 specimens from the Peru-Chile Trench through
the efforts of Robert H. Gibbs and Bruce B. Collette; about 10,000
specimens from the Great Barrier Reef collected by Victor G. Springer;
approximately 2,000 fish specimens from Brazil received from J. S.
Dendy, Auburn University; 10,000 specimens from the southeastern
United States donated by Frank J. Schwartz, Chespeake Biological
Laboratory; and nearly 10,000 specimens from Lebanon, given by
Carl J. George, American University of Beirut.

Outstanding accessions of reptiles and amphibians include 417 collec-
tions from the South Pacific made by Robert M. Roecker; nearly 240
specimens of lizards from the Pacific Islands, collected by personnel of
the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey; 640 specimens of reptiles and
SPECIMENS IN THE NATIONAL COLLECTIONS 123

amphibians from Senegal and Gambia, collected by the Smithsonian
African Mammal Project; over a hundred specimens of ring-neck
snakes from the southeastern United States, collected by Bernard
Martof; and 152 specimens of reptiles and amphibians collected in
Venezuela by the Smithsonian Venezuelan Project.

Exhibits

The hall depicting the peoples of Africa neared completion during
the year. A life group illustrating the making of poisoned arrows,
bows, and ostrich-egg shell-beads by Bushmen of the northern Kalahari
was essentially completed; a second life group depicting a domestic
scene among the Hereros of southwest Africa, which will be displayed
in a hut-shaped exhibit case, neared completion. The hall will be
opened officially in the next fiscal year.

The planning and writing of scripts for the future hall of Old World
archeology made progress, with Mrs. Elly Dubinsky preparing exhibit
units for the Greco-Roman alcove under the supervision of Gus W.
Van Beek.

In June an exhibition of Tunisian Mosaics was opened for public
exhibition. This display, which had wide showing in Europe, will be
exhibited in. eleven museums of the United States and Canada in the
next two years under the auspices of the Smithsonian Traveling
Exhibition Service. Gus Van Beek arranged for the Washington
exhibition, worked with designer Dorothy Guthrie in planning it, and
assisted SITES in reviewing and editing the catalog.

Two additions to the hall of physical anthropology, both dealing
with cultural modifications of the human body, were made under the
direction of T. Dale Stewart. One of these is a central glass case
containing examples of mummifications, drying, and fat saponification
of complete human bodies. The other is a large oil painting by New
York artist Alton Tobey showing some of the more dramatic body
alterations usually undertaken for aesthetic reasons—such as deformed
heads and feet, patterns of tattooing and scarification, stretched necks,
and pierced ears.

Planning for the future hall of plant life was advanced by a field
expedition to Colombia under the leadership of botanist Thomas R.
Soderstrom, accompanied by Paul Marchand, master model-maker
from the Science Museum in Buffalo; artist Jay Matternes; Smith-
sonian photographer Kjell Sandved; and Smithsonian exhibits spe-
cialist Reginald J. Sayre. Marchand made molds and models of
plants from living specimens; Matternes set up his easel on the
mountainside where the chilling winds and frequent rain made his

STATUE OF JAPANESE
STATESMAN REPATRIATED

In 1858 Baron Naosuké Ii, the first
prime minister of modern Japan, con-
cluded a treaty of friendship with the
first United States minister to Japan.
Townsend Harris. Two years later
Prime Minister Ii was assassinated by
opponents of his foreign policy as he was
leaving the imperial palace grounds in
Tokyo. ‘Today Prime Minister Ii is greatly
honored in Japan as a courageous man
who upheld a liberal and wise national
policy at the cost of his life. Had it not
been for his penetrating foresight and
his resolute stand in opposition to popular
opinion, Japan might have adhered
much longer to the tradition of isolation
which that nation had shared with the
rest of the Orient.

A life-size wooden statue of Prime Min-
ister Ii, sculpted by Sekka Shima, was
exhibited at the World’s Columbian
Exposition at Chicago in 1893 and then
presented to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. There it remained in the Museum
of Natural History until the late summer
of 1966 when it was decided that this
statue should be returned to Ii’s home-
land. About this same time Roger
Pineau, of the Smithsonian Institution
Press, received naval orders to temporary
active duty to assist Admiral Samuel
Eliot Morison with historical research in
Japan. It seemed propitious to ask
Admiral Morison—who is a member of
the Smithsonian Journal of History board—
to represent Secretary Ripley in the
return of the statue, and the Navy
Department arranged for its transpor-
tation.

With the help of Mr. Walter Nichols,
the American cultural attaché in Tokyo,
the statue was returned to Baron Ii’s
birthplace at Hikone in Omi Province.

job extremely difficult; Sandved photographed more than 3,000 views
of the high Andes, as well as many close-up photographs of the plants;
and Sayre prepared for shipment back to the Museum plants that
included dried grasses, the woody parts of shrubs, and many specimens
preserved whole in formalin. The five-paneled panoramic view of the
paramos made by Matternes will be used to prepare the background
painting of the life group in the Museum. The photographs made
by Sandved will be used in an automatic projection system which will

accompany the exhibit.
Insects and related groups will be presented in a future exhibit

hall tentatively titled ‘““The World of Insects and Their Allies.” Pre-
liminary discussions of the departmental staff determined that the
underlying theme of the hall will be ecological, and planning was
begun in December. Writer Peter Farb, as consultant, will act as
liaison between the departmental staff and the Office of Exhibits in
developing the hall outline and the eventual exhibit scripts. Joseph
Shannon is the designer.

Two new permanent exhibits were opened in the hall of life in the
sea. The first of these demonstrates the variety of reproductive mechan-
isms in marine invertebrates, while the second shows various examples
of parental care among the marine animals. The case on reproduction
has been used as the basis of a tour guide produced as a cooperative
effort between the District of Columbia public schools, the Smith-

The ancient castle and grounds of the Ii family—as well as the modern mu-
seum in which the statue now stands (left, above)—are maintained as an
important cultural property.

The presentation took place on 16 November 1966 in the Hikone Public Hall,
where the statue was, accepted by Mayor Naoyoshi Ii, great grandson of
Prime Minister li. The ceremony was attended by John L. Stegmaier, U.S.
Consul-General for the Kobe-Osaka area, and Mr. Walter Nichols.

The remarks of Admiral Morison and Mayor Ii were covered by Japanese
press and television. After a tea and flower ceremony Mayor Ii took his
visitors on a tour of the castle and museum, and hosted a dinner for them at
the family estate.

Mayor li—who was first shown this statue of his forebear in May 1954 at
the Smithsonian (left) by Remington Kellogg, then Director, United States
National Museum—is a leading authority on crustaceans. His recent Fauna
Japonica Mysidae (Crustacea) is an outstanding contribution to the carcinological
literature.

sonian’s Office of Education and Training, and the Museum of Natural
History’s department of invertebrate zoology. It is intended that this
experimental tour guide provide the necessary background information
for making, a class trip to the Museum truly significant.

The new hall of meteorites was opened in December. With scripts
prepared by the curatorial staff of the division of meteorites and
exhibit design by Dorothy Guthrie, it features displays illustrating
phenomena of the fall of meteorites, their systematic classification, and
their scientific study. A tektite exhibit and a large globe illustrating the
moon’s surface were also included. One display is centered around a
section of the El Taco meteorite, a large individual from the Campo
del Cielo meteorite area in Argentina. Four sections were obtained
by the Smithsonian of this 4,400-pound specimen which has been the
object of study in Germany, Argentina, and many laboratories in this
country.

Nine exhibits units have been installed in the introductory section
of the physical geology hall. Noteworthy among these is a six-foot-
diameter relief globe depicting the geology of the earth, and a mural
by Pierre Meonde which illustrates one theory of the evolution of the
solar system. Work on this hall is under the overall direction of Paul
E. Desautels with the assistance on scripts of other members of the
department and of the department of paleohiology; design is by
Dorothy Guthrie.

Work has progressed on the dioramas depicting vertebrate life of
the Mesozoic era with the completion of the background painting by
Jay Matternes for the Triassic period. The Jurassic and Cretaceous
dioramas have been received from the contractor and now require only
the background painting. Models for a fourth diorama, illustrating
marine vertebrate life during the Cretaceous, have been approved. At
completion, the four dioramas will be viewed on the balcony of the
dinosaur hall.

Construction of the new hall depicting vertebrate life during the
Pleistocene has been completed this year and certain of the skeletons,
such as the giant Panamanian sloth, three mastodons, and the Hager-
man group of horses, have been installed. Mounting of several skeletons
has been completed and several others have been remounted in
different poses.

The first part of the hall on cold-blooded vertebrates was opened
during the year, and an excellent reproduction in the form of a life
group depicting a niche in the Everglades environment is a feature
attraction. This section also includes exhibits on amphibians and
reptiles, intended to give a rather full picture of the total biology of
these animals—their anatomy, ecology, and behavior.

THEODORE H. REED, Director

| 3 ead GROWTH AND ACHIEVEMENT in all areas again mark the
year for the National Zoological Park. No one event overshadows
all others. In the animal department a third gorilla and a sloth bear
were born. In the research division a field study of the Ceylonese
elephant was started. The new hoofed-stock area was opened and
occupied. And constant improvement in such aspects of the Zoo’s
work as education, nutrition, and beautification of the grounds contrib-
uted to a very good year.

In the interest of conserving endangered species of animals, two
female pygmy hippopotamuses from other zoos were bred to the
National Zoo’s Totota. Word has also been received that our male
orangutan, Butch, who was sent to the Boston Zoo last year* is now
residing in Colorado Springs for breeding purposes.

The Animals

Through gifts, births, purchases, and exchanges, the collection has
increased so that it now contains not only more individual animals,
but a greater number of species than ever before in its history, greatly
adding to the diversity of the exhibits.

To these figures should be added the 28 species, comprising 138 in-
dividuals, of small mammals under the care of the research division
and not always on exhibit, giving a grand total of 1,017 species and
3,404 individuals.

Increased interest of the scientific community in the history of
captive animals has led the Zoo to improve with an easy-retrieval
system its method of keeping animal records.

Nore: Certain tabulated, statistical, and other information formerly contained in
the report of the National Zoological Park in Smithsonian Year now appears as
appendices to the Separate of this Report (available on request from the Director
of the National Zoological Park). This information includes:
Visitor statistics and other operational information.
Report of the Veterinarian, augmented by case histories and autopsy reports.
Complete lists of (a) animals in the collection on June 30, 1967; (b) all births
and hatchings during the year; and (c) changes in the collection by gift,
purchase, or exchange.

In cooperation with the American Institute of Biological Sciences,
the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an intensive course in bio-
medical telemetry at the Natural History Museum auditorium,
August 10 to 13. Special exhibits in connection with the course, held
at the Zoo August 10 to 19, were:

Caiman: This reptile swallowed a radio transmitter which senses
temperature and telemeters it to an external receiver, whether the
animal is in or out of the water. Visitors could detect the clicking
signal and calculate the caiman’s temperature for themselves.
Four-day-old Inaki, lowland gorilla, the third offspring (and first female)
born to Moka and Nikumba.

Llama: A subcutaneous probe from an attached external trans-
mitter sent pulses to a receiver for continuous recording. These indica-
tions, which are useful in disease diagnosis, showed much smaller
changes in this warm-blooded animal than in the caiman.

Pronghorn: A transmitter carried externally by the animal emitted
a pulsating signal which could be heard on a receiver with turnable
antenna. Rotation of direction-finding receiver by the visitor allowed
him to locate the animal in the paddock.

These exhibits were set up by R. Stuart Mackay of the University
of California, in cooperation with the Zoo staff.

Moving the white rhinoceroses turned out to be one of the most
elaborate engineering feats to be accomplished during the year.
From their rather small cage and outdoor yard in the elephant house,
which they had occupied ever since their arrival here on September 4,
1956, Bill and Lucy were transferred to a moated hillside where
they can be viewed without any obstructing bars. Their new home
is in an area reserved for hoofed stock too delicate to winter outdoors,
and it is an ideal spot in which to display these valuable and mag-
nificent animals.
158 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Special ramps that would bear the weight of the rhinos (Bill weighs
4,865 pounds, Lucy 3,630) were built by the mechanical department
in order to have the animals walk onto the waiting trucks. With the
aid of tranquilizers administered by Zoo veterinarian Clinton Gray,
and with eleven stalwart keepers to push and tug, both animals made
it safely. The distance traveled was about 500 feet—the time required,
four hours.

With completion of the new hoofed-stock area, the zebras and
Mongolian horse were returned on September 2, 1966, to the Zoo,
after having been boarded at a farm in Maryland. The first major
birth in the area was that of a male Grant’s zebra on April 12, 1967.

BIRTHS

Outstanding mammal births included a sloth bear, a brown lemur,
golden marmoset twins, five serval kittens, two of the rare little South
African black-footed cats, and two golden cats. As always, the excite-
ment that surrounds the birth of a gorilla in captivity attended
the birth to Moka, the Zoo’s lowland gorilla, of her third infant and
first female, on April 8, 1967. Inaki, as the youngster was named, is
being reared by Mrs. Bernard Gallagher, who successfully reared the
first two gorillas born at the National Zoo. The birth this year of 5
Barbary apes, more than in any previous year, brings to 27 the colony
which is being built up for the monkey island that is in the Zoo’s future
plans. Mating of the black rhinoceroses has been observed, and if the
signs of pregnancy are reliable, a rhinoceros will be born during fiscal
year 1968.

Among the bird hatchings followed by successful raising were those
achieved by crested green wood partridges (14), Hawaiian ducks (9),
black-necked swan (1), kookaburras (5), Pentland’s tinamou (2), and
the bare-throated tree partridge (1). The first emu chick to be hatched
in the Zoo appeared, but perhaps the rarest of all was a tiny elf owl;
so far as is known, the only other elf owls to be hatched in captivity are
at the Sonora Desert Museum in Arizona, where conditions closely
simulate their natural habitat and are not at all like those for our
little pair behind glass in the bird house. Birds that had first nestings
but were unsuccessful in hatchings were the rufous-thighed falconet,
red-billed oxpecker, and collared forest falcon.

Noteworthy reptile hatchings were those of the banded red snakes
(2) and the eastern indigo snake (1).

GIFTS

As usual, the Zoo was the recipient of numerous, much appreciated
gifts. A complete list will be found in the Appendix (see note, p. 156).

Of particular interest were two baby cheetahs, presented by Woodward
& Lothrop, which were part of a window display at the store in
January. Dr. Harry Hoogstraal, at the time stationed in Cairo, sent
the Zoo a North African banded weasel, eleven European hoopoes,
other birds, and a number of interesting reptiles. John Archbold, of
Upperville, Va., gave two river otters. Edward Marshall Boehm, of
Trenton, N.J., presented 29 specimens of rare birds, and S. Dillon
Ripley contributed 18 birds, mostly waterfowl, and a muntjac—a
small species of Asiatic deer. An albino turtle from Thailand was a
gift from the Dusit Zoo, Bangkok, to the National Zoo, and was
accepted on the Zoo’s behalf by Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, who visited
the Dusit Zoo in October.

A much appreciated contribution, received from Reader’s Digest, was
$500 ear-marked for the purchase of animals.

PURCHASES

Four Pére David’s deer were purchased to start a National Zoological
Park herd. These rare animals exist only in captivity, having been
extinct in the wild for many years. All are young, and breeding is not
expected for several years.

One male greater kudu was received and females now in quarantine
in Germany are expected to arrive in midsummer.

Pure species gibbon colonies are hard to find in the United States,
as these ‘‘species”’ readily crossbreed, but the Zoo has been fortunate in
obtaining five crested gibbons, Hylobates concolor, sometimes called
white-cheeked gibbons.

New animals purchased and placed on exhibit this year include lesser
pandas, Colobus monkeys, Sykes’ monkeys, Asiatic pangolins, and
viscachas.

Sixty eggs of Icelandic ducks were purchased and are being incu-
bated; old squaw and red-breasted merganser are two of the several
species bought. Also purchased and placed on exhibit were 2 rhinoceros
hornbills from Malaya, known for their high, red-and-yellow casque
curled upward at the front.

In the bird house, on loan from the Baltimore Zoo; is a kagu, which
is nocturnal and lives on the forest floor in New Caledonia.

LOANS AND EXCHANGES

The Zoo continued its custom of exchanging surplus animals with
other zoos and of receiving specimens in return, and a complete list
of these will be found in the Appendix (see note, p. 156). In several
such instances the Zoo obtained mates for solitary specimens in the
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 161

National collection, among them a hyacinthine macaw from the
Catskill Game Farm and a drill from the Dallas Zoo. From Pretoria,
South Africa, came the largest exchange, which included a pair of
spotted hyenas, four Stanley cranes, eight sacred ibis, and a number
of rare reptiles.

REMOVALS

Saddest loss of the year was the death on November 26, 1966, of
the Bengal tiger Samson, mate to Mohini the white tigress. Specialists
called in consultation found it impossible to save the animal from a
degenerative kidney ailment. Details of the terminal illness may be
found in the Veterinarian’s report in the Appendix (see note, p. 156).
Ramana, Samson’s son, a male of normal color from Mohini’s first
litter, is now of breeding age and has been successfully introduced to
his mother. Genetic makeup from this union should produce a litter
of which half the cubs are white and half yellow.

Because of a shortage of great ape quarters, the Zoo’s pair of breeding
chimpanzees, Maggie and Jiggs, were loaned to the Forest Park Zoo in
Springfield, Massachusetts. On April 21, 1967, two days after their
tenth baby was born, Jiggs escaped from his cage and had to be shot.
Maggie and the baby remain in Springfield.

Some losses in the collection were specimens that had been here for
so many years that they may have established longevity records.
“Granny,” a red-faced macaque, received in 1942 as a gift from
Harold Coolidge, in whose family it had been a pet since 1937, died
March 1967 at the age of thirty.

Research

Research at the National Zoological Park has undergone rapid
diversification during the past year. With the conversion of two rooms
on the top floor of the reptile house into laboratories, facilities have
been expanded, and the added area permits the accommodation of
new predoctoral research students as well as visiting investigators from
other institutions.

In conjunction with H. K. Buechner of the Smithsonian Office of
Ecology, and with F. Kurt and G. McKay, a research program was
initiated on the behavior and ecology of the Ceylonese elephant,
Elephas maximus, financed in part through the Smithsonian Foreign
Currency Program and by a grant from the World Wildlife Fund.
Preliminary studies on elephant behavior were conducted at the Zoo,
but the current effort is concentrated in the Yala region on the south-
east coast of Ceylon.

164 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

During fall 1966 Paul Leyhausen of the Max Planck Institute at
Wuppertal visited for two months and together with John Eisenberg
initiated research on the behavior patterns of our captive viverrids.
It is being continued by Christen Wemmer.

In January Eisenberg left for Ceylon to initiate the elephant ecology
program. Thence on January 30 he proceeded to Madagascar, where
he joined Edwin Gould of Johns Hopkins University in a continuation
of their studies on the insectivores of that island. Eisenberg’s return
in April was followed by three shipments of living mammals from
Madagascar, including the mouse lemur Microcebus, the dwarf lemur
Cheirogaleus, and tenrecs of the genera Tenrec, Hemicentetes, and Maicro-
gale. Eisenberg returned to Ceylon in May for an inspection of field
work on the elephant. He presented a seminar at the University of
Missouri and gave a lecture course in sociobiology during the fall
semester at the University of Maryland.

Other current research projects were:

1. Studies of thermoregulation and reproduction in the tenrecs of
the following genera: Mucrogale, Hemicentetes, Tenrec, Setifer, and
Echinops (with E. Gould).

2. Studies of the ontogeny of vocalization in neotropical primates,
the following species being currently under study: Saguinus oedipus,
Leontocebus rosalia, Ateles fusciceps (with Miss N. Muckenhirn).

3. Studies on the social behavior and on the ontogeny of behavior
among selected species of Caviomorph rodents (with Mr. N. Smythe).

4. Studies on the prey-catching behavior of carnivorous mammals,
including the Tenrecidae, Dasyuridae, and Viverridae (with P.
Leyhausen and C. Wemmer).

Visiting scientists using the facilities of the research division also
included Theodore I. Grand, Oregon Primate Center; Muriele
Bertrand, Johns Hopkins University; and Suzanne Ripley, University
of Virginia.

The following papers originating in the research division were

Conservation

As conceived by Smithsonian Secretary Langley in 1888, the Na-
tional Zoological Park was to be ‘‘a home and city of refuge for the
vanishing races of the continent.” In the years since then, North
American wildlife has been brought under generally successful man-
agement in hundreds of State and National parks, forests, and refuges.
At the same time, however, wildlife in Africa, Asia, and South America
has been so swiftly and drastically reduced that several hundred species
are in imminent danger of extinction. Today the National Zoo’s role
in conservation has become international.

Within the Zoo itself, the new orientation is expressed in manage-
ment of the collection, and in public education. ‘“‘Vanishing Animal”
signs mark the threatened mammals and birds. Captive breeding has

become a necessary safeguard against extinction for a number of
species. The National Zoo has had outstanding success in propagating
the pygmy hippopotamus. Other endangered species successfully bred
at the Zoo include the golden marmoset, orangutan, dorcas gazelle,
and Hawaiian duck. The Zoo has acquired a nucleus herd of Pére
David’s deer and is awaiting arrival of a trio of scimitar-horned oryx.

The Director and the Assistant Director are closely affiliated with the
work of such national and international conservation agencies as the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Wild Animal
Propagation Trust, and the Committee on Conservation of the Ameri-
can Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which also has a
Subcommittee on Endangered Species. A principal function of the
latter is to help suppress the traffic in illegally captured and smuggled
animals. Zoos considering purchase of species on the critical list are
required by AAZPA policy to consult this Subcommittee, which
verifies the required licenses and certificates.
166 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Day-to-day cooperation with foreign zoo associations, conservation
groups, and public officials has virtually halted the trade in smuggled
orangutans. In February 1967, in the first action of its kind, U.S.
authorities seized a young orangutan at Dulles Airport. Pending final
court action, ‘“Dennis” has been housed at the National Zoo. Authori-
ties have recommended that he be placed on deposit, for breeding
purposes, in a zoo designated by the Wild Animal Propagation Trust.
The Subcommittee has also helped suppress illegal traffic in monkey-
eating eagles, Javan and Sumatran rhinoceroses, Galapagos and
Aldabra tortoises, golden marmosets, and Zanzibar red Colobus
monkeys, all gravely threatened species.

A long-term objective of the Zoo is to establish a “‘survival center,”
a farm or ranch with more space for breeding groups of endangered
species than an urban zoo can provide. A suitable farm owned by the
Smithsonian Institution is available to the Zoo, provided funds can be
obtained for improvements and operating costs.

Information and Education

The information-education section continued its signing and labeling
program. It also provided graphic arts services and support, editorial
assistance and copy writing for various activities, as well as assisting
with press, radio and TV coverage of Zoo activities. Also continued was
the dissemination of natural history and Park information by telephone
and correspondence. The Zoo library was reorganized. The photo-
graphic files are being completely reorganized.

Some 38 guided tours were conducted for groups of handicapped
children, visting schools and colleges, visitors from other zoos and
museums, and special guests and dignitaries. The section also co-
operated with the Friends of the National Zoo in various projects.

Friends of the National Zoo

Of prime importance to the Friends of the National Zoo is the
realization of means to enable them to acquire financial support and an
income for continuation of their educational aims and objectives. On
November 6, 1966, the President signed P.L. 89-772, which permits the
Friends of the National Zoo to operate concessions, the proceeds to be
used for research and educational work for the benefit of the Zoo. On
May 31, 1967, a contract was signed, authorizing the Friends to operate
a sales kiosk near the clock in the center of the Zoo.

The annual Zoo Night for members was held June 5. Members
toured the new hoofed-stock area and the two new buildings for delicate
hoofed stock. There were refreshments on the bird-house lawn and
a guitar concert by Charlie Byrd.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 167

The official emblem and seal (line drawings of the white tigress,
Mohini) were produced and copyrighted. These are used to identify the
organization in numerous ways. Publication of the quarterly newsletter,
Spots and Stripes, was continued.

At the annual meeting on May 31, new officers elected for the coming
year were Timothy V. A. Dillon, president; Margaret W. Harlan,
vice president; Frank Ridgdill, treasurer; and Warren Iliff, secretary.
Outgoing officers were Malcolm C. Henderson, president; Timothy
V.A. Dillon, vice president; Luis Corea, treasurer; Mary Ellen Grogan,
secretary.

The Friends cooperated with the Zoo in “operation preg. watch,’
during which members generously volunteered their time for all-night
vigils of closed-circuit TV monitoring—watching for parturition in the
lioness Princess. The volunteer watching the monitor was instructed
to turn on the film tape-recorder at first sign of the birth process and to
notify veterinarian Clinton W. Gray. For a week Princess was watched
by Zoo personnel by day and by Friends volunteers by night. The
pregnancy unfortunately turned out to be a false one, but the watchers
were eager to participate again at any future time to assist the Zoo in
obtaining valuable footage on the behavior and birth processes of
captive exotic animals.

Construction and Improvements

A long-sought project for a continuous 24-hour scenic park road in
Rock Creek Valley to connect the Arlington Memorial Bridge and
Potomac Parks with Rock Creek Park has become a reality. The Zoo
bypass on the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, which provides the
missing link by carrying parkway traffic around instead of through the
Zoo, was dedicated on August 19, 1966. The project included a 400-
foot tunnel under Administration Hill and a bridge over Rock Creek at
Calvert Street. A parkway overpass at Harvard Street to accommodate
Zoo traffic is nearing completion.
168 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

The hardy-hoofed-stock complex was completed and occupied during
the year. These quarters were designed for animals which require a
minimum of shelter and protection from the Washington weather, such
as the Cape buffalo, white-bearded gnu, zebra, Przewalski horse, and
llama. The site is built on a 34-acre area, with four separate buildings
laid out in a rectangular pattern. The area enclosed by the buildings is
used as a holding, or off-exhibit area. The perimeter area is divided
into six exhibit paddocks, all viewed across dry moats from the visitor
walk which circumscribes the complex. Building design of each of the
four shelters is the same, and the construction is similar to that used in
the deer area—masonry block with flat roofs on exposed laminated
wood beams. The loafing shed extends the full length of each shelter,
and back of it is the building, divided into a bull stall and a loafing
stall, the latter so arranged that it can be subdivided into three separate
stalls each the size of the bull stall. Service is through an alleyway
running along both axes of the complex.

The delicate-hoofed-stock complex, opened to the public on June 6,
1967, consists of two buildings, totaling 15,850 square feet, built on the
upper part of the three-acre sloping site. Landscaping and grading are
so designed that visitors can view the four delicate-hoofed-stock pad-
docks from the promenade roofs of the two buildings, and then proceed
via ramps and stairs to view the exhibits inside. This inside view is
from a visitor corridor which runs the length of, and connects, the
two buildings. Each building has three exhibit stalls, with the usual
adjacent retiring stall and keeper and service rooms and access. The
back (paddock) wall of each exhibit stall is a window wall that allows
the visitor to view the inside as well as the outside area, and gives a
feeling of spaciousness to the inside exhibit.

The delicate-hoofed-stock buildings are of poured concrete con-
struction with natural stone facing and trim on exposed surfaces. Since
delicate-hoofed stock are considered to be those animals which, in the
Washington area, require heated quarters in the winter and protection
from the extreme summer temperatures, the heating system for these
buildings is designed to provide a minimum temperature of 60° F.
during the winter, and one of the buildings is air conditioned. Planned
for exhibit in these buildings are dorcas gazelles, kudu, sable antelope,
and scimitar-horned oryx. Since the Zoo has pairs of three different
species of rhinoceros (white, black, and Indian) one of the enclosures
was modified to accommodate the white rhinos.

The trunk sewers and retention basin, started in January 1966, were
completed in June 1967, and Beaver Valley has again been opened to
the public.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Most of the new construction completed to date centers at the north
end of the Zoo between Connecticut Avenue (1) and the Elephant
House (10). Earlier construction includes the remodeled bird house (5),
great flight cage (6), deer paddocks (7), parking for 260 cars in lots
A and B (3 and 4), and the perimeter vehicular road (2). The recently
opened hoofed-stock area is a 7-acre complex consisting of two perma-
nent buildings for delicate stock (9) and four multi-stall shelters with
eight yards for hardy stock (8). It is expected that 50 to 60 animals will
eventually be accommodated in this area as the herds develop. (Blue
Ridge Aerial Survey photo.)

170 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Plans for the hospital, research, service, and supply complex are
completed and have been approved by the various reviewing agencies.
Bids will be opened early in August and construction should start some
time in fall 1967.

The fiscal year 1967 Appropriation Act contained an item of
$1,589,000 for improvements at the National Zoological Park, to
include the multi-climate complex. Plans for this building were started
by the architects after approval was obtained from the various review-
ing Commissions. Construction is expected to start in late spring 1968.

Beautification of the Park continued under head gardener John
W. Monday with the planting of 65 trees, 2000 evergreens, 4000 bulbs,
and 5,100 annuals. Gifts of plants were received from Mrs. Lyndon
B. Johnson, and also from the Arboretum, the D.C. Water Works,
Botanical Gardens, Glendale Nursery, Glendale Hospital, and Walter
Reed Hospital. An account of the work of the grounds department
is contained in the Appendix (see note, p. 156).

pcoiyrenes HAVE CONTINUED TO EXPAND at the Smithsonian Tropical

Research Institute essentially along the same lines as in previous
years, but with some slight changes of emphasis. Among these activi-
ties—research by the staff and support of research by visiting scientists
and students, education and training, and the encouragement and
practice of conservation—it is the latter two that have shown the
greatest relative increase.

STRI scientists and students have begun long-term research on several
biological processes or problems which are particularly conspicuous in
the Tropics (e.g., the evolution of social behavior and social systems,
and the relationship between species diversity and evolutionary “‘suc-
cess”). We are beginning to get results from these studies. Unfortu-
nately, however, some of these results are difficult to interpret, due
largely to the fact that the studies have been confined to Central and
South America. We have been able to identify some distinctive charac-
teristics of organisms and biotas in these regions, but we do not know if
they are typical of the Tropics as a whole or only of the New World.
Thus, we badly need comparative data from other parts of the Tropics,
and ideally, from the tropical parts of all the major zoogeographic
realms.

During the latter part of the year, the staff of the Institute began to
develop plans for research in the Old World Tropics and for coopera-
tion with other scientific institutions in that area. In order to establish
preliminary contacts, and to acquire the necessary background informa-

17]
172 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 71967

tion, Rand and Robinson attended an international symposium on
tropical biology at Varanasi, India, and then investigated possible
research areas in Ceylon. Rand also visited Malaya. Moynihan subse-
quently made a more extensive survey of research possibilities in
Senegal, the Ivory Coast, the Congo (Kinshasa), Madagascar, Assam,
Ceylon, Thailand, and the Territory of Papua-New Guinea. It is hoped
that these efforts will produce practical results in the form of new
research programs by the end of FY 1968 or the beginning of FY 1969.

In November, the Smithsonian Institution held a conference on
tropical biology in Panama City attended by more than 60 outstanding
scientists from the U.S. and Latin America. In the course of the discus-
sion, an attempt was made to determine the most urgent and important
problems confronting biologists in the Tropics. Special attention was
paid to the possible effects of a new sea-level canal joining the Atlantic
and Pacific somewhere across Central America or northern Colombia.
It was resolved that an urgent need exists to begin long-term ecological
studies now, especially in the marine environments. Under present
world conditions of exploding human populations and the limitations
of the resources that support them, it is essential that any environmental
manipulations as significant as the proposed Atlantic-Pacific sea-level
canal be based on a comprehensive background of fundamental
information.

Research and Publication

In terms of research in progress or completed at STRI, the study of
tropical biology has provided and continues to provide results of both
theoretical value and practical usefulness. From a purely scientific
point of view, tropical biotas are interesting primarily because they
are so rich and varied; they include much larger numbers, and a greater
diversity, of species than the biotas of any other regions of the world:
and the ecological and behavioral relations among species are more
complex, on the average, in the Tropics than anywhere else. Convincing
evidence points to the Tropics as the place of origin and principal center
of evolution of most groups of organisms. It would appear, too, that new
and major types of adaptations to new ways of life are more likely
to be evolved by tropical species than by species of other regions, and
Tropical species seem to be more successful in invading other regions
than are species of other regions in invading the Tropics. As a result
of this combination of features, tropical biotas provide invaluable
opportunities for the analysis of such fundamental biological processes
as evolution, competition and cooperation among species and in-
dividuals, animal communication (with its implications for the origin
of human language), and the development of social organization.
TROPICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE 173

Within the Tropics, the Panamanian region is particularly interesting
or several reasons. The isthmus itself is a bridge between two continents.
It is the route by which species of northern origin move south, and
southern species move north. Thus, it is a living laboratory for the
study of zoogeographic change. The fact that the Atlantic and Pacific
are only 50 miles apart in central Panama is also significant. Nowhere
else in the world can the distinct floras and faunas of two oceans be
compared as easily and under such favorable conditions.

The practical implications of basic research in the Tropics are less
obvious but not less important. The human societies of tropical regions
are developing and expanding at breakneck speed. They will need to
learn a great deal more about their environments, if they are to manage
these environments successfully and thus attain the goals they have
set for themselves.

In view of all these facts, it is not surprising that the Panamanian
region attracts more and more scientists and students. And there is
every reason to believe that this increase will continue, or even ac-
celerate, during the next decade. The following tabulation shows the
number of visitors for whom the Institute provided appreciable
support during the past year.

Mention of a few of their projects may illustrate the range of activities
which the Institute has been able to facilitate, encourage, or support.

Owen J. Sexton, his associates, and graduate students from Wash-
ington University continued their researches on the factors regulating
reproduction in lizards, particularly anoles. Such studies are particu-
larly significant for they are revealing endogeneous cycles in repro-
ductive activity. This work was supported by the National Science
Foundation.

John W. Smith of the University of Pennsylvania and his students
investigated for several months the auditory communication patterns
among birds, especially flycatchers. This approach to the study of
animal behavior is rewarding, for it is demonstrating the various
evolutionary pathways by which essential information is encoded and

transmitted, and it also sheds light on the phylogeny of the organisms
themselves.

At the marine laboratories, Howard Winn of the University of
Rhode Island and his graduate students recorded and analyzed the
sounds produced by a variety of fishes, particularly marine catfishes.
The large concrete tanks of the Naos Island facility proved most
suitable for this research, which is supported by the Office of Naval
Research.

Eric Davidson of Rockefeller University continued his experimental
studies of gene activity in anuran oOgenesis. One local species, Engy-
stomops pustulosus, has proven particularly useful, and is yielding new
information on possible extranuclear synthesis of DNA, and the specific
roles of various cytoplasmic factors in repressing or activating portions
of the genome during ontogeny. This research is supported by the
American Cancer Society.

Various aspects of the biology of ants were investigated by several
researchers. Roger Akre, Washington State University, and his grad-
uate students spent several months studing the factors involved in the
movements of army ants (Eczton). Paul Kannowski, University of North
Dakota, studied the mating-flight behavior of several ant species. The
peculiar leaf-cutting ants (Atta) were studied by Bruce Haines of Duke
and Paul Martin of Michigan Universities. Haines investigated the
role that Atta plays in determining vegetational patterns. This is a
two-sided effect, for although these ants defoliate many plants, they
also fertilize the soil near their nests, adding phosphorus which is
scarce in the poor tropical soils. In cultivating fungus in their leaf
gardens, they manage to grow only one species to the exclusion of all
other fungi. Martin, a chemist, seeks to know how this remarkable
feat is accomplished.

Most of the subjects investigated by scientists of the Institute staff
(permanent resident scientists and graduate student interns) fall into
the fields of evolution, social behavior, communication, species di-
versity, and zoogeography. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the
research was supported from federal funds appropriated to the Smith-
sonian Institution.

Martin Moynihan continued his studies of social behavior among
Andean birds, supported by the National Science Foundation, and
of communication in Neotropical primates. He presented two seminars
at the University of Texas on the evolution of social and communica-
tion systems. Also, he was awarded the William J. Walker prize by
the Boston Museum of Science for outstanding achievements in biology.
TROPICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE 177

Robert L. Dressler, on leave for the past year, served as executive
director of the Association for Tropical Biology. Despite heavy
administrative duties, he continued his research on the pollination
relationships between euglossine bees and orchids of the subtribe
Stanhopeinae. The peculiar adaptations in structure, flowering time,
and odor serve to attract the “right” kind, or kinds, of bees and
thus to supply the principal isolating mechanisms between many orchid
species. This relationship has been a major factor in orchid evolution.

Engystomops pustulosus have now reached the stage where the entire
repertory has been cataloged. Experiments are in progress to determine
the information content and how this information is encoded. He also
continued his work on the selective forces affecting egg type and clutch
size in tropical reptiles in general. Rand became a member of the
editorial committee of the journal Copeza.

Michael H. Robinson, from Oxford University, joined the regular
scientific staff last year. Using monkeys and spiders as predators and
various insects as prey, he began a series of experiments investigating
the complex adaptations evolved in such interactions. Among the
many questions that he is posing is: do appendages common to all
insects serve as cues for prey recognition? Initial results suggest that,
like the marmoset Saguinus geoffroyi, predators can distinguish insect
prey only be features which are often concealed by the behavior and
morphology of cryptic insects.

Ira Rubinoff continued his studies of the evolution of isolating
mechanisms in certain species of Panamanian marine fishes. Working
with Rubinoff on various problems of the complex Panamanian fish
fauna was Richard Rosenblatt of the Scripps Oceanographic Institute,
who spent several weeks as a special consultant on Panamanian marine
fishes. Rubinoff presented a paper, ‘‘ Measurement of Isolation Achieved
Between Sympatric and Allopatric Combinations of the Genus Bathy-
gobius in Panama,” at a meeting of the American Society of Ichthyolo-
gists and Herpetologists. He was appointed associate in ichthyology at
the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University.

Neal Smith’s continuing experiments on the evolution of adaptations
for and against brood parasitism between several species of oropendolas
(Icteridae) and the parasitic icterid Scaphidura revealed an unexpected
result. Oropendolas who fail to discriminate eggs of Scaphidura from
their own, and therefore raise the young parasites, usually do so to
the detriment of their own offspring. Selection then favors increasing
discrimination by the oropendolas, and better mimicry by the Scaphi-
dura. Under certain conditions, however, selection may favor non-
178 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

discrimination. In these cases, young oropendolas have a better chance
of reaching the fledging stage when they are raised in the same nests
with young Scaphidura, than when they are not. The balance between
discrimination and nondiscrimination appears to be delicate, and the
complex factors producing this unique situation are still being studied.

Marcel Hladik’s studies are showing an interesting parallel between
Old and New World monkeys in the correlation betwen the kinds of
food eaten and the microstructure of their digestive gut. Using light
and electron microscopy, Hladik is finding that the intestinal mucosa
very rapidly adjusts morphologically and histochemically to changes
in the types of food consumed. This is an important adaptation to
living areas where insect and fruit abundance may vary asynchronously.

Martin Naumann continued his study of several species of social
wasps (Protopolybia). Unlike many wasps and bees, the size of the nest
in these species is not indicative of the age of the nest, but rather of the
size of the founding swarm and this, in turn, is a function of the number
of queens present.

Significant progress in analyzing the social behavior of the white-
faced monkey Cebus capucinus was made by John Oppenheimer, whose
observations of how new groups form and how territorial rights are
established were of special interest.

Using automatic cameras in the Barro Colorado Island forest,
Nicholas Smythe has been able to obtain an almost complete record of
the behavior and ecology of the large caviomorph rodents, the agouti
Dasyprocta punctata, and the paca Agouti paca. Symthe’s detailed work
with these species show how the diverse social systems found in the
caviomorphs can be considered specific adaptations to particular fea-
tures of their environments.

National Academy of Science Fellow Howard Wright studied the
sexual behavior and other interactions of several species of grapsoid
crabs. These poorly known crabs exhibit remarkable geographic varia-
tion in certain features of their behavior which can be correlated with
predator pressure.

Estanislau da Silveira of Brazil, Organization for American States
Fellow at the Institute, completed a catalog of the endoparasites of the
anteater Tamandua. José Olazarri of Uruguay, another OAS Fellow,
began his studies of the molluscan fauna of Barro Colorado and the
behavior of the spiny rat Proechimys. He is also assisting Michael
Robinson with his work on spiders.

More than 20 papers by visiting scientists, based wholly or in part
upon the results of research at Institute facilities, were published last
year (a listing of earlier such works is to be found in Smithsonian
TROPICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE 179

Information Leaflet 281, rev. August 1965). Papers by the staff are
listed on page 182.

Educational and Related Programs

Under the continuing fellowship program with the Science and
Educational Division of the Organization of American States, the fellows
are learning modern techniques of field biology under the guidance
of the resident members of the Institute staff. Field classes of the
Organization for Tropical Studies visited the Institute’s facilities and
conducted exercises at the marine laboratories, and a class of students
from Harvard, under the direction of Giles Mead, curator of fishes
at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, spent several weeks studying
the marine and fresh-water organisms of the area. Senior members of
the Institute staff are assisting and to some extent directing the work
of the graduate student interns. They also provide informal guidance
to visiting students from other institutions.

A fellowship program sponsored by the U.S. Air Force was estab-
lished to bring scientists to Panama and adjacent regions to investigate
the feasibility of doing extensive research in the Tropics. The first are
expected to arrive early next year.

The past year was a period of major construction and renovation
at the Barro Colorado Island laboratory. Ernest Hayden, formerly
master sergeant, U.S. Army, was appointed station manager. A new
building was finished which will serve as a residence for a staff scientist
and as additional dormitory space for visiting scientists. Eastman
Kodak’s experimental facility was relocated and the old Kodak
building was converted into a combination residence and laboratory
area. A new house and a screened-in dining building were constructed
for the labor staff. The station acquired the new 40-foot fiberglass-
hulled vessel James etek II to supplement and eventually to replace
the present wooden vessel which has been in service for many years.
The boat dock area, which had been filling up with stream sediment
for a number of years, was cleared and dredged. The library, possibly
the best in the Neotropics, continued to expand and is now more than
8000 volumes. Mrs. Alcira Mejia was promoted to full-time librarian,
and Mrs. Nicholas Smythe was appointed library assistant.

The marine laboratories, opened last year, were expanded and
their facilities improved. Archibald Turner, formerly of the U.S.
Army Tropic Test Center, was appointed manager of both stations.
Construction was completed at the Galeta Island station, and now
both marine laboratories are fully operational. The Naos Island
station was enlarged to include another building, which will serve

as laboratory and office space for resident and visiting scientists.
Construction was completed on several concrete tanks, each 29’ x 23’ x
8’ deep, in the largest building of the Naos Island complex. The tanks
now have running sea water and are being used for the study of large
and pelagic organisms. The second floor of the original building, the
“bunker laboratory,” was remodeled to provide a seminar hall, office
and laboratory space for visiting researchers, and an area for the storage
of specimens. An 18-foot fiberglass outboard skiff and two 4-wheel-
drive vehicles were other additions which have greatly facilitated
field work.

Dr. Peter Glynn, who was engaged to begin a marine invertebrate
program, is expected to arrive early next year. Three new research
associates were appointed: John Eisenberg of the National Zoo;
Paulo Vanzolini of the Departmento de Zoologia in Sao Paulo,
Brazil; and Patricio Sanchez of the Catholic University of Chile.

Conservation

The Institute continued to preserve the areas under its control
but because poaching pressure has increased, especially from boats,
the legal limits of the Barro Colorado Island Preserve were extended
to include a wide band of water around the island. The new boundary
is being marked by signs.

All physical facilities of the STRI are located in the Panama Canal Zone:
Barro Colorado Island, with its laboratory for research on terrestrial and
fresh-water organisms; marine biology laboratories on Naos Island and
Galeta Island, both connected with the mainland by causeway; a tract
in the Navy Pipeline Reservation; and an office in Ancon.

182 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

The staff continued to encourage, both formally and informally,
conservation practices in the Republic of Panama. Martin Moynihan
was made a member of the Comisién Nacional de Proteccién de la
Fauna Silvestre. He also gave advice on the management of reserves
in Madagascar and New Guinea.

Guy A. Ramanantsoa, chief of the Forestry Bureau of the Malagasy
Republic, visited Barro Colorado in order to make personal observa-
tions of conservation practices. He also conferred with members of
the Reforma Agraria on the types and extent of exploitation of Panama’s
natural resources.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

W. H. Kiem, Director

a SUN IS THE principal source of all energy required for life on the
earth. Radiant energy from the sun is trapped by pigments and
converted to potential chemical energy. Food produced by this process
of photosynthesis is either stored or utilized immediately for the growth
and development of biological systems.

Organisms not only derive their energy supply from the process of
photosynthesis, but also use signals from sunlight to regulate and con-
trol their rates of growth and development. Most of these ‘“‘regulatory”’
responses use short-duration or low-energy light signals in contrast to
photosynthesis, in which large amounts of energy are captured and
stored.

The research of the Radiation Biology Laboratory (RBL) is directed
toward understanding the cellular and subcellular mechanisms and
processes by which organisms utilize radiant energy from the sun for
their growth and development. This research has been directed into
four main areas: (1) Regulatory biology—physiology of developmental
responses to light; (2) regulatory biology—biochemical processes of
developmental responses to light; (3) measurement of solar radiation;
and (4) carbon dating—measurements and research techniques.

Regulatory Biology—Physiology

Growing cells of the moss Physcomitrium turbinatum utilize light signals
for regulating their growth rate as well as orienting the direction of
their growth axis. These moss cells are a potentially important tool for

183
184 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

studying the mechanism by which light controls growth because single
cells can be examined and their responses measured.

Detailed action spectra, the determination of the relative sensitivity
of different quality light stimuli, for both growth and oriented growth
responses have been measured. Such action spectra measurements
provide information about the nature of the pigments present which
absorb light stimuli and regulate growth. For red wavelengths the
growth action spectrum matches closely the zn vivo absorption spectrum
of a single moss filament. A major peak at 680 nanometer (nm) and a
shoulder at 640 nm are characteristic of absorption by chlorophyll.
For blue wavelengths, however, where there is appreciable chlorophyll
absorption, there is no photogrowth response.

Moss cells of Physcomitrium also exhibit a positive directional photo-
orientation. An action spectrum determined by a null balancing method
in which a filament grew between two light sources and indicated the
relative effectiveness of the two beams, indicated maximum effectiveness
in the far-red at 730 nm with a broad region of effectiveness extending
from 600 to 800 nm. A significant fact is that the shape of the action
spectrum determined for photo-orientation depends upon the quality
of light being used as a reference beam. This fact suggests that probably
two pigment systems are being utilized by the moss cells to regulate
growth. It is postulated at present that these two pigment systems are
chlorophyll and phytochrome which interact to regulate both growth
and photo-orientation of growth.

Pollen from higher plants can be germinated and grown under
laboratory conditions and the elongation rate of the pollen tube as
well as mitosis of the tube nucleus can be measured. The effect of
light on the elongation growth of pollen tubes has not been studied
previously. Pollen of flowering plants has an advantage for the study
of light-controlled growth in that it is a one-celled structure which
does not show the presence of a chloroplast or chlorophyll. Thus, it is
a favorable material for the study of phytochrome-mediated responses
without the complication of photosynthesis of chlorophyll-mediated
responses. Pollen tubes grown on lactose-agar medium were exposed to
red and far-red monochromatic irradiation. Growth measured after 3, 4,
and 6 hours and compared to controls kept in the dark indicated that
both red and far-red stimulate growth elongation, and that far-red was
more effective in stimulating growth (dark 131 +34 yw; red 196+36 yu;
far-red 308+ 59 uw in 4 hours).

Seeds of higher plants are also known to be sensitive to red and
far-red light in controlling their germination. Some seeds require a
red-light exposure before they will begin to grow even if all other
environmental conditions are favorable for growth. This light sensi-
RADIATION BIOLOGY LABORATORY 185

tivity for germination is apparently determined by the relative amounts
of red and far-red in the light to which the maturing seeds are exposed.
Seeds of the mustard Arabidopsis thaliana have been grown to maturity
under rigidly controlled environmental conditions exposed to either
fluorescent lamps alone or fluorescent plus incandescent white lamps.
Seeds grown under fluorescent lamps (relatively rich in red energy)
appear to lose much of their light requirement and as high as 40%
germinate in the dark; however, seeds matured under fluorescent plus
incandescent lamps (rich in far-red) do not germinate in the dark for
long periods of time. Similarly, it has been found that there is also a
quantitative difference in light sensitivity in which much more energy
is required to produce germination in fluorescent-grown seeds than in
fluorescent- plus incandescent-grown seeds. The relative amounts of
the two absorbing forms of phytochrome in the mature seeds are indi-
cated as the controlling mechanism, and experiments are continuing
to determine the effects of temperature, photoperiod, spectral quality
and time of after-ripening upon the subsequent light sensitivity of the
seeds.

Regulatory Biology—Biochemistry

The influence of light on phosphate uptake and incorporation in
corn leaves was studied. Corn-leaf sections 2 cm. long grow and unroll
when floated on aqueous solutions and exposed to red light. Radio-
active phosphate can be added to these solutions and the incorporation
of phosphate can be measured and compared with the physiological
growth responses controlled by red light. Organic phosphate determined
by colorimetric methods and P*® counted electronically, for irradiated
compared to dark sections, gave ratios of 1.03-+0.16 for organic phos-
phate and 1.04+0.11 for P%*. Several factors which might influence
the uptake and incorporation rates were tested. Among these variables
were the developmental stages of the corn seedlings employed, hydra-
tion status of the excised leaf segments prior to irradiation, and amend-
ments to the H;P%*O, solution including buffers, various salts, and
sugars. No significant differences between irradiated and control plants
were found and the average ratio (irradiation/control) for all experi-
ments was 0.99+0.14. It is concluded that at the present time no
significant effects of light on phosphate uptake and incorporation can
be demonstrated.

Chloroplast development and differentiation can be controlled by
light and offers a good in vitro system for studying the mechanisms
by which differentiation occurs. Chloroplasts from developing bean
leaves incorporate the radioactively labeled amino acid leucine into
186 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

protein. During the past year it has been found that at the end of a
one-hour incorporation period, half the radioactive protein formed is
in a soluble fraction (100,000 * g for 60 minutes) and half is sedi-
mented as an insoluble fraction. Only a small portion of the radio-
activity in the insoluble fraction is sedimented with free ribosomes
(30,000 to 100,000 X g for 60 minutes) while 75% can be sedimented
at 6,000 X g for 30 minutes. Repeated washing with water removes
only a portion of the radioactivity in the 6,000 X g fraction. The
radioactivity remaining is associated with chlorophyll when centri-
fuged in a sucrose density gradient. Also, the addition of unlabeled
leucine to chloroplasts incorporating labeled leucine, followed by
continued incubation under incorporation conditions does not remove
radioactivity already incorporated into either the soluble or insoluble
fraction. It is concluded that the zn vitro protein synthesizing system
is producing both soluble and lamellar chloroplast proteins. The data
also suggest the existence of two separate incorporation sites since the
soluble fraction does not act as precursor for the insoluble fraction
and vice versa.

Isolation and chemical characterization of pure phytochrome from
dark-grown rye seedlings has continued, and improved yields and
more reproducible extraction methods have been developed. The
question of how many species of phytochrome subunits are present
was resolved by fingerprinting the peptides released by trypsin; 34 to
41 peptides were released. Amino acid analysis indicated that phyto-
chrome contained 100 trypsin-sensitive bonds per 100,000 molecular
weight units. Thus the chemical molecular weight of the subunit is
34,000 to 41,000. This is in good agreement with the physical molecular
weight, 36,000, which was determined by high-speed equilibrium

Electron micrographs of bean chloroplast as it appears (top) when pieces of
leaf are fixed and (middle) when a preparation of freshly isolated chloroplast
is fixed. Freshly isolated chloroplasts such as this are used to study chloroplast
protein synthesis. In these preparations the chloroplasts appear the same as
those from intact leaves, except that they are slightly swollen. Protein synthesis
by these chloroplasts is not prevented by an enzyme which degrades ribonucleic
acid.

Fragments (bottom) of two chloroplasts from a preparation of isolated chloro-
plasts which has been incubated at 25° C. for 1 hour before they were fixed
show severe disruption when compared with chloroplasts in leaves, or with
freshly isolated chloroplasts. Protein synthesis by these disrupted chloroplasts
is prevented by an enzyme which degrades ribonucleic acid.

centrifugation of the ultimate subunit. Thus, only one species of phyto-
chrome subunit exists in the aggregate which was isolated. If two or
more subunits existed then a multiple of 36 peptides would be expected.

Flectron microscopic examinations of pure phytochrome which had
been prepared for examination in white light gave variable results.
In some cases fibers and large symmetrical aggregates were observed.
In other cases small five-membered rings of subparticles 20 angstroms
in diameter could be observed. When phytochrome was prepared
under green plus far-red light none of the five-membered small aggre-
gates could be observed. If an aliquot of the same phytochrome solution
was treated with red light, immediately before preparation for micro-
scopy, many of the small five-membered aggregates could be seen.
A tentative aggregation hypothesis has been constructed to explain
these results. In the postulated system the subunit has a molecular
weight of 36,000 and aggregates into pentamers of 180,000 m.w. These,
in turn, aggregate into tetramers (m.w. approx. 800,000) consisting of
20 subunits.

Many biological responses require a time-measuring system and it
has been postulated that the dark reversion of the far-red absorbing
form of phytochrome to the red absorbing form might be such a time-
measuring device. For this reason the kinetics of the dark reversion of
pure rye phytochrome zn vitro have been studied. The absorption
spectra of solutions initially in the far-red absorbing form were measured
after various periods of time in the dark. The temperature was main-
tained at 25° C. and the pH at 7.5 to 7.9, while in the presence of
sodium chloride at concentrations of 0.005 to 0.5 M, and in the presence
of air. Within one hour 50% of the maximum red absorption at 660 nm
which could be obtained by driving the system with far-red irradiation,
had reappeared, with a concomitant loss in the absorption at the
far-red maximum (730 nm). The kinetics of this dark reversion suggest
a system more complex than a first-order reaction.

Solar Radiation Measurements

Measurements of total sun and sky short-wave radiation have
continued, using an automatic system sampling once every 3 minutes
for 100-nm bandwidths from 0.29 to 2.5 yw. Six new detectors, modified
pyranometers, with an internal electrical heating current for calibra-
tion, have been constructed and installed, along with new amplifiers.
Data for daily and seasonal fluctuations of radiant energy are being
collected with this system that are correct to +1% for the six 100-nm
spectral bands being monitored. The sensitivity of the system has
been increased to 0.01 Langley/minute.
James E. Mielke (left) and Austin Long collecting water samples at Tuborg
Lake on Ellesmere Island. Knudsen bottles are lowered with the hand winch
through an 8-inch-diameter hole in the ice to the sampling depth, a messenger
dropped along the line closes the bottle, and the sample is drawn up. At
least 20 liters are collected from each depth.

Correlative studies of plant growth are being made with several
day-length sensitive plants in the greenhouse and control environment
rooms. Responses occur in both vegetative and floral structures (such
as internode length, pod formation, tillering or floral development)
as a function of the direction of changing day length and the relative
red to far-red energies present.

Day neutral plants such as the Black Valentine bean, exhibit little
sensitivity to red to far-red ratios under the experimental conditions
employed. Flowering occurs in all three growth areas. Internode
development appears to be sensitive to day length, in that the lower
internodes are inversely related to the length of day, whereas the
upper internodes are directly related to day length.

In long-day plants such as Wintex barley, there appears to be a
high degree of sensitivity to both red to far-red ratios, as well as to the
direction of the changing day length. Tiller formation is comparable
in all three growth areas. Node development and its associated floral
maturation, however, are to be found only in those areas where there
is an appreciable amount of far-red present. Floral maturation decreases
very rapidly in these two areas as the day length diminishes.
190 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

Carbon Dating

The carbon-dating section of the laboratory has continued to provide
age determinations of samples submitted. During the past year approxi-
mately 80 samples were dated.

Field studies were made on Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories,
to determine the age of trapped seawater at the bottom of Lake
Tuborg. Lake Tuborg, at the head of Greely Fiord, was formed when
a glacier advanced across the fiord. At present, water of about 25 parts
per million salinity lies in the bottom 60 meters while the upper 60
meters is fresh water. Temperature and salinity profiles indicate no
complete mixing since the time of lake formation. Carbon-14/carbon-12
and carbon-13/carbon-12 ratios from analyses on dissolved bicarbonate
from the lake and from a nearby fiord indicate that the salt water in
the bottom of the lake has been trapped there for about 3,000 years.

Staff Activities

David L. Correll attended, as delegate, the Antarctic Oceanography
Symposium in Santiago, Chile, in September 1966.

During September and October 1966, William H. Klein was one of
the eight lecturers at the five-day Solar Radiation Symposium at the
Nationa! Physical Laboratory in Jerusalem, Israel, where he presented
the paper, ‘‘Variation in Spectral Quality of Solar Radiation and
Biological Responses,’ and discussed with Harry Z. Tabor, and
officials of Hebrew University, the feasibility of setting up a solar radia-
tion station in Israel to measure the spectral quality of daylight.

At the Biology Department, Western Reserve University, Cleveland,
Ohio, in March 1967, Maurice M. Margulies gave a seminar, ‘“‘Amino
Acid Incorporation into Protein by Developing Chloroplasts.”

At the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists
in Columbia, South Carolina, in April 1967, Te-Hsiu Ma presented
a paper, “The Red and Far-red Light Effects on the Pollen-tube
Elongation and Pollen Germination in Tradescantia.”’

In May 1967, Bernard J. Nebel and David L. Correll participated
in the Symposium “Growth and Development—Form and Function”
that officially opened the new Michigan State University — Atomic
Energy Commission Plant Research Laboratory at East Lansing,
Michigan.

Several visiting scientists were invited to present current results of
their work. These included:

N. K. Boardman, Division of Plant Industry, C.S.I.R.O., Canberra,
Australia, was invited to come to Washington in October to consult
RADIATION BIOLOGY LABORATORY 19]

with Margulies and to give a seminar on ““The Photochemical Systems
of Photosynthesis’.

David Dennison, Department of Biology, Dartmouth College, Han-
over, New Hampshire, was invited to consult in February 1967 with
the research staff of RBL and provide information for a bibliographic
search of Phycomyces research.

Donald S. Berns, Division of Laboratories and Research, New York
State Department of Health, Albany, New York, was invited to Wash-
ington to present a seminar on phycobiliproteins in cooperation with
the Washington area section of Plant Physiologists.

W. Shropshire assisted with a summer workshop on photobiology
at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology during
June.

A significant teaching venture was initiated in cooperation with the
Consortium of Washington Area Universities. A series of 13 lectures
in photobiology was presented for which seminar credit was given to
students. Approximately 200 persons attended each lecture. The
speakers and their topics were:

Orientation— What is Photobiology?, W. Shropshire, Radiation Biology
Laboratory, Smithsonian Institution.

The Molecular Basis of Human Vision, George Wald, The Biological
Laboratories, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Comparative Structure of Photoreceptors, Jerome J. Wolken, Biophysical
Research Laboratory, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

The Vertebrate Eye, George K. Smelser, College of Physicians and Sur-
geons, Columbia University, New York, New York.

Information Flow in Photoreceptors, W. A. Hagins, Laboratory of Physical
Biology, National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases,
Bethesda, Maryland.

The Daily Photopertod in the Control of Annual Cycles in Animals, Donald
S. Farner, Department of Zoology, University of Washington,
Seattle, Washington.

Photoperiodism—FPlants, Sterling Hendricks, Mineral Nutrition Labora-
tory, United States Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland

The Photoreceptor Process in Lower Animals, Timothy Goldsmith, Depart-
ment of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.

Phototaxis in Microbes, Roderick Clayton, Section of Genetics, Develop-
ment and Physiology, Division of Biological Sciences, Cornell
University, Ithaca, New York.

Phototropism, George Curry, Department of Biology, Tufts University,
Medford, Massachusetts.
192 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1967

The Molecular Basis of Ultraviolet Inactivation and Photoreactivation, Jane
K. Setlow, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

The Energy Conversion Process in Photosynthesis, Daniel 1. Arnon, Depart-
ment of Cell Physiology, University of California, Berkeley, California.

Evolution of Photoreceptors, Richard M. Eakin, Department of Zoology,
University of California, Berkeley, California.

A 30-minute color TV film, ‘“‘Secrets of Life,’ describing the re-
search activities of the laboratory was prepared by the RBL staff and
Craig Fisher of NBC. The film was shown nationally several times and
has resulted in many requests from interested students about the field
of photobiology.

Scientists who joined the staff during the year are Dr. Elisabeth
Gantt, biologist, from Dartmouth Medical School, who will work on
membrane and pigment structure of algae. Chemist Vicente Julio
Medina, postdoctoral student from the University of Georgia, joined
the laboratory in January to work on light effects on nucleic acid and
nucleotide metabolism. Dr. Francesco Parenti, visiting postdoctoral
from the University of Milano, Italy, continued his work on protein
synthesis in chloroplasts this year. Director William H. Klein was
detailed to the Biology Branch of the United States Atomic Energy
Commission for one year beginning September |. During his absence,
Walter Shropshire was Acting Director.
