ENR OD UC ELON.

The influence of Doctor George Brown Goode on the growth and
character of the United States National Museum was profound, and it
extended to museum development in all parts of the world. It is
desirable that an account of his life and services should appear, together
with reprints of his valuable papers on American science and public
museums, as well as several on related subjects that have never been
published, in this portion of the Smithsonian report devoted to the work
of the National Museum. Most of these papers appeared originally in
publications not easily accessible to students, and all reprints have long
since been distributed.

GEORGE BROWN GOODE.

Every student of nature the world over has profited by the work of
Doctor Goode. Everyone interested in the advancement of science and
in the development of museums as the graphic representatives of history
and science has been and will be encouraged and assisted because he lived
aud worked. Every person can emulate his example of right living and
honest service with gain individually and as a member of the community
and of the body politic, and every Virginian can point with pride to the
fact that Doctor Goode’s ancestors were from that historic State.

Personally I knew him as the man of science, the museum adminis-
trator, the patriot, the valued adviser, and the loyal friend. ‘Two years
have passed since his death, and I feel the personal and public loss more
and more. No one has come to take his place in many of the fields of
his activity. Science, and particularly Government scientific institutions,
will long miss the wholesome influence that he exerted on the minds of
scientific and public men. But all that could be said by me has been
spoken by those whose tributes follow. We loved the man, and we cherish
his memory in secret thought and honor it in the written words of this
memorial volume.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

By GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD,
President of the Joint Commission of the Scientific Societies.

This day was selected as the day to pay tribute to Doctor G. Brown
Goode, as it is his natal day. On my return to Boston from the maritime
provinces last summer, I heard with deep regret of the death, a few days
before, of Doctor George Brown Goode. ‘To me he had been a friend;
to me his death was a deep personal loss and sorrow. ‘To him I have
turned for counsel, for advice, for sympathy, and his response was
prompt, earnest, and cordial. Do I not express the feeling of all who
knew him? Never was there a truer and more intelligent counselor, a
more sympathetic friend, a more ready helper, a more kindly nature.

None knew him but to love him,
None named him but to praise.

It was at Twin Oaks, one of the last Sundays in June, that he spent
the last morning with us. He walked with us through the grounds’
twining ways, pointing out the beauties of the flowers, which he was so
quick to see, and showing a knowledge of the habits and needs of every
tree and shrub. He passed through the grounds to the library and
looked over a portfolio of recent Japanese prints. He showed a perfect
familiarity with them, selecting the good, rejecting the poor, and know-
ing the value of each. With books he was equally familiar, and more
than once suggested some rare book that I should like to obtain. Books
were his friends and companions. His reading was extensive and varied.
He knew my pedigree better than I, and corrected mistakes that I had
made in preparing my genealogy for the Society of Colonial Wars, in
which organization he was deeply interested. His mind was versatile,
his interests widespread, his tastes refined, his judgment correct. He
was a true lover of nature, of art, of beauty everywhere. He heralded
to us the first coming of the birds, he knew their notes, and welcomed
the opening of the spring blossoms. He was alive to every bit of earth
andsky. With all the pressure of numerous and varied cares and respon-
sibilities, he lent a ready ear, a helping hand, to all who asked his aid.
He would read and correct a manuscript for a friend, conduct another

through the Museum and open to him its treasures, or prepare a scheme
for an exposition at Chicago or Atlanta. Into the work of the Museum
he threw his whole heart and life. He knew it in all its strength
and weakness, its deficiencies, its wealth, its possibilities, and therefore
believed in its glorious future. He knew it in all its different depart-
ments—in its minute details. He welcomed every new object that was
brought into the Museum and directed its disposition. He refused the
appointment of Commissioner of Fisheries and remained in charge of the
Museum at a smaller salary, because he felt his services were more needed
there. He was urged last summer to go to the Seal Islands, a trip he
would gladly have taken, but he was reluctant to leave his work. He
remained to die at his post. ,

Others will speak of him in his public relations; others can estimate
his scientific attainments and the debt of gratitude the Museum owes to
his faithful and skillful administration; others will weave and lay upon
his tomb wreaths and garlands. I bring but a few violets, the expres-
sion of my personal love and esteem. He was a friend whom I loved
and whom I miss from my daily life.
OPENING ADDRESS.

By SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

While I am aware that it is only fitting that I should say something
here about one I knew so well as the late Doctor Goode, I feel the occa-
sion a trying one, for he was so dear a friend that my very nearness and
sense of a special bereavement must be a sufficient excuse for asking
your indulgence, since I can not speak of him even yet without pain,
and I must say but little.

Here are some who knew him still longer than I, and many who can
estimate him more justly in all his scientific work, and to those who can
perform this task so much better, I leave it. I will only try to speak,
however briefly,. from a personal point of view, and chiefly of those
moral qualities in which our friendship grew, and of some things apart
from his scientific life which this near friendship showed me.

As I first remember him it seems to me, looking back in the light of
more recent knowledge, that it was these moral qualities which I first
appreciated, and that if there was one which more than another formed the
basis of his character it was sincerity—a sincerity which was the ground
of a trust and confidence such as could be instinctively given, even
from the first, only to an absolutely loyal and truthful nature. In him
duplicity of motive even, seemed hardly possible, for, though he was in
a good sense, worldly wise, he walked by a single inner light, and this
made his road clear even when he was going over obscure ways, and
made him often a safer guide than such wisdom alone would have done.
He was, I repeat, aman whom you first trusted instinctively, but also one
in whom every added knowledge explained and justified this confidence.

This sincerity, which pervaded the whole character, was united with
an unselfishness so deep-seated that it was not conscious of itself, and
was, perhaps, not always recognized by others. It is asubject of regret
to me, now it is too late, that I seem myself to have thus taken it too
much as a matter of course in the past, at times like one I remember,
when, as I afterwards learned, he was suffering from wretched health,
which he concealed so successfully while devoting himself to my help,
that I had no suspicion till long after of the effort this must have cost

him. He lived not for himself, but for others and for his work. There
was no occasion when he could not find time for any call to aid, and the
Museum was something to which he was willing to give of his own
slender means.

Connected with this was an absence of any wish to personally domi-
nate others or to force his own personal ways upon them. It is pleas-
antest to live our own life if we can, and with him every associate and
subordinate had a moral liberty that is not always enjoyed, for apart from
his official duties, he obtruded himself upon no one with advice, and his
private opinion was to be sought, not proffered.

His insight into character was notable, and:it was perhaps due as
much as anything to a power of sympathy that produced a gentleness in
his private judgment of others, which reminded one of the saying, that if
we could comprehend everything we could pardon everything. He com-
prehended and he pardoned.

Associate this tolerance of those weaknesses in others, even which he
did not share, with the confidence he inspired and with this clear insight,
and we have some idea of the moral qualities which tempered the
authority he exercised in his administrative work, and which were the
underlying causes of his administrative excellence. I do not know
whether a power of reading character is more intuitive or acquired; at
any rate without it men may be governed, but not in harmony, and must
be driven rather than led. Doctor Goode was in this sense a leader,
quite apart from his scientific competence. Every member of the force
he controlled, not only among his scientific associates, but down to the
humblest employees of the Museum, was an individual to him, with
traits of character which were his own and not another’s, and which were
recognized in all dealings. And in this I think he was peculiar, for I
have known no man who seemed to possess this sympathetic insight in
such a degree; and certainly it was one of the sources of his strength.

I shall have given, however, a wrong idea of him if I leave anyone
under the impression that this sympathy led to weakness of rule. He
knew how to say ‘‘no,’’ and said it as often as any other, and would
reprehend where occasion called, in terms the plainest and most uncom-
promising a man could use, speaking so when he thought it necessary,
even to those whose association was voluntary, but who somehow were
not alienated, as they would have been by such censure from another.
‘He often refused me what I most wanted,” said one of his staff to me,
“Dut Inever went to sleep without having in my own mind forgiven him.”

I have spoken of some of the moral qualities which made all rely upon
him, and which were the foundation of his ability to deal with men. T'o
them was joined that scientific knowledge without which he could not
have been a Museum administrator, but even with this knowledge he
could not have been what he was, except from the fact that he loved the
Museum and its administration above every other pursuit, even, I think,
Memorval Meeting. 9

above his own special branch of biological science. He was a man of
the widest interests I have ever known, so that whatever he was speak-
ing of at any moment, seemed to be the thing he knew best. It was
often hard to say, then, what love predominated; but I think that he had,
on the whole, no pleasure greater than that in his Museum administra-
tion, and that, apart from his family interests and joys, this was the
deepest love of all. He refused advantageous offers to leave it, though I
ought to gratefully add here, that his knowledge of my reliance upon
lim and his unselfish desire to aid me, were also among his determining
motives in remaining. ‘They were natural ones in such a man.

What were the results of this devotion may be comprehensively seen
in the statement that in the year in which he was first enrolled among
the officers of the Museum the entries of collections numbered less than
200,000, and the staff, including honorary collaborators and all subordi-
nates, thirteen persons, and by comparing these early conditions with
what they became under his subsequent management.

Professor Baird at the first was an active manager, but from the time
that he became Secretary of the Institution he devolved more and more
of the Museum duties on Doctor Goode, who for nine years preceding
his death was practically in entire charge of it. It is strictly within the
truth then to say that the changes which have taken place in the Museum
in that time are more his work than any other man’s, and when we find
that the number of persons employed has grown from thirteen to over
two hundred, and the number of specimens from 200,000 to over
3,000,000, and consider that what the Museum now is, its scheme and
arrangement, with almost all which make it distinctive; are chiefly
Doctor Goode’s, we have some of the evidence of his administrative
capacity. He was fitted to rule and administer both men and things,
and the Museum under his management was, as someone has called it,
‘“A house full of ideas and a nursery of living thought.’’

Perhaps no one can be a ‘“‘naturalist,’’ in the larger sense, without
being directly a lover of Nature and of all natural sights and sounds.
One of his family says:

He taught us all the forest trees, their fruits and flowers in season, and to know
them when bare of leaves by their shapes; all the wayside shrubs, and even the flow-
ers of the weeds; all the wild birds and their notes, and the insects. His ideal of an
old age was to have a little place of his own ina mild climate, surrounded by his
books for rainy days, and friends who cared for plain living and high thinking, with
a chance to help someone poorer than he.

He was a loving and quick observer, and in these simple natural joys
his studies were his recreations, and were closely connected with his
literary pursuits.

I have spoken of his varied interests and the singular fullness of his
knowledge in fields apart from biologic research. He was a genealogist
of professional completeness and exactitude, and a historian, and of him in
10 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

these capacities alone, a biography might be written; but his well-founded
claim to be considered a literary man as well as a man of science, rests as
much on the excellent English style; clear, direct, unpretentious, in which
he has treated these subjects, as on his love of literature in general. I
pass them, however, with this inadequate mention, from my incompetence
to deal with him as a genealogist, and because his aspect as a historian
will be presented by another; but while I could only partly follow him
in his genealogical studies, we had together, among other common tastes,
that love of general literature just spoken of, and I, who have been a
widely discursive reader, have never met a mind in touch with more far-
away and disconnected points than his, nor one of more breadth and
variety of reading, outside of the range of its own specialty. ‘This read-
ing was also, however, associated with a love of everything which could
illustrate his special science on this literary side. The extent of this
illustration is well shown by the wealth and aptness of quotation in the
chapter headings of his American Fishes, his Game Fishes of North
America, and the like, and in his knowledge of everything thus
remotely connected with his ichthyologic researches, from St. Anthony’s
Sermon to Fishes, to the Literature of Fish Cookery, while in one of his
earliest papers, written at nineteen, his fondness for Isaac Walton and
his familiarity with him, are evident. He hada love for everything to do
with books, such as specimens of printing and binding, and for etchings
and engravings, and he was an omnivorous reader, but he read to collect,
and oftenest in connection with the enjoyment of his outdoor life and all
natural things. One of these unpublished collections, The Music of
Nature, contains literally thousands of illustrated poems or passages
from his favorite poets.

These were his recreations, and among these little excursions into
literature, ‘‘the most pathetic, and yet in some respects the most con-
solatory,’’ says his literary executor, ‘‘seems to have been suggested
by an article on the literary advantages of weak health, for with this
thought in mind he had collected from various sources accounts of literary
work done in feeble health, which he brought together under the title
Mens Sana in Corpore /zsano.’’

Still another collection was of poems relating to music, of which he was
an enthusiastic lover. He sang and played well, but this I only learned
after his death, for it was characteristic of his utter absence of display, that
during our nine years’ intimacy he never let me know that he had such
accomplishments; though that he had a large acquaintance with musical
instruments I was, of course, aware from the collections he had made.

We must think of him with added sympathy, when we know that he
lost the robust health he once enjoyed, at that early time during his first
connection with the Museum, when he gave himself with such uncalcu-
lating devotion to his work as to overtask every energy and permanently
impair his strength. It was only imperfectly restored when his excessive
Memorial Meeting. Lr

labors in connection with the Centennial Exposition brought on another
attack, and this condition was renewed at times through my acquaintance
with him. When we see what he has done, we must remember, with now
useless regret, under what conditions all this was accomplished.

I have scarcely alluded to his family life, for of his home we are not to
speak here, further than to say that he was eminently a domestic man,
finding the highest joys that life brought him with his family and children.
Of those who hear me to-night most knew him personally, and will bear
me witness, from his daily life, that he was a man one felt to be pure in
heart as he was clean of speech, always sociable, always considerate of
his associates, a most suggestive and helpful man; an eminently unselfish
man—may I not now say that he was what we then did not recognize, in
his simplicity, a gveat man?

It isa proof [says one who knew him] of the unconsciousness and unobstrusive-
ness which chracterized Doctor Goode in all his associations and efforts that, until
his death came, few, if any, even of his intimate friends, realized the degree to
which he had become necessary to them. All acknoweledged his ability, relied on
his sincerity, knew how loyally he served every cause he undertook. ‘The news of
his death showed them for the first time what an element of strength he was in the
work and ambitions of each of them. With a sudden shock they saw that their
futures would have less of opportunity, less of enthusiasm and meaning, now that
he was gone.

He has gone; and on the road where we are all going, there has not
preceded us a man who lived more for others, a truer man, a more loyal
friend.

GOODE AS A HISTORIAN AND CITIZEN.

By WILLIAM LYNE WILSON,
Postmaster-General of the United States.

It has been most appropriately assigned to those who saw, and were
privileged to see, more of Doctor Goode than myself, in his domestic life
and in daily official intercourse, to speak of his virtues and his most
charming and lofty traits as a man; and to speak of him in his chosen
field of science must be assigned to those who do not, like myself, stand
outside of the pale of scientific attainment. The somewhat humbler part
is mine to speak of Doctor Goode in those relations in life in which he
was probably less known and less thought of than as a man of science or
in other fields of his distinguished attainment.

The German professor, of whom it is related that on his deathbed he
mourned the waste of his life work in expending his energies on the
entire Greek language instead of concentrating them on the dative case,
gives a ludicrous and extreme illustration of that necessity for division
of labor and of specialization which all men recognize in this age of
ours. In the field of intellectual, as in that of mechanical, occupation,
the ‘‘jack-of-all-trades’’ is master of none; and while the rule for the
intellectual man and for the great student must always be to endeavor
to know everything of something and something of everything—at least
of everything connected with that something—it is becoming more and
more difficult in the compass of human life and human attainment to
live up to that rule.

Doctor Goode was honored in his own country and in other countries
as an eminent man of science, and deservedly so honored, and his lasting
fame must rest upon his solid and substantial contributions to science
and the advancement of human knowledge, on his eminent success as an
administrator of scientific organizations, and on that work which all his
life shows to have been most congenial to him—the bringing of science
down to the interest and instruction of the people.

He was a richly endowed man, first with that capacity and that
resistless bent toward the work in which he attained his great distinction
that made it a perennial delight to him; but he was scarcely less richly

13
14 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

endowed in his more unpretending and large human sympathies, and it
was this latter that distinguished him as a citizen and a historian.

It has been said time and again, with more or less truth, of the great
English universities, and possibly of similar great schools in our own
country, that they tend to make a caste, and that men who come out
from them find themselves separated from the great mass of their fellow-
citizens, out of sympathy with the thought, the action, and the daily life
of the generation in which they move. ‘This certainly could never be
said of Doctor Goode. As a citizen he was full of patriotic American
enthusiasm. He understood, as all must understand who look with
seriousness upon the great problems that confront a free people and who
measure the difficulties of those problems—he understood that at least
one preparation for the discharge of the duties of American citizenship
was the general education of the people, and so he advocated as far as
possible bringing within the reach of all the people not only the oppor-
tunities but the attractions and the incitements to intellectual living.
It was one of his favorite ideas that there should be in every town,
and even in the villages of the country, at least some sort of a library,
at least some sort of a reading room, at least some sort of a museum,
to quicken and generate the intellectual life of that community, and
possibly to stimulate men to the high career which he and others like
him have been stimulated to from such beginnings.

But Doctor Goode knew also that mere education—literary or scien-
tific—whatever it might do for the individual, however much of power
or distinction it might give to him, and however much of personal enjoy-
ment and luxury it might bring to him, is not the only thing required to
make an American citizen, and I am satisfied that the work which he
did in the field of American history was connected, closely connected,
with this general idea. It is not only that we have free institutions in
this country, it is not only that we have universal education, at least
within the reach of the people of this country; we have as our chief reli-
ance for success in the future, as it has been our chief safety in the past,
the rich political heritage of hundreds of years’ training in these institu-

tions, and Doctor Goode, with the quick and warm sympathies of the
man and of the historian, seems to have felt that he could do no greater
service to the people of his day and generation and to his country than
in the most attractive and concrete way (if I may so express it) to lead
the young men of this country to the study of the history of the past—
to the deeds and the writings of the great men to whom we owe the
foundation and the perpetuation of our institutions. "This was probably
somewhat the result of his personal sympathies, feeling that what
influenced him would influence others, and it was a wise and proper
conclusion.

The study of the past, the study of the lives of those who have been
eminent and useful men in the past, is a potent influence on high, intel-
Memortal Meeting. eas

ligent, patriotic effort in the present. The xoblesse oblige of a patriotic
and substantial ancestry, not only for the individual but for the country
itself, is a power whose influence we can scarcely exaggerate. I have
thought, as I have visited the great universities of Kngland and seen in
their common halls, where once a day the students meet to partake of
one meal at least in common, as upon their walls I have seen in living
canvas the portraits of the great men of their special colleges—of Isaac
Barron, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and all the English bishops at
Trinity—and each exhibiting groups of those who have risen to useful-
ness and done great deeds in literature, in science, in public life, in war,
or in any of the elements and fields of English greatness, that there was
a mute appeal to every Englishman from those walls to be worthy of his
country and of his college.

It must have been something of this idea that induced the old Roman
to place in the entrance to his house the efiigies of every member of his
family who had borne a high office in the state. As his son came in and
out of that house, he passed between effigies, as lifelike as Roman art
could make them, of every member of that family who had held a high
office, or magistracy, in the Roman commonwealth. He was stimulated
to patriotism by the examples of his fathers—of those who had led
armies, of those who had extended the limits of the empire, of those
who had triumphed on returning from foreign fields of conquest and vic-
tory, of those whose names were revered in the annals of his country—

and so it must have been, consciously or unconsciously, some feeling of
this kind that seems almost from Doctor Goode’s youth to have led him
into the field of genealogical inquiry and study, led him into the field of
historic study, grouping his studies, as he seems to have done, around
great and inspiring characters.

Perhaps no family in this country has had so perfect a book, so com-
plete a study of all of its branches, as Doctor Goode gave to the family
whose name he bore in that book entitled Virginia Cousins, and it is
especially gratifying to me to know that Virginia history, so much
neglected, was perhaps the favorite field of Doctor Goode’s study and
investigation. He was a student of the writings of Washington, and
gathered all the material he could find about that great Virginian. He
was a student of the writings of Jefferson; he was a student of the lives
of other distinguished men of that old Commonwealth, and I am told
that he had in contemplation the publication of a book to be called
Virginia Worthies, in which doubtless he would have tried to give
the proper standing to that minor and second class of Virginia’s great
men of whom the country at large knows so much less to-day than it
ought to know.

Not only, however, in the study of the men and the history of the
Commonwealth from which in one line of his ancestry he was sprung
was Doctor Goode a student. He was a student of American history at
16 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

large. He was one of the Council of the American Historical Associa-
tion, and it was particularly through his efforts that the connection
between that association and the Smithsonian Institution was brought
about. He was one of the organizers here but a few months ago of the
Southern History Association, and took great interest in the work that
is projected by it. He was connected with the great organizations, the
Sons of the American Revolution and the Sons of the Revolution, presi-
dent of the first and vice-president of the other, and not as a mere office-
holder, not as a mere member, but as a zealous, enthusiastic, intelligent
worker.

But Doctor Goode was not only a historian in this respect and in
this peculiar way. He was also a historian of science, and he seems here
likewise to have followed the same general idea of grouping scientific
history—the history of scientific progress—around the particular men
and individuals connected with that progress.

Iam assured by those who are more capable of speaking authoritatively
on such a subject than I am, that in certain papers of his, partly pub-
lished, and partly as yet unpublished, he has given us the most interest-
ing and instructive history yet produced of the progress of science in the
United States; so that it is not attributing to Doctor Goode a novel and
undeserved character to speak of him to-night as a historian. Had his
life been spared, in his peculiar way, in his own personal and attractive
manner, he would doubtless have made most substantial contributions to
the study of American history, and I can not doubt, as I have already
said, that in doing this he was impelled by the patriotic idea that he was
helping to build up a strong American intelligent citizenship in the
country he loved so well.
GOODE AS A NATURALIST.

By HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN,
DaCosta Professor of Zoology, Columbia University.

The designation ‘‘naturalist’’ was one which Goode richly earned and
which he held most dear, and our deep sorrow is that his activity as a
naturalist extended only over a quarter of a century. We are cheered
by the thought that he was a man of whom no adverse word can ever be
spoken either in science or in character. We think of both at this time,
because in him the man and the profession were inseparable and con-
stantly interacting. His scientific virtues were of the order rare as the
Christian virtues, and we can not thoroughly understand his scientific
career unless we understand him as a man. Errors of judgment, mis-
leading tenets, and adherence to false hypotheses among some of the
most gifted of our professional ancestors have arisen as often from defect
of principle and from personal prejudices as from defect of knowledge.
We see in our friend, on the other hand, that the high standard of scien-
tific achievement was constantly parallel with and very largely the out-
growth of a high standard of personal character and motive.

In brief, the work of the true naturalist is ever lighted by the four
lamps, of love, of truth, of breadth, and of appreciation, and all of these
shone brightly upon the path of Goode. His love of nature was inborn,
predetermining his career, and so far surpassing his self-interest we fear
it is only too true that he sacrificed his life for the diffusion of natural
truth. So far as I know, he never entered a scientific controversy and
was never under temptation to warp or deflect facts to support an
hypothesis; yet he was incapable of tampering with truth under any
circumstances which might have arisen. His presidential address of 1887
before the Biological Society of Washington showed him as scrupulous not
to overestimate as he was eager not to underestimate the existing status
of American science. While largely cultivated by wide experience in
contact with nature and men, his breadth of view was certainly innate.
If Goode had a fault, it was that his interests were too numerous and his
sympathies too broad. He displayed not only a warm appreciation of
those around him and an enthusiasm for contemporary research, but an
exceptional sense of the close bonds between the present and the past—

as seen in his admiration for the pioneers of American science and his
repeated vindication of their services. This passion for history led to an
important phase of his literary work. His fine addresses, The Begin-
nings of Natural History in America (1886), The Beginnings of Amer-
ican Science (1887), The Literary Labors of Benjamin Franklin (1890),
The Origin of the National Scientific and Educational Institutions
of the United States (1890), and An Account of the Smithsonian
Institution (1895), sprang from the same instinct which prompted
him to compile the valuable bibliographies of Baird, of Girard, of Lea,
and of Sclater, and to undertake the remarkable genealogy of his own
family entitled Virginia Cousins. ‘The time between 1887 and 1895
which he devoted to these subjects caused some of his fellow-naturalists
anxiety; yet I fancy this work was largely sought by him for diversion
and rest, just as Michael Foster tells us that philosophy and controversy
served as recreation to Huxley, at a time when overwork had given hima
passing distaste for morphology.

His trend of life guided by these four beacon lights was swayed by
two countercurrents—first, his strong impulses as an original investiga-
tor, and, second, his convictions as to the duty of spreading the knowl-
edge of nature. These currents moved him alternately. The most
superficial view of his career shows that his whole environment fostered
his public spirit and made difficult and at times impossible the retirement
so essential to studies in nature.

Goode’s practical and public achievements for natural history there-
fore do him even more honor than his writings, because from June, 1870,
when he graduated from Wesleyan University, to September, 1896,
administrative service became paramount, and he was free to devote only
the odd intervals of his time to research. Our great gain in the national
institutions he has advanced is our corresponding loss in ichthyology and
the kindred branches of zoology.

Soode’s successful work in the natural history courses at Wesleyan
led at graduation to a place in the college museum, where in 1870 he at
once showed his great talent for systematic arrangement. In further
preparation for zoology, he went to Harvard, and for a few months came
under the genial influence of Louis Agassiz. But the turning point in
his life came in 1872, when, working as a volunteer upon the United
States Fish Commission, at Eastport, he met Spencer F. Baird. The
kind of simple but irresistible force which Abraham Lincoln exerted
among statesmen Baird seems to have exerted among naturalists. He
at once noted young Goode’s fine qualities, adopted him, and rapidly
came to be the master spirit in his scientific life. Goode delighted to
work with a man so full of all that constitutes true greatness. He fre-
quently spoke of Baird as his master, and intimate friends say that he
never showed quite the same buoyant spirit after Baird’s death—he felt
the loss so keenly. Baird took Goode to Washington in the winter of
1872 and practically determined his career, for he promoted him rapidly

through every grade of the Fish Commission and Museum service. It
is hard to realize now the intensely rapid and eager development of our
national scientific institutions in those years.

No doubt Baird’s mantle fell fittingly upon Goode’s shoulders, and he
had all but the magnificent physique of his master to qualify him for
this heavy burden. His talents and methods were of a different order.
Both men enjoyed universal adiniration, respect, and even love, but
Baird drove men before him with quiet force while Goode drew men
after him. Lacking the self-confidence of Baird, Goode was rather per-
suasive than insistent. His success of administration also came partly
from an instinctive knowledge of human nature and his large faculty of
putting himself in other men’s shoes. He sought out the often latent
best qualities of the men around him and developed them. When things
were out of joint and did not move his way, he waited with infinite
patience for the slow operation of time and common sense to set them
right. He was singularly considerate of opinion. Not ‘‘I think,’’ but
“‘Don’t you think,’’ was his way of entering a discussion. I am
reminded of the gentleness of my teacher, Francis Balfour, when one
of his students carelessly destroyed a rare and valuable preparation, as I
learn from one of Goode’s associates that under similar provocation,
without a word of reproof, he stooped over to repair the damage himself.
He was fertile of original ideas and suggestions, full of invention and of
new expedients, studying the best models at home and abroad, but never
bound by any traditions of system or of classification. He showed these
qualities in a marked degree in the remarkable fisheries exhibit which
he conceived and executed for Berlin in 1879, and continued to show
them in his rapid development of the scope as well as of the detail of a
great museum. ‘To all his work also he brought a refined artistic taste,
shown in his methods of printing and labeling, as well as in his encour-
agement of the artistic, and, therefore, the truthful and realistic develop-
ment of taxidermy in the arrangement of natural groups of animals. ‘To
crown all, like Baird, he entered into the largest conception of the wide-
reaching responsibilities of his office under the Government, fully realiz-
ing that he was not at the head of a university or of a metropolitan
museum, but of the Museum of a great nation. Every reasonable request
from another institution met a prompt response. I well recall Goode’s
last visit to the Anierican Museum in New York, and his hearty approval
of the work there, especially his remark, ‘‘I am glad to see these things
being done so well in this country.’’ Not the advancement of Washing-
ton science but of American science was his dominating idea.

In fact, every act and every word of Goode’s breathed the scientific
creed which he published in 1888:

The greatest danger to science is, perhaps, the fact that all who have studied at all
within the last quarter of a century have studied its rudiments and feel competent

to employ its methods and its language and to form judgments on the merits of cur-
rent work. . . . Inthe meantime the professional men of science, the scholars,
20 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

and the investigators seem to me to be strangely indifferent to the questions as to
how the public at large is to be made familiar with the resultsof their labors. . . .
It may be that the use of the word naturalist is to become an anachronism, and that
we are all destined to become generically biologists and specifically morphologists,
histologists, embryologists, physiologists.

I can but believe, however, that it is the duty of every scientific scholar, however
minute his specialty, to resist in himself, and in the professional circles which sur-
round him, the tendency toward narrowing technicality in thought and sympathy,
and above all in the education of nouprofessional students. . . .

Ican not resist the feeling that American men of science are in a large degree
responsible if their fellow-citizens are not fully awake to the claims of scientific
endeavor in their midst.

I am not in sympathy with those who feel that their dignity is lowered when their
investigations lead toward improvement in the physical condition of mankind, but
I feel that the highest function of science is to minister to their mental and moral
welfare. Here in the United States, more than in any other country, it is necessary
that sound, accurate knowledge and a scientific manner of thought should exist
among the people, and the man of science is becoming, more than ever, the natural
custodian of the treasured knowledge of the world. ‘To him, above all others, falls
the duty of organizing and maintaining the institutions for the diffusion of knowl-
edge, many of which have been spoken of in these addresses—the schools, the
museums, the expositions, the societies, the periodicals. To him, more than to any
other American, should be made familiar the words of President Washington in his
farewell address to the American people:

‘Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general
diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force
to public opinions it should be enlightened.”’

As a naturalist Goode did not close any of the windows opening out
intonature. His breadth of spirit in public affairs displayed itself equally
in his methods of field and sea work and in the variety of his observa-
tions and writings. While fishes became his chief interest, he knew all
the Eastern species of birds after identifying and arranging the collection
in his college museum. He loved plants, and in the latter years of his
life took great pleasure in the culture of the old-fashioned garden around
his house. He was not wedded to his desk, to dry bones, nor to alcoholic
jars. His sea studies and travels ranged as early as 1872 from the Ber-
mudas to Eastport on the Bay of Fundy; to Casco Bay in 1873, to Noank,
on Long Island Sound, in 1874. Here he conceived a great Index
Bibliography of American Ichthyology, a work which he did not live
to complete, and here he met his future colleague, Bean, who describes
him as ‘‘a young man with plump cheeks and a small moustache.”’
During the following two years his assistant curatorship at the National
Museum confined him, but in 1877 he was studying the fisheries off
Halifax, and in 1879 at Provincetown. ‘The work of the fishery census
was starting up in earnest, and Goode was busy planning and getting
together his men. Special agents were sent out, to every part of the
coast and to the Great Lakes, to gather information. Goode worked at it
himself on Cape Cod, and manifested the same enthusiasm as in every
other piece of work he took up. He interested himself in getting together
Memorial Meeting. 2X

a collection representing the methods of the fisheries and the habits of
the fishermen. Neglecting neither the most trivial nor important objects,
branching out into every collateral matter, he showed his grasp both of
principles and of details.

His literary bent and facility of written expression showed itself before
his graduation at Wesleyan in the College Argus, which contains seven
brief papers, including his first scientific article, prophetically entitled
Our Museum. He contributed to the American Naturalist in 1871 a
note upon The Billfish in Fresh Water, and in 1872 A Sea Bird Inland.
He published and presented before the American Association in 1873 his.
first paper of importance, entitled Do Snakes Swallow Their Young?
These studies of real merit foreshadow two marked features of his later
work—first, his recognition of the importance of distribution, which cul-
minated in the preparation of his unfinished memoir upon the Geographi-
cal Distribution of Deep Sea Fishes; second, his close observance of the
habits of animals, which was of marked usefulness in his subsequent Fish
Commission service and treatises upon fish-culture. His Catalogue of
the Fishes of the Bermudas, from his visit in 1872, indicates how early in
life he had thought out a thoroughly philosophical method of studying a
local fauna: ‘‘In working up my notes,’’ he says, ‘‘I have endeavored
to supplement previous descriptions by (1) descriptions of the colors of
the fishes while living, (2) notes on size and proportions, (3) observa-
tions on habits, (4) hints in reference to the origin and meaning of their
popular names, (5) notes upon modes of capture and economic-value.’’
He increased the number of recorded species from seven to seventy-five,
and gave a careful analysis of their probable geographical derivation.

Many of his briefer papers deal directly with the biological problems
which attracted his interest, especially among reptiles and fishes, touch-
ing such questions as migration, coloring, albinism, mimicry, parasitism,
feeding and breedig habits, and the relation of forest protection to the
protection of fishes.

It is difficult to classify the papers, long and short, which we find rap-
idly succeeding each other in the valuable bibliography prepared by Doctor
Adler and Mr. Geare. Of his 193 independent papers, 21 are biological,
g treat of reptiles and amphibians, 38 are devoted to the structure, life
habits, and distribution of the fishes, in addition to 15 purely systematic
contributions upon the fishes. Among the former are his large memoirs
upon the Menhaden, his shorter treatises upon the Trunk Fishes, the
Pampanos, the Sword Fishes, and the Eel. ‘The work of the Fish Com-
mission is described, and published at home and abroad, in 30 reports and
popular papers. The special branch of Fisheries Exhibits is treated in
8 papers, and of fish-culture in 12 papers. Besides his 14 reports as
Director of the National Museum he published, between 1881 and 1896,
13 papers developing the theory and practice of museum administra-
tion, leading up to his very notable articles, Museums of the Future,
22 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

Museum History and Museums of History in 1889, and his invalu-
able memoir upon Museum Administration in 1895. His labors and
writings placed him in the lead of museum experts in this country and
upon the level of the distinguished leader of museum development in
England, Sir William Flower. The closing sentence of his address before
the English Museums Association must be quoted. ‘‘The degree of civ-
ilization to which any nation, city, or province has attained is best shown
by the character of its public museums and the liberality with which they
are maintained.’’

His popular works include the Game Fishes of the United States, pub-
lished in 1879, a book written in charming literary style, besides innu-
merable short articles in the Chautauquan, Forest and Stream, and
Science. In 1888 appeared his American Fishes: A Popular Treatise
upon the Game and Food Fishes of North America, with special refer-
ence to habits and methods of capture. These writings give us a further
insight not only into the two sides of Goode’s scientific nature, the theo-
retical and the practical, but into his artistic and poetical sentiment and
into the wide extent of his reading. Besides the long list enumerated
above, he published 51 joint ichthyological papers with G. Brown, W. O.
Atwater, R. E. Earll, A. Howard Clark, Joseph W. Collins, Newton P.
Scudder, but his main collaborateur was Tarleton H. Bean. Under their
names appear 35 papers, but, chief of all, the Oceanic Ichthyology, a
Treatise on the Deep Sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, based chiefly
upon the collections made by steamers Blake, Albatross, and Fish Hawk
in the Northwestern Atlantic.

In 1877 Goode saw his first deep-sea fish drawn fresh from the bottom,
and experienced a sensation which he thus describes in the preface of his
monograph:

The studies which have led to the writing of this book were begun in the summer
of 1877, when the first deep-sea fishes were caught by American nets on the coast of
North America. ‘This took place in the Gulf of Maine, 44 miles east of Cape Ann,
on the 19th of August, when from the side of the United States Fish Commission
steamer Speedwell the trawlnet was cast in 160 fathoms of water. ‘The writers were
both standing by the mouth of the net when, as the seamen lifted the end of the bag,
two strange forms fell out on the deck. A single glance was enough to tell us that
they were new to our fauna, and probably unknown to science. ‘They seemed like
visitors from another world, and none of the strange forms which have since passed
through our laboratory have brought half as much interest and enthusiasm.
Macrurus bairdii and Lycodes verrillii were simply new species of well-known
deep-dwelling genera, and have since been found to be very abundant on the conti-
neutal slope, but they were among the first fruits of that great harvest in the field
of oceanic ichthyology which we have had the pleasure to garner in the fifteen years
which have passed since that happy and eventful morning. It seems incredible that
American naturalists should not then have known that a few miles away there was a

fauna as unlike that of our coast as could be found in the Indian Ocean or the seas
of China... .

In one of the latest of his 45 contributions to the Bulletins of the
United States National Museum is the description of the discovery of the
Memorial Meeting. 23

new deep-sea Chimeeroid, for which, true to his appreciation of the past,
he proposed the name //arriotta, in memory of Thomas Harriott, the
earliest English naturalist in America.

The quaint, old-fashioned style of some of Goode’s essays gives us an
insight into his historic sense and his reversion to the ideas and principles
of his Virginia ancestors. Seldom have we known the loyal conservative
spirit, of reverence for old institutions, fealty to independence of socie-
ties, combined with such a grandly progressive spirit in the cooperation
of the Government with the state, and of one country with another in
the promotion of science.

Again, what impresses us most is Goode as the apostle of scientific
knowledge. A conviction of his mission in life breathes forth from his
earliest papers in the College Argus to his final appeal in Science for the
‘“Admission of American students to the French universities.’’

One of his intimate friends writes:

Sometimes we talked of more far-reaching matters, and in such discussions I often
took a position I had no faith in, hoping to draw him out. I remember once we fell
to talking of the province of science, and for the sake of argument I took the position
that most scientific work was merely a form of intellectual amusement, and benefited
no one. He became quite earnest in his protest against that view, and asserted his
belief that the majority of scientific men were working toward the improvement of
things and that it was the destiny of science to be the salvation of the world. At
another time he unfolded the idea that man through science was approaching step
by step nearer the Infinite Ruler of the Universe, and that it was only through these
activities that he could hope to reach his proper destiny; that every amelioration of
life, every improvement in manners, every change in theological tenets was a token
of man’s unfolding through the working of intellectual forces.

Our lasting regret must be that Goode’s life terminated just as he had
richly earned the right to retire from the scientific service of his country—
from your service and mine, my friends—to devote himself more exclu-
sively to his own researches.

As early as 1880, during the Herculean task of entering the new
National Museum building, Goode remarked to one of his friends, ‘‘ We
have had pretty hard scrambling—I think we will take a rest presently ’’—
but, alas! the rest days never came. One duty after another fell heavily
upon his too-willing shoulders. All must have observed in later years a
certain quiet melancholy which marked his overwork, and conscious
inability to cope with all that his ambitious and resourceful spirit
prompted. None the less he showed a continuous and rapid intellectual
development during the last ten years of his life, and it was evident that
his powers were constantly expanding, and that his brightest and most
productive days were to come in his projected independent and joint
researches. As before noted, his Geographical Distribution of Deep Sea
Fishes was nearly completed, the charts having been exhibited before
the Biological Society, and a mass of voluminous notes and valuable
observations are ready to show that the distribution of deep-sea fishes is
far from being so general as has been supposed, and that there are certain
24 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

well-defined thalassic faunal regions. Another projected work for which
extensive materials were collected was upon the Fishes of America, in
which Doctor Theodore Gill was to have cooperated.

Goode was always encouraged by his supreme faith in the reward of
honest intellectual labor, and it is pleasant to recall now that he took the
keenest satisfaction in the completion and publication of the Oceanic
Ichthyology, which revived in him all his old natural-history spirit. He
regarded it as his chief life work, and once observed to his fellow-writer,
Tarleton Bean, ‘‘It will be our monument,’’ little foreseeing that so scon
after its publication he would be gone and that his friends and admirers
all over the world would share this very thought in receiving the fine
monograph a few weeks after his sudden and unexpected death.

Our friend has gone to his fathers. As a public-spirited naturalist he
leaves us the tender memory and the noble example, which helps us
and will help many coming men into the higher conception of duty in
the service and promotion of the truth. We can not forget his smile nor
his arm passing through the arm of his friend. Thinking little of him-
self and highly of others, faithful to his duties and loyal to his friends,
full of good cheer and hopefulness—it is hard for us to close up the ranks
and march on without him.
GOODE’S ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO AMERICAN SCIENCE.

By WILLIAM HEALEY DALL,
Paleontologist, United States Geological Survey.

Most persons unacquainted with the interior working of our executive
bureaus have an impression that they are the creation of law, in the sense
in which the term ‘‘creation’’ was formerly used to describe the coming
into being of some part of the material universe. Perhaps this impres-
sion is seldom definitely formulated, but, nevertheless, it is common to
hear arguments from intelligent people, bent on ameliorating govern-
ment, which tacitly assume that an act of Congress by some inherent
magic will accomplish that which they desire. It is a truism that whole
schemes of social reorganization are built on no better foundation, and
thousands of earnest reformers work, suffer, and even die for theories
erected on this hypothesis.

Whatever of truth there may be in the application of this idea to the
purely business offices of the Government, where finance, commerce,
invention, or transportation are provided for, nothing could be more mis-
taken than its application to the scientific bureaus. For each and every
one of them the world is indebted to some individual. In the majority
of cases the man came with his purpose before the law was thought of,
and his devotion to his self-imposed mission, his persistence, and his
energy were the inciting causes of some lines in an appropriation bill,
with all its potentialities, the seed of the present organization. Some-
times the sower, given the opportunity to dig and water, was spared to
reap the first fruits of the harvest. On other occasions worthy suc-
cessors arose, bore the burden and heat of the day, and carried out the
plans to final triumph. Thus, to Hassler and Bache we owe the Coast

ce

Survey, which has spread the fame of American achievements in geodetic
science through every civilized community; to Hayden, King, and
Powell are due the organization and success of the Geological Survey of
the United States; to the initiative of Smithson and guiding hand of
Henry we owe the Smithsonian Institution; the Fish Commission was
the embodied work of Baird; and to Baird and Goode’s untiring labors
we are indebted for the National Museum. ‘There remain very few per-
sons with intimate personal knowledge of the unwritten history of the

gradual development of the Museum. ‘To Professor Henry American
science owes a debt which is but seldom realized and can hardly be exag-
gerated. It is difficult for anyone, even with the printed records before
him, to form an adequate idea of the conditions under which the Smith-
sonian Institution grew to its present stature, nor what unceasing vigi-
lance was required of its head to avoid the pitfalls which everywhere
beset its path in adolescence. Opinions, emphatic and divergent, were
abundant, in and out of Congress, as to the policy and methods deemed
desirable for the Institution. Men would have used the fund for a great
library, museum of art, or university. The original act by which it was
constituted was a compromise, leaving a door open for the advocates of
either opinion to modify the policy of the Institution should the time
come when any particular view could command a majority in the gov-
erning board. Professor Henry was determined that the ‘‘increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men’’ in the highest and broadest sense
of the words should be the object to be attained, and that nothing local
or special should absorb the funds or the energies of the Institution.
Such things as could and would be done by other agencies were not to
be attempted by the Smithsonian, but rather the things worth doing,
which, except for the aid given by the Institution, could not get done at
all. ‘Those branches of activity prescribed by the act creating the Insti-
tution, but which tended to outgrow a strict subordination and absorb
undue proportions of the income, were rigorously pruned and sternly
repressed. It seems strange to recall a time when free speech did not
exist in the capital of the nation, yet it is within my memory when so
great was the irritability of the proslavery element in Washington that
Professor Henry, with an eye single to the welfare of his beloved Insti-
tution, felt it necessary to warn foreign men of science invited to work or
lecture here that certain topics must not be touched upon, directly or
indirectly. Professor Henry knew that the resources of the Smithsonian
could not support a great museum or a great library and still carry out
the promotion of science in the wider sense, which was his ideal aim.
He wished for a national museum and a national library, but only at
national expense. He approved of the far-reaching explorations and
collections which the genius of Professor Baird initiated and by untiring
labors promoted, but he did not wish the enormous mass of material thus
brought together to be a charge upon the slender funds of the Institu-
tion. His policy was to distribute to other institutions of learning,
museums, and colleges, as soon as worked up, everything except a typical
series of the specimens, thus at once promoting research at other points
and economizing space and the expenses of preservation. Arrangements
were made with naturalists all over the country by which material in
their special lines of research was shipped to them as soon as received,
to remain indefinitely, until reported upon. ‘The same policy led to
placing in the Corcoran Gallery of Art such objects of art spared by the

great fire of 1865 as that establishment could utilize ; and to the deposit
in the Library of Congress of the great collection of scientific books and
periodicals, which was rapidly outgrowing all the limits set by his pru-
dence. In his determination that nothing should be permitted to divert
the progress of the Institution from the lines laid down for it, Professor
Henry thought no labor too great, no personal supervision too minute,
no just economy too paltry. Who shall say that his lofty purposes and
unceasing struggles have not been justified by his success?

Meanwhile Baird’s ambitions and endeavors were leading toward the
establishment of a national museum in fact, if not in name. Multitu-
dinous expeditions were set on foot for Pacific railway routes, military
surveys, the coast survey, the routes for an Isthmian canal, the explora-
tion of the Hudson Bay territory, Lower California, and Alaska. From
each and all of these a stream of the most precious material for study
flowed toward the Smithsonian Institution. The natural sciences all over
the world were enriched by the countercurrent of published researches
which poured from those Elizabethan towers. A bevy of students, poor
in purse, but rich in enthusiasm, in energy and devotion, found shelter
there. From time to time, as opportunities came, they sallied forth, one
by one, to the ends of the earth, bent on enriching the collection and
advancing science, in which they usually succeeded.

How difficult in such a case to hold the balance true! To preserve for
study what was needed and yet not to exceed the limits imposed by cir-
cumstances. To be loyal and true in spirit, as well as in the letter, to
the policy of the chief, and yet to hold securely for the future that which
the future would need. Yet this task, so perplexing and so difficult,
was successfully performed by Baird. He had for Henry an affectionate
loyalty and veneration asstrong in its way as his devotion to biological
research, and which supplied a never-failing and most elevating example
to the younger men about him. ,

The establishment of the Fish Commission with its separate income
partly available for research somewhat ameliorated the situation. The
establishment of a national museum, as urged by Baird and Henry,
became a more familiar idea to Congress and the country. With the
Centennial Exposition of 1876, came an opportunity of which Baird
was not slow to take advantage. He determined that the exhibition
made by the United States should bear testimony to what the Museum
could do both in the way of material and in its presentation. ‘The
Government made a loan of several millions to the Exposition, which
no one then supposed would ever be repaid. Members of the appro-
priations committee felt quite safe in half jokingly assuring Professor
Baird that if the money ever was repaid an appropriation for a National
Museum building should not be withheld. The entire staff of the
Museum, including several unpaid volunteers, with Goode at their head,
gave all their energies for nearly a year to make the Government and
28 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

especially the Museum exhibit a success, feeling that the future of the
Museum was really at stake. Individuals all over the country were called
upon to assist by advice or material in their special lines. ‘Thousands of
letters were written and thousands of exhibits gathered. Here Goode
had his first training in the artsof exposition, in which he finally became
the acknowledged master. Many were the discussions as to system, selec-
tion of exhibits, cases, labels, and methods in general. It was indeed a
liberal education to those engaged in the work. No test could have been
contrived which would better have revealed the strength or weakness, on
certain sides, of all engaged in it. Men of whom much was expected
failed utterly. Others developed unexpected capacity.and talent. The
result was a glorious success, acknowledged by all beholders.

After a certain time the Government loan was repaid, and at last the
unofficial promises of members of Congress were kept. A sum, pitiably
small if compared with the money devoted by most civilized nations to
housing their national museums, was appropriated, and, by a lucky chance,
an unparalleled depression in the iron trade enabled contracts to be made
to the great advantage of the Government. A building without any archi-
tectural pretensions, but giving light and floor space at a lower cost than
in any other permanent structure of equal size ever erected by the United
States, was finally put up, a new organization effected, and at last the
National Museum possessed a local habitation anda name. ‘The direction
of its activities, under the supervision of Professor Baird, was placed in
Goode’s hands, and his career asa Museum administrator officially began.

It may be thought that the preceding remarks have included very little
about Goode and a great deal about other matters. Thisis true; but no
account of the man and his activities would be adequate which omitted a
delineation of the struggles, fears, and hopes of which, in his position, he
was the natural heir. A great institution is not created; it is built up.
With the mortar of its foundations is mixed the blood and sweat of the
builders. Something of the very soul of its architect springs with its
pinnacles toward the heavens. ‘The capacity for administration may be
inborn, the professional knowledge must be earned. These truths are
singularly ignored, even by those who should know better. In fact our
people, even those who have much advanced the cause of education, and
those who have won repute in the fields of politics or business, have not
wholly shaken off the provincial notion that a museum is a sort of toy
which an intelligent window-dresser might be competent to manage.
The realization of the fact that museum administration is a profession, as
arduous as that of medicine or law, seems to be confined almost entirely
to those who have actually been devoting their lives to it. That in the
case of a national museum, as a sort of general clearing house of
national activities in science, and the chief arena of international scientific
reciprocity, still wider knowledge of men and their work, a still broader
mental horizon, and infinite tact and patience are urgently required, is
still less appreciated.
Memorial Meeting. 29

It is true that every administrator must learn and grow with the
progress of his work; but that the work should be put into the hands of
total inexperience, as is frequently suggested, is like insisting that all
our genealogies should be traced from Adam and Eve.

The relations which Goode bore to the scientific activity of the country
and less directly to that of the world are best understood through a sketch
of Museum administration in the concrete. We may begin with condi-
tions in such an institution itself.

It is hardly true, as I have heard it somewhat broadly stated by one of
the uninitiated, that ‘‘scientific men are all cranks,’’ though this estimate
is by no means without its supporters. Yet it can not be denied that there
is something out of the common and, to the average citizen, peculiar
in the mental constitution which leads to the adoption of a profession
which offers no pecuniary reward at all adequate to the required exertion ;
which, in this country at least, extends little hope of discrimination from
quacks and charlatans adept at attracting public notice; in which the
modest prizes are few and far between, promotion problematical; where
the worker must congratulate himself if he is able to support and educate
his family without actual privation, and must find his reward, if at all,
in the consciousness of work well done and the esteem of a few contempo-
rary toilers. Such a mental constitution, I repeat, does have in it some-
thing different from that of the ordinary mind and something which the
average man finds difficult to reconcile with his idea of common sense.
Only the other day I heard of a conscientious guardian of an orphan with
a small competence, who refused to allow the boy to follow his natural
bent and become a naturalist, on the ground that it would be a dereliction
of duty if the guardian permitted his ward to enter upon a career in which
the rewards are so few and financial success so doubtful.

Those in whom the bent is so strong as to defy all obstacles not infre-
quently are somewhat one-sided people. ‘They feel, as they ought to
feel, that their own specialty is the most important of the many domains
of science. Since they have not hesitated at any sacrifice to devote them-
selves to it, it is not unnatural that they should feel that from colaborers
in science, support, encouragement, and a sufficient allotment from the
common fund are justly due. Ina great museum this common fund or
income is never sufficient to meet all demands. ‘The director must be
more than human who can apportion disappointment without exciting
disapproval. Yet in the midst of annual expressions of regret I never
heard Goode’s justice or kindly feeling questioned.

It sometimes happens, as a scientist is human, that the weaknesses or
faults of our common humanity find a lodgment with him, possibly even
to the point where a love of science seems the only thread withholding
him from utter shipwreck. The kindly and generous nature of Professor
Baird, joined toa certain practical shrewdness, enabled him to utilize and
succor, from time to time, such waifs, putting them where the redeeming
virtue might exert its wholesome influence and the broken soul might

feel the comfort, in hours of remorse, that, after all, its life had not been
wholly wasted. Baird’s example was not forgotten by his pupil.

Lest engrossment in a specialty breed indifference to progress in com-
mon, it is of the highest importance that the leader in a band of workers
shall use every opportunity of emphasizing their joint responsibility to
science and to the public, for whose entertainment and instruction the
museum is supported by public funds. This duty Goode never forgot,
and by example and precept he continually stimulated each and every
one to his best efforts.

The experiments in methods of preservation and exhibition, by which
the best results are reached, are of interest and value to the whole scien-
tific community. It often happens that only through a long series of
failures, all more or less costly, is success at last attained. Were each
museum, private or public, obliged to run the whole gamut of experi-
ment, the losses would be irreparable and the cost enormous. In this
direction, as did Baird in his time, Goode developed a particular genius,
and his successes placed him early in his career in the very front rank,
if not at the virtual head, of all Museum experts. ‘The results of this
work were placed freely at the disposition of all interested, and nearly all
museums in this country and many abroad have materially profited by
the skill and ingenuity thus displayed. It is highly probable, so modest
was the originator, that few of those whose work is thus assisted have
any definite idea of the source from which the facilities came.

Looking beyond the Museum itself and considering its external rela-
tions, we find that naturalists and anthropologists all over the country are
in the habit of appealing to the Director or staff of the National Museum
for scientific information, advice, or needed assistance in all sorts of
directions. In many cases the question is not simple, but one requiring
the utmost consideration and delicacy.

‘The needs or requests of different institutions or persons are not infre-
quently conflicting, and the decision may be far-reaching. The compe-
tition between different workers or institutions in the same field is
liable, unless treated with great tact, to rouse antagonisms. Small
societies sometimes inadvisedly identify themselves with the opinions or
theories of some individual member, and if the latter prove contestable
the amount of human nature which may be displayed is astonishing. It
has happened that such an organization, in a fit of pique, has showered
abusive pamphlets over the inhabited universe. Rival candidates for
coveted posts resort to the most ingenious methods for securing indorse-
ment contrary to the rules of the institution. Occasions arise when
advice is sought with seriousness and given with anxiety, as a matter of
duty. In short, it is required of the head of the Museum to have a gen-
eral knowledge of the character, responsibility, and reliability of all the
professional and most of the amateur scientific workers of the country
and of the character and interrelations of all the more or less scientific

societies, not only for the use and benefit of the outsiders, but for the
safety and protection of the Museum itself. While no one could exceed
Professor Baird in the breadth and accuracy of his information on such
topics, yet the traditions he handed down and Goode’s own wide knowl-
edge of the younger generation gave him satisfactory qualifications of
this most necessary and special kind.

Leaving the ostensibly scientific, not the least embarrassing duty the
head of the Museum has to perform is the answering of letters from the
people at large. Here the variety ranges from the intelligent seeker for
an explanation of some observed phenomenon, to the fraudulent scheme
of some rascal for securing books or specimens by false pretenses. ‘The
most ignorant are often the most confident in their own explanation of
something which has temporarily puzzled them ; nevertheless they seek
official sanction and approval. Cranks write letters in blue ink, the
nouns filled in with red. So and so announces that the Apollonian
Library, upon whose letter head he writes, is desirous of a full set of the
publications and, being the only library in a large region round about,
should undoubtedly receive them; and signs himself librarian. It is
known to the initiated that the signer is himself the Apollonian Library
and its only reader. Ill-spelled letters tell of natural curiosities, mar-
velous to behold, sometimes for sale, sometimes to be freely donated. It
would be a great mistake to suppose that these letters may be treated
with scorn, or ignored. It has often happened that the layman in his
blindness has stumbled upon something good. At any rate he is one of
the great American people whose taxes support the Museum, and is enti-
tled to courtesy and illumination if it can be furnished. At all events,
it will be clear to you that special knowledge, tact, and kindliness will
not be superfluous in the treatment of the daily mass of correspondence.

I have tried to throw a little light on the difficulties and problems our
dear friend met and solved so well. Iilustrations might be greatly mul-
tiplied did time permit. What has been said, I trust, is enough to show
that no ordinary man could have done this work (and much else) and
yet have left behind him no antagonisms, no memories of failure, no
hint of insufficiency, associated with his name. He is remembered as
one never weary of welldoing; who reached the heights, though ever
aiming higher; whose example stimulated and whose history will prove
a lasting inspiration.

RESOLUTIONS AND MESSAGES OF SYMPATHY.

On the completion of the reading of the formal addresses, General
Orlando B. Willcox, U.S. A., representing the Society of the Sons of the
American Revolution of the District of Columbia, offered the following
resolutions, which were seconded by Rear-Admiral James A. Greer,
U. S. N., representing the Society of the Sons of the Revolution, and
adopted by a rising vote:

We, the associates and friends of the late George Brown Goode in the scientific,
patriotic, and historical societies of the city of Washington, being met together to
commemorate his life and service, do recognize:

That in his death the world has lost a great man of true moral worth, unusual
breadth of intellect, profound human sympathy, unswerving loyalty to his duty, and
devotion to his family and his friends.

That America has been deprived of a most patriotic, public-spirited, and loyal
citizen, American science of its first historian, and American history of an original
investigator.

That universal science has lost one of its foremost ichthyologists and a man broadly
learned in the entire field of natural history.

That the scientific service of the United States Government, the societies to which
he belonged, and all the institutions in America for the promotion of knowledge
have lost in him an ever faithful and willing cooperator.

Resolved, That this minute be communicated to the societies of which Doctor
Goode was a member and a copy be sent to his family, to whom the persons here
assembled extend their sincere sympathy.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED IN THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

By the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Whereas the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Doctor G. Brown
Goode, died on September 6, 1896,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents wish to here record their sense of the devotion
to duty which in the late Doctor Goode came before any consideration of personal
advancement, or even before the care of his own health, and of their recognition
that his high administrative ability and wide knowledge were devoted unselfishly
to the service of the Institution, with results whose value they can not too highly
acknowledge; and they desire to express their feeling of the loss that the Institution,
the National Museum, and the cause of science has sustained in his untimely death.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be suitably engrossed and transmitted
to the family of Doctor Goode.

By the employees of the National Museum:

Whereas, in the untimely death of Doctor G. Brown Goode the scientific world
and the American people have suffered an immeasurable Joss—we, his assistants,
collaborators, and friends, knew and esteemed him as an investigator of signal hon-
esty and ability, as an earnest and efficient administrator whose willing aid and
forbearance endeared him to all, as a man of pure motives and stainless life, and as
a faithful friend and mentor—therefore,

Resolved, That in Doctor Goode’s death we have lost a leader and companion
whose teachings will always be in our minds and whose memory will forever live in
our hearts.

Resolved, That we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the stricken family in this
our common sorrow.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE FIELD COLUMBIAN MUSEUM.

At a meeting of the director and curators of the Field Columbian
Museum, Chicago, Illinois, the following preamble and resolutions were
adopted:

Whereas, We have learned with great sorrow of the death of the distinguished
scholar and scientist, Doctor George Brown Goode, Director of the National Museum;
be it therefore, in grateful tribute to his memory,

Resolved, That we recognize, as the world has already recognized, the conspicuous
abilities displayed by him in the particular field of science in which he chose to labor,
but still more fully we appreciate the fact that in the broader field of museum organ-
ization and management, a work which he had reduced to science, he stood without
a peer. Not less admirable, as a feature of his career, is the enviable position always
held by him as an adviser and helper among his associates, scientific, official, and
personal. His strong, helpful hand was ever extended.

Resolved, That we mourn his loss not only on account of these attainments and
qualities, but also as a man of broad sympathies and tender heart, upright cheerful
character, and honest, virtuous life.

Resolved, That our sincere sympathies are hereby extended to the members of his
bereaved family in the hour of their affliction, and that a copy of these resolutions
be transmitted to them in token thereof.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

At a meeting of the biological section of the New York Academy of
Sciences held October 12, 1896, the following resolution, introduced by
Professor Henry F. Osborn and seconded by Mr. William T. Hornaday,
was unanimously adopted by a rising vote:

Resolved, That the members of the biological section of the New York Academy of
Sciences desire to express their deep sense of loss in the death of Professor G. Brown
Goode, of the United States National Museum. In common with all naturalists in
this country, we have admired his intelligent and highly successful administration
of the National Museum, as well as his prompt and ready response to the requests
and needs of similar institutions throughout the country.

In face of the arduous and exacting duties of his directorship, he has held a lead-
ing position among American zoologists, and we are indebted to him for a series of
invaluable investigations, especially upon the fishes.

Those of us who had the good fortune to know Professor Goode personally, recall
his singular charm of character, his genial interest in the work of others, his true
scientific spirit. We have thus lost one of our ablest fellow-workers and one of the
truest and best of men.

CIRCULAR ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF FISH AND FISHERIES.

UNITED STATES COMMISSION OF FISH AND FISHERIES,

Washington, D. C., September 8, 1896.
[Circular Order No. 139.]

It becomes my painful duty to announce to the employees of the United States
Commission of Fish and Fisheries the death in this city, on the 6th instant, of Doctor
George Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and at one
time United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries. Although his official con-
nection, strictly speaking, has always been with the former establishment, Doctor
Goode is best known for his researches and publications on the fishes and fisheries
of the United States, on which subjects he came to be recognized as the leading
authority. He first joined in the investigations of the Fish Commission on the
Atlantic coast in 1872 as a volunteer, and in that capacity continued to participate
in its scientific work up to the time of Professor Baird’s death in 1887. He was
appointed to succeed the latter as Fish Commissioner, but relinquished that position
after a few months, upon the passage of the act giving it an independent status.
Doctor Goode had charge of the Fishery Division of the Tenth Census, and was also
the United States Commissioner to the Fishery Expositions at Berlin and London.
He has been one of the most fruitful and valued contributors to the reports and bul-
letins of the Fish Commission, and in his death the fishing interests of the country
have sustained a severe loss.

J. J. BRicE, Commissioner.

EXTRACTS FROM PROCEEDINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS.

[From a report of the proceedings of the Seventh Annual General Meeting of the Museums Asso-
ciation held in Glasgow July 21 to 25, 1896. ]

At the meeting of the Association held in Newcastle last year was read a contribu-
tion from Doctor G. Brown Goode on The principles of Museum Administration ;
and afterwards the author sent a reprint of the paper to each member of the Associa-
36 Memorval of George Brown Goode.

tion. To most members he was already known by his contributions to museum
literature in the Reports of the National Museum of the United States, and other pub-
lications; but a more personal feeling of intimacy was engendered by the direct
communication of his thoughts to the Association at Newcastle. It was therefore
with a feeling of the deepest regret the news of his untimely death was received.
Doctor Goode died in Washington on 6th of September at the age of forty-five
years. His early death is a great loss, not only to the United States Museum, but to
museums in general, for he took a deep and active interest in all things affecting
their development and well-being.

[From the proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual Convention, American Institute of Architects, 1896. ]

Of the corresponding members the institute loses Professor G. Brown Goode, the
well-known Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and Curator of the
National Museum, who brought out of a chaos of inaccessible treasures the orderly,
well-arranged, enjoyable, and instructive collection which makes the Smithsonian
Institution take rank with the finest museums in the world.

MESSAGES OF SYMPATHY.

From among a large number of letters received since the death of Mr.
Goode, appreciating his great services and offering consolation at his
death, the following few extracts are made.

Sir William H. Flower, director of the British Museum, said:

I should like to take part in any tribute to the memory of a man I admired so
much and was in such sympathy with as Brown Goode.

Professor Enrico H. Giglioli, of Florence, on October 3, 1896, spoke
of Mr. Goode as one of the men he loved and esteemed most:

I feel so crushed [he said] by this terrible blow that I hardly know what I am
writing. . . . Hewasso full of energy and work it is hard to believe that he is
now no more. ‘To youallat the National Museum the loss must be immense, but to
many abroad it is a great and much felt sorrow. To science in America not alone,
but in the civilized world, his loss is indeed irreparable and will be felt for years.

The Honorable William Wirt Henry, of the Virginia Historical Society,
wrote:

It is a source of great satisfaction to me that I knew Doctor Goode personally and
was privileged to be associated with him in his work in the patriotic and historical
societies with which he was connected. No one could know him without being
impressed with his learning and modesty and the sterling qualities of the man. I
feel that his death is a loss which will be felt in every path in which he walked, and
will be mourned by every votary of science.

M. Henri de Varigny, of Paris, wrote to Secretary Langley:

I have received the card which notified [me of] the sad news of the death of that
excellent and most distinguished man, G. Brown Goode. I was already acquainted
with the fact, and had published a few lines of obituary notice in the Revue Scien-
tifique, but I have not adequately expressed the feeling of true sorrow I experience
when I remember that he is no more, and that his writing, activity, and energetic
kindness have ceased to be. He was very kind and obliging to me, and I shall keep
a warm remembrance of him. Your loss is a great one.
Memortal Meeting. 37

Mr. Valdemar Knudsen, of Honolulu, Hawaii, wrote:

The card announcing the death of George Brown Goode, LL. D., has just been
received, and my full sympathy for his loss to your institution and to mankind in
general is hereby humbly tendered.

Doctor Karl Mobius, of Berlin, wrote, under date of January 26, 1897:

The unexpected death of Mr. George Brown Goode has deeply affected me. We
were in agreeable communication, to the advantage of our museums. We have lost
in him a distinguished promoter of our scientific efforts.

Professor Alfonso L. Herrera, of the National Museum in Mexico,
wrote:

I have received the notice of the lamented death of George Brown Goode, LL. D.,
and after thanking you for this mark of attention, I offer my most sincere condo-
lence, and on my part I deplore the loss sustained by science, the National Museum,
the Smithsonian Institution, and all persons who, like myself, had the good fortune
to receive consideration from the deceased. I shall never forget his kindness and
courtesy.

Mr. John Crawford, of Managua, Nicaragua, wrote:

On my return here from an excursion among the mountains I learned with much
surprise and great regret of the death of Doctor G. Brown Goode, On many occa-
sions he was very patient and kind to me, and no doubt was so to many other natu-
ralists who, like myself, are far from museums and the advantages of daily conferring
with and receiving instruction from scientists. I esteemed him highly, and had
hoped that he would live many years in good health, and in physical and mental
vigor continue and enjoy his useful life.

Mr. Julius Neumann, of the Chinese Custom Service, Shasi, China, on
March 15, 1897, wrote:

It was with extreme regret that I have just received your card of the 16th of
November last announcing the death of Professor G. Brown Goode, and I write this
note to condole with you on the loss your great Institution and science at large
have to deplore.

I had the pleasure of meeting the deceased first in London in 1883, and then in
the following year in New Orleans, and ever since we had kept up friendly relations.
I shall always fondly cherish his memory.

The Honorable John Boyd Thacher, of Albany, New York, wrote:

My personal knowledge of Professor Brown Goode began in 1890, when he gave
his advice and counsel to the World’s Columbian Commission in classifying the
various objects into proper departments for exhibition, and more particularly in
advising and establishing an adequate method in passing judgment upon the exhibits.
In these matters I can testify to his ability and consummate skill. It was purely
voluntary service he rendered, and I at once formed—and have since maintained—a
profound sense of his goodness to those who were officially charged with work for
which he knew we were most imperfectly equipped, and to whom he gave not only
suggestions but detailed and elaborate and finished plans. It is the glory of the
modern scientist and scholar that he subordinates himself to the accomplishment of
public work. Our friend never asked to be identified personally with the accom-
plished thing. It was enough for him to know that some good was done and not
that the world should know that it was done by him. ‘The utter absence of selfish-
ness in any life is worthy of recording in brass or in marble or in formulated words.

Doctor Leon Vaillant, professor of the Museum of Natural History in
Paris, said that the ichthyological world has experienced a great loss.

Doctor J. B. de Lacerda, director of the National Museum in Rio de
Janeiro, and Baron C. R. Osten-Sacken, tendered their sympathy.

Doctor H. von Ihering, of San Paulo, Brazil, spoke of the loss the

Doctor R. Schone, director-general of the Royal Museums in Berlin,
expressed his sincere regret at the death of this worthy scholar and extends
his sympathy.

Professor Pietro Pavesi, director of the Zoological Museum of the Uni-
versity of Pavia, offered his condolence. A similar message was received
from the Museum Francisco-Carolinum in Linz.

MEMOIR OF GEORGE BROWN GOODE, i8si-i8096.

By SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY,

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

George Brown Goode was born at New Albany, Indiana, on February
13, 1851, and died at his home in Washington on September 6, 1896,
after a life of forty-five years, than which few human lives have ever
been better filled.

In those years he won the warm affection of a wide circle of friends
and the trust and confidence of a multitude of subordinates in the position
to which his own abilities had carried him. He interested himself and
interested others in ever-widening circles of research, and such varied
work that it seemed to those who knew what he was doing, incompre-
hensible that one man could accomplish so much in one single life; and
when this came to an end, its cessation was like the loss of a part of them-
selves to those who knew him best, by whom he is remembered with an
affection which men rarely gain from one another.

He was the son of Francis Collier Goode and Sarah Woodruff Crane.
The Goode family trace their ancestry in this country to John Goode, of
Whitby, who settled in Virginia prior to 1661.”

While still settled in Virginia, many members of the Goode family

went to the South and West to do pioneer work in building up villages
and towns on what was then the outskirt of civilization.
' Doctor Goode’s father, Francis Collier Goode, was born in Waynes-
ville, Ohio, and was a merchant in Ohio and Indiana. In 1857 he retired
from business, removing to Amenia, New York; subsequently to Mid-
dletown, Connecticut, and later to Arlington, Florida, and occasionally
spent winters in the Bermudas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia,
and Washington City.

42 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

His mother, Sarah Woodruff Crane, was a descendant of Jasper Crane,
who came to New England during the first ten years of the first settle-
ment, and was one of the pioneers of Newark, New Jersey.

Doctor Goode was thus of sturdy American parentage on both sides,
numbering among his ancestors the founders of the Virginia, Massachu-
setts, Connecticut, and New Jersey colonies. ‘The family was singularly
free from foreign mixture, not 1o per cent of the marriages among the
numerous descendants having been with persons whose ancestors came
to America later than 1725.

He passed his early childhood in Cincinnati and his later childhood
and early youth in Amenia, New York, where he was prepared for col-
lege by private tutors. His father was a man of studious habits and
not devoid of an interest in science. He had assembled in his library a
set of the Smithsonian Reports, which young Goode read as a boy. It
was through these volumes that he was first attracted to science and to
the Smithsonian Institution, his boyish ambition being to become con-
nected with it and to study under Professor Baird.

He entered Wesleyan University at Middletown, Connecticut, in 1866,
and was graduated in 1870. Although scarcely more than fifteen when
he entered college and a little over nineteen years of age at the time of
his graduation, being the youngest member of the class, his work in the
studies of the natural history group was so satisfactory as to attract the
favorable notice of his teachers. ‘The years at Middletown foreshadowed
the strong love for nature, the museum interest, ability in classification,
and even the literary talent, which were the distinguishing features of
all Doctor Goode’s later career.

When he went to college, his father removed to Middletown and became
a neighbor to Orange Judd, the pioneer of agricultural journalism in this
country and closely identified with the advancement of scienttfic agricul-
ture. ‘There sprang up between the daughter of Mr. Judd and young
Goode a friendship which ripened into love and resulted in their
marriage, of which I speak here because Doctor Goode himself felt that
the friendship with Mr. Judd, thus brought about through his daughter,
had the largest share in determining his future career. The two young
people had similar tastes in natural history and outdoor life. As early
as 1869 Doctor Goode commenced to record in the College Argus and
the College Review his outdoor rambles. He was at this time a young
man of stout frame and vigorous health, engaging in all of the athletic
sports known to’college students of that day.

In 1870he entered Harvard University as a post-graduate student under
Professor Louis Agassiz, whose genial influence he glowingly describes
in his youthful letters.

Mr. Judd had presented to Wesleyan University a building known as
the Orange Judd Hall of Natural Science. This building wasin progress

Memorr of George Brown Goode. 43

of erection during Mr. Goode’s student years and was dedicated in the
commencement week of 1871.

Before that time [says Professor Rice] the natural history collections of Wesleyan
University were scattered in several buildings, very imperfectly labeled and arranged,
and most inaccessible to students or visitors. The spacious rooms in Judd Hall first
gave the opportunity to arrange and display these collections in such manner as to
give them the dignity of a museum.

The work which Doctor Goode had done while a student under Pro-
fessor Agassiz caused an invitation to be extended to him to undertake
the arrangement of this collection, and in.1871, when but a little over
twenty, he was given the title of Curator of the Museum, and undertook
the installation of the collections. It was in this work that he “‘ first
showed that genius for museum administration which he was destined
afterwards to display in the larger field.’’ He retained his official con-
nection with Middletown until 1877, although the greater part of these
years was spent either in Washington or in the field. During a portion
of this time, although absent from Middletown, he received a salary
from Wesleyan University, and was allowed in exchange to send to the
Museum duplicates of natural history specimens in the Smithsonian
Institution, as well as the duplicates of the collections which he made.
He always retained a strong feeling of affection for his alma mater, and
founded the Goode prize, intended to stimulate an interest in biologic
studies. He was one of the editors of the 1873 and 1883 editions of the
Alumni Record of Wesleyan University, and received the honorary
degree of Doctor of Laws from that institution in 1893.

Doctor Goode’s mother died in his infancy, and he found in his father’s
second wife an affectionate and sympathetic helper, who was a strong
believer in the possibility of his future scientific career. To her he owed
his introduction to Professor Baird, whom he first saw at Eastport, Maine,
in 1872, and this meeting was the turning point of his professional life.
Through it he not only got the larger opportunities for natural history
work afforded by the Fish Commission and the Smithsonian Institution,
but Professor Baird singled him out almost from the first as his chief
pupil, his intimate friend, his confidential adviser, and his assistant in
all the natural history work in which he was engaged. ‘The splendid
advantages which Professor Baird accorded his young friend were repaid
by an intense devotion.

Mr. Goode said once that he could lay down his life for such a man,
and indeed he almost did so, for his originally robust health was impaired
by this devotion to Professor Baird’s service, particularly at the Centen-
nial Exposition of 1876, which he left invalided, and the effects of his
overwork in which left him a weaker man through his after life. ‘The
death of Professor Baird in 1887 affected him so deeply that it was not
until 1895 that he was once heard to say that he had but just recovered
from the loss.
44 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

He became in 1872 a volunteer in the United States Fish Commission,
the year after the organization of that Bureau, and he continued this
work, making collections in 1872 at Eastport, Maine, in 1873 in Casco
Bay, and in 1874 at Noank, on Long Island Sound. The years from
1872 to 1878 show collections of fishes made by him at the points named,
as well as in Bermuda, Florida, Connecticut, and other places. Nearly
twenty papers and articles relating to the Fish Commission and to fish-
eries appeared from his pen during the first four years of this voluntary
association with the Fish Commission. He was interested not only in
the scientific side of ichthyological work, but devoted great attention to
the economic side. It was in 1877 that he found his first specimen of a
deep-sea fish and laid the foundation of the studies which culminated in
the splendid memoir on Oceanic Ichthyology by himself and Doctor
Bean. During these years with Professor Baird he became experienced
in all the work of the Fish Commission, and upon his death was appointed
Commissioner of Fisheries by the President. The position up to this
time had been an honorary one, but Mr, Goode informed President
Cleveland that the work had grown to such an extent that it was not
possible for any person who was actively engaged in the Smithsonian
Institution or elsewhere to continue it. President Cleveland urged him
several times to permanently accept the position of Commissioner of Fish-
eries, and the Committee on Appropriations of Congress had provided a
salary which was larger than the one which Mr. Goode was receiving or
ever did receive, but he resolutely declined, asserting that his life’s ambi-
tion had been to become associated with the Smithsonian Institution;
that his heart was in the Museum, and that he could not give it up. As
related to his work in the Fish Commission, the facts may be mentioned
that in 1877 he was employed by the Department of State on statistical
work in connection with the Halifax Commission, and in 1879 and 1880
he was in charge of the Fisheries Division of the Tenth Census. His
administrative abilities were strongly brought out in the organization of
this work. Professor Henry F. Osborn describes his method as follows:

Special agents were sent out, to every part of the coast and to the Great Lakes, to
gather information. Goode worked at it himself on Cape Cod, and manifested the
same enthusiasm as in every other piece of work he took up. He interested himself
in getting together a collection representing the methods of the fisheries and the
habits of the fishermen. Neglecting neither the most trivial nor important objects,
branching out into every collateral matter, he showed his grasp both of principles
and of details.

He was United States commissioner to the Internationale Fischerei
Ausstellung in 1880 at Berlin and to the International Fisheries Exposi-
tion held at London in 1883. From circular order No. 139, issued by
Commander J. J. Brice, United States Commissioner of Fish and Fish-
eries, I extract the following sentences:

Doctor Goode is best known for his researches and publications on the fishes and
fisheries of the United States, on which subjects he came to be recognized as the
Memovrr of George Brown Goode. 45

leading authority. . . . He has been one of the most fruitful and valued con-
tributors to the reports and bulletins of the Fish Commission, and in his death the
fishing interests of the country have sustained a severe loss.

As I have before said, his connection with the Smithsonian Institution
followed shortly after the acquaintance with Professor Baird, who invited
him to spend the winter of 1873 in Washington for the purpose of arrang-
ing the ichthyological specimens and with the understanding that as a
payment for this service he was to be allowed to select duplicates for the
museum at Middletown. At that time he had the title of Assistant Cura-
tor, which was later changed to Curator, and although the relations to
Middletown continued, the ties with the Institution were becoming stronger
and stronger. He now met Professor Henry for the first time, and became
one of the small coterie of Smithsonian men who at that time lived in the
Smithsonian building and formed a part of the hospitable household which
Professor Henry maintained. In these early days the staff was an
extremely small one, being only thirteen persons, including honorary
collaborators and subordinates. Doctor Goode threw himself into this
work with uncalculating devotion. Professor Baird’s duties were becom-
ing more and more numerous, and after he became Secretary of the Insti-
tution Doctor Goode took the Museum work upon his willing shoulders.
In 1881, when the new Museum building was completed and the United
States National Museum really organized, Mr. Goode, then thirty years
of age, was made Assistant Director. In that year he prepared a circular,
known as Circular No. 1 of the National Museum, which set forth a
scheme of administration for the Museum so comprehensive in its scope,
so exact in its details, so practical in its ideas that it is with but few
modifications still the guide for the Museum staff. On January 12, 1887,
Professor Baird, whose health was then failing, appointed Mr. Goode as
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National
Museum, and from that time until his death he had the fullest charge of
the entire administration of the Museum.

It is hard to say whether Mr. Goode was best known as a museum
director or a naturalist. I, of course, had more occasion to see his work
from the administrative side. It would be impossible to understand his
success in this field without thinking of the character of the man, and
here I may repeat what I have said elsewhere, that if there was one
quality more than another which formed the basis of his character it was
sincerity—a sincerity which was the ground of a trust and confidence
such as could be instinctively given even from the first only to an
absolutely loyal and truthful nature.

I do not know whether a power of reading character is more intuitive
or acquired, but at any rate without it men may be governed, but not in
harmony, and must be driven rather than led. Doctor Goode was in
this sense a leader, quite apart from his scientific competence. Every
member of the force he controlled, not only among his scientific asso-

ciates, but down to the humblest employees of the Museum, was an indi-
vidual to him, with traits of character which were his own and not
another’s, and which were recognized in all dealings, and in this I think
he was peculiar, for I have known no man who seemed to possess this
sympathetic insight in such a degree, and certainly it was one of the
sources of his strength.

I shall have given, however, a wrong idea of him if I leave anyone
under the impression that this sympathy led to weakness of rule. He
knew how to say ‘‘no,’’ and said it as often as any other, and would rep-
rehend, where occasion called, in terms the plainest and most uncompro-
mising a man could use, speaking so when he thought it necessary, even
to those whose association was voluntary, but who somehow were not
alienated as they would have been by such censure from another. ‘‘He
often refused me what I most wanted,’’ said one of his staff to me; ‘‘ but
I never went to sleep without having in my own mind forgiven him.’’

I have spoken of some of the moral qualities which made all rely upon
him and which were the foundation of his ability to deal with men. To
them was joined that scientific knowledge without which he could not
have been a museum administrator; but even with this knowledge he
could not have been what he was, except from the fact that he loved the
Museum and its administration above every other pursuit, even, I think,
above his own special branch of biological science. He was perhaps a
man of the widest interests I have ever known, so that whatever he
was speaking of at any moment seemed to be the thing he knew best.
It was often hard to say, then, what love predominated; but I think
that he had, on the whole, no pleasure greater than that in his Museum
administration, and that, apart from his family interests and joys, this
was the deepest love of all. He refused advantageous offers to leave it,
though I ought to gratefully add here, that his knowledge of my reliance
upon him and his unselfish desire to aid me were also among his deter-
mining motives in remaining. ‘They were natural ones in such a man.

What were the results of this devotion may be comprehensively seén
in the statement that in the year in which he was first enrolled among
the officers of the Museum, the entries of collections numbered less than
200,000, and the staff, including honorary collaborators and all subordi-
nates, thirteen persons, and by comparing these early conditions with
what they became under his subsequent management.

Professor Baird at the first was an active manager, but from the time
that he became Secretary of the Institution he devolved more and more
of the Museum duties on Doctor Goode, who for nine years preceding
his death was practically in entire charge of it. It is strictly within the
truth, then, to say that the changes which have taken place in the Museum
in that time are more his work than any other man’s, and when we find
that the number of persons employed has grown from thirteen to over
two hundred, and the number of specimens from 200,000 to over 3,000,000,

and consider that what the Museum now is, its scheme and arrangement,
with almost all which make it distinctive, are chiefly Doctor Goode’s, we
have some of the evidence of his administrative capacity. He was fitted
to rule and administer both men and things, and the Museum under his
management was, as some one has called it, ‘‘ A house full of ideas and
a nursery of living thought.’’

His success of administration [says Professor Osborn] also came partly from an
instinctive knowledge of human nature. . . . He sought out the often latent best
qualities of the men around him and developed them. When things were out of
joint and did not move his way, he waited with infinite patience for the slow opera-
tion of time and common sense to set them right. He was singularly considerate of
opinion, . . . fertile of original ideasand suggestions, full of invention and of new
expedients, studying the best models at home and abroad, but never bound by any
traditions of system or of classification. . . . To all his work also he brought
a refined artistic taste, shown in his methods of printing and labeling, as well as in
his encouragement of the artistic, and, therefore, the truthful and realistic develop-
ment of taxidermy in the arrangement of natural groups of animals. To crown all,
like Baird, he entered into the largest conception of the wide-reaching responsibili-
ties of his office under the Government, fully realizing that he was not at the
head of a university or of a metropolitan museum, but of the Museum of a great nation.
Every reasonable request from another institution met a prompt response. :
Not the advancement of Washington science, but of American science, was his
dominating idea.

There was no subject in connection with the administration of the
Museum to which he did not at some time or other give his personal
attention. He had a quick eye for color and for form, understood the art
of decorating and case building, and had besides a special knowledge of
subjects so widely remote from his own biologic interests that it isa
question whether a new species or a new musical instrument gave him
the greater pleasure. So fully could I rely on his judgment in all things,
that even in matters not connected with the Museum I frequently sought
the benefit of his advice, and this was sure to be sound, whether it related
to the typography or paper of a new volume of the publications, or to
some weighty question of policy. It is difficult to single out from among
the manifold matters relating to the Institution proper which were con-
fided to him one single thing. I can not, however, but recall the fact that
he seemed to me, both because of the soundness of his judgment and the
wide domain of science with which he was acquainted, the fittest person
to place in charge of the Hodgkins award made two years ago. To this
entire work, from the time of Mr. Hodgkins’s gift down to the closing
of the award, Mr. Goode gave unremitting and zealous attention, having
served as chairman both of the preliminary committee and the committee
on award.

The field of natural history, of antiquities, of art, of books, is so vast
that a mere assemblage of objects, of books, of prints, of engravings, 1s
not in itself significant. Collecting is an art which many essay but few
attain. Mr. Goode was eminently a collector. As early as 1872 we find
48 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

him collecting the fishes of the Bermudas, which he worked up in a cata-
logue, giving in each case, in addition to characteristics previously noted,
descriptions of the colors of the fishes while living, notes on the size and
proportions, observations of habits, hints in reference to the origin and
meaning of their popular names, and notes upon modes of capture of
economic value. The same careful methods of collection he followed in
the subsequent expeditions which he undertook in the field. It was not
alone in natural history, however, that this talent for collecting displayed
itself. Every possible sort of specimen or information which was at
hand he collected. He would bring back from every exposition which
he attended methodical collections, frequently of materials overlooked by
others. Every visit to a foreign country resulted in the bringing back
of a collection, not of miscellaneous objects, but of a series which could
themselves be placed on exhibition. ‘These might be musical instru-
ments, ecclesiastical art, early printed books, medals, or ivories, and the
same taste and discrimination and good judgment were displayed in their
selection. He collected, however, not only objects, but also words and
ideas. From the assembling of the common names of plants and animals
in America there grew a large collection of Americanisms, probably larger
than any single collection published. Portraits of scientific men, portraits
of Washington and Jefferson, autographs, Confederate imprints, Ameri-
cana, American scientific text-books—these are but a few of the fields
in which Doctor Goode collected.

He was a naturalist in the broadest sense of that word, following in
the footsteps of Agassiz and Baird.

He had [says Doctor Gill] acquaintance with several classes of the animal king-
dom, and especially with the vertebrates. He even published several minor contri-
butions on herpetology, the voices of crustaceans, and other subjects. . . . The
flowering plants also enlisted much of his attention, and his excursions into the fields
and woods were enlivened by a knowledge of the objects he met with.

The designation naturalist [says Professor Osborn] was one which Goode richly
earned and which he held most dear, and our deep sorrow is that his activity as nat-
uralist extended only over a quarter of acentury. . . . Asa naturalist Goode did
not close any of the windows opening out into nature. His breadth of spirit in public
affairs displayed itself equally in his methods of field and sea work and in the variety
of his observations and writings. While fishes became his chief interest, he knew
all the Eastern species of birds after identifying and arranging the collection in his
college museum. He loved plants, and in the later years of his life took great
pleasure in the culture of the old-fashioned garden around his house. . . . Many
of his briefer papers deal directly with the biological problems which attracted his
interest, especially among reptiles and fishes, touching such questions as migration,
coloring, albinism, mimicry, parasitism, feeding and breeding habits, the relation of
forest protection to the protection of fishes.

Perhaps no one can be a ‘‘naturalist’’ in the larger sense without
being directly a lover of Nature and of all natural sights and sounds.
One of his family says:

He taught us all the forest trees, their fruits and flowers in season, and to know
them when bare of leaves by their shapes; all the wayside shrubs, and even the
Memotr of George Brown Goode. 49

flowers of the weeds; all the wild birds and their notes, and the insects. His ideal
of an old age was to have a little place of his own in a mild climate, surrounded by
his books for rainy days, and friends who cared for plain living and high thinking,
with a chance to help someone poorer than he.

He was a loving and quick observer, and in these simple, natural joys,
his studies were his recreations, and were closely connected with his
literary pursuits.

He was of course first and foremost an ichthyologist, and this through
no lack of sympathy with the larger field, but because of the recognition
of the fact that the larger field could not be successfully covered by
one man.

His adherence to this subject as a specialty was undoubtedly deter-
mined by his long and intimate connection with the Fish Commission
during the period of greatest advancement in methods of deep-sea explo-
ration, the rich collections of fishes derived from that source being placed at
his command. The novelties of structure and environment presented by
this material, ever increasing as the work progressed, proved an attraction
too strong to be resisted, even in the face of his varied official duties,
and caused him to become distinctively a student of the marine forms.

His observations were not confined to any single branch of the subject,
but were given the widest latitude that his time permitted. He was the
discoverer of many new and strange species and an acknowledged authority
on classification; but he took perhaps the greatest interest in questions
regarding the geographical and bathymetrical distribution of fishes, a
field in which his opportunities for investigation had been unexcelled.
The color of fishes had also been a favorite study with him, and he had
paid attention to many points in their morphology and in the functions
of special organs. He was especially well versed in the literature of
ichthyology from the earliest times, and after Professor Baird, was the
most eminent exponent in this country of the benefits to be secured
to the practical fisheries through the application of scientific teachings.

Doctor Gill, in reviewing his scientific career, said:

A Catalogue of the Fishes of the Bermudas,' published in 1876, furnished addi-
tional evidence of knowledge of the literature of his subject and ability to use it to
advantage in the discussion of mooted questions, and it also evinced his power of
observation.

In the same year, 1876, appeared another work which, to a still greater degree,
rendered manifest those same mental characteristics. The work was only a cata-
logue, but perhaps from no other publication can some intellectual qualities be so
readily and correctly gauged by a competent judge as an elaborate catalogue. Powers
of analysis and synthesis, and the ability to weigh the relative values of the material
at hand, may make a ‘‘mere catalogue’ a valuable epitome of a collection and of a
science. Such a production was the Classification of the Collection to illustrate the

Animal Resources of the United States,t a work of 126 pages; three years later this
catalogue served as the basis for and was elaborated and expanded into a large Cata-
logue of the Collection to illustrate the Animal Resources and the Fisheries of the
United States,? a volume of 351 pages. These catalogues were for the tentative and
adopted arrangement of material exhibited by the Smithsonian Institution and the
United States Fish Commission at the International Exhibition, 1876.

It was the ability that was manifested in these catalogues and the work incidental
to their preparation that especially arrested the attention of Professor Baird and
marked the author as one well adapted for the direction of a great museum. For
signal success in such direction special qualifications are requisite. Only some of
them are a mind well trained in analytical as well as synthetic methods, an artistic
sense, critical ability, and multifarious knowledge, but above all the knowledge of
men and how to deal with them. Perhaps no one has ever combined in more har-
monious proportions, such qualifications than G. Brown Goode. In him the National
Museum of the United States and the world at large have lost one of the greatest of
museum administrators.

As a naturalist, the attention of Doctor Goode was especially directed to and even
concentrated on the fishes. His memoirs, contributed mostly to the Proceedings of
the United States National Museum, were numerous and chiefly descriptive of new
species. (For many of these he had, as a collaborator Doctor Tarleton Bean, then
the curator of fishes of the United States National Museum.) Some of the memoirs,
however, dealt with special groups, as the Menhaden (1879), Ostraciontidee (1880),
Carangidze (1881), the Swordfishes (1881), and the Kel (1882). His monograph of
the Menhaden (4revoortia tyrannus) contributed originally to the Report of the
United States Commissioner of Fisheries3 and then published as a separate work 4—
a large volume of nearly 550 pages and with 30 plates—is a model of critical treat-
ment of information collected from all quarters. But his most important contribu-
tions were published as official Government reports and were the results of investiga-
tions especially undertaken for such reports. Especially noteworthy were the
volumes comprising the results of the census of 188o.

The 1880 census was planned and carried out on an unusual scale. For the fish-
eries the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries cooperated and Doctor
Goode had general charge of the entire work. The assistants and special agents

were consequently selected with judgment and the results were very valuable.
The huge mass of statistics was digested and condensed in seven large quarto
volumes representing five sections separately devoted to special branches of the
subject.*

Doctor Goode’s cares were mainly concentrated on the first section, treating of
the Natural History of Aquatic Animals, which was discussed in over 900 pages of
text and illustrated by 277 plates. This work was by far the most complete survey
of the economical fishes of the country that had ever appeared and has since been
the most prized; it led to another.

After the appearance of the census volumes, Doctor Goode was urged to prepare a
work for popular use. His consent to do so was followed by a volume, entitled
American Fishes, A Popular Treatise upon the Game and Food Fishes of North
America,? published by the Standard Book Company of New York. Inasmuch as
none of the previous popular works on the American fishes had emanated from men
of scientific eminence, it scarcely need be added that the new work had no rival in
the field, so far as accurate information and details of habits were involved.

A short time previously Doctor Goode had also prepared the text to accompany a
series of twenty large folio colored portraits by an eminent artist, Mr. S. A. Kil-
bourne, of the principal Game Fishes of the United States.3

Never had investigations of the deep sea been conducted with such assiduity and
skill as during the last two decades. The chief honors of the explorations were
carried off by the British and American governments. As the fishes obtained
by the vessels of the United States Fish Commission were brought in, they were
examined by Doctor Goode (generally in company with Doctor Bean) and duly
described. At length Doctors Goode and Bean combined together data respecting
all the known forms occurring in the abysmal depths of the ocean and also those
of the open sea, and published a résumé of the entire subject in two large volumes
entitled Oceanic Ichthyology.4

This was a fitting crown to the work on which they had been engaged so long
and the actual publication only preceded Doctor Goode’s death by a few weeks.

But the published volumes did not represent all the work of Doctor Goode on the
abyssalian fishes. He had almost completed an elaborate memoir on the distribu-

tion of those fishes, and, contrary to the conclusions of former laborers in the same
field, had recognized for them a number of different faunal areas. It is to be hoped
that this may yet be given to the world.

Morphological and descriptive ichthyology were not cultivated to the exclusion
of what is regarded as more practical features. In connection with his official
duties as an officer of the United States Fish Commission he studied the subject of
pisciculture in all its details. Among his many contributions to the subject are one
on The First Decade of the United States Commission, its plan of work and accom-
plished results, scientific and economical (1880), another treating of the Epochs in
the History of Fish Culture (1881), and two encyclopedic articles—The Fisheries of
the World (1882), and the one entitled Pisciculture, in the Encyclopedia Britannica
(1885 ).

The great work of his life, Oceanic Ichthyology [says Doctor Jordan], was, how-
ever, written during the period of his directorship of the National Museum, and it
was published but a month before his death. Almost simultaneously with this were
other important publications of the National Museum, which were his also in a
sense, for they would never have been undertaken except for his urgent wish and
encouragement. If a personal word may be pardoned, The Fishes of North and
Middle America, which closely followed Oceanic Ichthyology, would never have
been written except for my friend’s repeated insistence and generous help.

The first recorded scientific paper of Doctor Goode is a notet On the Occurrence of
the Bill-fish in fresh Water in the Connecticut River. The next is a critical discus-
sion of the answers to the question Do Snakes Swallow their Young? In this paper
he shows that there is good reason to believe that in certain viviparous snakes, the
young seek refuge inthe stomach of the mother when frightened, and that they
come out unharmed when the reason for their retreat has passed.

The first of the many technical and descriptive papers on fishes was the Catalogue
of the Fishes of the Bermudas,’ published in 1876. This is a model record of field
observations and is one of the best of local catalogues. Doctor Goode retained his
interest in this outpost of the great West Indian fauna, and from time to time
recorded the various additions made to his first Bermudan catalogue.

After this followed a large number of papers on fishes, chiefly descriptions of
species or monographs of groups. The descriptive papers were nearly all written in
association with his excellent friend, Doctor Tarleton H. Bean, then Curator of Fishes
in the National Museum.

In monographic work Doctor Goode took the deepest interest, and he delighted
especially in the collection of historic data concerning groups of species. The
quaint or poetical features of such work were never overlooked by him. Notable
among these monographs are those of the Menhaden, the Trunk-fishes, and the Sword-
fishes.

The economic side of science also interested him more and more. ‘That scientific
knowledge could add to human wealth or comfort was no reproach in his eyes. In
his notable monograph of the Menhaden the economic value as food or manure of
this plebeian fish received the careful attention which he had given to the problems
of pure science.

Doctor Goode’s power in organizing and coordinating practical investigations was
shown in his monumental work4 on the American Fisheries for the Tenth Census

in 1880. The preparation of the record of the fisheries and associated aquatic indus-
tries was placed in his hands by Francis A. Walker, Superintendent of the Census.
Under Doctor Goode’s direction skilled investigators were sent to every part of the
coast and inland waters of the country.

His American Fishes, a popular treatise upon the game and food fishes
of North America, published in 1888, is deserving of a special mention
both because of the charming literary style in which it is written as well
as its scientific accuracy and excellence. The wealth and aptness of the
chapter headings of this book show that Mr. Goode’s wide reading was
associated with everything which could illustrate his science on the
literary side. He had a knowledge of everything even remotely con-
nected with his ichthyological researches, from St. Anthony’s Sermon
to Fishes, to the literature of fish cookery, while in one of his earliest
papers, written at nineteen, his fondness for Isaac Walton and _ his
familiarity with him are evident.

While never claiming the title of anthropologist, he was yet a close
student of the anthropological and ethnological work in this country and
abroad, and it is not too much to say that no professional anthropologist
had a higher ideal of what his science might come to be or exercised a
more discriminating criticism on its present methods and conditions than
did Doctor Goode. He was, moreover, not only interested in the bio-
logical problems of the anthropologist, but in technology and the history
of art. The history of human invention and archzeology were equally in
his mind, and his suggestiveness in each of these fields could be attested
by all of the anthropologists with whom he came in contact.

It would be difficult [says Professor Mason] to find among those who are pro-
fessional anthropologists a man who had a more exalted idea of what this science
ought to be. There is not, perhaps, another distinguished scholar who has endeay-

ored to collect into one great anthropological scheme all of the knowledge of all
men in all ages of the world and in all stages of culture.

Doctor Goode was peculiarly related to the management of expositions
and did more than any other person in America to engraft upon them
museum ideas and widen their scope from the merely commercial and
industrial to the educational and scientific.

His first experience in this field was in 1876, at the Centennial Exhi-
bition held in Philadelphia. Professor Baird was in charge of the exhibits
of the Smithsonian Institution and Fish Commission, and being much
occupied at the time with other matters, the greater part of the installa-
tion and other work connected with the exhibit was placed under the
immediate supervision of Mr. Goode. The work done by the Smithso-
nian and Government departments at this exhibition was pioneer work,
it being the first international exhibition in which the United States Gov-
ernment was engaged. It is not too much to say that the arrangement
of the Smithsonian exhibit at Philadelphia was the model on which all
subsequent exhibits of the kind were based, and that the classification,
the installation, and the arrangement have had a lasting influence on
54 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

exhibition work everywhere. But every administrative activity of this
sort was sure to result in some literary product, so that we find in 1876
Mr. Goode published A Classification of the Collections to illustrate the
Animal Resources of the United States: A list of substances derived
from the animal kingdom, with synopsis of the useful and injurious ani-
mals, and a classification of the methods of capture and utilization. This
work was afterwards published in an enlarged form as a bulletin of the
National Museum.

His services as commissioner for the United States Government at the
Fisheries Exhibition of Berlin in 1880 and London in 1883 have already
been alluded to. ‘These, too, resulted in several articles in German and in
a bulletin of the Museum, while several addresses and papers delivered
at the Conferences of the International Fisheries Exhibition in London
were published in the papers of the conferences, and full reports were
made by Doctor Goode on his return to this country and published at
the Government Printing Office.

He was the representative of the Smithsonian Institution at all the
subsequent exhibitions held in this country—Louisville, 1884; New
Orleans, 1885; Cincinnati, 1888; Chicago, 1893, and Atlanta, 1895—
serving also as a commissioner and for a time acting Commissioner-Gen-
eral to the Columbian Exposition held at Madrid in 1892.

The exhibits made under his direction were never repetitions. Each
one contained new material never shown before, and exhibited the prog-
ress of the Institution and Museum, as well as the advances made in
the arts of taxidermy, installation, and labeling. Mr. Goode, too,
always bore in mind the local interest, and endeavored to show speci-
mens and materials which would be instructive to persons residing in the
neighborhood of the place at which the exposition was held. ‘Thus at
Cincinnati objects were prominent which related to the Ohio Valley, for
Madrid he prepared an exhibit to illustrate the conditions of human and
animal life in America at the time of the Spanish discovery, whilst at
Atlanta especial stress was laid on showing the fauna, flora, archeeology,
and mineral resources of the South Atlantic States. He prepared the
report on the Madrid Exposition, and at the request of the Governfnent
Commission drew up a provisional classification for the Chicago Exposi-
tion, which, while not formally accepted, was used throughout in the
official classification, many pages being copied without a change. For
the Chicago, as well as the Atlanta Exposition, he prepared a carefully
written catalogue, and for the latter an excellently condensed sketch of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Nowhere were Mr. Goode’s administrative talents more strongly
shown than in an exhibition. The plans of the floor space, the cases,
the specimens were all carefully arranged in advance. Boxes were
especially made of lumber which could be utilized for cases or platforms.
Cases were marked, and not very long before the opening of the exposi-

tion the entire mass would be deposited on the bare space assigned to
the Smithsonian exhibit. Usually other exhibitors had their material
half arranged by this time, and the fear was expressed by sympathetic
bystanders that the Smithsonian would not be ready. ‘The cases would
be unpacked and the specimens put in them in whatever position they
happened to stand, and up to the last day all would seem to be in con-
fusion; but Doctor Goode knew his resources and his men as a general
knows his army. Suddenly all detailed work would come to an end,
and in the course of a few hours, as if by magic, the entire exhibit would
be put in place. He had a pardonable pride in this sort of generalship,
for whether at Chicago or Atlanta it had never failed him, and it earned
the highest encomiums at Berlin, London, and Madrid.

Doctor Goode’s services at these various expositions were recognized
by diplomas and medals, and from the Spanish Government he received
the order of Isabella the Catholic, with the grade of commander.

I have already spoken of Mr. Goode’s administrative qualities as shown
in his management of the National Museum; but his contributions to
museum administration and the history of museums were not confined to
his own work. From all parts of America and even as far distant as
Australia his opinion was sought with regard to the plans for museum
buildings as well as on minor matters of installation. All requests for
such information and advice were fully answered in minute detail.

It was into his papers on museums that some of his best thoughts went,
and it was there that we find epigrammatic statements which are con-
stantly quoted by all interested in the matter.

The first paper by him on this subject appeared in the College Argus,
March 22,1871. It was entitled Our Museum, and was a description of
the collectionin Judd Hall. This article indicated plainly the museum
instinct, for it was largely intended to make known the deficiencies in
the collection, and pointed out how students and professors could make
these good on their summer excursions. He also published a guide to
this museum.

In 1888 he read before the American Historical Association a paper
entitled Museum History and Museums of History. Here he traced
the growth of the museum idea from the beginning down to the present
time, repeating his now oft-quoted phrase, ‘‘An efficient educational
museum may be described as a collection of instructive labels, each illus-
trated by a well-selected specimen.’’ Atlases of ethnological portraits
and works like those of Audubon he described as ‘‘not books, but
museum specimens, masquerading in the dress of books.’’

Even more forcible was a lecture delivered before the Brooklyn Insti-
tute in 1889, entitled Museums of the Future. ‘‘The museum of the
past,’’ he wrote, ‘‘must be set aside, reconstructed, transformed from a
cemetery of bric-a-brac into a nursery of living thoughts.’?’ . . . ‘‘The
people’s museum should be much more than a house full of specimens
56 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

in glass cases. It should be a house full of ideas, arranged with the
strictest attention to system.’”’ . . . ‘‘A finished museum is a dead
museum, and a dead museum is a useless museum.’’

Most noteworthy, however, was his paper contributed to the Museums
Association of Great Britain in 1895, entitled The Principles of Museum
Administration. This was a carefully prepared codification of ‘‘the
accepted principles of museum administration,’’ which Mr. Goode hoped
would ‘‘be the cause of much critical discussion.’’ "The ideas were
presented in the form of aphorisms and were exceptionally clear cut,
ending with the assertion that ‘‘the degree of civilization to which any
nation, city, or province has attained is best shown by the character of
its public museums and the liberality with which they are maintained.”’

This paper was warmly welcomed by museum experts, many of
whom testified by their letters the interest they had in the clear pre-
sentation of the principles which should guide the museum administrator.
At the 1896 meeting of the same association Mr. Bather said: ‘‘ When I
read the magnificently exhaustive address by Doctor G. Brown Goode,
published in our last report, it was manifest that all the ideas I had ever
had were anticipated in that masterly production ;’’ whilst an obituary
note in the same volume says, ‘‘ His early death is a great loss, not only
to the United States Museum, but to museums in general, for he took a
deep and active interest in all things affecting their development and
well-being.” :

The Manchester Guardian, September 20, 1896, says:

He was a recognized authority on all matters affecting museum administration,
and in this capacity he last year wrote a paper on the principles of museum manage-
ment and economy, which was brought before the annual congress of the Museums
Association at Newcastle, and has since attracted much attention as an admirable
exposition of the general theory of administration applicable to museum work in all
its branches. It is of interest to note that Doctor Goode’s definition of a museum is
an institution for the preservation of those objects which best illustrate the phenom-
ena of nature and the works of man, and the utilization of these for the increase of
knowledge and for the culture and enlightenment of the people. In this spirit
Doctor Goode worked, and he not only achieved much in his own country, but was

also ever ready to cordially cooperate with foreign kindred institutions, especially
those in England, for the advancement of museum work as a means of education.

These activities would have been sufficient for an ordinary man, but in
addition he was the historian of American science.

In 1886 he delivered, as president of the Biological Society of Wash-
ington, an address entitled The Beginnings of Natural History in Amer-
ica, tracing it from Thomas Harriott, who came to this country in 1585,
reciting the scientific labors of Captain John Smith, John Ray, Thomas
Jefferson, and a host of others. ‘The spirit which actuated this address
is well illustrated in the following paragraph:

It seems to me unfortunate, therefore, that we should allow the value of the labors

of our predecessors to be depreciated, or to refer to the naturalists of the last century
as belonging to the unscientific or the archaic period. It has been frequently said
Memoir of George Brown Goode. Cy;

by naturalists that there was no science in America until after the beginning of the
present century. This is, in one sense, true, in another, very false. There were
then, it is certain, many men equal in capacity, in culture, in enthusiasm, to the
naturalists of to-day, who were giving careful attention to the study of precisely the
same phenomena of nature. The misfortune of the men of science of 1785 was that
they had three generations fewer of scientific predecessors than have we.

This address he followed up by a second, entitled The Beginnings of
American Science. The Third Century, delivered in 1887, also before the
Biological Society. He divided the period from 1782 to 1888 into three
periods, which he called after the names of Jefferson, Silliman, and
Agassiz.

Continuing along this same line, he contributed to the American His-
torical Association, in *890, a paper on The Origin of the National Scien-
tific and Educational Institutions of the United States.

The material contained in these various papers was summed up in an
unpublished work entitled What has been done for Science in America,
1492-1892, which illustrates in an interesting way the development of
Doctor Goode’s mind, for in this study as much attention is given to
astronomy, physics, and even comparative philology as is paid to natural
history. Parallel with this work may be mentioned a collection of por-
traits of almost every scientific man of importance mentioned in any of
these four essays. Besides these, he wrote an article in the Science
News, 1878, entitled The earliest American Naturalist, Thomas
Harriott.

He was greatly interested in American history, a close student of the
writings of the fathers—more especially of Washington and Jefferson—
and an enthusiastic investigator of Virginia history, for which he had
assembled a great mass of original material. He was especially interested
in the study of institutional history, which he thought approximated
most nearly to the scientific method. It is more than likely that this
interest grew out of his studies in genealogy, the most splendid result of
which is his Virginia Cousins, though a great mass of material, still
unpublished, attests the fact that these genealogical collections were
intended to cover the South and to serve as a contribution to Southern
history. He relates in the prologue to his Virginia Cousins that his
interest in the Goode family tree was awakened in him by his father at
the age of twelve.

The significance of genealogical studies for American listory he recog-
nizes in the following words: ‘‘’The time is coming when the sociologist
and the historian will make an extensive use of the facts so laboriously
gathered and systematically classified by genealogists, and it is probable
that this can be better done in the United States than elsewhere;’’ and
again, ‘‘One of the elements of satisfaction in genealogical study legiti-
mately arises from the success of our attempts to establish personal rela-
tions with past ages and to be able to people our minds with the images
of our forefathers as they lived two, three, four hundred years ago.”’
58 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

But there was a scientific interest which attached to this work, as well
as an historical one, for Doctor Goode was a strong believer in heredity,
and he was profoundly impressed with the idea that man’s capabilities
and tendencies were to be explained by the characteristics of the men
and women whose blood flowed through their veins.

This idea, too, is brought out strongly in his biographical work,
nowhere more strongly than in his biographies of Henry, Baird, and
Langley (almost the last work he ever did) for the Smithsonian Memo-
rial Volume, and it is carefully worked out in an elaborate plan of a
biography of Professor Baird, which would probably have been the next
literary work he would have undertaken had his life been spared.

He was greatly interested in bibliography, his methods in this work
being most exact. He published bibliographies of Spencer Fullerton
Baird, Charles Girard, Philip Lutley Sclater, and had under way bibli-
ographies of Theodore Gill and David Starr Jordan.

A gigantic work in the same line [says Dr. Gill] had been projected by him and
most of the materials collected; it was no less than a complete bibliography of
Ichthyology, including the names of all genera and species published as new. In
no way may Ichthyology, at least, more feel the loss of Goode than in the loss of
the complete bibliography.

Mr. Goode was a student of the history of the scientific societies, and
was himself deeply interested in their welfare. In all the Washington
scientific societies he was an active member, serving as president both of
the Biological Society and the Philosophical Society, before which he
delivered notable addresses on the history of American science. He
also belonged to the Anthropological and Geographic societies of Wash-
ington and stoutly maintained the traditions of all these. He was elected
a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1888, was for many
years a member of the Association for the Advancement of Science, being
elected vice-president of the zoological section last summer, a few days
before his death. He was a member of the American Philosophical
Society, of the American Society of Naturalists, and a Fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and among foreign societies he
had been honored by election to the Société des Amis des Sciences Nat-
urelles de Moscou, Société Zodlogique de France, Zoological Society of
London, and the Société Scientifique du Chile.

He seemed to regard historical and patriotic societies with an equal
interest, being a member of the council of the American Historical
Association and a member of the Virginia Historical Society, and the
Columbian Historical Society of Washington, and of the newly formed
Southern Historical Society. His work in connection with the hereditary
and patriotic societies was so especially near to him as to demand an
unusual mention. He was one of the organizers of the Sons of the
American Revolution of the District of Columbia, holding the offices of
vice-president-general and registrar-general in the national society, and at
Memoir of George Brown Goode. 59

the time of his death of president in the local society. He stimulated
this society to issue historical publications, and saw a number through the
press himself. A society known as the Sons of the Revolution having
been founded with somewhat similar aims, Mr. Goode joined this organi-
zation with the avowed purpose of bringing them together. In this society
he held the office of vice-president. He was lieutenant-governor of the
Society of Colonial Wars of the District of Columbia. He gave constant
advice to the Daughters of the American Revolution during the period
of their organization, and was instrumental in having the State of Massa-
chusetts present, as a home for the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion. in Georgia, its building at the Atlanta Exposition, which was a copy
of the old Craigie house in Cambridge, once occupied by Washington
as his headquarters, and later the residence of Longfellow. The success
of this effort gave him special pleasure, for he regarded it as one of the
means for promoting friendliness between the people of New England
and the people of the South.

Although these numerous duties and activities would seem to have been
more than enough for any single man, Mr. Goode did not stop here.
Every scientific activity of the Government had at some time or other
the advantage of his wise counsel and his active cooperation. His public
duties outside of the Smithsonian in connection with the Department of
State, the Fish Commission, the census, and the various expositions
abroad at which he represented his Government I have already alluded
to; but he was possessed of a higher order of patriotism which even
this service did not satisfy. Mr. William L. Wilson, Regent of the
Smithsonian Institution, lately Postmaster-General of the United States,
and president of Washington and Lee University, says:

He was a richly endowed man, first, with that capacity and that resistless bent
toward the work in which he attained his great distinction that made it a perennial
delight to him; but he was scarcely less richly endowed in his more unpretending
and large human sympathies, and it was this latter that distinguished him as a
citizen and a historian.

As a citizen he was full of patriotic American enthusiasm. He understood, as all
must understand who look with seriousness upon the great problems that confront a
free people and who measure the difficulties of those problems—he understood that
at least one preparation for the discharge of the duties of American citizenship was
the general education of the people, and so he advocated as far as possible bringing
within the reach of all the people not only the opportunities but the attractions
and the incitements to intellectual living.

Doctor Goode, with the quick and warm sympathies of the man and of the histo-
rian, seems to have felt that he could do no greater service to the people of his day
and generation and to his country than in the most attractive and concrete way, if I
may so express it, to lead the young men of this country to the study of the history

of the past, to the deeds and the writings of the great men to whom we owe the
foundation and the perpetuation of our institutions.

He was greatly interested in the establishment of a national university,
and in 1891 read a paper in Philadelphia, afterwards printed in the
bo Memorial of George Brown Goode.

magazine Lend a Hand, edited by Edward Everett Hale, entitled Wash-
ington’s University the Nation’s Debt of Honor. In this article he
computed that the bequest of Washington to the United States for a
national university would, at compound interest, amount, in 1892, to
$4,100,000, and he proposed that the National Government should
restore this sum as the nucleus of the endowment for the National
University. He acted as secretary of the executive committee, of which
the Chief Justice was chairman, which was laboring to this end, and
spared no effort to bring it to a successful conclusion.

Another project in which he was interested and for which he labored
was a movement to fully open French universities to American students.
His interest was excited in this movement because he thought that
American science was becoming one-sided, owing to the fact that all of
the students who went abroad visited German universities. Of the
American cominittee, which, in cooperation with the French committee,
had this matter in charge, Doctor Goode was the secretary, and he had
the satisfaction of seeing this project brought to a successful issue before
his death.

He had a strong interest in literature, and wrote in an excellent Eng-
lish style—clear, direct, and unpretentious. I have never met a mind in
touch with more far-away and disconnected points than his, nor one of
the same breadth and variety of writing, outside of the range of his own
specialty. He had fine zesthetic tastes and derived keen enjoyment from
everything that was beautiful in nature or in art. He knew all natural
sights and sounds, and recognized the note of every bird. He knew
good pictures and good prints, was familiar with all the processes of
graphic arts, and a good judge of them, both on the technical and the
artistic side. He loved a beautifully printed book and an artistic bind-
ing. All these tastes he utilized in the publications which he wrote or
edited. The work which he had in hand at the time of his death and to
which he devoted so much loving care, the History of the First Half
Century of the Smithsonian Institution, he aimed to make the expression
of all these tastes. ‘To no writing which he ever did, did he bring a
higher literary expression than to the pages which he prepared for this
book. He was at infinite trouble in discussing such matters as the form
of the page, the style of the type, the quality of the paper, the initial
letters, the headlines and illustrations, and the binding, and when he
discussed any of these points with the expert craftsmen his knowledge
of the details was as full as their own.

In spite of ill health and suffering, his overwrought nervous system,
and his occasional severe mental depression, he never allowed himself to
take a cynical view of human nature. He was a man who loved his
fellow-men, and to whom that love was repaid with a warmth to a degree
rare in this day. He made all other men’s concerns his own. He sent
notes and suggestions to hundreds of scientific men, whose work profited
Memotr of George Brown Goode. 61

thereby, and in the large circle of friends he had, scarcely one did not at
one time or other come to Mr. Goode for advice and sympathy upon his
own private affairs. He was an intensely loyal American patriot, ever
careful that nothing should be said or done that should in anyway reflect
upon his country. He was especially devoted to Virginia and never hap-
pier than when he could spend a few days on her soil, looking over a
historic house or copying some of the records which he hoped to turn to
advantage in his historical studies.

‘* He is remembered,’’ says Doctor Dall, ‘‘as one never weary of well-
doing; who reached the heights, though ever aiming higher; whose
example stimulated and whose history will prove a lasting inspiration.”’

‘“As a public-spirited naturalist,’’ says Professor Osborn, ‘‘he leaves us
the tender memory and the noble example, which helps us and will help
many coming men into the higher conception of duty in the service and
promotion of the truth. Wecan not forget his smile nor his arm passing
through the arm of his friend.’’

I have never known a more perfectly sincere and loyal character than
Doctor Goode’s, or a man who, with better judgment of other men or
greater ability in molding their purposes to his own, used these powers
to such uniformly disinterested ends, so that he could maintain the dis-
cipline of a great establishment like the National Museum while still
retaining the personal affection of every subordinate.

I have scarcely alluded to his family life, for of his home we are not
to speak here, further than to say that he was eminently a domestic
man, finding the highest joys that life brought him with his family and
children.

He has gone; and on the road where we are all going there has not
preceded us a man who lived more for others, a truer man, a more loyal
friend.

MUSEUM-HISTORY AND MUSEUMS OF HISTORY’

By GEORGE BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the U.S. National
Museum,

The true significance of the word museum may perhaps best be
brought to our apprehension by an allusion to the ages which preceded
its origin—when our ancestors, hundreds of generations removed, were
in the midst of those great migrations which peopled Europe with races
originally seated farther to the east.

It has been well said that the story of early Greece is the first chapter
in the history of the political and intellectual life of Europe.

To the history of Greece let us go for the origin of the museum idea,
which in its present form seems to have found its only congenial home
among the European offshoots of the Indo-Germanic division of the
world’s inhabitants.

Museums, in the language of ancient Greece, were the homes of the
muses. The first were in the groves of Parnassus and Helicon, and later
they were temples in various parts of Hellas. Soon, however, the mean-
ing of the word changed, and it was used to describe a place of study, or
aschool. Athenzeus described Athens in the second century as “‘the
museum of Greece,’’ and the name of museum was definitely applied to
that portion of the palace of Alexandria which was set apart for the study
of the sciences, and which contained the famous Alexandrian library.
The museum of Alexandria was a great university, the abiding place of
men of science and letters, who were divided into many companies or
colleges, and for whose support a handsome revenue was allotted.

The Alexandrian museum was destroyed in the days of Caesar and
Aurelian, and the term museum, as applied to a great public institution,
dropped out of use from the fourth to the seventeenth century. The
disappearance of a word is an indication that the idea for which it stood
has also fallen into disfavor; and such, indeed, was the fact. ‘The his-
tory of museum and library run in parallel lines. It is not until the
development of the arts and sciences has taken place, until an extensive

December 26-28, 1888.

written literature has grown up, and a distinct literary and scientific
class has been developed, that it is possible for the modern library and
museum to come into existence. ‘The museum of the present is more dis-
similar to its old-time representative than is our library to its prototype.

There were in the remote past galleries of pictures and sculpture, as
well as so-called museums. Public collections of paintings and statuary
were founded in Greece and Rome at a very early day. ‘There was a
gallery of paintings (Pinacotheca) in one of the marble halls of the pro-
pyleum at Athens, and in Rome there were lavish public displays of
works of art. M. Dezobry, in his Rome in the Time of Augustus, has
described this phase of Latin civilization in the first century before
Christ:

For many years [remarks one of his characters] the taste for paintings has been
extending in a most extraordinary manner. In former times they were only to be
found in the temples, where they were placed less for purposes of ornament than
as an act of homage to the gods; now they are everywhere, not only in temples, in
private houses, and in public halls, but also on outside walls, exposed freely to air
and sunlight. Rome is one great picture gallery; the Forum of Augustus is gor-
geous with paintings, and they may be seen also in the Forum of Ceesar, in the
Roman Forum, under the peristyles of many of the temples, and especially in the
porticos used for public promenades, some of which are literally filled with them.
Thus everybody is enabled to enjoy them, and to enjoy them at all hours of the
day.

The public men of Rome, at a later period in its history, were no less
mindful of the claims of art. They believed that the metropolis of a great
nation should be adorned with all the best products of civilization. We
are told by Pliny that when Cezesar was dictator, he purchased, for 300,000
deniers, two Greek paintings, which he caused to be publicly displayed,
and that Agrippa placed many costly works of art in a hall which he built
and bequeathed to the Roman people. Constantine gathered together in
Constantinople the paintings and sculptures of the great masters, so that
the city, before its destruction, became a great museum, like Rome.

The taste for works of art was generally prevalent throughout the
whole Mediterranean region in the days of the ancient civilizations, and
there is abundant reason to believe that there were prototypes of the
modern museum in Persia, Assyria, Babylonia, and Egypt, as well as in
Rome. Collections in natural history also undoubtedly existed, though
we have no positive descriptions of them. Natural curiosities, of course,
found their way into the private collections of monarchs, and were doubt-
less also in use for study among the savants in the Alexandrian museum.
Aristotle, in the fourth century before Christ, had, it is said, an enormous
grant of money for use in his scientific researches, and Alexander the
Great, his patron, ‘‘took care to send to him a great variety of zoological
specimens, collected in the countries which he had subdued,’’ and also
‘placed at his disposal several thousand persons, who were occupied
in hunting, fishing, and making the observations which were necessary
for completing his History of Animals.’? If human nature has not

changed more than we suppose, Aristotle must have had a great museum
of natural history.

When the Roman capital was removed to Byzantium, the arts and
letters of Europe began to decline. The Church was unpropitious, and
the invasions of the northern barbarians destroyed everything. In 476,
with the close of the Western Empire, began a period of intellectual
torpidity which was to last for a thousand years.

It was in Bagdad and Cordova that science and letters were next to be
revived, and Africa was to surpass Europe in the extent of its libraries.
In the Periplus, or Voyage of Hanno, occurs the following passage
in regard to specimens of Gorillas, or ‘‘ Gorgones:’’

Pursuing them, we were not able to take the men (males); they all escaped, being
able to climb the precipices, and defended themselves with pieces of rock. But three
women (females), who bit and scratched those who led them, were not willing to
follow. However, having killed them, we flayed them, and conveyed the skins to
Carthage; for we did not sail any further, as provisions began to fail.!

With the Renaissance came a period of new life for collectors. The
churches of southern Europe became art galleries, and monarchs and
noblemen and ecclesiastical dignitaries collected books, manuscripts,
sculptures, pottery, and gems, forming the beginning of collections
which have since grown into public museums. Some of these collec-
tions doubtless had their first beginnings in the midst of the dark ages,
within the walls of feudal castles, or the larger monasteries, but their
number was small, and they must have consisted chiefly of those objects
so nearly akin to literature as especially to command the attention of
bookish men.

As soon as it became the fashion for the powerful and the wealthy to
possess collections, the scope of their collections began to extend, and
objects were gathered on account of their rarity or grotesqueness, as well
as for their beauty or instructiveness. Flourens, in his Life and Works
of Blumenbach, remarks: ‘‘The old Germany, with its old chateaux,
seemed to pay no homage to science; still the lords of these ancient and
noble mansions had long since made it a business, and almost a point of
honor, to form with care what were called cabinets of curiosities.’’

To the apothecary of old, with his shop crowded with the curious
substances used in the medical practice of his day, the museum owes
some of its elements, just as the modern botanic garden owes its earliest
history to the ‘‘physic garden,’’ which in its time was an outgrowth

of the apothecary’s garden of simples. "The apothecary in Romeo and
Juliet —
In whose needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
Of eel-shaped fishes, —

was the precursor of the modern museum keeper. In the hostelries and
taverns, the gathering places of the people in the sixteenth and seven-

teenth centuries, there grew up little museums of curiosities from foreign
lands, while in the great fairs were always exhibited sundry gatherings
of strange and entertaining objects.

At the middle of the last century there appear to have been several
such collections of curiosities in Britain.

In Artedi’s ichthyological works there are numerous references to
places where he had seen American fishes, especially at Spring Garden
(later known as the Vauxhall Garden, a famous place of resort), and at
the Nag’s Head, and the White Bear, and the Green Dragon in
Stepney, in those days a famous hostelry in London. He speaks also of
collections at the houses of Mr. Lillia and in that of Master Saltero (the
barber-virtuoso, described by Bulwer in his Devereux), in Chelsea
and at Stratford, and also in the collection of Seba, in Amsterdam, and
in that of Hans Sloane.

With the exception of ‘‘¢he monk or Angel-fish, Anglis, alias Mermaid-
jish,” probably a species of Sguzatina, which he saw at the Nag’s Head,
all the fishes in these London collections belonged to the order Plectog-
nathi.

Josselyn, in his Two Voyages to New England (1638-1673), after
telling us how a Piscataway colonist had the fortune to killa Pilhannaw —
the king of the birds of prey—continues, ‘‘ How he disposed of her I
know not, but had he taken her alive and sent her over into England,
neither Bartholomew or Sturbridge Fair could have produced such
another sight.”’

Shakespeare’s mirror strongly reflects the spirit of the day. When
Trinculo, cast ashore upon a lonesome island, catches a glimpse of Caliban,
he exclaims :

What have we here? A man ora fish? Dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a
fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell. . . . astrange fish! Were I in England
now, (as once I was), and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would
give a piece of silver; there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there

makes a man: when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay
out ten to see a dead Indian.

The idea of a great national museum of science and art was first worked
out by Lord Bacon in his New Atlantis, a philosophical romance pub-
lished at the close of the seventeenth century. ‘The first scientific
museum actually founded was that begun at Oxford in 1667, by Elias
Ashmole, still known as the Ashmolean Museum, composed chiefly of
natural history specimens collected by the botanists Tradescant, father
and son, in Virginia, and in the north of Africa. Soon after, in 1753,
the British Museum was established by act of Parliament, inspired by
the will of Sir Hans Sloane, who, dying in 1749, left to the nation his
invaluable collection of books, manuscripts, and curiosities.’

?The collections of Sloane, who was one of the early scientific explorers of
America, were like those of the Tradescants, contained many New World speci-

Many of the great national museums of Europe had their origin in the
private collections of monarchs. France claims the honor of having been
the first to change a royal into a national museum, when, in 1789, the
Louvre came into the possession of a republican government. It is very
clear, however, that democratic England, by its action in 1753, stands
several decades in advance—its act, moreover, being one of deliberate
founding rather than a species of conquest.

The first chapter in the history of American museums is short. In
colonial days there were none. In the early years of the Republic, the
establishment of such institutions by city, State, or Federal Government
would not have been considered a legitimate act. When the General
Government came into the possession of extensive collections as the result
of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition in 1842, they were placed in charge
of a private organization, the National Institution, and later, together

mens, and the British Museum as well as the Ashmolean was built around a nucleus
of American material. Indeed, we can not doubt that interest in American explora-
tion had largely to do with the development of natural history museums.

In those days all Europe was anxious to hear of the wonders of the new-found con-
tinent, and to see the strange objects which explorers might be able to bring back
with them, and monarchs sought eagerly to secure novelties in the shape of animals
and plants.

Columbus was charged by Queen Isabella to collect birds, and it is recorded that
he took back to Spain the skins of several kinds of animals. Even to this day may
be seen in the old collegiate church in Siena a votive offering placed there nearly
four centuries ago by the discoverer of America. It consists of the armor worn by
him when he first stepped upon the soil of the New World and the rostrum of a
swordfish killed on the American coast.

The state papers of Great Britain contain many entries of interest in this connec-
tion. King James I was an enthusiastic collector. December 15, 1609, Lord South-
ampton wrote to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King about Virginia squirrels
brought into England which were said to fly. The King very earnestly asked
if none were provided for him—whether Salisbury had none for him—and said he
was sure Salisbury would get him one. ‘The writer apologizes for troubling Lord
Salisbury, ‘‘but,’’ continued he, ‘‘ you know so well how he [the King] is affected
to such toys.”’

Charles I appears to have been equally curious in such matters. In 1637 he sent
John Tradescant the younger to Virginia ‘‘to gather all rarities of flowers, plants,
and shells.”’

In 1625 we find Tradescant writing to one Nicholas that it is the Duke of Buck-
ingham’s pleasure that he should deal with all merchants from all places, but espe-
cially from Virginia, Bermuda, Newfoundland, Guinea, the Amazons, and the East
Indies, for all manner of rare beasts, fowls and birds, shells and shining stones, etc.

In the Domestic Correspondence of Charles I, in another place, July, 1625, is a
‘Note of things desired from Guinea, for which letters are to be written to the mer-
chants of the Guinea Company.’’? Among other items referred to are ‘‘an elephant’s
head, with the teeth very large; a river horse’s head; strange sorts of fowls; birds’
and fishes’ skins; great flying and sucking fishes; all sorts of serpents; dried fruits,
shining stones, ete.’’ Still farther on is a note of one Jeremy Blackman’s charge—
in all, £20—for transporting four deer from Virginia, including corn and a place
made of wood for them to lie in.

with other similar materials, in that of a corporation, the Smithsonian
Institution, which was for a long period of years obliged to pay largely
for their care out of its income from a private endowment. It was not
until 1876, however, that the existence of a National Museum, as such,
was definitely recognized in the proceedings of Congress, and its financial
support fully provided for.

In early days, however, our principal cities had each a public museum,
founded and supported by private enterprise. The earliest general col-
lection was that formed at Norwalk, Connecticut, prior to the Revolution,
by a man named Arnold, described as ‘‘a curious collection of American
birds and insects.’? This it was which first awakened the interest of
President Adams in the natural sciences. He visited it several times as
he traveled from Boston to Philadelphia, and his interest culminated in
the foundation of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.’ In 1790
Doctor Hosack brought to America from Europe the first cabinet of min-
erals ever seen on this continent.

The earliest public establishment, however, was the Philadelphia
Museum, established by Charles Willson Peale in 1785, which had for a
nucleus a stuffed paddlefish and the bones of a mammoth, and which
was for a time housed in the building of the American Philosophical
Society. In 1800 it was full of popular attractions.

There were a mammoth’s tooth from the Ohio, and a woman’s shoe from Canton;
nests of the kind used to make soup of, and a Chinese fan six feet long; bits of asbestus,
belts of wampum, stuffed birds and feathers from the Friendly Islands, scalps, toma-
hawks, and long lines of portraits of great men of the Revolutionary war. To visit
the museum, to wander through the rooms, play upon the organ, examine the rude
electrical machine, and have a profile drawn by the physiognomitian, were pleasures
from which no stranger to the city ever refrained.

Doctor Hare’s oxyhydrogen blowpipe was shown in this museum by
Mr. Rubens Peale as early as 1810.

The Baltimore Museum was managed by Rembrandt Peale, and was in
existence as early as 1815 and as late as 1830.

Earlier efforts were made, however, in Philadelphia. Doctor Chovet,
of that city, had a collection of wax anatomical models made by him in
Europe, and Professor John Morgan, of the University of Pennsylvania,
who learned his methods from the Hunters in London and Sué in Paris,
was also forming such a collection before the Revolution.

' This collection [we are told] was sold to Sir Ashton Lever, in whose apart-
ments in London Mr. Adams saw it again, and felt a new regret at our imperfect
knowledge of the productions of the three kingdoms of nature in our land. In
France his visits to the museums and other establishments, with the inquiries of
Academicians and other men of science and letters respecting this country, and their
encomiums on the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, suggested to him the idea
of engaging his native State to do something in the same good but neglected cause. —

Museum-Fhstory and Museums of History. ip

The Columbian Museum and Turrell’s Museum, in Boston, are spoken
of in the annals of the day, and there was a small collection in the attic
of the statehouse in Hartford.

The Western Museum, in Cincinnati, was founded about 1815 by
‘Robert Best, M. D., afterwards of Lexington, Kentucky, who seems to
have been a capable collector, and who contributed matter to Godman’s
American Natural History. In 1818 a society styled the Western
Museum Society was organized among the citizens, which, though
scarcely a scientific organization, seems to have taken a somewhat liberal
and public-spirited view of what a museum should be. With the estab-
lishment of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in 1812,
and the New York Lyceum of Natural History, the history of American
scientific museums had its true beginning.

The intellectual life of America is so closely allied to that of England
that the revival of interest in museums and in popular education at the
middle of the present century is especially significant to us. The great
exhibition of 1851 was one of the most striking features of the industrial
revolution in England, that great transformation which, following closely
upon the introduction of railroads, turned England feudal and agricul-
tural into England democratic and commercial.

The great exhibition marked an epoch in the intellectual progress of
English-speaking people. ‘‘The great exhibition,’’ writes a popular
novelist, and a social philosopher as well, ‘‘did one great service for
country people. It taught them how easy it is to get to London, and
what a mine of wealth, especially for after memory and purposes of con-
versation, exists in that great place.’’

Under the wise administration of the South Kensington staff, a great
system of educational museums has been developed all through the
United Kingdom.

Our own Centennial Exhibition in 1876 was almost as great a revela-
tion to the people of the United States. The thoughts of the country
were opened to many things before undreamed of. One thing we may
regret—that we have no such widespread system of museums as that
which has developed in the motherland with South Kensington as its
administrative center. England has had nearly forty years, however, and
we but thirteen, since our exhibition. May we not hope that within a
like period of time, and before the year 1914, the United States may have
attained the position which England now occupies, at least in the respects
of popular interest and substantial governmental support? ‘There are
now over one hundred and fifty public museums in the United Kingdom,
all active and useful.

The museum systems of Great Britain are, it seems to me, much closer
to the ideal which America should follow, than are those of either France
or Germany. ‘They are designed more thoughtfully to meet the needs of
72 Memorral of George Brown Goode.

the people, and are more intimately intertwined with the policy of national
popular education.

Sir Henry Cole, the working founder of the Department of Science and
Art, speaking of the purpose of the museums under his care, said to the
people of Birmingham in 1874:

If you wish your schools of science and art to be effective, your health, the air,
and your food to be wholesome, your life to be long, your manufactures to improve,
your trade to increase, and your people to be civilized, you must have museums of
science and art to illustrate the principles of life, health, nature, science, art, and
beauty.

Again, in words as applicable to Americans of to-day as to Britons in
1874, said he:

A thorough education and a knowledge of science and art are vital to the nation,
and to the place it holds at present in the civilized world. Science and art are the
lifeblood of successful production. All civilized nations are running a race with us,
and our national decline will date from the period when we go to sleep over the
work of education, science, and art. What has been done is at the mere threshold
of the work yet to be done.

The people’s museum should be much more than a house full of speci-
mens in glass cases. It should be a house full of ideas, arranged with
the strictest attention to system. I once tried to express this thought
by saying: ‘‘An efficient educational museum may be described as a col-
lection of instructive labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen.’’

The museum, let me add, should be more than a collection of speci-
mens, well arranged and well labeled. Like the library, it should be
under the constant supervision of one or more men, well informed, schol-
arly, and withal practical, and fitted by tastes and training to aid in the
educational work. I should not organize the museums primarily for the
use of people in their larval or school-going stage of existence. The
public school-teacher, with the illustrated text-books, diagrams, and other
appliances, has in these days a professional outfit which is usually quite
sufficient to enable him to teach his pupils.

School days last at the most only from four to fifteen years, and they
end, with the majority of mankind, before their minds have reached the
stage of growth most favorable for the reception and assimilation of the
best and most useful thought. Why should we be crammed in the time
of infancy and kept in a state of mental starvation during the period
which follows, from maturity to old age—a state which is disheartening
and unnatural all the more because of the intellectual tastes which have
been stimulated and partially formed by school life?

The museum idea is much broader than it was fifty or even twenty-
five years ago. ‘The museum of to-day is no longer a chance assemblage
of curiosities, but rather a series of objects selected with reference to
their value to investigators, or their possibilities for public enlightenment.
The museum of the future may be made one of the chief agencies of the
higher civilization.
Museum-Ffistory and Museums of Flistory. 73

I hope that the time will come when every town shall have both its
public museum and its public library, each with a staff of competent men,
mutually helpful, and contributing largely to the intellectual life of the
community.

The museum of the future in this democratic land should be adapted
to the needs of the mechanic, the factory operator, the day laborer, the
salesman, and the clerk, as much as to those of the professional man and
the man of leisure. It is proper that there be laboratories and profes-
sional libraries for the development of the experts who are to organize,
arrange, and explain the museums.

It is proper that laboratories be utilized to the fullest extent for the
credit of the institution to which they belong. No museum can do good
and be respected which does not each year give additional proofs of its
claims to be considered a center of learning. On the other hand, the
public have a right to ask that much shall be done directly in their
interest. They will gladly allow the museum officer to use part of his
time in study and experiment. ‘They will take pride in the possession
by the museum of tens of thousands of specimens, interesting only to
the specialist, hidden away perpetually from public view, but necessary
for proper scientific research. They are the foundations of the intellect-
ual superstructure which gives to the institution its proper standing.

Still, no pains must be spared in the presentation of the material in
the exhibition halls. The specimens must be prepared in the most care-
ful and artistic manner, and arranged attractively in well-designed cases
and behind the clearest of glass. Each object must bear a label giving
its name and history so fully that all the probable questions of the visitor
are answered in advance. Books of reference must be kept in convenient
places. Colors of walls, cases, and labels must be restful and quiet, and
comfortable seats must be everywhere accessible, for the task of the
museum visitor is a weary one at best.

All intellectual work may be divided into two classes, the one tending
toward the increase of knowledge, the other toward its diffusion; the one
toward investigation and discovery, the other toward the education of the
people and the application of known facts to promoting their material
welfare. ‘The efforts of learned men and of institutions of learning are
sometimes applied solely to one of these departments of effort—sometimes
to both—and it is generally admitted, by the most advanced teachers,
that, for their students as well as for themselves, the happiest results are
reached by carrying on investigation and instruction simultaneously.
Still more is this true of institutions of learning. The college which
imparts only second-hand knowledge to its students belongs to a period
in the history of education which is fast being left behind.

The museum must, in order to perform its proper functions, contribute
to the advancement of learning through the increase as well as through
the diffusion of knowledge.
74 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

We speak of ‘‘educational’? museums and of the ‘‘educational”’
method of installation so frequently that there may be danger of incon-
sistency in the use of the term. An educational museum, as it is usually
spoken of, is one in which an attempt is made to teach the unprofessional
visitor of an institution for popular education by means of labeled col-
lections, and it may be, also, by popular lectures. A college museum,
although used as an aid to advanced instruction, is not an ‘‘ educational
museum’? in the ordinary sense, nor does a museum of research, like the
Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, belong to
this class, although, to a limited extent, it attempts and performs popular
educational work in addition to its other functions.

In the National Museum in Washington the collections are divided
into two great classes: The exhibition series, which constitutes the educa-
tional portion of the Museum, and is exposed to public view, with all
possible accessories for public entertainment and instruction; and the
study series, which is kept in the scientific laboratories, and is rarely
examined except by professional investigators.

In every properly conducted museum the collections must, from the
very beginning, divide themselves into these two classes, and, in planning
for its administration, provision should be made not only for the exhibi-
tion of objects in glass cases, but for the preservation of large collections
not available for exhibition, to be used for the studies of a very limited
number of specialists. Lord Bacon, who, as we have noticed, was the
first to whom occurred the idea of a great museum of science and art,
complains thus, centuries ago, in his book, On the Advancement of
Learning, that up to that time the means for intellectual progress had
been used exclusively for ‘‘amusement’’ and ‘‘teaching,’’ and not for
the ‘‘augmentation of science.”’

The boundary line between the library and the museum is neither
straight nor plain. ‘The former, if its scope be rightly indicated by its
name, is, primarily, a place for books. The latter is a depository for
objects of every kind, books not excepted. The British Museum, with
its libraries, its pictures, its archaeological galleries, its anthropological,
geological, botanical, and zoological collections, is an example of the
most comprehensive interpretation of the term. Professor Huxley has
described the museum as ‘‘a consultative library of objects.’’ ‘This defi-
nition is suggestive but unsatisfactory. It relates only to the contents of
the museum as distinguished from those of the library, and makes no
reference to the differences in the methods of their administration.

The treasures of the library must be examined one at a time, and by
one person at a time. Their use requires long-continued attention, and
their removal from their proper places in the system of arrangement.
Those of the museums are displayed to public view in groups, in sys-
tematic sequence, so that.they have a collective as well as an individual
significance. Furthermore, much of their meaning may be read at a

glance. The museum cultivates the powers of observation, and the casual
visitor even makes discoveries for himself, and, under the guidance of
the labels, forms his own impressions. In the library one studies the
impressions of others.

The library is most useful to the educated; the museum to educated
and uneducated alike, to the masses as well as to the few, and is a powerful
stimulant to intellectual activity in either class.

The influence of the museum upon a community is not so deep as that of
the library, but extends toa much larger number of people. The National
Museum in Washington has 300,000 visitors a year, each of whom carries
away a certain number of new thoughts.

The two ideas may be carried out, side by side, in the same building,
and, if need be, under the same management, not only without antag-
onism, but with advantage. That the proximity of a good library is
absolutely essential to the influence of a museum, will be admitted by
everyone. I am confident, also, that a museum wisely organized and
properly arranged is certain to benefit the library near which it stands in
many ways, and more positively than through its power to stimulate
interest in books, and thus to increase the general popularity of the library
and to enlarge its endowment.

Many books and valuable ones would be required in this best kind of
museum work, but it is not intended to enter into competition with the
library. When necessary, volumes might be duplicated. It is very often
the case, however, that books are more useful and safer in the museum
than on the library shelves, for in the museum they may be seen daily by
thousands, while in the library their very existence is forgotten by all
except their custodian.

Audubon’s Birds of North America is a book which everyone has
heard of and which every one wants to see at least once in his lifetime. In
a library, it probably is not examined by ten persons in a year. Ina
museum, if the volume were exposed to view in a glass case, a few of the
most striking plates detached, framed, and hung upon the wall near at
hand, it will teach a lesson to every passer-by.

The library may be called upon for aid by the museum in many direc-
tions. Pictures are often better than specimens to illustrate certain ideas.
The races of man and their distribution can only be shown by pictures
and maps. Atlases of ethnological portraits and maps are out of place in
a library if there is a museum nearby in which they can be displayed.
They are not even members of the class described by Lamb as ‘‘ books
which are not books.’’ ‘They are not books, but museum specimens,
masquerading in the dress of books.

In selecting courses for the development of a museum, it may be useful
to consider what are the fields open to museum work. As a matter of
convenience, museums are commonly classed in two groups—those of
science and those of art—and in Great Britain the great national system
76 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

is mainly under the control of The Science and Art Department of the
Committee of Council on Education.

This classification is not entirely satisfactory, since it is based upon
methods of arrangement rather than upon the nature of the objects to be
arranged, and since it leaves in a middle territory (only partially. occu-
pied by the English museum men of either department) a great mass
of museum material, of the greatest moment, both in regard to its inter-
est and its adaptability for purposes of public instruction.

On the other side stand the natural history collections, undoubtedly
best to be administered by the geologist, botanist, and zoologist. On
the other side are the fine-art collections, best to be arranged, from an
esthetic standpoint, by artists. Between is a territory which no English
word can adequately describe—which the Germans call Culturgeschichte—
the natural history of civilization, of man and his ideas and achieve-
ments. ‘The museums of science and art have not yet learned how to
partition this territory.

An exact classification of museums is not at present practicable, nor
will it be until there has been some redistribution of the collections
which they contain. It may be instructive, however, to pass in review
the principal museums of the world, indicating briefly their chief char-
acteristics.

Every great nation has its museum of natural history. ‘The natural
history department of the British Museum, recently removed from the
heart of London to palatial quarters in South Kensington, is probably
the most extensive, with its three great divisions, zoological, botanical,
and geological. :

The historian and the naturalist have met upon common ground in
the field of anthropology. ‘The anthropologist is, in most cases, historian
as well as naturalist; while the historian of to-day is always in some
degree an anthropologist, and makes use of many of the methods at one
time peculiar to the natural sciences. ‘The museum is no less essential
to the study of anthropology than to that of natural history. The library
formerly afforded to the historian all necessary opportunities for work.
It would seem from the wording of the new charter of the American
Historical Association that its members consider a museum to be one of
its legitimate agencies.

Your secretary has invited me to say something about the possibilities
of utilizing museum methods for the promotion of historical studies.
This I do with much hesitation, and I hope that my remarks may be
considered as suggestions rather than as expressions of definite opinion.
The art of museum administration is still in its infancy, and no attempt
has yet been made to apply it systematically to the development of a
museum of history. Experiment is as yet the museum administrator’s
only guide, and he often finds his most cherished plans thoroughly
impracticable. ‘That museums can ever be made as useful to history as

qq
Museum-Fitstory and Museums of [1tstory. 77

they are to physical science, their most enthusiastic friend dares not
hope. ‘The two departments of science are too unlike.

The historian studies events and their causes; the naturalist studies
objects and the forces. by which their existence is determined. ‘The
naturalist may assemble in a museum objects from every quarter of the
globe and from every period of the earth’s history. Much of his work
is devoted to the observation of finished structure, and for this purpose
his specimens are at all times ready. When, however, he finds it neces-
sary to study his subject in other aspects, he may have recourse to the phys-
ical, chemical, and physiological laboratories, the zoological and botanical
gardens, and aquaria, which should form a part of every perfect museum
system. Here, almost at will, the phenomena of nature may be scruti-
nized and confirmed by repeated observation, while studies impractica-
ble in the nursery may usually be made by members of its staff, who
carry its appliances with them to the seashore or to distant lands.

The requirements of the historian are very different. Nevertheless, I
am confident that the museum may be made in his handsa most potent
instrumentality for the promotion of historical studies. Its value is per-
haps less fully realized than it would be were it not that so many of
its functions are performed by the library. In the library may be found
descriptive catalogues of all the great museums, and books by the
hundred, copiously illustrated with pictures of the objects preserved in
museums. A person trained to use books may by their aid reap the
advantage of many museums without the necessity of a visit to one.

The exhibition series would be proportionately larger in an historical
than in a natural-history museum. The study series of a historical
museum would mostly be arranged in the form of a library, except in
some special departments, such as numismatics, and when a library is
near might be entirely dispensed with.

The adoption of museum methods would be of advantage to the his-
torian in still another way, by encouraging the preservation of historical
material not at present sought for by librarians, and by inducing present
owners of such material to place it on exhibition in public museums.

Although there is not in existence a general museum of history
arranged on the comprehensive plan adopted by natural-history museums,
there are still many historical collections of limited scope, which are all
that could be asked, and more.

The value to the historian of archaeological collections, historic and
prehistoric, has long been understood. ‘The museums of London, Paris,
Berlin, and Rome need no comment. In Cambridge, New York, and
Washington are immiense collections of the remains of man in America
in the pre-Columbian period—collections which are yearly growing in
significance, as they are made the subject of investigation, and there is
an immense amount of material of this kind in the hands of institutions
and private collectors in all parts of the United States.
78 _ Memorial of George Brown Goode.

The museum at Naples shows, sc far as a museum can, the history of
Pompeii at one period. The museum of St. Germain, near Paris, exhibits
the history of France in the time of the Gauls and of the Roman occupa-
tion. In Switzerland, especially at Neuchatel, the history of the inhab-
itants of the Lake Dwellings is shown.

American ethnological museums are preserving with care the memorials
of the vanishing race of red men. ‘The George Catlin Indian Gallery,
which is installed in the room in which this society is now meeting, is
valuable beyond the possibility of appraisement, in that it is the sole
record of the physical characters, the costumes, and the ceremonies of
several tribes long extinct.

Other countries recently settled by Europeans are preserving the
memorials of the aboriginal races, notably the colonies in Australia and
New Zealand. Japan is striving to preserve in its Government museum
examples of the fast-disappearing memorials of feudal days.

Ethnographic museums are especially numerous and fine in the
northern part of Europe. ‘They were proposed more than half a century
ago, by the French geographer, Jomard, and the idea was first carried
into effect about 1840, on the establishment of the Danish Ethnographical
Museum, which long remained the best in Europe. Within the past
twenty years there is an extraordinary activity in this direction.

In Germany, besides the chief museum in Berlin, considerable ethno-
graphical collections have been founded in Hamburgand Munich. Aus-
tria hasin Vienna two for ethnography, the Court Museum (Hof-Museum),
and the Oriental (Orientalisches Museum). Holland has reorganized
the National Ethnographical Museum (Ryks Ethnographisch Museum)
in Leyden, and there are smaller collections in Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
and The Hague. France has founded the Trocadero (Musée de Tro-
cadero). In Italy there is the important Prehistoric and Ethnographic
Museum (Museo preistorico ed ethnografico) in Rome, as well as the col-
lection of the Propaganda, and there are museums in Florence and Venice.

Ethnographical museums have also been founded in Christiania and
Stockholm, the latter of which will include the rich material collection
by Doctor Stolpe on the voyage of the frigate Vanadzs around the world.

In England there is less attention to the subject, the Christy collection
in the British Museum being the only one specially devoted to ethnog-
raphy, unless we include also the local Blackmore Museum at Salisbury.

In the United States the principal establishment arranged on the
ethnographic plan is the Peabody Museum of Archzeology in Cambridge,
and there are important smaller collections in the American Museum of
Natural History in New York and the Peabody Academy of Sciences at
Salem. |

The ethnological collections in Washington are classified on a double
system, in one of its features corresponding to that of the European, in
the other like the famous Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford, arranged to

show the evolution of culture and civilization without regard to race.
This broader plan admits much material excluded by the advocates of
ethnographic museums, who devote their attention almost exclusively to
the primitive or non-European peoples.

In close relation to the ethnographic museums are those which are
devoted to some special field of human thought and interest. Most
remarkable among these probably is the Musée Guimet, recently
removed from Lyons to Paris, which is intended to illustrate the history
of religious ceremonial among all races of men.

Other good examples of this class are some of those in Paris, such as
the Musée de Marine, which shows not only the development of the
merchant and naval marines of the country, but also, by trophies and
other historical souvenirs, the history of the naval battles of the nation.

The Musée d’Artillerie does for war, but less thoroughly, what the
Marine Museum does in its own department, and there are similar
museums in other countries. :

Historical museums are manifold in character, and of necessity local in
interest. Some relate to the history of provinces or cities. One of the
oldest and best of these is the Markisch Provinzial Museum in Berlin.
Many historical societies have collections of this character.

There are museums which illustrate the history of particular towns,
events, and individuals. ‘The museum of the city of Paris, in the Hotel
des Invalides, is one of these. ‘The museum of the Hohenzollerns, in
Berlin, contains interesting mementos of the reigning family of Ger-
many. ‘The cathedrals of southern Europe, and St. Paul’s, in London,
are in some degrees national or civic museums. The Galileo Museum
in Florence, the Shakespeare Museum at Stratford, are good examples
of the museums devoted to the memory of representative men and the
Monastery of St. Mark, in Florence, does as much as could be expected
of any museum for the life of Savonarola. ‘The Soane Museum in Lon-
don, the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, are similar in purpose
and result, but they are rather biographical than historical. There are
also others which illustrate the history of a race, as the Bavarian National
Museum in Nuremberg.

The study of civilization or the history of culture and of the develop-
ments of the various arts and industries have brought into being special
collections which are exceedingly significant and useful. Doctor Klemm
and General Pitt-Rivers, in England, were pioneers in the founding of
collections of this kind, and their work is permanently preserved in the
Museum fur Volkerkunde, in Leipzig and at the University of Oxford.

Nearly every museum which admits ethnological material is doing
something in this direction. There are a number of beginnings of this
sort in this very building.

The best of the art museums are historically arranged and show
admirably the development of the pictorial and plastic arts—somie, like
80 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

that in Venice, for a particular school; some that of a country, some that
of different countries side by side.

The art museum, it need scarcely be said, contains, more than any
other, the materials which I should like to see utilized in the historical
museum.

Incidentally or by direct intention, a large collection of local paintings,
such as those in Venice or Florence, brings vividly into mind the occur-
rences of many periods of history, not only historical topography—the
architecture, the utensils, weapons, and other appurtenances of domestic,
military, ecclesiastical, and governmental routine—but the men and
women who made the history, the lowest as well as the most powerful,
and the very performers of the deeds themselves, the faces bearing the
impress of the passions by which they were moved.

These things are intelligible to those who are trained to observe them. —
T’o others they convey but half the lesson they might, or mayhap only a
very small part indeed.

The historical museums now in existence contain, as a rule, chance
accumulations, like too many natural-history museums of the present,
like allin the past. I donot mean any disrespect by the word chance, but
simply that, though the managers are willing to expend large sums for
any specimens which please them, many most instructive ones have been
excluded by some artificial limitation. The National Portrait Gallery in
London is an instance. Many illustrious men are not represented upon
its walls solely because no contemporary pictures of theirs, reaching a
certain ideal standard of merit, are in existence.

So, also, the collection of musical instruments at South Kensington,
which admits no specimen which is devoid of artistic suggestions— ~
thus barring out the rude and primitive forms which would give added
interest to all. “The naturalist’s axiom, ‘‘any specimen is better than
no specimen,’ should be borne in mind in the formation of historical
museums, if not rigidly enforced.

Another source of weakness in all museums is one to which attention
has already been directed, namely, that they have resigned, without a
struggle, to the library material invaluable for the completion of their
exhibition series. Pictures are quite as available for museum work as
specimens, and it is unwise to leave so many finely illustrated books, lost
to sight and memory, on the shelves of the libraries.

That libraries can do good work through the adoption of museum
methods has been clearly shown in the British Museum in the exceed-
ingly instructive collections which have of late years been exhibited by
its librarians, to illustrate such subjects as the lives of Luther and Michael
Angelo, and by their permanent display of pictures and documents refer-
ring to the history of London.

The Dyce-Forster collection of autograph documents, letters, and
manuscripts is also, in its own way, suggestive. Every large library has

done something of this kindin its own way. It remains for some student
of history to work out upon a generous plan, and with plenty of exhibi-
tion space at his command, the resources which are already in the posses-
sion of some great treasure-house like the British Museum.

What the limitations of historical museums are to be it is impossible
at present to predict. In museum administration experience is the only
safe guide. In the scientific museum many things have been tried, and
many things are known to be possible. In the historical museum most
of this experimental administration still remains to be performed. ‘The
principal object of this communication is to call attention to the general
direction in which experiment should be made.

The only safe course to be pursued in the development of plans in any
untried department of museum work is to follow the advice which the
Apostle Paul proffered to the Thessalonians:

‘* Prove all things; hold fast that which is good !’’

THE GENESIS OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

By GEORGE BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the U. S. National
Museum,

When, in 1826, James Smithson bequeathed his estate to the United
States of America ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men,’’ he placed at the disposal of our nation two
valuable collections—one of books and one of minerals.

In the schedule of Smithson’s personal effects, as brought to America
in 1838, occurs the following entry :

Two large boxes filled with specimens of minerals and manuscript treatises,

apparently in the testator’s handwriting, on various philosophical subjects, particu-
larly chemistry and mineralogy. Eight cases and one trunk filled with the like.

This collection and the books and pamphlets mentioned in the same
schedule formed the beginnings, respectively, of the Smithsonian library
and the Smithsonian museum. ‘The minerals constituted, so far as the
writer has been able to learn, the first scientific cabinet owned by the
Government of the United States. Their destruction in the Smithsonian
fire of 1865 was a serious loss. Our only knowledge of their character
is derived from the report of a committee of the National Institution,
which in 1841 reported upon it as follows :*

Among the effects of the late Mr. Smithson, is a Cabinet which, so far as it has
been examined, proves to consist of a choice and beautiful collection of Minerals,
comprising, probably, eight or ten thousand specimens. ‘The specimens, though
generally small, are extremely perfect, and constitute a very complete Geological
and Mineralogical series ¢ embracing the finest varieties of crystallization ; rendered
more valuable by accompanying figures and descriptions by Mr. Smithson, and in

*Proceedings of the National Institution, July, 1841, 2d Bull., p. 95. Francis
Markoe, jr., secretary of the National Institution, in a letter written to the Amer-
ican Philosophical Society in 1841, described as a part of this cabinet ‘‘a superb
collection, and very large, of precious stones and exquisite crystallized minerals

decidedly the richest and rarest collection in the country.”’

his own hand-writing. ‘The cabinet also contains a valuable suite of meteoric
stones, which appear to be specimens of most of the meteorites which have fallen
in Europe during several centuries.

This report was made in July, 1841, at the time when, by order of the
Secretary of the United States Treasury, the minerals, books, manu-
scripts, and other articles forming part of the Smithson bequest, were
deposited in the custody of the National Institution, where they remained
until 1858.

A room had been planned for their reception in the Smithsonian edi-
fice, which was to be made fireproof," but if this was ever constructed it
was not occupied, and the collections having been displayed for some
years in the Regents’ room, were destroyed by fire January 24, 1865.

The National Institution was for nearly eighteen years the official
custodian of these and other museum materials belonging to the nation.
This organization, ten years before the Smithsonian Institution was pre-
pared to receive any collections whatever, fourteen years before its build-
ings were ready for the exhibition of museum objects, and in after years,
until its charter expired by limitation in 1862, held many objects whose
proper place was in the National Museum. Indeed, the retention of
many historical objects in the Patent Office hall until 1883, was an evi-
dence of a lingering uncertainty as to the proper location of responsibility
for the care of the national collections.

In order to understand the genesis of the National Museum of the
United States, it seems necessary to examine the history of this society,
at one time so enterprising and influential.

The National Institution for the Promotion of Science, organized in
Washington, May 15, 1840, was for some years the most prominent
exponent of the idea of a national museum.’ ‘The establishment of this
society was doubtless to a very great degree due to the stimulating and
inspiring effects upon public opinion of the Smithson bequest. The
germs of the idea which it represented seem, however, to have been
existing in Washington at a much earlier period, for in 1816, or before,
a similar society had been organized in the capital under the name of
The Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences.?

The Columbian Institute received on May 20, 1818, a charter from
Congress which expired in 1838, after which its members ‘‘ were invited

tution, 1841, 1st Bull., p. 3.

3Before 1816 an organization known as The Metropolitan Society was in existence
in Washington, and the Columbian Institute was an outgrowth of it or replaced it.
The United States Military Philosophical Society met in Washington and New York
as early as 1805.

to become members of the National Institution, and to deposit in its
Cabinet their effects, books, and papers.’? '

This invitation was accepted July 17, 1841,*in a letter from Asbury
Dickins, secretary, and although no record of any transfer is to be found
in the Bulletin of the National Institution, I have before me a letter
from Messrs. John J. Abert, A. O. Dayton, and F. A. Markoe, com-
mittee of that society, addressed to the Secretaries of the War and Navy
Departments, January 1, 1842, in which, among the other collections in
their custody, they mention ‘‘the books, minerals, and works of art
belonging to the late Columbian Institute,’’ and also the ‘‘ books, papers,
and proceedings of the late American Historical Society,’’? an organiza-
tion to which also the National Institution stood in the position of an
heir.

To Doctor Edward Cutbush is due the preservation of the only state-
ment extant of the objects of the Columbian Institute, embodied ap-
parently in its constitution, and quoted as follows in his address as its
president, delivered January 11, 1817, in Congress Hall, Washington: 3

To collect, cultivate, and distribute the various vegetable productions of this and
other countries, whether medicinal or esculent, or for the promotion of arts and
manfactures. ;

To collect and examine the various mineral productions and natural curiosities of
the United States, and to give publicity to every discovery that the institute may
have been enabled to make.

To obtain information respecting the mineral waters of the United States, their
locality, analysis, and utility, together with such topographical remarks as may aid
valetudinarians.

To invite communications on agricultural subjects, on the management of stock,
their diseases, and the remedies.

To form a topographical and statistical history of the different districts of the
United States, noticing particularly the number and extent of streams, how far navi-
gable, the agricultural products, the imports and exports, the value of lands, the
climate, the state of the thermometer and barometer, the diseases which prevail in
the different seasons, the state of the arts and manufactures, and any other informa-
tion which may be deemed of general utility.

To publish annually, or whenever the Institution shall have become possessed of
a sufficient stock of important information, such communications as may be of public
utility, and to give the earliest information in the public papers of all discoveries
that may have been made by or communicated to the Institute.

A remark significant in this connection may be found in a letter
written by Edward Cutbush, M. D., dated Geneva, New York, January 20,
1842, accepting his election to corresponding membership in the National
Institution. After thanking the institution ‘‘for this memento of their
friendship and recognition of past services in the cause which has been
so honorably revived at the seat of Government,’’ he continued thus: ‘‘I
most sincerely hope that all the objects which engaged the attention of
Thomas Law, Esq.,? and myself, in 1816, in establishing the Columbian
Institute will ow meet the approbation and support of the Government,
and of the scientific men of the District of Columbia.’’ *

™Proceedings of the National Institution, 1842, 2d Bull., p. 156.

?Thomas Law was a member of an English family of talent and influence. His
father, Edmund Law, D. D., born in Cartmel, Lancashire, in 1703, educated at St.
John’s College, Cambridge, was author of several theological and philosophical works,
and in 1769 became Bishop of Carlisle, holding this office till his death in 1787. Of
his younger brothers, one was Bishop of Elphin, another, George Henry Law, D. D.,
(1761-1845) was Bishop of Chester, 1812, and later, 1824, of Bath and Wells. [Bio-
graphical Sketch in Gentleman’s Magazine, 1845, Pt. 2, p. 529.] His elder brother,
Edward Law—Lord Ellenborough—( 1750-1818) was an eminent lawyer, principal
counsel for Warren Hastings in the great impeachment trial before the House of
Lords, Attorney-General and Lord Chief Justice of the King’s Bench,and was father
of Edward Law, Earl of Ellenborough (1790-1871), Governor-General of India.

Thomas Law was born in 1756, and in 1773, at the age of seventeen, entered the
service of the British East India Company in Bengal, and was rapidly promoted,
becoming member of the revenue board of Hugli before he was twenty-one, later
judge of Poonah, and in 1783 collector, judge, and magistrate of Behar, a province
with more than 2,000,000 inhabitants, an office which he administered for six years
with great success, afterwards, at the request of Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-Gen-
eral, then engaged in his campaign against Tippoo Saib, serving for two years on the
revenue board at Calcutta. In 1791, his health having failed, he sailed for England,
where he remained until 1793, the year of his removal to America,

While in India he was the friend and associate of Lord Cornwallis, Lord Tergue-
nett, and Sir William Jones, and was the-author of what was known as the Mocur-
rery system and permanent settlement, a great legislative reform, the accomplishment
of which was the principal feature of Cornwallis’s administration, which the board
of control of the East India Company described as ‘‘forming a new epoch in Hin-
dostan, from which, they predict, will be derived security and permanent prosperity,
and consider it as an important and most beneficial change to 50,000,000 of people,
and full of beneficial consequences.”’

William Duane, the editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, who had known Mr. Law
in India, wrote thus concerning him in 1815:

‘“We have known Mr. Law now more than thirty years. We knew him when he
was inferior to no man in eminence and in power, the third or fourth in degree in a
great empire; and this was at a time, too, when, by his own generous efforts, pursued
with zeal and talent that commanded general admiration and esteem, he brought
about a revolution, the influence of which now extends to one hundred and twenty
millions of people, as great in its moral and political influences as the extinction of
the feudal system. In Hindostan, under the Mogul government, the tenure of land
was in the Empire and reverted upon the demise of the holder. The afflictions pro-
duced by such a system can not be conceived by those who have not been eye-wit-
nesses of them. Upon the death of a zuinndar, or landholder, where polygamy

The idea of a subsidy from the General Government seems to have
been prominent in the minds of the founders of the Columbian Institute.
In the closing portion of the same address Doctor Cutbush naively
remarked as follows:

I can not refrain from indulging in the pleasing hope that the members of our
National Government, to whom has been confided the guardianship of the District
of Columbia, will extend their fostering care to this establishment, and that a part
of the public grounds, reserved for national purposes, may be vested in the Colum-
bian Institute. I would also, with due deference, suggest that a small pecuniary
aid would enable the Institute at an earlier period to extend its benefits to all parts
of the United States, and to render an essential service to the nation by perpetuating
an establishment worthy of the metropolis bearing the name of our illustrious Wash-
ington, where at some future period the youth of our country will repair to complete
their education at the national seminary, to which the Botanical Garden and Miner-
alogical Cabinet would be important appendages.

prevails and the children and females are numerous, the death of the head of the
family, where no provision has been otherwise made, can not be wellimagined. Mr.
Law, who held the government of a rich and populous province under the Bengal
administration, proposed what has been called the Mocurrery system, that is to
make the land personal property and not to revert to the sovereign. This plan, pur-
sued through several years of zeal and devotion to humanity, he accomplished. The
Norman conquest, the revolution in England in 1688, were great events, and they
mark epochs in history and are treated as such, while Mr. Law’s revolution without
bloodshed eventually changed the whole moral and social condition of Hindostan,
settled estates in persons and as personal property, and put an end to all the calami-
ties which were consequent of the old system; yet the event is scarcely heard of;
perhaps there are not three men in this country who ever heard of it yet.’’

In a letter written to Law by Marquis Cornwallis in 1796, he said: ‘‘We labored
together for the security of person and property to the subjects of the British Gov-
ernment in Asia,’’ and referred to ‘‘that plan of which I shall ever with gratitude
acknowledge you as the founder.”’

Another reform suggested by Mr. Law was in connection with the commercial
relations of India with England. Concerning this Mr. Law writes, in 1824:

““The augmented wealth and prosperity of many of the natives of India since I
quitted Bengal is evinced by commercial events and improvements, some of which
have fulfilled my anticipations, when I proposed to the company, and was urgent
with them, to throw open and enlarge new branches of trade originally in India.
Cotton and sugar are now imported thence into England, and British manufactures
have been exported to pay for these new and rich Asiatic cargoes, and this to an
amount that in 1815 was estimated at £870,177. Five years afterwards, in 1819, the
value of such manufactures exported to India exceeded three millions sterling.”

One of the results of this Indian reform was doubtless the abolition at so early a
day of negro slavery in the British West Indies.

Another of his reforms was that effected when at an early age he was governor of
Behar, and which was perhaps his chief popular title to the appellation of ‘‘ Father
of the People.’’ The capital of Behar is as much venerated by the Hindus as Mecca
by the Mohammedans. Pilgrims annually resort to it from all parts of India. ‘These
pilgrims had been oppressed by heavy taxes ever since the establishment of the
Mohammedan Government—taxes imposed according to the apparent dignity of the
pilgrims, which was rated by the number of their animals, and the palanquins, horses,
or elephants which accompanied them. When Mr. Law became collector the exac-
tions were so onerous that many Hindus were deterred from fulfilling their religious

go Memorial of George Brown Goode.

Cutbush’s address before the Columbian Institute, nearly three-
quarters of a century ago, is well worthy of study at the present time.
It is full of enlightened patriotism and of hopeful prophecy for the United
States and for Washington. ‘‘Where genius and talent are respected,
rewarded, and promoted,’’ wrote he, ‘‘the arts and sciences will flourish
and the wealth and power of the nation increase.’’

The wisdom of such men as Cutbush opened the way for the organi-
zation of the National Institution, which in its turn, as we shall see, had

usages, but through his efforts the taxes were diminished to a moderate sum, a
greater number of pilgrims would pay it, and, while the demands of the revenue
were fulfilled, ‘‘ purposes of humanity were forwarded and the pious feelings of the
natives were gratified.’’ [Law’s ‘‘Reply,”’ p. 7.]

Mr. Law’s removal from England was due in part to an act of injustice on the part
of the East India Company, which resulted in considerable financial loss to himself,
and in part to his ‘‘decided disapprobation of an impolitic and exhausting war that
the administration was then carrying on against France.”’

He conceived a great admiration for the character of Washington, and when he
knew of the efforts being made to establish a national capital, he became anxious to
identify himself with its growth from the very beginning.

He invested all of his property in houses and lots in Washington, and for forty
years was one of the most zealous and enlightened citizens.

S. L. Knapp (Ignatius Loyola Robertson, LL.D.) wrote of him in 1830 in his
Sketches of Public Characters :

‘‘He purchased largely of the soil, built on an extensive scale, suggested ten thou-
sand plans for the improvement of the city and for the prosperity of the nation; but
the slow, doubtful, and often strange course of Congress came not only in his way,
but in the way of all those deeply interested in the welfare of the city; and he has
spent the days of his maturity and wisdom in unavailing efforts for the improvement
of it. It is happy for him, however, that he has lived to see the dawn of a better
day for Washington, and, if he can not stay here long to enjoy it, he will rejoice in
the hopes of his friends and descendants.”’

Among the enterprises in which he participated at an early day was the erection
of the great building south of the Capitol which has for so many years borne the
inscription ‘‘ Law House.”’ .

Three sons, born in India, accompanied Mr. Law to America, one of whom, Mr.
John Law, a lawyer in Washington, died before 1824, and all before 1834.

Mr. Law married, as second wife, Miss Custis, daughter of George Washington
Parke Custis, the stepson and adopted son of Washington, thus allying himself by
family ties with the man whom he so much revered.

Mr. Law was a zealous advocate of a national paper currency and published a
book on currency.

He also wrote poetry and contributed to general literature.

He was one of the leaders in the intellectual life of the infant capital, and not-
withstanding his personal eccentricities was universally respected. As one of the
founders of the first learned society in Washington, he is worthy of our veneration ;
and since he has been ignored by the biographical dictionaries this notice of his life
has been written.

He died in 1834.

Reference to Mr. Law’s character and career may be found in an obituary in the
National Intelligencer, 1834, quoted in the New England Magazine, September, 1834,
in Sketches of Public Characters, by ‘‘Ignatius Loyola Robertson”’ (S. L. Knapp) in

an important influence toward shaping the course of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Indeed, the germ of the Smithsonian idea may be found in Cutbush’s
address—and his spirit was kindred to that of Henry and his associates,
who worked under more favorable conditions thirty years later.’

'The two brothers James and Edward Cutbush were among the most active of the
popular teachers and promoters of science and education at the beginning of the
present century, and it would be unjust to allow their names to drop out of the his-
tory of American science.

Both were physicians, both teachers of chemistry, both enthusiastic in the work
of founding schools and learned societies. They were born, certainly in Pennsyl-
vania, probably Philadelphia, somewhere between the years 1750and 1770. Edward
entered the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1790 and
graduated in 1794, and his brother James at about the same time or a little later.

The National Institution began its career at a time when the country
was chafing under the irritation of the delays of Congress in organizing

was engaged in delivering courses of chemical lectures in Philadelphia, presumably
for the benefit of medical students.

He appears to have enlisted as a volunteer in a Pennsylvania regiment at the
beginning of the war of 1812, and at its close, on the 12th of August, 1814, was
appointed assistant apothecary-general in the Regular Army of the United States,
which position he held until 1820, when he was appointed post surgeon and chief
medical officer of the Military Academy at West Point. In November, 1821, he was
made assistant surgeon and acting professor of chemistry and mineralogy in the
Academy, in which capacity he served until his death, which occurred on December
D5 yelO23:

His most important work, A System of Pyrotechny (8vo., Philadelphia, 1825, i-xliv,
1-612), was published in Philadelphia after his death by his widow, aided by a sub-
scription from the cadets of the Military Academy.

Another work, entitled The Philosophy of Experimental Chemistry, in two vol-
umes (Philadelphia, 1813, 12mo., (1) pp. xii, 1-356 (2) i-viii, 1-339), appears to have
been the earliest general work or text-book on chemistry written in America,
although Benjamin Rush had printed a syllabus of his lectures which gave him the
title to be considered ‘‘the father of chemistry in America,’’ and James Cutbush
himself had, as early as 1807 or 1808, prepared an Epitome of Chemistry, for the use
of St. John’s College, in which he was a teacher, of the publication of which, how-
ever, I have found no record.

In 1812 he delivered an Oration on Education (Philadelphia, 1812, 8vo., pp.1-50),
before the Society for the Promotion of a Rational System of Education, of which
he was vice-president --an enlightened and eloquent address full of historical infor-
mation. He also published in 1808 a book called The Useful Cabinet, a treatise
‘‘On hydrostatics and specific gravity,’’ and also certain papers in the American
Journal of Science.

Besides holding a corresponding membership in the Columbian Institute at Wash-
ington, which was founded by his brother, he was president of the Columbian Chem-
ical Society and member of the Linnzean and Agricultural societies of Philadelphia.
Rafinesque, enumerating in 1817 those of the American scientific men whom he con-
sidered entitled to rank as philosophers, mentions the name of Cutbush along with
his own and those of Jefferson, Clinton, Vaughan, Bentley, Winthrop, Patterson,
Williamson, Griscom, Wood, Dupont, Woodward, Rush, Mitchill, Ramsay, and
Priestley.

Edward Cutbush, after his graduation at the Philadelphia Medical School in 1794,
became attached to the militia of Pennsylvania, first as hospital surgeon and subse-
quently as surgeon-general. On the 24th of June, 1799, he was appointed a surgeon
in the United States Navy, in which capacity he served until June 20, 1829, when he
resigned. Inthe years 1816 and 1817 he appears to have been stationed in Wash-
ington, and at this time participated in the foundation of the Columbian Institute
for the Promotion of Science. I can find no record of his whereabouts after 1829
until 1835, when he was a resident of Geneva, New York, and participated in the
establishment of the medical institute of Geneva College, in which he became pro-
fessor of chemistry. On the occasion of its formal opening, on February 10, 1835,
he delivered a discourse ‘‘On the history and methods of medical instruction”’
(Geneva, 1835, 8vo., pp. I-24). In 1842 he appears to have been still at Geneva, and
at this time was probably a man seventy or eighty years of age. His Washington
address and his Geneva address appear to be his only literary remains, with the

the institution of learning provided by Smithson, whose legacy had for
some years been deposited in the Treasury. '

It has already been suggested that the National Institution owed its
origin to the influence of the Smithson bequest. Indeed, it may not be
altogether impossible that it was founded with special reference to some
plan looking toward securing the control of this bequest. ‘

Although less than fifty years have gone by, I can not learn that any
of those who were active members at the time of its organization are
still living, and unfortunately no one seems to have left any written record
of the secret history of this very significant movement.

It seems possible, however, to read between the lines, in the official
publications of the society and the utterances of its friends, and thereby
to acquire a certain additional insight into their meaning.

With this in mind, it is instructive to review briefly the history of the
discussions which preceded the final organization of the Smithsonian
Institution—not with reference to its entire policy, for this has already
been well done by others, but in connection with its relations to the
national institution, and the custodianship of the National Museum.

In 1835, as we have seen, the fact was first made known that Smithson,
who had died in Genoa, six years earlier, had bequeathed the reversion
of his whole estate to the United States of America ‘‘to found at Wash-
ington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.’’

The bequest was communicated to Congress by the President on the
17th of December, and was accepted by Congress by an act approved
July 1, 1836, pledging ‘‘the faith of the United States’’ to the due appli-
cation of the fund to the purposes of the bequest.

On the ist of September, 1838, the proceeds of the estate, amounting
to $508,318.46, was paid into the United States Mint, and shortly after
the convening of Congress in that year, in a message dated December 6,
President Van Buren informed both Houses that the amount received
having been invested, he deemed it proper to invite the attention of Con-
gress to the obligation devolving upon the United States to fulfill the
object of the bequest.

Hight sessions of Congress passed by before any definite plan of organ-
ization was decided upon, and suggestions from all parts of the country
were liberally forthcoming. Strange to say, nearly every suggestion, no

* Smithson had died in 1829, but the legacy did not become available until after
the death of his nephew, the residuary legatee, in 1835, after which, in September
of that year, the Government of the United States was first apprised of the fact of
the existence of such a bequest. The legacy was brought to New York in August,
1838, but no definite action was taken concerning its application until eight years
later, when on August 10, 1846, the act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian
Institution was passed. The Regents held their first meeting September 7, 1846,
and elected a secretary, who accepted the trust on December 7, and entered upon
his duties two weeks later.

matter how humble its source, seems to have had its weight in the delib-
erations, and almost every one was embodied in one or more of the provi-
sions of the numerous bills brought up for the consideration of Congress.

In 1836, when this matter first came to the notice of the Senate, it
seems to have been the generally accepted opinion of those who took part
in the discussion that the intention of the testator was the establishing
of a university.

In this direction, too, was the tendency of the advice of those ‘‘ persons
versed in science and in matters relating to public education,’’ to whom
in July, 1838, the Secretary of State addressed letters, asking advice as
to the most advantageous mode of applying the proceeds of the bequest.”

Of these, three favored a school of high grade. President Wayland,
an institution which should occupy ‘‘the space between the close of a
collegiate education and a professional school ;’’ Doctor Cooper, ‘‘an insti-
tution of the character of an university;’’ President Chapin, ‘‘an institu-
tion for liberal and professional purposes and for the promotion of original
nvestigations—to carry scholars through a range of studies much above
those of the ordinary collegiate course.’’

Horatio Hubbell, of Philadelphia, also, in a letter to President Van
Buren, urged a university on the German plan, with numerous professor-
ships, chiefly scientific, and Professor Dunglison, of the University of
Virginia, in two very favorable letters in the Southern Literary Messen-
ger (under the signature ‘‘4’’), proposed the foundation of ‘‘a central
school of natural science,’’ to be supplemented in time by a botanical
garden, an observatory, a zoological institute, or analogous means (includ-
ing, doubtless, in his mind, museum collections), for prosecuting in a
proper way the great sciences of astronomy and general physiology—‘‘a
school where natural philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, phi-
losophy, and all other sciences could be effectually taught
which, so far from clashing with others, would aid them

a school
which, although
it might be helped by a gift of funds from the nation, could neverthe-
less go into operation without them—which, under a wise management,
could be speedily brought to yield results of the utmost practical import-
ance, and fulfill to the very letter the wishes of the testator.’’?

Mr. Rush objected to a school of any kind, and proposed a plan which
more nearly than any other of the early ones corresponded with that
which was finally adopted. In a shadowy way he outlined a system of
scientific correspondence, of lectureships, of general cooperation with the
scientific efforts of the Government, of a liberal system of publication,

and even of collections of geological, zoological, botanical, ethnological,
and economical objects.

The fifth response was from the venerable Senator and ex-President,
John Quincy Adams, who, from 1835, when he was appointed chairman
of the select committee of the House to report upon the Smithson
bequest, appears to have taken a deep interest in its fate, and to have
felt personally responsible for its judicious administration. In his letters
to the Secretary of State, October 8 and 11, 1838, he brought forward
with great vigor the proposal that the first use to be made of the fund
was the establishment of a great national astronomical observatory, and
in January, 1839, as chairman of the House committee, acting jointly
with a similar committee from the Senate, he reported a bill (House bill
1161, Senate bill 293) providing for the establishment of an observatory
fully equipped, with provision for the publication of its observations, and
the annual composition and publication of a nautical almanac.

The bill, which was evidently a minority report of the joint committee,
was reinforced by two sets of resolutions, proposed by Mr. Adams in the
House, one reported from the committee January 26, providing—

That the first appropriation from the interest, or income, of the Smithsonian fund,
ought to be for the erection and establishment, at the city of Washington, of an
astronomical observatory, provided with the best and most approved instruments
and books for the continual observation, calculation and recording of the remark-
able phenomena of the heavens; for the periodical publication of the observations

thus made; and of a nautical almanac for the use of the mariners of the United
States and of all other navigating nations,

The second, reported February 6, recited the opinion—

That the education of the children of these United States is a duty of solemn
and indispensable obligation incumbent upon their parents and guardians, not for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, but to qualify them for the
enjoyment of their rights, and the performance of their duties throughout life [and
therefore |

That no part of the Smithsonian fund ought to be applied to the education of the
children or youth of the United States, nor to any school, college, university, or
institute of education.

The latter resolutions were evidently intended as a counterpoise to the .
view still held by many members of the Senate, which was brought for-
ward by the speech of Senator Asher Robbins, of Rhode Island, January
10, 1839, in which he urged ‘‘that this institution should make one of a
number of colleges to constitute a university to be established here, and
to be endowed in a manner worthy of this great nation and their immense
resources.’

On the 18th of February Senator Robbins produced an antidote to Mr.
Adam’s anti-university resolution in the following:

1. Resolved, That it is the duty of the United States, they having accepted the

trust under the will of Mr, Smithson, of London, to execute that trust dona fide
according to the true intent and meaning of the testator.
96 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

2. Resolved, That the trust being to found an institution in the city of Washington
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, the kind of institution
which will have the effect intended and described, in the most eminent degree, will
be the kind of institution which ought, in good faith to be adopted, as being most in
accordance with the true intent and meaning of the testator.

3. Fesolved, That all experience having shown scientific and literary institutions
to be by far, the most effectual means to the end of increasing and diffusing knowl-
edge among men, the Smithsonian Institution should be a scientific and literary
institution, formed upon a model the best calculated to make those means the most
effectual to that end.

4. Resolved, 'That to apply said trust fund to the erection and support of an obsery-
atory, would not be to fulfill doxa fide the intention of the testator, nor would
it comport with the dignity of the United States to owe such an establishment to
foreign eleemosynary means.

Neither of the bills was received with favor, and the T'wenty-fifth Con-
gress came to an end without any decision having been reached. Senator
Robbins retired from public life at this time, and the university idea was
not subsequently brought prominently forward. During this session,
however, various petitions were received. One was from Professor
Walter R. Johnson, urging the foundation, advocating the claims of ‘‘an
institution for researches in practical science.’’’

Another was from Charles Lewis Fleischmann, of the United States
Patent Office, proposing the establishment of an institution for the
promotion of agriculture, with experimental farms of 1,360 acres, manu-
factories, mills, and workshops, a considerable staff of teachers and
instructors, and one hundred students at the commencement.’

The Kentucky State Agricultural Society petitioned for the endowment
of an agricultural school or college out of the legacy, and the Superin-
tendent of the Coast Survey, Mr. Hassler, was urging the foundation of
an astronomical school.

In the meantime public interest was becoming awakened. ‘The matter
was agitated in the newspapers and reviews, petitions were coming in
from individuals, urging speedy action, and the corporation of the city
of Washington, through their mayor, Peter Force, presented a vigorously
worded memorial to Congress.

Early in the first session of the Twenty-sixth Congress, 1839-1841,
Mr. Adams again brought up the Smithson bequest, introducing again
his bill for the establishment of a national observatory and reenforcing it
by his famous report of 18404 and a speech of considerable length, supple-
mented by an elaborate statement from the astronomer royal of Great
Britain concerning the observatories at Greenwich and elsewhere.

-Mr. Adams seems to have been alone in his advocacy of the observatory
and his bill and report produced no results.

It was just at this time that the National Institution was organized on
the 15th of May, 1840, by the adoption of a constitution and a declaration
of its objects, ‘‘which are to promote science and the useful arts, and to
establish a national museum of natural history, etc.’’

The constitution of this society in its first form was somewhat meager,
but as printed on the cover of the second bulletin of proceedings is
decidedly prophetic of the future act of incorporation of the Smithsonian
Institution,

Its plan, however, was conceived in a broad and liberal spirit, its
membership was a strong one, including at the beginning about ninety
representative men of Washington, Members of Congress, scientific men,
clergymen, and prominent citizens, and as many more corresponding
members, among whom were all the leading men of the country. Among
its principal officers were the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy,
ex-President Adams, the Chief of Engineers of the Army, and other
prominent officials. ‘The meetings were well attended, the membership
was enthusiastic, gifts of books and specimens began to flow in, and the
prospects of the society looked very bright.

In his discourse * on the objects and importance of the National Insti1-
tution, delivered January 5, 1841, its president, Mr. Poinsett, referred
pointedly to the Smithson bequest, saying that it offered a favorable
occasion for carrying into effect all the important objects connected with
a national institution, such as that just being organized in Washington,
enabling the ‘‘Government to afford all necessary protection to the pro-
motion of science and the useful arts* without the exercise of any
doubtful power, etc.’’

Soon after this, in February, Senators Linn and Preston, both members
of the National Institution, proposed new bills for the organization of the
Smithsonian Institution, at the same time reporting a bill to incorporate
the National Institution for the Promotion of Science.

By these bills the entire management of the Smithsonian fund was to
be intrusted to the National Institution. Its officers, a superintendent
and six professors, were to be nominated by that society, which was also
to prescribe their duties. Provision was made for joint occupancy by the
two institutions of buildings to be erected at the cost of the Smithson
bequest, and finally it was required—

That all collections of works of art and of natural history, owned by the United

States, not otherwise assigned (or all works of art, and all books relating thereto,
and all collections and curiosities belonging to the United States, in the possession of

any of the Executive Departments, and not necessarily connected with the duties
thereof) shall be deposited in said buildings (or shall be transferred to said institu-
tion, to be there preserved and arranged).

In these bills, drawn up in 1840, may be found the germ of the National
Museum idea, even to the extent of a proposition for an appropriation
from the National Treasury, to be expended under the direction of the
cfficers of the National Institution, the president and directors of which
were the prototypes of the Smithsonian Chancellor and Regents for pur-
poses connected with the administration of the collections such as it was
not deemed proper to pay for out of the Smithsonian fund.*

The object of the National Institution was the promotion of science
and the useful arts, but the principal agency chosen for accomplishing
this object was a national museum of natural history, etc.

This was stated clearly in its declaration of objects at the time of its
organization in 1840, as well as in its constitution.?

The sections relating to the Museum in the proposed act of incorpora-
tion of the Institution of 1841 corresponded precisely to Articles XIV
and XVI of the constitution of the society, except that the provision
for the appointment of curators by the Institution is omitted.

It was evidently the intention that the Board of Managers should
control the national collections by virtue of the authority vested in them
in their proposed control of the Smithsonian Institution.

The act to incorporate the National Institution did not receive the
approval of Congress until 1842,° when new proposals for the organiza-

tion of the Smithsonian Institution were brought forward, very similar
in many respects to those which had developed within the National
Institution. :

The idea of a national museum to be administered in connection with
the Smithsonian organization had been suggested by no one in the five
years of discussion which preceded the organization of the National
Institution.

It is true that there had been plans proposed, especially those of
Dunglison and Rush, which might have led up to the development of
a museum, but the value of the museum as an educational agency and
as an aid to research was not understood in those days. In its former
aspect, it needed the teachings of the great exhibitions from 1851 to 1876,
in the latter the vivifying influence of the Darwinian scientific renais-
sance of 1859.

The subject of the Smithsonian legacy and its proper disposition was
henceforth one of those most frequently discussed by the founders of
the National Institution, and for years it was the opinion of many
influential men that this society should be made the custodian of the
Smithson fund, and that the interests of the two establishments should
be united.

A suggestive indication of the sentiment of the officers of the Insti-
tution is found in the letter of the committee of management to the
Secretaries of War and the Navy in 1842, in which they remark that
the object of the National Institution is ‘‘to increase and diffuse knowl-
edge among men’’—making prominent the words of the Smithsonian
bequest instead of the official definition of the objects of their own
society, and deliberately indicating the fact of quotation, by the custom-
ary symbols.

The influence of this society was strongly and continuously present in
Congress, for the six years which followed its organization, until the
Smithsonian act was finally framed, and it seems very appropriate to try
to ascertain whose was the master mind which not only prevailed in
finally ingrafting the development of the National Museum upon the
Smithsonian project, but which directly or indirectly led to the forma-
tion of the various features of organization which have become such
characteristic elements in the Smithsonian plan.

The controlling mind was evidently that of Joel R. Poinsett, of South
Carolina, who was Secretary of the Navy in 1840, and at whose house
the society was organized, by eight persons, among whom were, of course,
Mr. Poinsett, Colonel Abert, Mr. Markoe, and Colonel Totten. Mr.
Poinsett was senior director, under the first plan of organization, and
occupied the chair at every meeting until, under the amended constitu-
tion, he was elected its first president in 1841. ‘The amendment to the
constitution was doubtless made in order to retain his official leadership,
for he became director ex officio while Secretary of the Navy. With the
100 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

close of Van Buren’s Administration he became a private citizen, but the
constitution was amended before his retirement from the Cabinet, and
the position of presiding officer was never proffered to his successor.

Although, from this time on, absent from the city, he was retained in
the presidency and reelected in 1841, the vice-president of the society,
Colonel Peter Force, continually presiding in his absence.

Although the society elected its officers annually, Mr. Poinsett told
Mr. Adams soon after his election that he should for two years come to
Washington to preside over the National Institution for the Promotion
of Science. He was in fact reelected to the presidency at every annual
meeting until that of 1845, when, having declined candidacy, Senator
Levi Woodbury was chosen president and Mr. Poinsett was unanimously
elected an honorary member of the Institution.

From this period the decline of the society’s prosperity was marked.
It is more probable, however, that Mr. Poinsett’s lack of interest was a
result of the weakness of the society than that the weakness resulted
from his lack of interest.

Perhaps, however, if Mr. Poinsett had been a resident of Washington
rather than of South Carolina during the four years of his presidency,
the result would have been different.

That Mr. Poinsett, as early as 1838, was thinking seriously about the
disposition of the Smithsonian bequest is evident from an entry in the
diary of John Quincy Adams, under date of December 8.1. Mr, Adams
was evidently suspicious, and believed that Mr. Poinsett did not give him
his entire confidence. In April, 1839, he talked to him again, and in
1841 he wrote again in his diary: ‘‘ April 14. Mr. Poinsett called upon
me and now fully disclosed his project, which is to place the investment
and disposal of the Smithsonian funds under the management of the
American Institution for the Promotion of Literature and Science.*

He said he had at present no other occupation on hand, and w onl
be willing to devote two years entirely to organizing this establishment
and getting it into full operation.’’

‘““T know not,’’ continued the aged statesman, ‘‘that it could be
accomplished more effectively, and think I must acquiesce in this arrange-
ment and endeavor to carry it through.’’ .

Since the bills of Messrs. Linn and Preston had been already for two
months before the Senate, it seems strange that Mr. Adams should have
looked upon Mr. Poinsett’s communication as a revelation—still more
so when it is remembered how clearly he had expressed himself in his
Discourse in January.?

* Extracts from the Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, Rhees, Documents, p. 769.

? Evidently meaning the National Institution.

3Mr. Poinsett was not only the first to publicly suggest the union of the Smith-
sonian with the National Institution, but was constant in his advocacy of the project.
(See remarks, March 8, 1841, Proceedings of the National Institution, 2d BullL., p. 69,
The Genests of the United States Nationat Museum. IOI

Poinsett, when elected to the presidency of the National Institution,
was a man sixty-two years of age, who had lived an eventful life, full of
opportunities for observing the institutions of Europe, Asia, and South
America. His culture was broad and sympathetic, and he was, perhaps,
better fitted than any of the public men of his time to appreciate the
necessity of organizing our public institutions on the most liberal and
comprehensive plan.

In his interviews with those who advocated the establishment of an
observatory as the first result of the Smithsonian legacy, he showed
full appreciation of the value of such an institution, but seems to have
kept before his own mind a much more comprehensive ideal.

Poinsett was the first to suggest the idea of a great national museum
at the capital of the nation.

In his address upon The Objects and Importance of the National
Institution for the Promotion of Science, delivered at the first anni-
versary meeting of the society, January 4, 1841, he advocated boldly the
formation of a national museum as one of the most important features
of a central establishment at the seat of Government, such as is main-
tained in every country in Europe for the advantage of those who culti-
vated the arts and sciences.

To one who reads this address it will become evident that it was
Poinsett who put in words the definition of the objects of the National
Institution—to promote science and the useful arts, and to establish a
national museum of natural history.

The following is an extract from this address:

The lovers of science, literature, and the fine arts, residing in the District, fe!t
sensibly the absence of those resources which are found elsewhere, and are necessary
for the attainment of knowledge. They were mortified to perceive that the great
advantages possessed by the public authorities at Washington were neglected, and

and letter, February 7, 1842, Idem., p.157.) Doctor Peter S. Duponceau, president
of the American Philosophical Society, in a letter to the Institution in November,
1840, remarked: ‘‘ Congress can not find a better opportunity to execute the will of
that beneficent testator than by laying hold of your institution, and making it its
own.’’ (Idem., Ist Bull., p. 12.) The Hon. Virgil Maxcy, chargé d’affaires at Bel-
gium, wrote in December, 1840, that in his opinion no better use could be made of
the bequest than ‘‘to place it under the direction of a Society organized for the
carrying into effect identical views with those contemplated by the philanthropical
and philosophical testator.’’ (Idem., p. 46.)

that, at the seat of Government of this great nation, there existed fewer means than
in any other city of the Union of prosecuting those studies, which, while they
impart dignity and enjoyment to existence, lead to the most useful practical results.
They believed it to be their duty to arouse the attention of Government to these
deficiencies, and, at all events, to address themselves to the task of supplying them,
as far as could be done by their individual and combined exertions. For these pur-
poses they have formed an association and applied themselves to collect specimens
of geology and mineralogy, and other objects of natural history, and, for the short
period of its existence, the efforts of the Institution have been eminently successful.

They have entered into correspondence with other learned societies, and have been
encouraged to proceed by their approbation, and profited by their generous coopera-
tion. They have invited the assistance of their fellow-citizens in the most distant
States and Territories, and hope, by their aid, to collect documents and facts illus-
trative of the early history of our country, specimens of its geology and of its min-
eral and vegetable productions, and, if not to preserve the animals and plants
themselves, which are passing away before the progress of settlement and cultiva-
tion, at least to perpetuate their forms, and the memory of their existence. ‘They
hope to be able to illustrate these subjects and others connected with them by a
series of gratuitous lectures, and entertain a confident expectation that numbers,
whose duties compel them annually to assemble here, will view with interest collec-
tions of the natural productions of America, drawn from every State and Territory
in the Union, and, becoming sensible of their utility, will contribute on their return
to swell their amount, and to spread throughout the country a taste for literary and
scientific pursuits.

In another place in the discourses of Mr. Poinsett, we find avowals of
plans and ambitious aspirations for the future of the National Museum
which would satisfy the most ambitious of its supporters of to-day. He
spoke thus :

Specimens of natural history are rapidly accumulating. The exploring expedition
has already sent home a large collection, which remains packed away in boxes in a
room belonging to the Philadelphia Museum, generously loaned by the company for
that purpose; and we may anticipate from the ability and well-known zeal of the
naturalists who accompanied it by order of Government that the squadron itself,
shortly expected, will return richly freighted with objects of natural history. I can
not believe that after all the labor, pains, and expense incurred in procuring them,
these specimens are not to be brought to Washington, to be arranged and exhibited
here. A geological survey of the Territory of lowa was made a few months since, by
order of the Government, and numerous valuable specimens collected by Mr. Owen.
Mr. Nicolet has brought with him interesting collections made in the country he
visited, and Doctor King, of Missouri, lately sent to the lead region on business con-
nected with the ordnance office, while there collected specimens of minerals which
are likewise destined for Washington. The ordnance officers who have lately returned
from Europe, have brought with them numerous specimens of the iron ores used in
the foundries there, and measures have been taken to procure, as objects of compari-
son, those of the United States.

Several individuals have transmitted donations to the Institution, while others have
deposited their collections with us, from a desire to have them preserved, and, at the
same time, to benefit science. We have reason to believe that this will be extensively
done as soon as the Institution is firmly established. There are many of our country-
men who, like Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum, look forward with
regret to the sale and dispersion of their collections, made at great cost and pains,
and desiring to have them preserved entire, would deposit them with an institution
which will be as stable as the Government that protects it.

In every country in Europe, those who cultivate the arts and sciences enjoy the
advantage of finding in each capital a central establishment, such as we propose.

In London, the Royal Museum, which was commenced by the enlightened liber-
ality of an individual, and subsequently enriched by similar bequests, and now
liberally patronized by Government, possesses all that is necessary to protect and
encourage literature, science, and the arts.

The Society for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts in Dublin, having
an extensive museum of natural history, a botanic garden, and school of design,
fulfills effectually the objects of its institution, and justifies the very liberal patronage
of the British Government. There students in every branch of science find the means
of improvement, and some of the most accomplished artists in England have been
instructed in this school.

In this country, we are best acquainted with the museum, botanical and zoological
gardens, and liberal course of instruction at the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, where
strangers resort, from every quarter of the world, to consult the collections and iisten
to lectures, which are open to all who choose to attend them. These courses of lec-
tures are delivered by the ablest and most eloquent men in France, on every branch
of science. In the summer botany is taught in a garden abounding in all the vege-
table productions of the world; zoology in the midst of specimens of every known
animal, and other branches of natural history, with the advantage of extensive
collections, which are augmenting daily by an enlightened and active system of
exchanges; chemistry and technology are illustrated by well-conducted experiments
and admirably adapted apparatus, and every branch of natural philosophy taught
with clearness and precision, and explained by the most ample means of illustration.
These lectures are attended by students who have completed their academic course,
and by men of science who seek to increase their knowledge.

There can be no doubt that a national institution, such as we contemplate, having
at its command an observatory, a museum containing collections of all the produc-
tions of nature, a botanic and zoological garden, and the necessary apparatus for
illustrating every branch of physical science, would attract together men of learning
and students from every part of our country, would open new avenues of intelligence
throughout the whole of its vast extent, and would contribute largely to disseminate
among the people the truths of nature and the light of science.

A fortunate concurrence of circumstances offers a favorable occasion to carry all these
important objects into immediate effect. A liberaland enlightened Englishman, fore-
seeing the benefits which would result to science throughout the world, by its success-
ful cultivation in the vast and extensive field offered by these States and Territories,
with enlarged views and praiseworthy philanthropy has bequeathed a fund to be
employed for the sacred purposes of increasing and diffusing knowledge among
men. This bequest will enable the Government to afford all necessary protection to
the promotion of science and the useful arts, without the exercise of any doubtful
power, by the application of the annual interest of this fund to the establishment of
an observatory, the erection of suitable buildings to contain the collections, and for
lecture rooms, the purchase of books and instruments, and the salaries of professors
and curators.

Poinsett’s enthusiasm was contagious, and his arguments, based as
they evidently were upon careful observations and judicious reasoning,
aud inspired by hopeful patriotism, brought him many sympathizers.
Among these the Hon. Levi Woodbury, who had been a member of the
saine Cabinet with Mr. Poinsett, and subsequently was in the Senate,
Senator W. C. Preston, one of the directors of the Institution, Senator R.
J. Walker, of Mississippi, Senator L. F. Linn, of Missouri, corresponding

members, appear to have been especially friendly to the plans of Mr. Poin-
sett, and on various occasions promoted the interests of the National
Institution on the floor of the Senate from 1841 to 1846.

In June, 1842, Mr. Poinsett was again in Washington, and on the 11th
presided at a meeting at the home of Mr. Francis Markoe for the purpose
of connecting the organizations of the National Institution with that of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Mr. Preston [wrote John Quincy Adams] has introduced into the Senate a bill for
combining together these two institutions, and now stated to the meeting his views
on the subject, embracing an appropriation of $20,000, and the occupation by law of
a large portion of the Patent Office building for the preservation and arrangement
of the objects of curiosity collected by the exploring expedition under Lieutenant
Wilkes, now daily expected home; and he called on me to say how far my purposes
may be concurrent with these suggestions.

I said I had the warmest disposition to favor them, and thought there was but one
difficulty in the way, which might perhaps be surmounted. I had believed that the
whole burden and the whole honor of the Smithsonian Institution should be exclu-
sively confined to itself, and not entangled or commingled with any national estab-
lishment requiring appropriations of public money. I exposed the principles upon
which all my movements relating to the Smithsonian bequest have been founded, as
well as the bills which at four successive Congresses I have reported, first for
obtaining the money, and then for disposing of the fund.

At the motion of Mr. Walker, of Mississippi, the president, Poinsett, was author-
ized to appoint a committee of five members of the Institute, to confer with Mr.
Preston and me upon the means of connecting the Smithsonian Institution with
the National Institute.

Nothing seems to have resulted from these deliberations.

On the 13th of June, at a stated meeting of the National Institution,
Senator Preston was present, and delivered, as the records inform us, ‘‘an
eloquent speech, in which he descanted at length on the history and labors
of the Institute, what it had done, and what it-proposed to do, its capac-
ity to be eminently useful to the country and Congress, the advantage of
uniting the Smithsonian Institution with it, etc., and appealed to Con-
gress, and to the liberal citizens of the United States, to come forward in
aid of a glorious cause, and in accomplishment of the great national
objects which the Institute has in view.’’*

Senator Preston’s bill for the union of the two institutions came to
naught.”

During this session, however, the act to incorporate the National Insti-
tute, as it was henceforth to be called, passed in a much modified form,
and was approved July 27, 1842, and the society now seems to have felt

requested for publication (Idem., p. 241), but I can not learn that it was ever put
in type.

report, and in Proceedings of the National Institute, 3d Bull., pp. 388-392. See also

‘much more secure in its project of retaining the control of the National
Museum, and either of gaining eventually the management of the Smith-
son fund or of obtaining an appropriation from Congress.

Senator Woodbury,‘ in commenting upon the form of the charter,
remarked that—

Care was taken originally to make the Institute different from all other chartered
bodies, even in this District, so as to elevate it above every motive of personal gain,
dedicating its labors exclusively to objects of a public character, and vesting all the
property possessed for this purpose in the Government itself; and thus, by rendering
it zational in substance, as well as name, to obviate any constitutional objection
which might arise against measures in its behalf.

The change of the name from Institution to Institute seems to have
been made in deference to a suggestion by Doctor Duponceau in a letter
written April, 1842, in which he said:

I have seen with great pleasure the bill brought into the Senate by the Hon. Mr.
Preston. It fully coincides with the views that I have expressed. The object, in
my opinion, is, to preserve the superiority of the National Institution over the Smith-
sonian, and that of the Government over both.

I would beg leave to suggest, whether it would not be advisable to make some
small alteration in the name of the National Institution, so that it should not bear
exactly the same name with the Smithsonian, but one expressive of some degree of
superiority. I would recommend, for instance, that of Institute, which appears to
me more dignified than that of institution, which is equally applicable to a school or
college as to a great national establishment for the promotion of science. My idea
would be to call the national establishment the ‘‘ National Institute for the Promo-
tion of Science,’’ and the subordinate one the ‘‘Smithsonian Institution,’’ without
more.

No appropyiation came, however, and the charter and changed name
failed to make the society more prosperous.

At a meeting June 20,* 1842, a resolution was passed appointing a com-
mittee to solicit private contributions of money and property.

At another meeting, August 8, 1842, a report’ was made by this com-
mittee in which they proposed to institute an annual scientific conven-
tion at Washington, during the session of Congress, and under the

3The committee appointed to devise and execute such measures as should be
deemed expedient to obtain contributions and other aid to the Institute would make
an informal report.

They propose making an appeal to the public, by disseminating an account of the
Institute, its past efforts, its condition, and its prospects, and an exhibition of the
many reasons why it should be sustained and encouraged by the citizens of the
United States. In their judgment the best means of doing this will be the publica-

auspices of the Institution, and also recommended an extensive system
of exchange of specimens for the benefit of the museum.

At the meeting of September 12, 1842, Mr. Poinsett, the president,
proposed a series of resolutions* intended to put the recommendation of
the report into effect. :

All of these resolutions and reports were issued in the form of circulars
(October 15, 1842, and February 24, 1843), but the appeals ‘‘to the lib-
erality and public spirit cf our countrymen’’ were without avail.

Consequently a special meeting of the board of management was held
December 23, 1843, at the office of the Secretary of State. ‘That the
society was regarded at that time as one of national importance is shown
by the presence at the meeting of Mr. Upshur, the Secretary of State,
who took an active part in the proceedings; the Hon. John Quincy
Adams, who presided; Senator Levi Woodbury, late Secretary of the
Treasury, who agreed to represent the meeting in Congress; the Hon.
J. R. Ingersoll, who acted as secretary, and who wrote out in his pream-
ble to the minutes of the meeting a forcible statement of the needs of the
society; the Hon. C. J. Ingersoll, Senator R. J. Walker, besides Colonel
Peter Force, Colonel Abert, Colonel Totten, Lieutenant Maury, and the
officers of the society.

The issue of this meeting was the decision ‘‘ to memorialize Congress
on the subject of the condition and wants of the Institute.”’

tion of the remarks addressed to the Institute by the Hon. Mr. Preston, Senator from
South Carolina, on the evening of the 13th of June last.

They also propose to address circulars to prominent individuals in the different
States, inviting their cooperation, particularly in receiving and transmitting con-
tributions.

They recommend that the Institute authorize the president and secretaries to
sanction their circulars by their official signatures.

They propose that a meeting of the learned men of our country, distinguished for
their attainments in the different sciences, particularly in those termed physical,
should be held annually at the seat of the General Government, at some early period
of the session of Congress, under the auspices of the Institute, to communicate the
results of their inquiries, to compare their observations, and to promote the general
interests of science. It has seemed to the committee that this Institute affords an
opportunity, which ought not to be neglected, of concentrating the genius and
learning of our country at a common center, from which the beams of intelligence
will radiate to gladden and bless the land.

They recommend that, in addition to the powers already conferred, the committee
be authorized to make arrangements for such a meeting, at a day as early as may be
found practicable, and to invite the attendance of those who may desire to partici-
pate in its proceedings.

They think that a system of exchanges of mineral and geological specimens, and
perhaps of other articles, with the private and public collections in different parts of
the Union, may be established with reciprocal advantage; and that the museum of
this Institute may, by these and other means, be enabled in time to exhibit the
various treasures of our different soils; and they would suggest the appointment of
a committee to whom this subject should be given specially in charge. (Proceed-
ings of the National Institute, 3d Bull., p. 335.)

The memorial was presented in due course of time, and in June, 1844,
Senator Choate presented a report upon the character and uses of the
Institute, recommending that its property should be vested in the United
States and an appropriation made for its benefit.

I have not been able to find a copy of this memorial, but since it was
evidently prepared by Mr. J. R. Ingersoll‘ it is safe to assume that the
grounds for asking aid were essentially those named in his ‘‘ preamble’’
read to the society December 28, 1843.”

In the meantime, on the occasion of the first annual meeting of the
National Institute (under its new name and in its capacity as a corpora-
tion), in April, 1844, the meeting of the friends of science, including,
besides all the members and patrons of the National Institute, the mem-
bers of the American Philosophical Society and of the Association of
American Geologists and Naturalists (the predecessor of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science), had been held in Wash-
ington. ‘The occasion was a brilliantly successful one. The President
of the United States presided at the first meeting and some prominent
public men at each of the others.

The National Institute received its full share of encomium. President
Tyler lauded it highly, held out the hope that the Government would
‘“continue to it a fostering care,’’ and expressed in a general way the
hope that it should be identified with the future National Museum and
the future Smithsonian Institution.

‘““Where can the Government find,’’ said he, ‘‘a safer depository for
the fruits of its expeditions, fitted out to explore distant and unknown
regions, than the National Institute? What can it better do for the
‘increase and diffusion of knowledge among men’ than by patronizing
and sustaining this magnificent undertaking ?’’

Senator Walker, of Mississippi, one of the directors of the Institute,
delivered a very appreciative introductory address on the present con-

”)

dition and history of American science, ending with an appeal to scien-
tific men to come forward and unite withthe people in sustaining and
advancing the National Institute.

Senator Woodbury, in a letter to the secretary of the Institution,
expressed himself strongly in favor of making the society the agent of
the Government in the matter of caring for collections, patents, and
copyrights, and also in the execution of the Smithson trust.

John Quincy Adams closed his address in these words:

I avail myself of this occasion to express my regret that, having taken an humble
part in the establishment of this Institution from its first foundation, under the
auspices of Mr. Poinsett, I have been able to contribute so little to its promotion

"At the meeting of May, 1844, the Hon. Joseph R. Ingersoll offered remarks upon
the pecuniary embarrassments of the Institute, and expressed a hope that Congress
would furnish the required aid. (Proceedings of the National Institute, 3d Bull.,
Pp. 359- )

and advantage, and to add my heartfelt satisfaction at the prosperity which, by the
untiring exertions and fervid zeal of its executive officers, it has attained. I believe
it eminently deserving of the fostering care and liberal patronage of the Congress of
the United States, and could anticipate no happier close to my public life than to
contribute, by my voice and by my vote, to record the sanction of the nation’s
munificence to sustain the National Institute devoted to the cause of science.

The Hon. Richard Rush, in a paper on The Smithsonian Bequest,
submitted to this meeting, urged that the Smithsonian fund should be
‘“engrafted upon the National Institute,’’ and submitted an elaborate
argument in favor of his proposal.

It was a gala week for the National Institution. The meeting was in
every respect a success, and there was every reason to believe that Con-
gress would share in the general enthusiasm and take the society under
its patronage.

In the circular of invitation dated March 5, 1844, the objects of the
meeting as a means of strengthening the position of the society had been
boldly stated, and the committee did not hesitate to say that ‘‘ should
the meeting prove as successful as the hopes of the managers in relation
to it are ardent, they will expect, hereafter to welcome all who may visit
the Association, in apartments peculiar to itself, stored with the objects
of its honest pride and worthy of the distinguished visitors.’’

Such a paper signed by such influential names as those of John C.
Spencer, Secretary of the Treasury, R. J. Walker, W. C. Rives, Rufus
Choate, of the Senate, J. R. Ingersoll and W. C. Preston, of the House of
Representatives, A. D. Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and
Abbot Lawrence, of Boston, was surely a powerful campaign document.

None the less weighty was the ‘‘Memorial of the Friends of Science
who attended the April meeting of the National Institute,’’ signed by
nearly forty representative scientific men and college presidents from all
parts of the United States, speaking in terms of high commendation of
the National Institute, and particularly of the extent and value of its
museum material, and expressing the hope ‘‘that the enlightened and
intelligent members of Congress will distinguish the present session by
the necessary appropriation of funds to an object so truly national and
so truly republican.”’

This indorsement of the museum work of the Institute is very cordial
and comprehensive, and very significant; is indicative of a decided growth
in public opinion in regard to museums—a growth largely due in the first
instance to the suggestions and later to the fostering care of Mr. Poinsett
and his society, the National Institute.

The hopes of the promoters of the Institute were doomed to disappoint-
ment. Congress adjourned without making any provision for its needs.

On the 12th of July a new scheme was proposed for collecting money
from private sources by the efforts of trustworthy agents, and in December
a committee was appointed to again memorialize Congress."

‘Proceedings of the National Institute, 3d Bull., p. 375.
The Genesis of the United States National Museum. 109

The movement had received its deathblow, however. ‘The failure of
the tremendous effort of April, 1844, disheartened all its friends. At the
next annual meeting Mr. Poinsett declined reelection to the presidency.
The society’s publications were discontinued, and even the annual address
of Senator Woodbury, solicited for publication by the society, seems to
have remained in manuscript unprinted.

No more meetings were held, no more bulletins printed, the magnifi-
cent list of 350 resident and 1,250 corresponding members began to grow
shorter. An effort was made to revive it in 1847, and a meager report
was made once afterward by the corresponding secretary. In 1855 it was
brought into existence for a time as a local scientific society, and issued
a new series of proceedings." Its glory departed, however, with the first
annual meeting in 1844, and the attention of Congress was directed toward
the organization of the Smithsonian Institution.

The influence of the National Institute upon the history of science in
the United States, and particularly in educating public opinion and the
judgment of Congress toan application of the proper means of disposing
of the Smithsonian legacy, can not well be overestimated.

If the Smithsonian had been organized before the National Institute
had exerted its influences, it would have been a school, an observatory,
or an agricultural experiment station.

In 1846, however, the country was prepared to expect it to be a general
agency for the advancement of scientific interests of all kinds—as catho-
lic, as unselfish, as universal as the National Institute.

The National Institute, after nearly five years of activity, suddenly
ceased to be a center of public interest. The struggle over the Smith-
sonian bequest, however, still continued. During the T'wenty-seventh
Congress, 1841-1843, the Senate did nothing. "The House of Represent-
atives appointed a select committee on the subject, and Mr. Adams as
its chairman reported a new bill, providing still more thoroughly for
the erection of an observatory and the publication of a nautical almanac
to be called the Smithsonian Almanac. Petitions continued to come
in, some urging action and asking for the establishment of prizes for
scientific essays, another for the establishment of an agricultural school
and farm in the District of Columbia. ‘The National Institute had
perhaps fallen somewhat into disfavor with Congress—or, it may be, had
become so prominent as to awaken feelings of opposition.

The Twenty-eighth Congress (1843-1845) brought their deliberations
more nearly to an issue.

The astronomical observatory bill (H. R. 418, T'wenty-eighth Congress )
was again presented by Mr. Adams, but not acted upon. In the Senate,
both in the first and second sessions, a bill for the Smithsonian Institu-

tion was reported, June 6, 1844, by the Committee on the Library, through
Senator Tappan, which, before it was finally brought to a vote, was brought
into a form somewhat resembling that which finally was adopted. It pro-
vided, however, for the appointment of various professors and lecturers
for a school of agricultural and mechanical arts, as well as for experimental
gardens, a library of science and economics, and a museum.

The museum clause of this bill was much the same as that finally agreed
to, and contained a provision that the natural-history objects and geolog-
ical and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States, “‘in
whosesoever custody the same may be,’’ should be transferred to the
custody of the board of managers of the Smithsonian Institution.

This was evidently worded with the purpose of withdrawing from the
possession of the National Institution the various collections, including
those which had belonged to Smithson, which had fallen into the hands
of that society between 1840 and 1845. Indeed, the National Institution
seems to have already become the object of some distrust and prejudice.
A proposition that two of the seven ‘‘managers’’ not ex-officio members
of the board should be selected from the membership of the National Insti-
tution caused a vigorous debate in the Senate, in the course of which at
least two Senators objected strongly to placing the administration of the
Smithsonian Institution, even to so slight a degree as this, in the hands
of a private corporation.

The act finally passed the Senate, but was not acted on by the House.

In connection with Mr. Tappan’s bill, in January, 1845, Senator Choate,
of Massachusetts, first appeared in advocacy of the establishment of a
great library, and delivered his famous oration upon the influence of
books. ‘The amendment at that time proposed, together with the amend-
ments urged by Mr. George P. Marsh, in connection with the Owen-Hough
bill, brought forward in the following session, had a great influence upon
the final adjustment of the plan of administration.*

To the Twenty-ninth Congress (1845-1847) belongs the honor of finally
formulating the act of incorporation by which the Smithsonian Institution
was established.

This was done through Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana, who reported
the bill nearly in its final form. John Quincy Adams was a member of
the select committee to whom it was referred, together with Mr. Owen,
chairman, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. George P. Marsh, Mr. Alexander D. Sims,
Mr. Jefferson Davis, and Mr. Wilmot.

Mr. Adams was now for the first time willing to omit his advocacy of
a Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory, the Naval Observatory having
now been organized, and being, as Mr. Owen remarked, ‘at least equal
in everything but the experience of its observers to the Royal Observa-
tory at Greenwich.’’

It is not my purpose to describe the growth of the Smithsonian plan

of organization, except in its bearings upon the development of the .
museum idea.

In the bill proposed by Robert Dale Owen in 1846 the National Insti-
tute was recognized to the extent of placing two of its members on the
Board of Managers, an arrangement which was continued in the Board of
Regents in the Hough bill which finally passed.

An amendment to the Owen bill, proposed by Joseph R. Ingersoll,
and passed, and which, had it not been superseded in the Hough bill,
would have given the National Institute a strong and perhaps permanent
hold upon the national collections, read as follows:

Src. 5. And be it further enacted, That, in proportion as suitable arrangements
can be made for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens
belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which may be in the city of
Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to such
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Managers to receive them, and shall
be arranged in such order, and so classed, as best to facilitate the examination and
study of them, in the buildings so as aforesaid to be erected for the institution; and
the managers of said institution shall afterwards, as new specimens in natural history,
geology, or mineralogy may be obtained for the museum of the institution, by
exchanges of duplicate specimens belonging to the institution (which they are
hereby authorized to make), or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise,
cause such new specimens to be also appropriately classed and arranged. And the
minerals, books, manuscripts, and other property of James Smithson, which have
been received by the Government of the United States, and are now placed in the
Department of State, shall be removed to said institution, and shall be preserved
separate and apart from the other property of the institution.

Src. 6. And be it further enacted, That the managers of said institution shall
appoint a Superintendent, whose duty it shall be to take charge of the ground,
buildings, and property belonging to the institution, and carefully preserve the same
from injury; and such Superintendent shall be the Secretary of the Board of Man-
agers, and shall, under their direction, make a fair and accurate record of all their
proceedings, to be preserved in said institution; and the said Superintendent shall
also discharge the duties of librarian and of keeper of the museum, and may, with
the consent of the Board of Managers, employ assistants; and the said managers
shall appoint a professor of agriculture, horticulture, and rural economy; and the
said professor may hire, from time to time, so many gardeners, practical agriculturists,
and laborers as may be necessary to cultivate the ground and maintain a botanical
garden; and he shall make, under the supervision of the board of management, such
experiments as may be of general utility throughout the United States, to determine
the utility and advantage of new modes and instruments of culture, to determine
whether new fruits, plants, and vegetables may be cultivated to advantage in the
United States; and the said officers shall receive for their services such sum as may
be allowed by the Board of Managers, to be paid semiannually on the first day of
January and July; and the said officers, and all other officers of the institution, shall
be removable by the Board of Managers, whenever, in their judgment, the interests
of the institution require any of the said officers to be changed.

In the Hough bill there was an attempt of another kind to weld
together the fate of the Smithsonian Museum and the National Cabinet

of Curiosities, by giving to the Board of Regents the authority to erect
a building by the side of the Patent Office, so as to form a wing of that
ig Memorial of George Brown Goode.

structure, and to connect it with the hall then containing the National
Cabinet, so as to constitute that hall in whole or in part the depository
of the cabinet of the institution.

This was discretionary, however, with the Regents, who fortunately
did not look upon the plan with favor.

Reference has been made to the marked similarity between the plans
of organization of the National and Smithsonian institutions. In addi-
tion to the feature of museum custody, which has already been discussed,
there were others no less significant.

The National Institution, like the Smithsonian Institution, had a
superior board of officers, composed of the President of the United States
and the members of his Cabinet. It had alsoa board of directors, which
included in its membership delegates from the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, corresponding in function to the Smithsonian Board of
Regents. In other respects, still more markedly than in the constitution
of its governing board, the Smithsonian seems to have been organized
with the plan of the National Institution in view. ‘The objects, as defined
in the Congressional act of establishment (sections 5 and 6), correspond
very closely to those announced in the early publications of the National
Institution.

The Institution at its foundation divided its members into eight classes,
as follows:

I. Astronomy, Geography, and Natural Philosophy;
II. Natural History;
III. Geology and Mineralogy;
IV. Chemistry;
V. The Application of Science to the Useful Arts;
VI. Agriculture; :
VII. American History and Antiquities;

VIII. Literature and Fine Arts;
and in all these classes, except the fourth, made plans for the collection
of museum material. Ethnography was grouped by Mr. Poinsett with
geography, with which he states that it is ‘‘intimately connected, and
indeed forming a part of it until it was lately erected into a separate
science.”

It is worthy of remark that the term ‘‘manager,’’* to designate a
member of the governing board, was employed in every bill, except in

«The term regent was undoubtedly suggested by the organization of the University
of the State of New York, a term peculiar to Mr. Hough, the mover of the substi-
tute, who was a Representative from that State and who in all probability had been
one of the board of regents of that university.

The Hon. W. J. Hough was the first Secretary of the Institution. Having been
elected to that office September 7, 1846, he served until the election of Professor
Henry, on December 3. Mr. B. B. French was elected assistant secretary, and
appears to have served until the election of C. C. Jewett, and at a meeting of the
board in December submitted a report for the Secretary.

the substitute which was proposed only a few hours before the final
action, and that when the election of the first Secretary was held, Francis
Markoe, jr., who had been for six years Secretary of the National Insti-
tution and was more than anyone else perhaps identified with its inter-
ests, received four votes against seven cast for Professor Henry. Doctor
Charles Pickering, the Curator of the National Institution, also received
one vote.
The term ‘‘curator,’’ as applied to an officer in charge of the national
collections, then came into use for the first time.

THE NATIONAL CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.

The formation of a ‘‘national museum’’ was one of the professed
objects of Poinsett and his associates in the National Institution, but it
does not appear that they ever dignified with that name their collections,
which were usually modestly referred to as constituting the ‘‘cabinet’’?
of the Institution, both in the constitution and in the proceedings of the
society.

In the Hough bill for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution
in 1846, the collection in the Patent Office was officially designated as the
National Cabinet of Curiosities, a name which, though never in general
use, is very appropriate and convenient for use in designating t ie assem-
blage of miscellaneous objects for a time exhibited in the Patent Office
building,

From 1847 to 1851, however, there was no use of the term National
Museum, the collections of natural history which were accumulating
under the care of Professor Baird constituting for the time being the
‘Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.’’

The National Cabinet of Curiosities, carrying with it a certain official
atmosphere, as well as an annual appropriation, was, however, one of the
parents of the greater establishment yet to come. Of its marriage with
the Smithsonian Museum, the National Museum of the United States was
the offspring.

The Smithsonian cabinet of minerals and meteorites was, as we have
seen, the first scientific collection which sie to the United States,
coming into the custody of Mr. Rush in Jane, 38.

*In 1790 a law was passed a Carer ‘to promote thie progress of science and
the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive
right to their respective writings and discoveries.’’ [Sec. vir, par. vm. ]

In this was gathered a collection of models, which was sometimes by courtesy
called ‘The American Museum of Arts,’? but which had no title to the name either
by law or by courtesy. This was destroyed by fire December 15, 1836.

In “An act to promote the progress of the useful arts, etc.,’? approved July 4, 1836,
provision was made for the preservation and display, under the charge of the Com-
missioner of Patents, not only of models, but of ‘‘specimens of compositions and of
fabrics and other manufactures and works of art.’’? [Sec.xx.]

II4 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

Of all the expeditions sent out by the Government, none previous to
the Wilkes exploring expedition, sent out in 1838, was instructed to
bring back collections of natural history.

In the earliest days of our Republic the cabinet of the American Philo-
sophical Society of Philadelphia was doubtless the official museum, and
this was enriched by the efforts of the only naturalist President, Thomas
Jefferson.

The first exploring expedition, that of Lewis and Clarke in 1803, was
sent out by Jefferson, who twenty-three years before, in 1780, began to
agitate the question of exploring the unknown West, and who at that
time offered to raise 1,000 guineas for the purpose from private sources.
Lewis and Clarke returned in 1806, bringing with them some valuable
scientific material, zoological and ethnological. Some of the animals
appear to have found their way to Peale’s Philadelphia Museum. God-
man in his American Natural History mentions a sable which had been
obtained from this source and was to be seen there in 1823. I have
been told that within a few years Indian garments and weapons brought
back by this party were to be seen in St. Louis. Pike’s expedition, in
1805, the second of the exploring enterprises, yielded little in the way of
scientific material. Whatever there was went undoubtedly to the Phila-
delphia Museum, and in 1808 there were still on exhibition at that place
two grizzly bears, which as cubs had been brought by Major Pike from
the region of the Rio del Norte and presented by him to President Jeffer-
son, who gave them to Mr. Peale for his museum. Other specimens
appear to have found shelter in the University of Virginia, where two
sets of antlers brought back by Captain Lewis are still preserved.

In 1820 a third expedition was sent by the General Government to
explore the Northwestern Territory, especially the region around the
Great Lakes and the sources of the Mississippi. This was under charge
of General Lewis Cass, at that time governor of Michigan ‘Territory.
Henry R. Schoolcraft accompanied this expedition as mineralogist, and
Captain D. B. Douglass, United States Army, as topographical engineer,
and both of these sent home considerable collections reported upon by
the specialists of the day, most of whom were at that time concentrated
in Philadelphia.

The fourth and fifth expeditions were those under Major Long, in the
far West; the first, or Rocky Mountain, exploration in 1819-20; the
second, to the sources of the St. Peter’s in 1823. In the first expedition
Major Long was accompanied by Edwin James as botanist and geologist,
who also wrote the narrative published in 1823. The second expedition
was accompanied by William H. Keating, professor of mineralogy and
chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, who was its geologist and
historiographer. Say was the zoologist of both explorations, and the
results of his labors went to the Philadelphia Museum.

The Genesis of the United States National Museum. II5

The sixth Government expedition was that by G. W. Featherston-
haugh, in 1834-35, to explore the geology of the elevated country
beween the Missouri and Red rivers and the Wisconsin Territories. I
have found no record of the disposition of his collections, but it is not
improbable that he may have carried them with him to England.

The seventh expedition was that under Lieutenant Wilkes, already
referred to as having been sent out in 1838, under the direction of Presi-
dent Van Buren, who seems to have intrusted the plans very largely to
Mr. Poinsett, who was the first to urge the formation of a national
museum, and to whom was doubtless due the insertion of the clause
instructing the officers to preserve and bring back collections in natural
history, a precaution which might easily have been overlooked, since the
expedition was organized professedly in the interests of the American
whale fishery.

It was, perhaps, the fact that there was no suitable depository for
collections at the seat of Government that stimulated Mr. Poinsett to
immediate action in 1840, when he founded the National Institution, the
arrival of these collections from the Pacific being at that time expected.

The purpose of Mr. Poinsett’s efforts is shown clearly in his first anni-
versary address:

There are many of our countrymen [says he] who, like Sir Hans Sloane, the
founder of the British Museum, look forward with regret to the sale and dispersion
of their collections, and desiring to have them preserved entire, would deposit them
with an institution which will be as stable as the Government that protects it. For
these purposes, and especially if it [the National Institution] be intrusted, as we
hope it will be, with the specimens of natural history collected by the exploring
squadron, it will be necessary that measures should be early adopted to have erected
on a suitable site a plain, fireproof building, where the increasing and valuable collec-
tions may be displayed, and be examined by the scientific inquirer. We cherish the
hope that they will form the foundation of a National Museum, and contribute to
spread the light of science over our land.

The exploring expedition [he continued] has already sent home a large collec-
tion, which remains packed away in boxes in a room belonging to the Philadelphia
Museum, generously loaned by the company for that purpose; and we may antici-
pate from the ability and well-known zeal of the naturalists who accompanied it,
that the squadron itself, shortly expected, will return richly freighted with objects
of natural history. I can not believe that, after all the labor, pains, and expense

incurred in procuring them, these specimens are not to be brought to Washington
to be arranged and exhibited here.’’!

Mr. Poinsett was at this time still Secretary of War, and had the
power to effect at least the beginning of what he desired to see done,
and one of his last official acts was to persuade his colleague, James K.
Paulding, the Secretary of the Navy, to order these collectioris forwarded
from Philadelphia.

In February the Institution was informed ‘‘that about one hundred
and fifty boxes, the results, as far as have been received, of the Explor-

* Discourse on the Objects and Importance of the National Institution, 1841, p. 50.

116 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

ing Squadron’s exertions, containing a variety of interesting objects of -
Natural History, and destined for the cabinet of the Institution, have
been shipped at Philadelphia, and are expected as soon as the navigation
opens."

Here, again, Mr. Poinsett’s prompt action told in the interest of the
future national museum. If he had waited till the navigation opened
he would have been obliged to treat with the Secretary of the Navy.

The entirely unorganized condition of affairs in Washington and the
lack of experience in museum administration is shown by the fact that
Mr. W. McGuigan, curator of the Philadelphia Museum Company, thought
it necessary to write the following amusing cautionary letter, which was
printed in the bulletin of the Institution:

It would be unadvisable to break open the cases containing the articles collected
by the South Sea Exploring Expedition, until such period as they are intended to be
prepared for exhibition. ‘The immense quantity of arsenic, and corrosive sublimate
necessary for their preservation requires imperatively that very great caution should
be observed, and that the handling and arrangements should be under either the
immediate inspection or personal attention of one fully adequate to all the details
connected with this subject.

In the hands of inexperienced persons death might be the result.

W. McGUIGAN.
PHILADELPHIA, February 6, 1842.

Still another step was taken on March 3, 1841, the day before the final
adjournment, which I am also disposed to attribute to the forethought
and interest of Mr. Poinsett, which was the appropriation by Congress
of $5,000 ‘‘for defraying the expenses of transporting to the city of
Washington and of arranging the collections made by the exploring
expedition.”’

The committee, consisting of Colonel Abert, Mr. Markoe, Mr. Dayton,
and Doctor King, appointed under a resolution passed at the stated meet-
ing of the National Institution on the 13th December, 1841, which is
in the following words :

Resolved, That a committee of four members be appointed by the Chair to
examine the subject of Exchanges, to propose a plan for that purpose, and to report
fully thereon to the Institution for its further consideration and action, beg leave, in
pursuance of the directions of the said resolution, to report—

That the duty devolved on the committee by the resolution, is, First, to examine the
subject of exchanges; second, to propose a plan of exchanges; and, third, to report
thereon to the Institution. In reference to the first point, viz: ‘‘the examination of
the subject,’’ the committee state that they have examined the subject, and that the
result has been a full conviction of mind that a system of exchanges is of very great
importance in the accomplishment of one of the primary objects for which the
National Institution has been declared to be formed, viz: ‘‘the establishment of a
national museum of natural history,’’ etc. Exchanges enter essentially into the
plan of every society constituted as the National Institution, and haying like objects
in view; and no occasion has been omitted to acquaint societies and individuals,
whose correspondence has been sought by or offered to the National Institution, that

* Proceedings of the National Institution, Ist Bull., p. 48.

The Genests of the United States National Museum. i

a system of general exchanges would be entered upon as soon as the Institution
should be able to mature a plan for that purpose. Under this assurance, and inde-
pendently of it also, it should be added, valuable collections of various kinds have
already been received by the Institution, which is thus already placed in a position
which makes it incumbent on us to redeem the pledge that has been given. The
committee consider it superfluous to dwell upon the advantages of exchanges; but
they wish the members to know that for this object they have already in hands the
most abundant materials—materials which are increasing and will continue to
increase every day. ‘These materials consist of contributions made by members, by
individuals who are not members, by societies and institutions at home and abroad,
and by foreign governments, as well as of those accessions that have been made by
the Exploring Expedition, which has already sent home an inexhaustible quantity
and variety of duplicates. It is well known to the Institution that the collections
received from all these sources are equally and absolutely the property of the Goy-
ernment, and that therefore the permission of the Government is indispensable to
enable the Institution to part with the duplicates derived from all these sources.
This permission, it is believed, will be cheerfully accorded. At the same time the
committee, for obvious reasons, do not think it proper to ask the Government to
allow the Institution to part with any of the duplicates of the Exploring Expedition,
until the squadron, shall have returned.

In reference to the second point, viz; a plan of exchanges, the committee do not
feel called upon or competent to enter into details. These must be left in a good
degree to those whom the Institution may see fit to charge with the execution of the
plan, in which of course they will be governed by the practice of other institutions,
and by such regulations as it may become expedient to adopt from time to time to
suit our own convenience and peculiar circumstances. Here, however, on the
threshold of the plan which the committee mean to propose, they regard it of con-
sequence to suggest for the sanction of the Institution, that in exchanges of all kinds,
the natural productions of our country shall first and always have a decided prefer-
ence. A great and leading design of the National Institution is to explore and
develop our own resources, and to study and describe the natural history of the
United States. To this end our exertions must principally be directed. It should
be the pride of all connected with or interested in a National Institution to see every
State in the Union fully represented in a National Cabinet, established at the seat of
Government. This method, while it recommends itself to us and our interests, is
calculated to extend benefits and encouragement to the societies and naturalists of
our own country, who will thus have a central depository, from which they may
enlarge and vary their own collections; and thus, also, in due time, the duplicates
of the Exploring Expedition may, with the greatest advantage, be diffused through-
out the land, thereby fulfilling, in the amplest manner, the intentions of those who
projected, and justifying the liberality of the Government which sanctioned that
noble project.

With these preliminary remarks, and under the restrictions which are embraced in
them, the committee recommend—

First. That a system of exchanges be entered upon without delay.

Second. That the Curator and assistants be directed, for this purpose, to separate
alf duplicates, except those from the Exploring Expedition; and that they select and
label such specimens as are to be sent to individuals or societies.

Third. That the first step taken be to discharge the obligations of exchange
already incurred by the Institution.

Fourth. That a committee be appointed, to whom the Curator shall submit all sets
of specimens thus set aside for any given exchanges, who shall decide upon the
equivalency, before said specimens shall be boxed up and sent off.
118 Memorral of George Brown Goode.

Fifth. That in all cases of difficulty which may arise, reference must be made to the
President or Vice-President of the Institution for decision, who will, if they conceive
it necessary, submit the question to the Institution.

Sixth. That a book be kept by the Curator, subject at all times to the inspection of
the committee, in which must be noted the contents of each box or package; lists of
the articles for which they are the equivalents; the name and place of the society or
individual to whom one set is to be sent, and from whom the other has been received.

In what the committee have now submitted, they conceive that they have done all
that it was possible or necessary to do at present, in reference to the third point of the
resolution, viz: ‘‘reporting fully on the subject ;’’ although they are perfectly sensi-
ble that in their report they have presented the subject in the most general manner,
believing that experience and practice alone will enable the Institution gradually to
settle upon a complete system. The committee beg leave to add, that the present
report is not to be regarded as final, but that it is submitted, with all due deference
to the Institution, to use the concluding words of the resolution, ‘‘for its further
consideration and action.”’

Shortly after this, on March 8, in order to provide for the reception
of these collections, Doctor Henry King* was elected curator of the
National Institution, the first in Washington to bear an official title
which has since been the designation of a goodly number of worthy
workers in science.

The curator, although an elective officer of the Institution, received
his pay from the Congressional appropriation already referred to, an
arrangement not unlike that which prevails to this day in the National
Museum, where the officers, chosen by the Smithsonian Institution, are
paid by the General Government.

The collections arrived some time in March, and in response to its
request Mr. Badger, the newly made Secretary of the Navy, placed them
under the care of the National Institution, and in April, as we learn
from the unpublished letters of the curator, the taxidermists were
preparing about fifteen bird skins a day, a rate of speed which quite
explains the atrocious condition of the preparations which have come
down to us from those days of the infancy of the National Museum.
In May additional collections, brought by the ship Suzanne to New
York and thence transshipped by the schooner /a/estine, were received
in Washington.

A new danger now threatened the integrity of the collections, which
was that the curator found many of the boxes ‘‘marked in such a

"Henry King, M. D., was a geologist and mining expert who had been a resident
of Missouri, who had lately been employed in an exploration of the lead mines of
the West, and who at this time was employed by the War Department in Washing-
ton. He was the author of a manual of Directions for making Collections in Natu-
ral History, published in 1840 by the Institution, the first part of a long series of
pamphlets of scientific instructors, printed at the capital. [1840. King, Henry.
Directions for making Collections in Natural History. Prepared for the National
Institution for the Promotion of Science; by H. King, M. D. Washington. Printed
by Gales & Seaton. 1840. 8vo., pp. I-24.]

Doctor King was elected curator March 8, 1841, and held the office until September
12, 1842, when he was succeeded by Doctor Charles Pickering.

manner as to indicate that they belong to and are claimed by private
persons,’’ these constituting a large part of the whole.

Here, again, Mr. Poinsett had foreseen and provided against the
danger, having instructed the curator, on a previous occasion, to pay no
attention to private marks on collections received from a Government
expedition.

The question was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy, who at once
replied that, in his opinion, ‘‘all specimens collected by officers attached
to the expedition belonged solely to the United States.”’

In April, 1841, the collections and library of the Institution were
installed in the new Patent Office building, where they remained until
removed to the Smithsonian, in 1857.

Extensive plans were made for a system of international exchange,
and a committee formulated the policy of the society in an elaborate
report.

Another Government collection soon came in consisting of the min-
erals and geological specimens gathered by David Dale Owen, during his
survey under the direction of the United States General Land Office,
also a collection of ‘‘Indian portraits and curiosities,’’ transferred by
the Secretary of War, and the Smithson cabinet, books and minerals,
deposited by the Secretary of the Treasury, and a bill was passed by
Congress, less important by reason of the appropriation of $500, which
it makes, than from the fact that it justifies the Secretaries of War
and of the Navy in transferring collections in their possession to the
Institution.

On the tst of January, 1842, a letter was written by a committee of
the National Institution to the Secretaries of War and the Navy.

In February, 1842, another important paper was presented to the
Institution by the same committee—important as marking the beginning
of the system of exchanges and distribution of duplicates which had for
nearly forty years been so important a feature of the work of the
National Institution."

With the exception of the papers already alluded to, which had refer-
ence to the relation of the society to the Government and to the Smith-
sonian bequest, the bulletin of proceedings from this time on contained
little more than the record of the receipt of donations of specimens and
of letters asking information or proffering advice. The society retained
the control of the exploring expedition collections, and in June, 1842,
Lieutenant Wilkes having returned to Washington, he, at three succes-
sive meetings of the Institute, gave a history of his voyage and its
results. He was at first subjected to some opposition, and until after a
court-martial, held in New York in August, seems to have been disposed
to say very cet He, however, wrote, under date of July 16, va a

letter’ to Senator Preston, in which he indignantly protested against
the manner in which his officers and men had been received on their
return.

When he was restored to favor and influence, he at once took steps to
gain control of the collections made by his squadron, provisionally under
the charge of the National Institution, with results to be studied later.

‘This letter, now in the archives of the Museum and never published, is of so much
interest historically, that after the lapse of nearly fifty years it is printed, in the cer-
tainty that its harsh significance has all vanished.

WASHINGTON City, 76th July, 7872.

My DEAR SiR: Agreeably to your desire, I hasten to give you the information rela-
tive to the remaining duties of the Expedition, and that are absolutely necessary to
carry out the intention of Congress in passing the Act authorizing the Expedition,
viz, ‘‘for the promotion of the great interests of Commerce and Navigation, and to
extend the bounds of science and promote the acquisition of knowledge.”’

For the accomplishment of these great objects, there was required persons to attend
to the different departments of science, and the following was the organization which
I proposed, and was adopted by the Government, and the most economical one that
could have been arranged to carry out the great views intended, and that the accom-
modations of the vessels would permit, viz:

The Departments of Astronomy, Hydrography, Magnetism, Meteorology, and
Physics, including the Experiments with the Invariable Pendulum, was confided
to myself with the officers under my command as assistants, besides the above I
was charged with the History or Narrative of the Voyage.

This at once greatly reduced the Scientific Corps which had been organized, viz,
from 23 tog. I felt the Navy was justly entitled to all these departments, embraced
as they were within the limits, or scope of the profession, and that they ought not to
be attached to such an undertaking, to act as the ‘‘hewers of wood and drawers of
water,’’ as was the case in its original organization.

Charles Pickering and Titian R. Peale, naturalists; Horatio Hale, philologist; James
D. Dana, geologist; William Rich, botanist; William Brackenridge, horticulturist
and assistant botanist; Joseph Drayton and Alfred Agate, artists; J. P. Couthouy,
conchologist, who was with the Expedition until the end of November, 1839, after
which period his duties were divided among the rest and successfully performed.
These formed the nine; to these was added a mechanic for the repair of instruments
and their proper preservation.

In all the above departments much remains to be done; indeed, I view the services
of the above gentlemen as necessary now, and even more so than at any other period
of the cruise, nor can their services be dispensed with, or the work concentrated,
without great loss to the Expedition, and the reputation of the country. For my own
departments I require the services of Mr. Stewart, who was a clerk in the Expedition,
but whom I have made hydrographical draughtsman, and some few of the officers,
who have been my principal assistants. Mr. Stewart will be enabled also to assist
me in my copying, etc. He is one of my own scholars and is now engaged in the
duties assigned him.

I truly regret that anything should have occurred to dampen the ardor of those
who are attached to the Expedition, and absolutely necessary to the bringing out the
results. ‘Theardor that has been felt during the cruise has been all-important to our
success, and has been in every way encouraged by me, and I did hope that it would
have been kept alive until all had been accomplished. The reputation of our country
is at stake, and if what has been attempted and succeeded in, is not now finished
The Genesvs of the United States National Museum. C2e

In September, 1842, Doctor Charles Pickering became curator. He
had been a member of the Wilkes exploring expedition and was occu-
pied during his connection almost entirely in the work of unpacking and
arranging its collections.

from any motive of economy, or derangement of the organization all will be ruined,
and we shall become the laughingstock of Europe, and all the praise that has been
lavished on our Government for its noble undertaking prove but ‘‘satire in
disguise.”’

What will be the reputation of those who have had the ordering of things since its
return, on their becoming known on the other side of the waters? For the reception
of myself I can easily account; but that of the officers and crews is truly unaccount-
able, particularly the want of any expression of thanks from the Department to the
latter on their discharge; it was felt by every officer and remarked by every man.
On minor duties I have been gratified by it formerly, and I have with pleasure seen
its effects upon many of the men that formed a part of the crews of this Expedition
when on other service with me; I have urged it all in my power, but without effect ;
every day develops some new opposition to the Expedition. I am aware you think I
want cause for this opinion; perhaps I am mistaken, but I can not but feel myself
bound up in it; indeed it would be strange if I was not, and I must say it is heartsick-
ening to me to hear those who have shared its dangers and troubles complaining of
a want of attention and courtesy, and exhibiting the unceremonious discharges from
their duties, with little or no prospect of consummating the labors in which they
have been engaged for the last four years, and before they have even seen their fami-
lies. Some are suffering under sickness contracted from their exposure in the sery-
ice of their country. They are now suddenly cut off and destitute of support for
themselves and families. These facts are well known. Such treatment is without
precedent in the service of this, or any other country.

Contrast our Expedition with those of the French and English engaged in the same
service, and at the same time, honor and rewards are heaped on all at and before
their return. Examine our results, compare them with theirs, contrast us in every
way with them you please, or with Expeditions that have gone before us, and then
ask if we have not reason to feel mortified.

Do not misunderstand me. I ask nothing for myself at present, and will not as
long as this mist hanging over me exists, but which any fair and candid examina-
tions into my actions and conduct would have long since dissipated ; neither do T ask
impossibilities or undeserved praise; no greater punishment can be inflicted on the
head of one who receives it. But I would ask: Is it not fully apparent and placed
beyond cant that the men of the Expedition have done their duty, and did deserve
the thanks of the Department before they were disbanded? It was openly com-
plained of when they were paid off.

I have greatly to complain of the course the Department has pursued towards
niyself, but I forbear to touch on this subject at present.

In conclusion, my dear sir, I beg you will excuse this long letter and its tone.
Whenever these subjects are brought to my mind I feel it acutely. All I do hope is
that, for the credit of the Expedition, the honor and reputation of the country, you
will not lose sight of what ought to be done. Fully confident I am that there is no
subject in which the reputation of our country is so much at stake as the develop-
ment of the results of the Exploring Expedition and on which its conduct will be
so closely scrutinized abroad. I have the honor to be, with great respect,

Yours, most truly,
CHARLES WILKES.

In the meantime, in February, 1842, Doctor J. P. Couthouy, one of
the naturalists of the expedition, having been detached from duty by
Captain Wilkes, was employed by the committee of the Institution to
aid in the work upon their collections, and in September Mr. W. D.
Brackenridge, horticulturist of the expedition, was also taken upon the
Museum staff and given charge of the plants,’ and a little later Professor
James D. Dana seems to have been given charge of the arrangement of
the geological and mineralogical collections, not only of the exploring
expedition, but of the Institution cabinet, including the Smithson, Owen,
Locke, and Totten collections, and Horatio Hale was performing a simi-
lar work upon the ethnographical collections of the Institution, which he
reported upon as ‘‘chiefly from the exploring expedition.’’

The force at this time engaged upon the national collections, under
the direction of the National Institution, consisted of Doctor Charles
Pickering, principal curator; J. P. Couthouy, J. D. Dana, Horatio Hale,
and W. D. Brackenridge, curators and assistants, and J. K. Townsend
and John Varden, assistants. "Thomas Nuttall, the well-known botanist,
had in 1841 been engaged upon the herbarium, but had now gone away.

Here, then, in 1842, we find a strong Museum force at work on the
collections, a force fully as effective thirty years later, in 1873, when the
writer first became acquainted with the operations of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The report prepared by them at the end of the year 1842 was essen-
tially the second official report upon the national collections, and since it
has never been published, it is printed in Note B, at the end of this
memoir.

At the meeting of September 12 a resolution was passed in these words:

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to wait upon the Secretary of the Navy,
and upon the joint committee of the Library of Congress, and to proffer to them the
cooperation of the Institute in carrying into effect the intentions of the law lately
passed by Congress, for the arrangement and preservation of the collections made by
the Exploring Squadron, and for the publication of the results of that Expedition ;

and that this committee be authorized to act in the name and behalf of the Institute
in all matters relating to this subject.

In reply to the letter transmitting this resolution, the following letter
was received:
NAvy DEPARTMENT, September 17, 1872.
Str: I have received your letter of the 15th instant, transmitting a copy of the
resolutions of the National Institute passed on the 12th instant, in relation to the
arrangement and preservation of the collections made by the exploring squadron,

and informing me that Doctor C. Pickering had been unanimously elected curator of
the Institute.

‘Mr. Brackenridge, on the return of the expedition in 1842, brought the live plants
and seeds to Washington, and there being no place for their reception hired a green-
house and cared for them, apparently on his own responsibility, for several months.
Eventually they were provided for at the Botanic Garden about 1859, after having
been for many years kept in greenhouses in the rear of the Patent Office.

In the meantime a change in the status of the Government collections
had been effected by the passage of an act of Congress, August 27, 1842,
providing for the publication, under the supervision of the Joint Library
Committee, of an account of the discovery made by the exploring expe-
dition, the third section of which was as follows:

That until other provisions be made by law for the safe-keeping and arrangement
of such objects of natural history as may be in the possession of the Government,
the same shall be deposited and arranged in the upper room of the Patent Office,
under the care of such persons as may be appointed by the Joint Committee of the
Library.

By act of August 4, 1842 (Stat. V., 501), the sum of $20,000 had
already been appropriated for the transportation, preservation, and
arrangement of these collections.

In the charter of the National Institute, passed a month before, there
was a provision that all trusts ‘‘are vested and confirmed to the said
corporation,’* and the supporters of the Institute were disposed to urge
that this was applicable to the collections of the ‘‘exploring squadron,”’
at that time in the custody of the Institution. The question did not
come up in a troublesome way at this time, for the Library Committee,
at that time unfriendly, simply confirmed the choice of curator made by
the National Institute, and appointed Doctor Pickering to the position,
Doctor Pickering being thenceforth subject to the Congressional com-
mittee, and only by courtesy acting for the National Institute.

Trouble was brewing, however, for it was evident that the links bind-
ing together the interests of the National Institute and the exploring
expedition were not very tenacious. There was in fact no legal authority
for the agency of supervision which the Institution was now exercising,
the whole being the outgrowth of a very informal understanding be-
tween two or three successive Secretaries of the Navy and a committee
of the Institution ‘‘appointed to correspond with the Departments of
Government.’’ *

This committee, composed of two of the most active directors and the
corresponding secretary, soon began to perform the functions of a gen-
eral executive committee—no doubt with the sanction of the society, but
without direct authority.

The recent acts of Congress had taken the control of the collections
away from the Navy Department, by whose act alone they had been placed
in charge of the Institute. The committee of the Institute still believed
itself responsible in an advisory way for the disbursement of the appro-

priation, but soon found expeditions in progress of which they had
no knowledge. ‘The committee filed a protest with Mr. Poinsett, their
president, who seems to have at once taken steps to secure the only
possible relief from the embarrassment—that of special legislation.

The following bill was accordingly introduced in the Senate by the
Hon. Robert J. Walker:

A BILL, for the preservation of the collections of natural curiosities furnished by the exploring
squadron, and from other sources.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, ‘That the board of management of the National
Institute be, and is hereby, invested with the custody of the specimens of natural
history, and other curiosities, which have been received, or which may have been
received, or which may hereafter be received, from the exploring squadron, and
from other sources, with authority to make all necessary arrangements to preserve
and exhibit the same, to regulate the number and compensation of persons employed
on said duty, and to superintend the disbursements relating thereto.

And be it further enacted, That the said board is hereby authorized to exchange
any of the duplicates of said collections with other institutions, or with State authori-
ties, or with individuals.

At the request of Senator Walker two of the members of the commit-
tee had drawn up a statement of the relations which they deemed it
desirable to have established between the Institution and the General
Government in respect to the national collections. ‘This statement was
submitted by Senator Walker, not as an official document emanating
from the Institute, but with the heading ‘‘ Remarks submitted by Mr.
Markoe and Colonel Abert to the Hon. Mr. Walker.’’ This was cer-
tainly an unfortunate form of introduction to Congress, and the oppo-
nents of the National Institute made the most of it. The bill with the
accompanying statement was referred to the Joint Committee on the
Library, and on the 28th of February was made the subject of a report
presented by Senator Tappan," in which he ridiculed the idea of placing
the results of a great Government expedition in the hands of a “‘private
corporation,’’ and advised members of the National Institute to disabuse
themselves of the idea that regular appropriations would ever be made
for its benefit. ‘‘’The case presents,’’ he remarked, ‘‘two officers of the
Government, one the head of a bureau, the other a clerk in one of the
public offices, who ask as a matter of right that they should have the
supervision of a very important literary and scientific work, the publica-
tion of which Congress has thought proper to intrust to one of its regular
committees.’? The recommendation of the committee was that the
responsibility of this work remain in the hands of the Joint Committee
on the Library, where it had originally been placed by law. Senator
Tappan’s attack was evidently based upon a partial misunderstanding of
the views of the members of the National Institute, who simply asked
the custody of the collections and the authority to supervise their arrange-
ment. Colonel Abert and Mr. Markoe were indignant at the injustice,

"Senate Document 233, see note D to this paper.
The Genests of the United States Nationat Museum. 125

and addressed to Senator Walker a letter in further explanation of their
views.

This letter, with the comments upon it by Senator Walker and Sena-
tor Preston, is printed in a note appended to this memoir,' accompanied
by a hitherto-unpublished letter from Senator Woodbridge, of Michigan,
who, as a member of the committee, was able to explain the real signifi-

cance of its action.
All of these papers are given in a pamphlet’ published at the time,

which is, however, now exceedingly rare and almost forgotten.

The versions of the papers here given are for the most part from the
originals or verified copies in the archives of the National Museum.

Senator T'appan’s speech and the subsequent action of Congress did
much to undermine the foundation of the Institute, which was evidently
scarcely solid enough to sustain the structure which it had been proposed
to rear upon them.

After this it was inevitable that there should arise conflicts of authority,
and they were not slow in coming.

It is possible that they were precipitated by Captain Wilkes, who
naturally may have felt some irritation at the manner in which the con-
trol of the collections made by his expedition were taken out of his control,
while he himself was for a time under charges.

The Commissioner of Patents, too, seems to have been irritated by the
occupation of a hall in the Patent Office controlled by alien authority.

In July, 1843, Doctor Pickering resigned his curatorship, and the
Library Committee, now hostile and acting in the spirit of their report,
made use of the authority vested in them by the act of August 26, 1842,
and appointed to the custodianship of the Government collections the
Commissioner of Patents, Mr. Ellsworth, and in August placed Captain
Wilkes in special charge of the gatherings of the exploring expedition.

The action of the committee does not appear to have been known to
the officers of the Institute except by rumor, but they were left to find
out the change of policy by an unpleasant series of experiences.

The first serious friction was in connection with Captain Wilkes. Its
character is shown by the following correspondence, which is here printed
on account of the new light it throws upon the condition of the National
Cabinet of Curiosities in the years 1843-44 and upon the otherwise inex-
plicable circumstances which led to the collapse of the National Institute
shortly afterwards :

Directors. But I refused, on the ground that I would not be the medium of bringing
forward misunderstood or exaggerated facts, for discussion or action, preferring the
course of the inclosed letter, as it will procure the desired information from the best
authority and under its true aspect. It seems to me that the Institute is the last
which should receive unkindness from anyone whose fame is connected with
the results of the exploring squadron, for without the interference of the Institute
where would these results have been; and without its future care what will become
of them, for what other body in whose care they can be placed has a permanent
domicile at Washington.

LETTER FROM COLONEL ABERT TO CAPTAIN WILKES, SEPTEMBER 5, 1843.

Str: It is contemplated soon to have a meeting of the Directors of the National
Institute, at which matters of much interest to the Institute will be brought up.
Understanding that you have been placed in charge of the room in which both
Institute and ex. [ploring] expedition curiosities are deposited, and anxious that at
our meeting the Directors should be fully and correctly informed, allow us to beg of
you the favor of an early answer to the following queries:

1. Have directions been given to remove the property of the Institute and that
under its care, except exploring expedition specimens, from the room in which they
now are or from the cases in which they have been deposited, or are such directions
contemplated?

2. Are the persons employed at the room and paid by the U. S. prohibited from
bestowing any attention upon any other than ex. [ploring] exp. [edition] specimens,
from opening the boxes of presents sent to the Institute, cleaning, arranging, and
attending to the same?

3. Will any of the persons employed at the room and paid by the U. S. be allowed
to bestow any of their time and talents upon the preservation and arrangement of
the collections, except those of the ex. [ploring] squadron?

4. Can the Institute count with sufficient certainty upon the services of any person
so employed so as to invest him or them as curators or assistants with the requisite
authority from the Institute?

You will readily perceive the importance of these questions to the Institute, and
how eminently they invoke the security and preservation of the valuable and extensive
collection under its care ; you will, therefore I hope, pardon us in the request of an

early answer.

LETTER FROM CAPTAIN WILKES TO COLONEL ABERT, SEPTEMBER 16, 1843.

WASHINGTON City, 16 Sept., 7843.

My DEar Sir: Your friendly letter was received on my return to the city after a
short absence, which will account for your not having an earlier reply.

I can not acknowledge any right in a committee of the Nat. [ional] Ins. [titute]
to call upon me for any explanations whatever relative to my official duties or
actions, particularly when such a call is based upon (as you inform me) ‘‘ painful
reports’? of which I have no knowledge and little regard, and can not help express-
ing my astonishment that any members of a scientific society should have given
credence to them, to have authorized an action on the part of one of their com-
mittees before they had ascertained that they were true.
Report of U. S. National Museum, 1897. Part |

; - The Genests of the United States National Museum. 127

I can not but admire your course in refusing to act, or be the medium of bringing
them forward for discussion or action before an appeal was made to the best authority.
I therefore feel much pleasure in answering the questions as coming from yourself,
and do it particularly with a view that you may communicate it to any of the gentle-
mien, your associates, who may have been instrumental in getting up and giving cur-
rency to the reports which you inform me are in circulation.

ist. The law places the collections of the United States Exploring Expedition in
the upper hall of the Patent Office building and under the care of the Joint Library
Committee of Congress for the purpose of arranging the whole for description, publi-
cation, and exhibition. The Library Com[mitt]ee have appointed me to superintend
them to this end. In pursuance of my duties the whole is undergoing arrangement.
When I took charge on the rst of August a few specimens and articles were pointed
out to me as belonging to the Nat[ional] Inst[itute]; those have not been disturbed
further than became necessary in the arrangements, and an equal care has been
bestowed upon them that others have received.

2d. All the persons employed and paid by the Government are required to devote
themselves entirely to the Government work; when there is no longer employment
for them, or they do not give satisfaction, they will be discharged. It is believed
that their time is now fully employed, and that their duties require all their time
and talents to be devoted to the collection of the Expedition in order to perform
them to the satisfaction of the Library Committee and myself. They are under the
same system as if employed elsewhere by the Government. From this it follows
that their time and services for which the Gov[ernmen]t pays can not be devoted
to or divided with any incorporated association.

Although believing that the above embraces an answer te all the enquiries made
of me I will go further and assure you that there is every disposition on the part of
the Library Com[mitt]ee of Congress and myself to have the few things belonging to
the Nat[ional] Inst[itute] that are now in the hall taken care of, and due notice will
be given to the Institute should the little room they occupy be required for collection
of the Exp[loring] Exp[e]d[ition], which it is now confidently believed will entirely
fill the hall when they are fully arranged. I will now close with a few words respect-
ing the last clause of your letter relative to my feeling any ‘‘unkindness’’ towards
the Nat[ional] Inst[itute]. It is rather improbable that any unkindness or hostility
should exist on my part considering that the labour of the Expedition, combined
with the exertion of your gifted president (Mr. Poinsett), were the origin of it, and
that in all probability it may one day become the depository of the large and valuable
collection of the Exp[lorin]g Expedition, therefore I can not but feel deeply inter-
ested in its welfare—everything compatible with the performance of my public duties
will always be done to accommodate and assist its rise and progress.

Believe me, with great respect, your obt. svt.,
CHARLES WILKES.

LETTER FROM COLONEL ABERT TO CAPTAIN WILKES, SEPTEMBER, 15343.

DEAR SiR: Your letter has been duly received. As well for our own justification
and for your satisfaction, I will go into some length in a reply.

Abstractly speaking, there may be no right in the Institute to enquire into the
course of your official action, but if under any circumstances this action be hazard-
ous to the property of the Institute, or to that deposited and placed under its care,
there can be no doubt, I think, that the Institute has a right to enquire if such be
the case and why.
128 Memortal of George Brown Goode.

You can, if you choose, give us a very short reply—that what you have done was
in the execution of your official duties, for which you can account only to your offi-
cial superiors. Yet, nevertheless, the Institute would have the right to make the
enquiry and to expect an answer of some kind. But allow me to call your attention
to the reflection that it is in your civil relation of an agent of the Library Committee
in which you are now temporarily acting, and it is only in that capacity that any
accountability can attach to you, or that any was supposed by the committee of the
Institute to exist.

As an officer of the Navy you can not now be acting; your course is not by virtue
of your commission or rank in the Navy, or orders from your constitutional or legal
superiors, or of any duties connected with your profession. No official responsibility
can exist between Capt. Wilkes, of the Navy, and the Library Committee, or official
penalties be incurred by a neglect of its directions. Your position, if I understand
it correctly, is by virtue of the authority in the Library Committee to place the col-
lection under the care of such persons as they may appoint. The executive or the
constitutional superior of the Army, as well as Navy, were it to assign you to a
ship to-morrow, you would have to go and abandon the care assigned to you by the
Library Committee, which shows, I think, that it is not the official relations of the
offices which are involved in your present position. Dr. King once had the place,
then Dr. Pickering, to whom you succeeded. Both of these gentlemen were civilians,
and as you succeeded them in your present place it is clear, I think, that it is not in
any official relation which Capt. Wilkes can claim, or to which he can be assigned,
that he is now acting, but in the civil relation of a person appointed by the Joint
Library Committee to take charge of matters the publication of which has been
made a duty of that committee. I make these explanations of our views that you
may feel relieved from the supposition that we had the most remote idea of encroach-
ing upon your official rights, for which I assure you, as well as for your well-estab-
lished professional abilities, we all entertain the greatest respect.

The specimens of the Exploring Squadron are to be deposited and arranged in the
upper room of the Patent Office. This, however, does not, we think, give the exclu-
sive possession of that room for that purpose unless such exclusive possession be
necessary. Whether it be or not, I am willing to admit, is the right of the Library
Committee to decide, and if they so decide others must give way. ‘The sign lately
put over the door would seem to indicate that such decision was in contemplation.
The Institute has also possession of part of that room, of the eastern half, by direc-
tion of the Secretary of State, under whose care the whole building was then placed.
The Institute has property there of great amount and, in our judgment, of great
value, and if it has to move its property, by virtue of a decision by the Library Com-
mittee, the courtesy of notice from the agent of that committee is not, I think, too
much to expect, and our right to enquire if we shall have to move should be viewed
as a duty on our part as the curator of so much property. I assure you the enquiry
was made with these impressions only. Your assurance that notice will be given if
we should have to move leaves us satisfied in this respect.

All that belongs to the Exploring Squadron is under the care of the Library Com-
mittee or itsagent. But the Institute is a legal body, regularly chartered with defined
rights over its property, gifts, and deposits. (See law of 27 July, 1842.) Now, what
is this property? Gifts and deposits from members, from foreign governments, from
distinguished foreigners, from our diplomatic agents, from foreign societies, from
domestic societies, from departments of our own Government, from our own citizens.
In a word, all the property in the room, except that of the Exploring Squadron and
that of the Patent Office, which (Institute) property, unless I am very much mis-
taken, far exceeds the impression you have of it, and judging from some remark
about the few things of the Institute.

Now, this property requires care, watching, and cleaning.
The Genesis of the United States National Museum. 129

I have at this time in my office twenty-four cases of the most valuable specimens
sent from Asia and Mexico to the Institute which we have not sent up, because we
were informed they would probably not be received, and would certainly not be
allowed to be opened and exhibited, as some 60 boxes or more of Institute specimens
are now in the room unopened and unattended to. Surely it was proper that such
matters should be inquired into if only for the future government of the course of
the Institute. We can not be without anxiety for our valuable collection nor
unmindful of our obligations to preserve it.

I feel satisfied you will see with me only matter of lamentation in such a state of
things. Science and national pride must bitterly regret any seeming necessity for it.

All the labor, all the contributions, from whatever branch of service, civil, diplo-
matic, navy, military, are for the scientific reputation of our common country, and
a hearty union of all is necessary to form a good collection. Deprive it of the charm
of being National, deprive it of that halo of interest with which the name National
has already covered it, and it will soon cease to increase, will be no longer worthy
of a thought, and will rapidly degenerate to the insignificance of a local collection.

Such are at least my views, and such were also the views which brought the
National Institute into existence, when about eight of us had our first meetings at
Mr. Poinsett’s. We then digested a scheme in which we thought all persons could
unite, because it was National; which all parties could befriend, because it was
National; to which all conditions and branches of service could contribute, because
it was National; to which the Government might extend its patronizing hand, because
it was National, because it aided and elevated the National character, and because
it would furnish a broad platform of National feeling, upon which all parties, all
sects, all conditions of life could, on principles cherished by all, meet and unite in
erecting a temple to National fame. And how charmingly have we gone on; look
at our great accumulations for so short a time, and yet it is all but a good beginning;
look at the feeling which exists throughout our country and throughout the world
in our favor, evidenced by contributions and letters from all quarters, and then ask
the question whether to aid or to embarrass a design so glorious and so free from
objections will give the most individual fame?

But we must know our condition, and what we have to depend upon. It is essen-
tial that we should, and you, as the agent of the Library Committee, are the only
person from whom we can obtain the desired information. Therefore, of necessity,
we had to address ourselves to you, and if I understand your answer correctly it is:
That you do not consider yourself at liberty to allow any of the persons receiving
pay from the United States to give any of their time or attention to the affairs of the
Institute, to overhaul or arrange or look after its specimens.

Both of your predecessors, Dr, King and Dr. Pickering, were also, with the appro-
bation of the executive, Curators to the Institute, and gave some attention to its
affairs. We did not, of course, expect that you would take a similar trouble upon
yourself, and one question in my previous letter was to ascertain if you would allow
any of those under you to attend to the Institute collection and property. I under-
stand you also as thinking this beyond your power. Under these circumstances the
Institute must act, and promptly, or its valuable collection will be injured. The
board of management will soon meet and the matter will be brought before them.

If in anything I have misunderstood you, I beg that you will not delay to correct
me, for be assured that I have no desire to put anyone in the wrong, and least of all
the eminent commander of the Exploring Expedition.

were

Soon afterwards a more serious conflict of authority began—this time

with the Commissioner of Patents, who was actually the official guar-

dian, not only of a portion of the collections, but of the hall in which
NAT MUS 97, PT 2 9

the entire cabinets, both of the society and the Government, were
lodged.

The correspondence referred to in Mr. Ellsworth’s first letter evidently
related to the great mass of native copper of the Ontonagon (still a
prominent feature in the National Museum), which the Secretary of
War had placed in the custody of the Institute at its meeting in Octo-
ber previous. Mr. Ellsworth was evidently bent upon dislodging the
National Institute from the Patent Office. To effect this he pursued the
not altogether ingenuous course of belittling the Institute, its work, and
the extent of its cabinet, and laying claim to the official possession of
more important collections of models, fabrics, manufactures, which, in
accordance with the act of 1836, reorganizing the Patent Office, he
designates as the ‘‘ National Gallery,’’ a name which he also applied to
the great hall in which all the collections were deposited.

The Commissioner of Patents was evidently legally in the right, and
the Institute found itself bereft not only of its command of Government
collections, but also of its hall.

The correspondence is here printed.

LETTER FROM ‘THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,
DECEMBER 7, 1842.
PATENT OFFICE,
Washington, December 7th, 1872.

Str: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter from the Secretary of
War of the 2d inst., communicating the information that my letter to his Depart-
ment of rst inst. had been referred to a committee of the National Institute for
answer.

Permit me to enclose a copy of the correspondence with said committee. I have
ventured to say in my reply that I did not believe their letter to myself had met
your approval.

The Hon. Sec’y will imagine my surprise at the letter of the committee when he
is informed that the Commissioner of Patents has the custody of the Patent Office
building; that he holds a special appointment under the Joint Committee of the
Library to take charge of all the property of Government mentioned in the act of |
August 26, 1842, and more especially as the National Institute has omitted to appoint
a Curator to protect the other articles received from the War and Navy Departments,
or even their own effects in this building since July last, and hence the care has
devolved upon myself as an act of courtesy if not of duty.

Under these circumstances, and having interested myself in the exhibition of the
copper rock at the seat of Government, I offered to take charge of it, under the
direction of the Secretary of War, if he desired it.

The disappointment expressed by many members of Congress at not finding this
beautiful specimen in the National Gallery prompted me, at the date of my letter,
to make, as I hoped, a respectful offer to the Hon. Secretary of my services. Nor
would I have replied to the committee had I not supposed that silence might seem
to adinit that I had been guilty of great presumption.

Let me add that I am a member of the Institute and cherish its welfare.

LETTER FROM COLONEL ABERT TO THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS,
DECEMBER 5, 1843.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5, 7843.

Str: The honorable Secretary of War has referred to the committee of the
National Institute your letter of the Ist inst.

Being uninformed by any law or regulation of the existence of a ‘‘ National Gal-
lery’’ or of any other collection under your care than the Models of the Patent
Office, you will pardon me if I do not fully appreciate the views or reasoning of
your letter,

At one period, by order of the Executive, the upper room of the Patent Office
was made the place of deposit for the effects of the ‘‘ National Institute,’’ a society
known to our laws and regularly chartered by Congress. This room thus became
the Hall of the Institute. In this room the Institute has deposited the collections
from the exploring squadron, and those from all other sources which were placed
under its care by order of the Executive. But from a supposed necessity, Congress
vested the care of the deposit from the exploring squadron for the purpose of pre-
paring an account of it, in such person as the Joint Library Committee should
appoint. This committee appointed Capt. Wilkes, of the Navy, for that purpose,
who is now exercising the functions of his office, and who may with propriety be
considered as in the regular official possession of the room.

In all this one sees nothing of the Patent Office or of any ‘‘ National Gallery’’ or
of any charge direct or indirect of the Patent Office over the deposits referred to.
If therefore by ‘‘ National Gallery”’ is intended to designate the room in which are
now placed the deposits of the Institute and of the exploring squadron, it is not a
room over which the head of the Patent Office can exercise control,

By alaw of the 20th July, 1840, the Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments
were placed in charge of the specimens of Natural History, received and to be
received by them, and funds were appropriated for their preservation. These officers
have deposited such articles as were then in their possession, and such as have since
been received in the care of the National Institute, as that law and the practice
under it are considered as prescribing the course on these subjects, and in the 2d
section of the law of July 27, 1842, all these deposits and the principle upon which
they were made were confirmed and legalized. When therefore the copper rock
arrived, to which your letter refers, the honorable Secretary of War, in conformity
of law and usage, placed it under the care of the National Institute.

As it was understood to be rather an inconvenience to Capt. Wilkes from the
want of space to receive any more articles of the Institute in the Hall under his care,
and as the Institute has at present no Curator there, those boxes and articles which
have come to hand within the last few months have been temporarily deposited
elsewhere, and among others the copper rock. The Committee of the Institute which
received this rock had it deposited in the War Office yard, where it is accessible
without impediment to all who are disposed to examine it, and where it is under the
efficient protection of the guard of the War and Navy Departinent buildings.

Very respectfully, your obt. svt.,

LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS TO COLONEL ABERT,
DECEMBER 7, 1843.

PATENT OFFICE, December 7, 1843.

Str: I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 5th inst.

The Hon. Sec’y of War has, it seems, referred to the Chairman of the Commit-
tee of the National Institute the answer of my letter to his Department, offering
to receive for exhibition at the National Gallery the ‘‘ copper rock.”’

I can not withhold my surprise or the expression of my regret that the committee
of the Institute on the reference of my letter deemed it necessary to declare their
unwillingness to recognize any such place as the ‘‘ National Gallery’? under my care
and to question the right of the Commissioner of Patents to the use of the large Hall
in the Patent Office building, and still more at /hezv claim of right to use that Hall
when their accommodations were only enjoyed at the convenience of the Commis-
sioner of Patents. To this unexpected reply to my letter I can not believe the Hon.
Secretary of War has given his approval. 2

Permit me to refer the Committee to the Act of July,’36, reorganizing the Patent
Office. ‘The first section gives the Commissioner of Patents the care of the models
of Patents, records, books, &c., &c.

The 20th section establishes a ‘‘ National Gallery,’’ in which the Commissioner of
Patents is bound to exhibit not only models but fabrics, manufactures, &c.

To carry out the design of this law cases have been erected at great expense and
many articles collected, while additions are daily made.

It is true that the National Institute did seek to obtain the entire control of the
large room in the Patent Office. A refusal was given because the Patent Office
building was by law placed under the care of the Commissioner of Patents and
because the room was needed, at least in part, by the office.

The law of August 26th, ’42, to which you refer, simply enacts:

‘That until other provisions be made by law for the safe keeping and arrange-
ment of such objects of natural history as may be in possession of Government, the
same shall be deposited and arranged in the upper room of the Patent Office under
the care of such person as may be appointed by the Joint Committee of the Library.”’
The act evidently did not contemplate the exclusive control of the room, but a super-
vision of the articles entrusted to the care of said Library Committee.

This Committee on advisement with the War and Navy Department appointed
Dr. C. Pickering, who enjoyed the use of the Hall in common with the, Patent
Office in a manner I had supposed entirely satisfactory to all concerned.

To relieve this Bureau from care and responsibility I proposed to the Hon. Secre-
tary of State to transfer to Dr. Pickering the custody of the archives, jewels, etc.,
received from the Department, but the Secretary declined, observing the Commiis-
sioner of Patents was a branch of the State Department, and he could not consent
to place the articles confided to him under care of a corporation or a stranger over
whom he had no control.

In July last Dr. Pickering resigned his trust. The Joint Committee of the Library,
upon whom alone devolved the right of filling the vacancy, entirely unexpectedly to
myself, conferred the appointment on the Commissioner of Patents. Of course the
Comunissioner of Patents has now by law the custody of the large Hall, which in all
official correspondence has been called the ‘‘ National Gallery.”

I will remark that the Hon. Secretary of State expressed a wish in the letter giv-
ing directions as to the large Hall that the National Institute might be permitted to
occupy any ‘‘empty cases’? so long as this could be done without inconvenience to
the Patent Office. In this request I most heartily acquiesced, and have permitted
the Institute to enjoy from time to time a very considerable portion of the upper and
lower stories. And while the Commissioner of Patents has the sole custody of the

building, the Institute may be assured that the articles deposited by them will receive
the same care and watchfulness as those belonging to the Patent Office or those
received from the Government.

It has given me pleasure to try to accommodate all parties, hoping that Congress
would make further provisions as appeared to be necessary. The time has now
arrived when the wants of the Patent Office imperiously require more of the large
Hall, and it remains for the National Legislature to determine who shall be accom-
modated when there is not room for all.

I regret your correspondence has compelled me to say thus much in defense of the
position I have the honor to hold.

Yours, respectfully,
H. L. ELLSwWortH.

Still another blow was in reserve. Statements were made in public to
the effect that the collections of the Institute were of very trifling value,
and one which appears to have been printed, though I can gain no infor-
mation as to its nature, made certain charges in connection with the por-
traits in the possession of the Institute, intended to show that the Institute
was ‘‘unworthy of the patronage of the Government.’’

This happened apparently during the great meeting of the friends of
the Institute in April, 1844, evidently with the intention of counteracting
any effect which the assemblage might produce upon Congress.

Mr. George P. Marsh, M. C., at this time (April 4) addressed a letter
to the corresponding secretary of the Institute, stating that its memorial
had been referred to him as a member of the Library Committee of Con-
gress, and asking for information to enable him to meet objections made
by persons unfriendly to the Institution. The information given in the
following letter in fact constitutes a third report upon the national col-
lection, a little more than a year subsequent to the date of those already
quoted:

LETTER FROM MESSRS. MARKOE AND ABERT TO THE HON. GEORGE P. MARSH,
APRIL, 8, 1844.
TAC? ‘7, “7 SL

To Mr. Marsu, H. Reps. NS eae

DEAR Sir: Your letter of the 4 inst. has been received. It found me occupied by
numerous & pressing engagements, and left so short a space of time for reply that I
have been compelled to call for aid upon a friend, Col. Abert, with whom I was for a
long time associated a member of an important committee of the Institute, whose
business it was to understand its affairs.

It is to be deplored that there are persons so unfriendly to the Institute, as to state
‘‘ that its collections are of very trifling extent and value, and that for this and other
reasons not necessary now to be specified, the Institute is unworthy the patronage
of the Government.’’ Some consolation, however, is derived from the assurance,
that you do not entertain these opinions, and from the opportunity which is now
offered of correcting at least one of these erroneous opinions the only one that has
been presented with sufficient distinctness to be met, namely, that which refers to
the extent and value of the Institute’s collections. We should have rejoiced if ‘‘ the
other reasons’’ had been as candidly and specifically made, so that they might be as
134 Memortal of George Brown Goode. '

promptly and explicitly met. We seize this occasion to assure you of our readiness,
our anxious desire, to meet any unfounded report or misrepresentation which may
have led to the assertion, that the Institute is unworthy the patronage of the Gov-
ernment. We are the more anxious as the assertion seems to have grown out of
other considerations than the supposed trifling extent and value of the collections of
the Institute.

The property of the Institute is of two kinds: That which it owns, the result of
donations & purchases, and that which it holds by Deposit. The latter kind, by our
Charter cannot be withdrawn, even by depositors, till after due notice has been
given. The statement which follows, made by Col. Abert & wh. embraces a very
inadequate description of the property, embraces gifts, purchases & deposits is taken
from the records of the Institute, and it may be verified at any time by reference to the
records, an attentive examination of wh. would show that the property of the Insti-
tute is of immense value, & of great American as well as general interest; & that it
is increasing every day in a wonderful manner—a perusal of the two Bulletins of
the proceedings of the Institute wh. have been published will give you the details
for two years of these accumulated & accumulating materials, & the unpublished
Records wh. go back for two years will supply the rest—Mr. Markoe begs leave to
add that the MS. matter wh. accompanied the memorial to Congress, & wh. has
happily been placed in your hands, embraces a very condensed view, wh. he pre-
pared with great care & toil of all the contributions, donations & deposits which
have been made to the Inst. since its foundation in May 1840, up to March 1844, &
of the names of the contributors, donors, & depositors. For a refutation of such
misstatements we refer you to these exact details, & sincerely hope that Congress
will publish them for its own information as wellas for the information of the world
& as an act of justice to the Institute.

The collections referred to are in the great hall of the Patent office, at the Treas-
ury, War & State Depts., at Col. Abert’s office & at the house of the Secretary of the
Inst. Besides wh. letters have lately been rec’d. announcing the approach of great
quantities of boxes of books, specimens of natural history, & other miscellaneous
presents, from for. Govts. Ministers & Consuls of the U. S., from officers of the
Army & Navy, & from many Societies & individuals both at home & abroad.

In conclusion, while we invite scrutiny in any shape, we take the liberty of sug-
gesting our earnest & anxious wish to meet a committee wh. whenever appointed
will find us prepared to explain the character & merits of the Inst. & effectually to
defeat unfounded & irresponsible surmises.

With true regards, Yr. obt. humble svts.

Joaloe ABER:

Imperfect & hasty statement of the collections & specimens, being either the
absolute property of the Institute, or specially deposited under its care. It is
believed, that the greater part of these, will eventually become the property of the
Institute; many of them having already become so.

Minerals—ist. About 6000 miscellaneous specimens from all quarters.

2d. A complete collection of about 10,000 specimens.

3d. In addition there are about 190 boxes or collections, not examined or opened.
They are spoken of as ‘‘boxes’’ or ‘“‘collections,’’ because the donors used these
terms in their letters presenting them and they are accordingly so entered upon the
Journals of the Institute.

4th. There are also 4 boxes of splendid minerals of Mexico, presented by His
Exc. Mr. Tonsel the Minister of War & Marines of Mexico, and one box Mex.
Antiquities.

Fossils.—Upwards of 30 boxes and seven or 8 thousand miscellaneous specimens
& casts of rare fossils.
Report of U.S. National Museum, 1897. Part Il. PLATE 18.

The Genests of the United States National Museum, 135

Birds.—tst, 1368 separate specimens; 2d. nine large boxes, one of which contains
27 dozen skins of rare birds from Brazil.

OQuadrupeds.—Between 4 and 500 specimens. Insects 74100 specimens, and more
than a dozen boxes besides not opened. Most of these in a deplorable condition for
want of funds to preserve & arrange them.

Shells. —1638 specimens, & more than 20 boxes and one barrel.

An immense number of fishes, reptiles mollusca, et cetera. One donor, Lt. Ged-
ney, U. S. N., gave upwards of 600 specimens & a large & rare collection of reptiles,
fishes &c. which composed a part of the munificent gift of Prince Momfanoi, of
Spain.

Coins, medals & medallions, antique & modern, embracing very many extremely
rare & valuable series, gold, silver & copper &c. Ist. 573 specimens; 2d. seven boxes.

Maps and atlasses in great numbers; books & pamphlets, between 4 & 5000, many
very rare, sent by the Russian, French, Belgian, Brazilian & other governments, &
from Societies in various countries. About rooo engravings, many extremely choice,
by the first Artists in the world, and several large boxes of books & engravings not
opened.

Specimens of woods, marbles, domestic manufactures, fossil teeth, megatherium
bones, Ancient vases & vessels, electrotype pictures, mosaics, Egyptian & South Sea
idols, large collections of human quadruped & bird crania, antique masks, rare col-
lection of Indian dresses &c., daguerreotype pictures, corals & coralines, large col-
lection of dried plants from all parts of the world. Specimens of art implements
&c., and an infinite diversity of contributions of every description too complicated
& various to enumerate. ‘

The Columbian Institute’s collection consisting of a large number of books, works
of art, specimens of Nat. Hist., all which are now the property of the Nat. Insti-
tute. Models of monuments, & of works of art etc. etc. Several hundred Indian
Portraits, and other paintings, many very rare & valuable & some the production of
the best masters.

Skeletons, Antlers, Horns, Teeth, Bones & casts of various quadrupeds & other
animals.

Indian Musical & other Instruments & implements & Lithographic portraits &
drawings in great numbers.

Large collection of objects of Natural History, idols, fabrics, antique works of art
&c, from Egypt and Africa, many of great curiosity & rarity, from various persons, &c.

Collection of Statuary, busts & casts.

Large collection of trilobites & rare fossils.

Dr. Franklin’s printing press.

A collection of Bedouine war instruments, & a variety of oriental curiosities.

A series of fine Electrotype medals, embracing the British & French Sovereigns,
from William the Conqueror to Victoria, and from Pharamond to Louis Philippe.

It is scarcely possible, in reply to your note wh. calls for an immediate answer to
enumerate further, but we don’t depend on so scant a list, given in terms necessarily
somewhat vague. We call special attention to the minute & exact detail given in
the abstract of the proceedings of the Inst. prepared by Mr. Markoe, & wh. accom-
panies the memorial to Congress, where every thing will be found exhibited &
described. We believe that if the collections of the Inst. are not already as great in
value as those brought home by the Exploring Expedition, they will become far
more so in a very short time. In American interest the Institute’s collections far
transcend the other.

In answer, apparently to a subsequent inquiry from Mr. Marsh, as to
the amount of the subsidy desired by the Institute, the following sched-
ule seems to have been prepared. There is nothing, however, to indicate

Hon. Mr. MARSH, May 18, 1844,
Flouse of Representatives.

Notwithstanding the extraordinary efforts at this time made and the
favorable report of Senator Choate, Congress adjourned in the spring of
1844 without making any provision for the care of the collections of the
Institute.

Another effort was made in 1845. Senator Levi Woodbury, president
of the Institute, in the annual address delivered by him on January
15 in the Hall of the House of Representatives, made a most impressive
appeal to Congress. After urging prompt action in the matter of the
Smithson trust—‘‘a trust so sacred and imperative that a longer delay to
execute it might prove not a little derogatory to our national honor ’’—
he continued:

Should the plan for this not be speedily matured, including the use of the Institute
or its officers, then a grant at once of enough to defray the expenses attendant on
the good preservation and collection of the public materials in our charge seems
indispensable, and is believed also to be free from every doubt connected either with
expediency or the Constitution, as many of the collections now belong to the Goy-
ernment and all of them are vested in it when the charter expires, and may be forth-
with if desirable. What small sum then is granted for this object by the Govern-
ment is granted for taking care of its own property, the title of which is public, the
one public, the whole end and aim public; and that act of duty done, we hope, by
the further help of our own contributions, with those of liberal friends of science

The Genests of the United States National Museum. 37

elsewhere, by the continued and generous assistance of the officers of the Army
and Navy, of our foreign ministers and consuls, as well as the members of Congress
and many in private life, I think it may be safely said we hope to advance still
farther and faster, till we render the Institute, in many respects, worthy its unri-
valed position and the growing country to which it belongs.*

This was followed up by a mennorial to Congress, which, having never
before been published, is here presented,* and which was favorably acted
upon by the Library Committee, who adopted the report submitted by
Senator Choate concerning the similar memorial of 1844. No action was,
however, taken.

Still another appeal was made? to the Twenty-ninth Congress, which
was presented to the Senate by Lewis Cass, and to the House of Repre-
sentatives by John Quincy Adams. This, too, was fruitless.

In 1846 also, as we have seen, Mr. Ingersoll, always a faithful friend
of the society, endeavored to establish a connection between it and the
Smithsonian Institution in the administration of a National Museum, but
the effort failed at the last moment, and the Regents of the Institution
were not inclined to take advantage of the privilege of putting this
building as a wing to the Patent Office, as they might have done.

In the organization of the Smithsonian Institution the National Instt-
tute was practically left out of account and the hopes of many years
were blasted. What was still more discouraging was that power had been
given to the new corporation to take possession of all Government collec-
tions in the custody of the Institute, on the possession of which its chief
claim to a subsidy was founded, and in connection with which a consid-
erable debt had been contracted,‘ as is indicated by Mr. Rush’s letter of
July, 1846.

In the ‘‘ Notice to the members of the National Institute ’’ which served
as an introduction to its fourth bulletin, dated November 25, 1846, a
pitiful statement of the condition of the society is given:

More than a thousand boxes, barrels, trunks, etc., embracing collections of value,
variety, and rarity in literature, in the arts, and in natural history, remain on hand
unopened—the liberal contributions of members at home and abroad—of Govern-
ments, of learned and scientific societies and institutions of foreign countries and
of our own—and of munificent friends and patrons in every part of the world. For

the preservation, reception, and display of these, the Institute has neither funds nor
a suitable depository.s

This was a fatal condition of affairs, for the formation of a museum
was the one object which, out of the many specified, seemed to have

finally absorbed the energies and the limited income of the National
Institute.

* Annual address, pp. 33, 34. 2 Note E. 3 Note F.

4 Colonel Abert estimated the amount in 1844 at $1,500 and it was now doubtless
greater.

It had evidently been the belief of itschief promoters that if a museum
under the patronage of the Government and under the control of their
society could be firmly established in Washington, all the other ends
sought by them would follow in necessary sequence.

In accordance with this policy circulars had been sent out to the offi-
cers of the Army at distant ports asking their aid and pointing out the
manner in which they might be useful in carrying out the objects of the
Institution, ‘‘and others to the governors of States and to the diplomatic
and consular representatives of the United States in foreign countries,
announcing that they had been made corresponding members, and invit-
ing their aid in the promotion of the objects of the Institution,’’ and to
each member of Congress, with a request that he bring specimens of the
natural productions of his district on his return to Washington."

WASHINGTON, February 9, 1847.

Str: The National Institution for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts,
established at the seat of Government, is desirous of procuring specimens of the
natural productions of every portion of the United States, and for that purpose
respectfully asks your aid and cooperation. The district you represent doubtless
possesses many important minerals and vegetable productions, which might prove
of great value to the arts if they were generally made known. Specimens of such
productions being brought to Washington will not only advance the objects of the
Institution, but will prove advantageous to the country whence they come. They
will be described by the scientific members of the Institution, and their uses and
advantages pointed out, and the specimens exhibited to the public in its museum.

You are respectfully requested to bring with you, on your return, such specimens
as you may collect during the ensuing recess. Even a single specimen from each
member will be of great advantage to the Institution, and be thankfully received as
a tribute to science.

We have the honor to be, sir, you most obedient servants,

To the Hon.

The assumption by a society of the important duty of organizing and
conducting a national museum would seem at the present time somwhat
strange, but it should be remembered that from the beginning it was
announced that all the collections made were the property of the General
Government, and that in the incorporation of the society by Congress all
the property of the corporation at the time of the expiration of its charter,
limited to twenty years, should belong to and devolve upon the United
States. Still more important a factor in the influence of the society was
the character of its membership, which included most of the leading men
in political, scientific, and literary circles, and had upon its list of officers
and directors such names as that of John Tyler, President of the United
States, and his Cabinet, an ex-Secretary of War, two leading Senators,

Levi Woodbury, Peter Force, Colonel J. J. Abert, Colonel J. G. Totten,
and Lieutenant M. F. Maury, Rufus Choate, Abbott Lawrence, and
A. D. Bache. Our Government functions were less centralized at that
time, and the policy of allowing more scope to private effort in public
matters was similar in this instance at least to that which prevails in
Great Britain at the present time. It was not to have been expected,
however, that its authority should have remained long unquestioned,
and in the end its lot was that which very frequently befalls those who
out of disinterestedness undertake, unasked, to forward the interest of
others. Thus, as Rush aptly put it, the merit of the Institute was
turned to its misfortune, and its ‘‘voluntary zeal’’ was thought totally
unworthy of recognition.

The various invitations to members of Congress, army aud navy
officers, consuls, and citizens to collect and send in materials had, how-
ever, begun to bring in great quantities of material, and the inability
to care for these properly was the cause of the appeals for Government
aid, which, as time went on, grew more frequent and urgent till 1846,
when discouragement took the place of anticipation, and the society
fell into a condition of inactivity and apathy.

The real cause of the decline of the National Institute was simple
enough. Failing to secure grants of money from Congress, the society
was overwhelmed by the deluge of museum materials which, in response
to its enthusiastic and widely circulated appeals, came to it from all
quarters of the world. The annual receipts from the assessment of
members were insufficient to pay for the care of the collections, and
although by virtue of the long term of its charter the collections were
kept together until 1861, there was little science and little energy mani-
fested in this administration.

In the archives of the National Museum there are a number of unpub-
lished papers which are of value as constituting a partial history of the
collections during this period, and some of which appear to be worthy
of permanent preservation are here presented.

One of them possesses a melancholy interest of its own. It is a list
of the active members of the National Institute in arrears for dues up
to December 12, 1843. ‘The delinquents were 168 in number, including
nearly one-half of the names on the membership roll, and the total
arrearage amounted to $1,300. No wonder that the managers were
discouraged, for this sum represented a like deficit in the assets of the
society, its only income being derived from membership fees.

From this time on, as we have already seen, the society languished.
In 1848 its cabinet was almost the only evidence of its existence. At
that time, however, an effort was made to resuscitate it, which seems
to have been partially successful. The coming in of a new Adminis-
tration was in some degree beneficial, the President, Taylor, having
140 Memorial of George Brown Goode.

accepted the position of patron of the society, and some members of the
Cabinet proving to be friendly.

About this time the society seems to have regained its control of the hall
in the Patent Office, an apartment which now came to be known properly
as The National Institute—a name which it retained until the hall was
finally dismantled.

A visitor to Washington at the time of the inauguration of Taylor,
in 1849, has left a record of his impressions of the capital city—at that
time still very crude and unfinished. ‘‘ All that meets the gaze in Wash-
ington, except the Capitol and the Departments, seems temporary,’’ he
wrote. ‘‘The city appears like.the site of an encampment, as if it were
more adapted for a bivouac than a home,’’ and then he goes on to
describe some of the principal characteristics of the city:

In the National Institution, like nearly all of our scientific and literary establish-
ments, as yet in embryo, sea quadrupeds from the Arctic zone, birds of rare plumage,
the coat in which Jackson fought at New Orleans, the rifle of an Indian chief, plants,
fossils, shells and corals, mummies, trophies, busts, and relics, typify inadequately
natural science and bold adventure. . . . The foundation of the long-delayed mon-
ument to him of whom it has been so admirably said that ‘‘ Providence made him
childless that his country might call him father,’’? the slowly rising walls of the
Smithsonian Institution, the vacant panels of the rotunda, the sculptured deformi-
ties on the eastern front of the Capitol, and the very coin, freshly minted from Cali-
fornia gold, awaken that painful sense of the incomplete, or that almost perplexing
consciousness of the new, the progressive, and the unattained which is peculiar to
our country.’

President T'aylor placed in the custody of the Institute the Washing-
ton relics, and some other hopeful things occurred. The members gained
courage and proceeded to revise its constitution and by-laws, to vote to
print a quarto volume annually to be entitled ‘‘ The Transactions of the
National Institute,’’? and to memorialize Congress for financial aid, and
to offer its services to the Government ‘‘as a referee in matters which
involve scientific knowledge and investigation.”’

In 1850, at the request of the Secretary of State, the Institute under-
took the appointment of the ‘‘Central Authority,’’ a committee of
21 members to pass upon articles proposed to be sent to the World’s
Fair of 1851 in London.

The needs of the Institute in 1850, as summed up in the Secretary’s
report, were not extravagant—a medium of publication, a curator and
librarian, who were to be paid sufficient salaries to enable them to give
a considerable portion of their time to the work, new bindings for the
books, and more room for library and meetings.*

3None of these, however, were realized, save for a short time the publication of
Proceedings in octavo in 1855-1857.
The Genesis of the United States National Museum., 141

At this time there were twenty-seven paying members of the society,
and its income was less than $150 yearly.*

Mr. C. F. Stansbury, the Secretary of the Institute, acted as its agent
for the World’s Fair, and obtained there some specimens for its museum,
and in 1856 others were received from the New York Exhibition.

It would appear from the records of this time that there was still a
Gallery of Curiosities in the Patent Office not in the custody of the
National Institute.*

In 1854 the Commissioner of Patents, for many years vested with a
measure of authority by the Library Committee, was given by Congress *
the administration of the collections and authorized to employ keepers,
and a trifling appropriation was made, to be expended under the Depart-
ment of the Interior—an arrangement which continued for three subse-
quent years.

In 1857, the Smithsonian Institution having definitely accepted the
responsibility of caring for the national collections, all the articles depos-
ited with the National Institute were removed. In addition to these
there were numerous objects directly under the control of the National
Institute which the officers would not permit to be removed. There was
evidently still a lingering hope that Congress would make provision for
the care of the collections. In this same year, 1858, another memorial
was sent to Congress, asking for an appropriation for preserving the
collections of objects of natural history intrusted to their care. This was
unfavorably reported upon by the Senate committee (see Bibliography,
under Brown) and in the House was referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia, whose report showed that ‘‘the collections are now
in the Smithsonian Institution.’’ 4

*The following letter will serve to explain the nature of the ties by which a part
at least of the members were held to the organization:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, January 5, 7852.

My DEAR Sir: I beg leave through you to thank the members of the National
Institute for the honor they conferred upon me by my election as one of the vice-
presidents, and to request that I may not be considered a candidate for reelection.

I shall continue to be a member and hold myself responsible for my portion of the
debt unavoidably incurred by the executive committee. It is my opinion that under
its present organization the Institution can not advance the cause of American
science, and that it may be productive of much evil.

I remain, very truly, your friend and servant,
JOSEPH HENRY.

PETER FORCE, Esq.

P. S.—I think it would be best to appoint a committee to inquire into the state of
the Institution, and to advise as to what is to be done, and how the debts which have
been incurred are to be paid. ' J. o.

Some of these Were, 11S “tiritey ibutethere was still a miscellaneous
collection, including many valuable objects, in the hall of the Patent

Office, and known as “‘the National Institute.’? Of these a catalogue -

was published by Alfred Hunter in 1859."

They were afterwards placed in some old cases in a passageway in the
Patent Office, and many valuable specimens and books were destroyed or
stolen, there being no one responsible for their safety.?

Professor Baird told the writer that the books and specimens were placed
on top of some file cases in a basement corridor, near an outer door, and
that a person with a cane could at any time dislodge an armful and carry
them away without impediment,

In 1861, shortly before the charter finally expired by limitation, the
birds and insects were almost completely destroyed and the library reduced
to broken sets of periodicals and transactions. Such as they were, they
were delivered by the Secretary of the Interior to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. 3

This was the end of the National Institute and its efforts to found a
national museum, the end of the National Cabinet of Curiosities, and of
the National Gallery, except so far as it continued in the possession of the
Washington relics and the F ranklin press, exhibited in one of the halls
of the Patent Office,

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION AND THE NATIONAL CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.

After ten years of discussion, a bill to incorporate the Smithsonian
Institution received the approval of Congress and the President. ‘The
charter, in its final form, does not appear to have represented fairly the
views of any one party, except that which favored the library and inci-
dentally the museum. Several special provisions, not from our present
point of view harmonious with the spirit of Smithson’s bequest, were
eliminated, and the act as finally passed, while broad enough to admit
upon the foundation almost any work for intellectual advancement, was
fortunately expressed in such general terms as to allow a_large share of
liberty to the trustees or regents.

The Smithsonian Institution has had upon its governing board many
of the noblest and wisest of the men of the nation, and the Regents, to
whom, during the first four years of its corporate existence, the decision
of its policy and its future tendencies was intrusted, were chosen from
among the very best of those at that time in public life.

*Hunter’s Bibliography,

*It is said that some enlightened Commissioner of Patents, in power between
1850 and 1860, was annoyed by the presence of a collection of fossil vertebrates in
one of the rooms in his building, and without consulting anyone sent them to a
bone mill in Georgetown, where they were transformed into commercial fertilizers—
once for thought, they now became food for the farmers’ crops.

Among them were George M. Dallas, the first chancellor, at that time
Vice-President of the United States; Chief Justice Taney; Rufus
Choate, of Massachusetts; Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana; George P.
Marsh, of Vermont; Lewis Cass, of Michigan; Jefferson Davis, of Mis-
sissippi; James A. Pearce, of Montana; James M. Mason and William
Winston Seaton, of Virginia; John McPherson Berrien, of Georgia;
William C. Preston, of South Carolina; William J. Hough, of New York;
Alexander Dallas Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and Gen-
eral Joseph G. Totten.

The Regents soon realized that in order to carry out efficiently the
trust which had devolved upon them, it would be necessary to decide
upon a definite course of policy, and to settle for themselves the inter-
pretation of certain of the provisions in the act of incorporation.

A committee was appointed at once to digest a plan to carry out the
provisions of the ‘‘Act to establish the Smithsonian Institution,’’ and on
January 25, 1847, this report was made, signed by Robert Dale Owen,
Henry W. Hilliard, Rufus Choate, and Alexander Dallas Bache, after
having made a preliminary report December 1, which was recominitted
to the committee December 21.

These dates are mentioned in order to afford opportunity for the remark
that in the interval between December 1 and December 21, Professor
Joseph Henry had been elected to and accepted the secretaryship of the
Institution, and that previous to his election he had submitted to the
Regents a sketch of a proposed plan of organization, which appears to
have been acceptable to the majority of the Board, and that in this sketch
were printed opinions which had from that time on a most powerful, and
in time a controlling, influence upon the policy of the Institution.’

The election of Professor Henry was in accordance with the view held
by the Regents, and expressed in the report of the committee, and even
more forcibly in the resolutions of the Board, that the Secretary must of
necessity become the chief executive officer of the Institution, and ‘‘ that
upon the choice of this single officer, more probably than on any one
other act of the Board, will depend the future good name and success
and usefulness of the Smithsonian Institution.’’?

‘At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds in Febru-
ary, 1865, Professor Henry said: ‘‘I have been from the first, now eighteen years, the
secretary or executive officer of the Smithsonian Institution. . . . Before my elec-
tion I was requested by one of the Regents to give a sketch of what, in accordance
with the will of Smithson, I considered should be the plan of organization, and after
due consideration of the subject there was not the least shadow of a doubt in my mind
that the intention of the donor was to found a cosmopolitan institution, the effects of
which should not be confined to one city, or even to one country, but should be
extended to the whole civilized world.’”? (Rep. Com., No. 129, Thirty-eighth Con-
gress, second session. )

The choice of Professor Henry was by no means the unanimous act of
the Regents, and since in respect to personal qualifications he undoubtedly
fulfilled the requirements of the resolution passed by the Board previous
to the election of a Secretary, it is clear that some of the Regents did not
look with favor upon his plan of organization.

Of the 12 votes cast at the election December 3, 1846, 7 were in favor
of Professor Henry, and 5 for persons who had been officers of the old
National Institute, and closely associated with its policy.

A bare majority—for the change of one vote would have made a tie—
then placed itself on the side of the Henry policy. In its report the
committee on organization speaks plainly of ‘‘two great conflicting opin-
ions’? in the Board, for the harmonizing of which the ‘‘compromise’’ so
often referred to during the struggle of the following six years.

One party was in favor of devoting the larger part of the income to
the library and museum.

The other party favored rather the publication of scientific memoirs,
grants for the promotion of original researches, and the maintenance of
a lecture System: *

The ‘‘compromise’’ consisted in the division of the annual income into
two nearly equal parts, to be applied to the two classes of expenditures,
$15,000 to library and museum and the remainder ($15,910) to publica-
tion, research, and lectures.’

On one subject, however, the Regents seem to have been unanimous,
and to have given their opinion in the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress and in accordance with
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes
of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and
objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library
of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that
a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art, may be provided,
which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the

original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit
of any branch of knowledge.4

The great building which, by the terms of this charter, the Smith-
sonian Regents were requested to erect and pay for was to be ‘‘ of suff-
cient size and with suitable rooms or halls for the reception and arrange-
ment upon a liberal scale of objects of natural history, including a

«To the library and museum party belonged, without doubt, Senator Choate, Mr.
Owen, and probably Mr. Rush and General Totten, who were both devoted to the
interests of the National Institute. Mr. Bache was, I suppose, the leader of the
opposition.

3In this resolution for the first time the term ‘‘natural history’’ is given its proper
scope, as including not only zoology and botany, but geology, mineralogy, and eth-
nology, although in the report of the committee a distinction seems to have been
made, probably for the purpose of better definition.

geological and mineralogical cabinet, a chemical laboratory, a library, a
gallery of art, and the necessary lecture rooms;’’ and this was coupled
with the accompanying provision, that, ‘‘in proportion as suitable
arrangements can be made for their reception,’’ all objects suitable for a
museum or gallery of art which the United States at any time might
possess shall be delivered to the Regents and shall be arranged in the
building.

The national collections then existing and those afterwards to accumu-
late were thus transferred to the governing board of the Smithsonian
Institution as a contribution from the United States to the resources of
the Institution, and were evidently intended in a certain way to counter-
balance the gift of James Smithson for the same purpose.

The intention of Congress is evident, and the law was almost manda-
tory incharacter. There was one phrase in the law, however, which gave
opportunity for adjustment of terms.

The provision that the delivery of these objects should take place ‘‘in
proportion as suitable arrangements could be made for their reception,’’
was, it may be, intended to give the Institution time for careful and
thorough preparation. -This placed no limit upon the time for completing
the buildings, and indeed gave to the Board of Regents the right to indi-
cate the time when ‘‘suitable arrangements’’ could be made.

It was undoubtedly the wish of the members of the Twenty-ninth Con-
gress that the expense and responsibility of organizing and maintaining
a national museum should be transferred forever to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and it was quite far from their intention that the public Treasury
should ever be called upon for aid.

Not only the National Museum, the National Library, and a national
chemical laboratory were thus assigned, but also the expense of keeping
up the previously neglected public park in which the Smithsonian build-
ings were to be erected. It was only by accident that a national observa-
tory and an institution corresponding to the present Department of
Agriculture were not added to the burden.

That was the day of small beginnings. ‘The theory of our form of
government had not been settled in the minds of our public men, and
every new project brought up for discussion in Congress became the sub-
ject of long and tortuous discussions. There were Congressmen who ten
years after the acceptance of the Smithson legacy were in favor of return-
ing the money to England to be given to any one who could legally take
it, while Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, in 1845, endeavored to over-
throw what had already been established and to substitute a ‘‘ Washington
University for the benefit of the indigent children of the District of Colum-
bia, in memory of and out of respect to George Washington, the Father
of his Country.’’*

146 Memorval of George Brown Goode.

The will of the Twenty-ninth Congress was not necessarily that of
the Thirtieth. Mr. Hilliard, of Alabama, made a bold and successful
stroke for the independence of the Board of Regents, and defeated a
motion to appoint a regular Congressional committee to supervise and
report upon their proceedings. This was a step toward securing the
recognition of the right of the Regents to interpret for themselves the
true meaning of the charter.

The next Congress was still less disposed to exercise a minute system
of control, and the Regents, through Senator Jefferson Davis, boldly
asserted that it was ‘‘improper for Congress to interfere with the adminis-
tration of a fund which it has confided to a Board of Regents not entirely
formed of members of Congress and not responsible to it.’’*

The attitude of Professor Henry from the beginning to the end of the
thirty-one years of his secretaryship was singularly independent and out-
spoken. Having before his election submitted to the Board of Regents
a plan of organization which met with their approbation, he was elected
with the understanding that he was to carry this plan into effect.

He was from the beginning in a certain way the authorized interpreter
of the Smithsonian bequest, and, as everyone knows who has studied
the history of the Institution, his earnest and steadfast policy and the
wonderful clearness and force with which he explained his views, sup-
ported by his scientific eminence and his grandeur of character, gave
him a wonderful influence with the successive bodies of men who acted
as regents.

His influence from the very start was on the side of publication and
original research and in opposition to constant expenditure of what in
time he began to designate as “‘local objects.’’

His attitude toward museum and library, especially the former, was at
first a noncommital one. He proceeded slowly, evidently not from lack
