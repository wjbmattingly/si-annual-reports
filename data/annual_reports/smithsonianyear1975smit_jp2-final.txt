THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accept-
ing the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establish-
ment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice
President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart-
ments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the
Smithsonian Board of Regents.

Limits to Growth?

S: DILLON. RIPLEY

IT IS APPROPRIATE these days to attempt to guess what amount of
growth is prudent in an organization. In the United States growth
and development have been synonymous with “good” for lo these
many years. “Growth” stocks, corporate “growth,” “growth” in-
dustry—all have been phrases on the side of the angels. And indeed
growth is natural, a symbol of animate being. “Growth is the only
evidence of life,” as a Dr. Scott said to Cardinal Newman a cen-
tury or so ago.

If then growth of some sort is natural—a condition of being—
how can it be measured? At what level is it healthy as in arithmetic
growth? At what stage does it become out of control, raging, and
cancerous, as in exponential growth? A few years ago all growth
was said to be good, but with discussions on natural resources re-
flecting our new environmental consciousness frame of mind, peo-
ple the world over have been made aware of the finite quality of
certain stores of natural objects, such as oil or minerals, on the one
hand, and of the worldwide problem of human population growth
on the other. The book, Limits to Growth, presaged a levelling off
and decline of standards of living based on development, growth,
and concomitant expectations within a hundred years, accompanied
along the way by a series of small crashes as various raw materials
became nonexistent or economically unexploitable. Given these
prospects, no matter how much debate centers around the details or
the time schedule, the planners of the world, taking stock of the
wars and oil embargoes in the Middle East, have grown in-
creasingly uncertain of the future, and hesitate nowadays to sub-
scribe to the prognoses of pre-October 1973.
In this uncertain climate it seems appropriate to take stock and
measure our own Smithsonian growth over the past decade. In
approximate terms the annual federal budget for salaries and ex-
penses (nearly 80 percent of our total federal budget each year is
for operations) has increased from a bit over $17 million in fiscal
year 1965 to nearly $71 million in fiscal year 1975. At first glance
this addition of about $53.5 million over the period seems a striking
proportional increase, especially looking back over the previous
ten years.

However, roughly $23.5 million of the $53.5 million net increase
in the period, or about 44 percent of the total increase, is for un-
avoidable costs. For example, nearly $20 million of the net increase
in the period is for unavoidable payroll costs, such as legislated pay
increases, applying both to staff employed in fiscal year 1965, and
for additional employees subsequently authorized by the Congress.
(Even if applied just to fiscal year 1965 employment alone, the
cumulative effect of these pay increases would have raised our
operating costs by more than $15 million; since fiscal year 1965, pay
raises alone have raised the pay of salaried employees nearly 70
percent and wage employees an estimated 83 percent.) During this
same period, inflationary increases for items such as utilities, sup-
plies, travel, etc., have further increased costs to the Institution by
$3 to $4 million. Thus, well over 40 percent of the “growth” of the
Smithsonian in the past ten years has been due simply to rises in
the cost of living.

If this is so, then what of the roughly $30-million increase that
makes up the rest of our total of $53.5 million? Where has this
been spent and how? Of this real increase nearly $4 million has
been for major national events in celebration of the American
Revolution Bicentennial, a program which is temporary in nature
and which will phase out gradually over the next two years. The
other $26 million was authorized for the establishment of new
activities and for the growth of existing bureaux and offices, in-
cluding new staff, in the past ten years, but exclusive of their
legislated pay increases. Of this $26 million, more than $6 million
has been for new activities such as the Hirshhorn Museum, the
Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, the National Museum Act, the
Office of Computer Services, and some fifteen other new bureaux
and offices. The remaining $20 million has gone to strengthening

existing activities and programs in order to keep up with ap-
propriate standards for the museums and laboratories in our care.
A highly visible and representative illustration is the Air and Space
Museum, which has experienced large increases in staffing and
funding as it has prepared for operations in its new building au-
thorized by Congress. Less conspicuous has been a concerted effort
to make our vast natural history collections more accessible for
research by the application of computer technology and the de-
velopment of a more adequate level of technician support.

With the growth of state and federally supported university
laboratories, as well as the newer support for museums across the
land, it ill behooves the Smithsonian to fail to keep up, either in
salaries or in support activities. Otherwise our national obligations
would be severely jeopardized. Skilled and specialized people in
the museum and laboratory world are at a premium. There is
intense competition for their services, just as there is high demand
for particularly skilled teachers in the academic marketplace.

It is perhaps worthwhile to cast a glance at the directions toward
which our $6 million for new activities has been steered. In the
museum field, new activities cover a broad range. In art, the In-
stitution has added an entire new museum, the Hirshhorn, filling a
recognized gap in the Smithsonian’s offerings for public exhibit, a
need which had been identified since as far back as 1938 but never
previously acted upon. Thus, by acquiring the Hirshhorn collection
and the museum to house it, the Institution took one giant step
forward in a tangible intellectual sort of growth by adding a new
dimension of aesthetic appreciation to the Nation’s Capital. Al-
ready in the first nine months of its existence, the Hirshhorn has
lived up to its promise by receiving 1,620,540 visitors, making it
one of our most popular museums in Washington.

The Cooper-Hewitt collections of decorative arts in New York, a
most significant and growing department, has been added to our
art-related collections. The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, a
new experiment in community relations and the fostering of tech-
nical museum training and art appreciation in a largely black
community, has been extremely successful and is now the recipient
of nearly a half-million dollars of annual federal operating funds.
The Archives of American Art is a new responsibility of the art
curatorship of the Institution, bringing to the Smithsonian a com-

6 / Smithsonian Year 1975
prehensive documentation of the papers and life histories of
American artists. Finally, the Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition
Service now receives federal support enabling it to present, in 1975,
498 exhibitions in forty-five states and seen by approximately four
million visitors.

In the realm of the sciences, environmental study receives sup-
port through the newly created Chesapeake Bay Center as well as
through the Environmental Sciences Program which, together with
the Research Awards Program, represent annual expenses of more
than $1 million. Additionally, the social sciences are represented
for the first time in the field of social anthropology through the
Center for the Study of Man. (History in the Museum of History
and Technology includes, of course, research in what could be
described as humanistic study as part of the social sciences.)

Finally, international programs, public information and orienta-
tion services, and equal opportunity and other important adminis-
trative services make up the rest. Thus of our $6 million for new
activities, 36 percent has gone to the arts, 20 percent to the sci-
ences, and about 33 percent to administering various services. The
remainder, nearly 11 percent, is accounted for by the technical
training grants program of the National Museum Act. This pro-
gram serves other museums and perhaps should not thus be re-
garded as support for the Smithsonian itself.

The private funds of the Institution have also grown sub-
stantially during this ten-year period, from a budget of $12.1 million
in fiscal year 1965 to $35.9 million in fiscal year 1975. As with our
federal appropriations, however, inflation of approximately 70
percent in the past ten years has cut heavily into the purchasing
power of the 1975 dollars, and again our real growth here has been
far less than it would seem. In 1965, for example, the Smithsonian
spent $9.1 million of federal grant and contract awards on various
research projects; in 1975 federal grant and contract expenditures,
once again exclusive of administrative expenses, were approxi-
mately $10.1 million. Deflated to 1965 dollars, however, it appears,
in real terms, the Smithsonian this year had available $3.2 million
less from these sources than ten years ago.

Aside from these grants and contracts, the private funds budget
has grown from $3.0 million to $25.7 million. This growth, al-
though also substantially diminished by inflation, does reflect the

Statement by the Secretary / 7
greater flexibility of private funds to begin new activities as op-
portunities arise—specifically it has allowed the expansion of the
Institution’s education “out reach” program through the National
Associates, spreading the values of our knowledge, research, ex-
hibits, and collections to citizens throughout the Nation. It has
allowed improvements also in services to area residents and to our
visitors to the Nation’s Capital. Included in these improvements are
a first experiment in a neighborhood museum, an enormously suc-
cessful annual Festival of American Folklife on the Mall, as well
as fully financed activities in oceanographics and the acquisition
of major collections.

In all of this we feel that our growth has been a logical outcome
of expressed needs of the Institution for further appropriate sup-
port, and for the addition of new activities to supplement and
buttress what we are already trying to do. Fortunately, as the
critic Hilton Kramer has pointed out in the New York Times (May
25, 1975), where we have added museum collections of real magni-
tude or differing theme, we have been able to house them in
separate buildings rather than having to expand an ever-growing
single roof, or balloon out on a single ever more vast building. In
my own opinion the days of combining all the world’s spectrum
of art—produced in all the continents from pre-classical to con-
temporary times, ranging in style from the Old Masters to “ethno-
art” or tribal arts—under a single roof in a multicellular building
are over. Museum fatigue can be akin to twisting the dial too
rapidly on a television set. A kaleidoscope of impressions in-
evitably brings on premature symptoms of brain damage. In a
vast collection like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, only rigorous
discipline will allow the practiced museum-goer or guided student
to focus on a single exhibit or period of time in cultural history on
a single visit, presumably one of many. The average museum-goer
has no such opportunity. A single visit can only produce a kind of
cosmorama or phantasmagoria so that the etiology of museumitis
is assured.

But if we attempt to make the Institution’s growth selective,
how do we select? In the past two years the Smithsonian has em-
barked on a series of priorities studies, using our administrative
resources to marshal bureau directors, our distinguished Smithson-
ian Council, our National Associates Board, and our Development

8 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Office, to focus on where our real needs remain. A seminar among
our science bureaux last February at Front Royal, Virginia, was
another example of our reassessment of our own progress.

It is quite clear from all these discussions that the future growth
of the Institution should consist of two parallel and distinct types
of activity. Physically, as far as existing needs are concerned, we
have reached a sort of plateau of new growth. We need desperately
a consolidated Museum Support Facility to house, curate, and con-
serve collections, in an off-campus setting, away from the Mall.
The public exhibition facilities on the Mall should not be further
cramped by the increasing pressures of storage and curation.

We already possess the land and some of the facilities at Suit-
land, Maryland, to expand appropriately. We need to create a new
way of looking at collections, working with them, and training
conservators as a prototype for a national conservation school.
Surely the Smithsonian must accept the responsibility for conserva-
tion of objects. We curate and store hundreds of thousands of
objects made by man, just as the Library of Congress and the
National Archives curate and store millions of documents, records,
manuscripts, and books. Only recently has it been realized that the
legacy of man-made objects is just as valuable historically and
philosophically as the testament of the written word. Present
efforts to conserve these objects are still in their infancy, carried
on spottily throughout museums and historical collections all over
the country by about two hundred trained persons. The training of
conservationists and the study of conservation techniques are of
the highest priority. Unless the Smithsonian can develop a Museum
Support Facility, outside the District of Columbia but still available
for curation and training, we shall be shirking our national re-
sponsibility, the outline of which was laid down in our original
charter of 1846 to be the “keeper of the national collections.”

Additionally, of course, we must renovate, repair, and refurbish
our old buildings and their surroundings. This task of keeping level
with decay and over-use is a fearsome one which never ceases. It
is a task occasioned not so much by growth as by the need to main-
tain our installations at many levels—physical, aesthetic, and in-
tellectual. Lack of attention to these concerns brings more expense
and trouble. Our surroundings directly affect their own mainte-
nance. It is easy enough to note that run-down lawns, neglected

Statement by the Secretary / 9
bushes or flower beds have just as direct an effect in increasing
untidyness and litter, as do shabby interiors, torn rugs, or broken
furniture.

One of the sadnesses of some contemporary architecture today
is contrived drabness. I recall sitting on an austere stone bench
(very new and stark) in the lower lobby of a brand new building
at Yale University, whose extruded aggregate wall and studied
terrazzo and cement floors conveyed all the style of a World War II
European concentration camp. A graduate student having finished
a soft drink bottle taken from a vending machine near the door to
the library, simply hurled it into the corner to smash and add to
the litter rather than place it in the handy rack for empties. This
was not an isolated gesture but rather a symbolic act. When in
Bedlam or in Belsen by all means behave like the other inmates—
or the guards?

The positive aspect of maintenance may be summed up: to
preserve is also to improve. And so the tasks of conservation,
curation, and storage go hand-in-hand with the tasks of keeping up,
of refurbishing, and of redoing our exhibits—whether in the Na-
tional. Zoo, or the museums—and of refining our laboratory
facilities. These tasks are not those having to do with growth but
rather those pertaining to prudent management.

The final, most important task which involves taking care of
what we already have is how to utilize the objects. With the in-
crease in collected objects comes an increasing responsibility for
growth in depth. Communication between bureaux and between
museums concerning collections, understanding what it is that we
possess, where it is, and how to retrieve the pertinent data, becomes
a new priority. Like libraries, museums suffer from bigness. Often
one department does not know what another has or where it is or
how to find it. Cataloguing and retrieval of museum information
are still miles behind the universality of present library techniques.

Here is an area where the Smithsonian has an opportunity to
provide national and international leadership in handling the trans-
mittal of information on collections; where they are, who knows
about them, and what more remains to be found out? We still have
no mechanism to correlate our cataloguing information with the
records of our registrar, who is concerned with logging objects in
or logging them out. We have no compatibility in systems, no

10 / Smithsonian Year 1975
agreed-upon vocabulary, no way of meshing in objects data with
library data, even though we know the basic principles for carrying
out these procedures. Thus the work of finding out how to use and
how to exchange information on our objects is in its prehistoric
stages. And yet as we are the caretakers of a finite set of things
for posterity, we must not only conserve them but we must pro-
vide the memory bank to let our successors know that we even
knew we had them and, as well, what we thought about them.

Finally, the second parallel and distinct type of activity of an
institution such as ours is indeed growth. “Ah ha,” the gentle reader
will say, “truth will out. We always suspected the worst’!

It is true that museums as such are concerned with growth. I
often think that today’s museums are the only legitimate growth
industry left. It is the nature of a museum to acquire objects, al-
though today the acquisition process is highly refined. As I noted
earlier, the Club of Rome study intimated that certain natural re-
sources, oil or copper for example, are finite in quantity in the
world and may run out. In the same way, museum keepers know
that the supply of objects, whether made by man, or great natural
objects, such as whales or pandas, are finite in number and will
inevitably run out in due course. So endangered man-made objects
must be preserved and collected with the same zeal and care needed
for endangered living species, end-products of the miracles of
evolution, that they may be preserved alive in some manner for
the future. How curious that a museum or zoo ends up being both
a growth industry and an instrument of conservation? What a
paradox to find a growth industry which is not at the same time a
consumer of resources?

Equally, for better or worse, the Smithsonian is constantly in-
volved in turning down potential gifts. Such gifts may range from
buildings to vast or small things. Thus we recently have turned
down the San Francisco Mint, the Saint Louis Post Office, and the
liner S.S. United States. Additionally we have politely rejected the
largest collection of ceramics from Thailand ever offered to any
museum in the United States (because we could not prove they
were legally imported).

But of course the Smithsonian accepts things especially where
the things in some way interdigitate with other things we already
have, or represent lacks in closely related subjects. For example, the

Statement by the Secretary / 11
Institution possesses a good deal of basic railroading material and
documentation of the history of railroad evolution in the United
States, but we lack a “donkey,” a particular small shunting engine
of a type long since dismantled and now only rarely found in the
Southern States used as a power take-off for temporary logging or
lumber mills set up in pine forests. But how to find one? How to
seek out that rarity, that sadly unrecognized relic, beneath whose
dirt and greasy squalor lies the “impassioned beauty of a great
machine.” Oh Georgia-Pacific, Oh Weyerhauser, where is thy
benison? Where in some neglected forest glade lies maundering
that rusting hulk?

Another area in which our collections have strength is in the
history of porcelain-making in Europe. Oriental hard-paste por-
celains were greatly admired in the West, but it was not until the
early eighteenth century, under the aegis of Augustus the Strong,
Elector of Saxony, that hard-paste porcelain was successfully pro-
duced in Europe at Augustus’s Meissen factory. Through the
benefactions of a few donors, notably Dr. Hans Syz, our Museum
of History and Technology possesses an important collection of
European hard-paste porcelains as well as a fascinating exhibit of
many Oriental prototypes in design and pattern.

But of the equally significant soft-paste porcelains, especially
from French factories of the late seventeenth and the early eight-
eenth centuries, such as Rouen, Saint Cloud, Mennecy, Chantilly,
and Sevres, we are woefully deficient. To demonstrate the develop-
ments in ceramic history and technology in Europe and the United
States, gaps such as this must be filled. And so, collectors, know
that the Smithsonian would indeed welcome gifts, not only of
French soft-paste porcelain, but of many other types of European
and American ceramics dating from about 1700 to the present. For
this is only prudence on our part. If we are to preserve such objects,
they must be en suite, to make the collection comprehensive and
historically more worthwhile for study. In this pursuit there should
be no impediment.

But the question of collecting is fraught with complication. As
I have pointed out, the objects are finite in number, like rare natural
resources. They may be fought over by rival directors or keepers
with ferocious or Machiavellian zeal. Or again they may be already
possessed by one institution or other and unavailable for further

12 / Smithsonian Year 1975
acquisition. This is all right if the objects are well taken care of,
documented, or conserved. It is also all right if they are available
for outside study or loan. Here the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York has recently been pioneering most farsightedly in
loan collections exchange so that objects of great rarity, not other-
wise available for collecting nor thus for viewing or studying,
may be exchanged temporarily or for a longer term, to benefit
others.

In such cases of higher need or high policy, the broad vision of a
director or a group of trustees may well exceed the imagination and
vision of a particular curator. Some curators are objective and full
of vision, ample in their comprehension of the needs of museums
in general as well as of the possibilities of education for the public,
but others may still have a long way to go in the area of posses-
sions. Like members of a family trying to divide up a parent’s
possessions after the funeral, curators sometimes let their human-
ness show. They may not always be willing to lend, exchange
where possible, or otherwise make objects available for study.

Perhaps this is where the attic image for museums makes its
appearance. People are possessive but not for scholarship. They
want to own things but not for posterity. They are proud of pos-
sessions, but not careful of their provenance or thoughtful of their
future. After a time they have possessed, as they have loved, and,
the embers growing cold, they could not care less what happens to
the objects. So send them up to the attic or send them to the local
historical society or museum! What's left anyway? And that’s how
museums often inherit their collections. No wonder then that the
curator, mindful of how this careless largesse has been acquired,
becomes jealous, or secretive or unsharing, bound that his superior
knowledge and his possessions will carry their secrets with them
to the grave. Such is the very antithesis of rational curation, con-
servation, and care for posterity. Surely no curator worth his salt
can fail to admit that some of these unworthy thoughts have passed
through his own head.

Thus museums are a growth industry give or take a few years.
Selective as they may be, “growth is the only evidence of life.”
But such growth is difficult to plan, notwithstanding established
priorities. Maybe we will never get a shunting engine or a perfect
collection of “soft-paste’” china, but there are other targets of

Statement by the Secretary / 13
opportunity along the trail. If an opportunity should come for the
Institution to acquire a collection of portraits of native Americans
similar in quality to those secured in the late 1870s painted by
George Catlin, should we say no because such an unexpected event
is not listed among our priorities? Fortunately, museum curators,
knowing that no one really cares about posterity except themselves
and librarians, would not be so pedantic. At such a moment a
proper curator throws caution to the winds and acts as decisively
and coolly as James Bond with one minute to solve the fate of the
world. The curator knows as surely as “007” that in acquiring
certain things from time to time, there is no priority. There is only
the urgent necessity. Equipped with such powers of discretion,
sureness, and authority, curators may act as coolly and shrewedly
as any great intelligence operative, knowing that what they are
after may represent one of the world’s only legacies for the future.

Thus the Smithsonian will continue to grow, and to conserve
prudently and to refurbish what it possesses, mindful of the keen-
ness of perception and judgment required along the way. It is an
honorable task, and an onerous one, not easy, for the world finds
such skills difficult to understand, their worth hard to evaluate,
and there is no school in which to learn except that of experience.
And yet this is a task of high priority, for collectors remain one of
the only means we have to help the long train of understanding,
of communication between generations which is the very stuff of
history. If history is transmitted in an institution such as ours
then this reinforces and instructs the present and casts a glimmer
of light into the murky shades shrouding the future.

I have referred in the past to a museum as a social planetarium
where past may be delineated, present experienced, and future
postulated, the latter deriving from both the others. We hope that
an additional natural development for the Smithsonian will be the
creation of a flexible area adjacent to the National Air and Space
Museum, where some presentiment of the future may be exhibited.
We would show some of the results of our known technologies,
both newly acquired, as well as re-use of old, for solar energy,
water conservation, food resources—in general, all that we know
or can perceive about life support systems. As we near the end of
our Bicentennial it is well to look ahead to our Tricentennial, and
in the process demonstrate to our citizens some of the implications
contained in the concept limits to growth.

14 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Limits to growth in this sense is not a real phrase. It is merely
symbolic and in proposing it the authors of the Club of Rome
study were suggesting a riddle. Mankind cannot exist without
growth but we would be wise to accustom ourselves to an outlook
which stresses the interdependence of our existence as humans on
the planet. While nationalism and independence are taken for
granted today, the world economy, the use of resources, the inter-
locking systems by which we live are inevitably becoming supra-
national.

Paradoxically, just as events in the world at large having to do
with available resources, food, and overpopulation should be re-
minding the statesmen of the world of our interdependence, our in-
ternational political institutions such as those associated with the
United Nations are increasingly threatened by neo-nationalism,
tribal and ethnic factionalism, and irrational social behavior. Per-
haps we need some practical demonstrations, such as those related
to how we are going to have to share in the future in order to exist
at all, to remind us that we should impose societal discipline upon
ourselves rather than have it superimposed upon us by events be-
yond our control.

As the Institution looks back over the past year one priority
clearly emerges. Along with evaluation of our procedures and our
growth should come an examination of ways to make ourselves
more self-reliant. Only in this fashion can we carry through our
objectives in a businesslike and timely fashion. I have always felt
that the Congress encourages us to act in such a responsible fashion
and indeed they have. The fact that we are filling in the West Court
of the Museum of Natural History using funds that the Institution
has raised privately so as to improve the facilities for our visitors,
school classes, tourists, and Associates alike, as well as to produce
restaurant accommodations for their comfort, has reminded our
Congressional committees that we have an obligation to do this.
We can act independently and prudently as we are chartered to do,
using private support to achieve goals related to the education and
convenience of our visitors. This is a facility which would have
taken far longer to achieve using the normal budget review and
Congressional appropriations procedures and would, therefore,
have been inevitably far more expensive. We can be thankful that
our charter gives us such flexibility.

Statement by the Secretary / 15
Such a development could not have come about without the
support the Associates have given us. At every level, locally and
nationally, there is a new awareness of the Smithsonian abroad.
This has come about largely because of Associates’ activities which
bring them a new understanding of our work and concerns. The
local programs of the Associates in Washington now involve some
70,000 people. Our national membership now stands at over
900,000. This means that for the first time Americans in a measur-
able proportion across the land have a feeling of belonging to the
Smithsonian and are in the process of understanding more clearly
their own heritage. For in this awareness they will realize that
the Smithsonian belongs to them.

This past year has seen the birth of two additional forms of
Institution outreach, one popular and of questionable impact from
our own point of view, the other of more immediate educational
interest to ourselves. The first was an apparently highly successful
series of three television hour specials on prime time, on the
Columbia Broadcasting System network, produced by David
Wolper, the celebrated independent producer, and sponsored by
du Pont. The three programs were light, somewhat frothy, and
varied from sensational to charming and nostalgic. I enjoyed them
as entertainment, as nearly fifty million Americans seemed to do,
and I hope they will be produced again. As entertainment they can
remind the public that the Smithsonian is fun and not merely “good
for one,” like castor oil or blackstrap molasses. Of course the more
we can remind people that learning is fun, and that the Smith-
sonian is fun, the better.

The second event has been the release of the first of our Encyclo-
paedia Britannica filmstrips for schools. We hope these will spread
across the land and increase the accessibility of our collections to
everyone in the same way that we hope to enlarge our Traveling
Exhibition Service of objects ranging from prints and pictures to
decorative objects or historic objects illustrating crafts and tech-
nology.

This past year has included several important appointments. Mr.
Stephen Weil has come to us from the Whitney Museum of Ameri-
can Art in New York to assume the post of Deputy Director of the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Dr. James Billington has
become Director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for

16 / Smithsonian Year 1975

Scholars after a trial year’s leave from Princeton. Dr. Forrest C.
Pogue was appointed Director of the Eisenhower Institute for His-
torical Research in the National Museum of History and Tech-
nology. Mr. Lawrence Laybourne has joined the Smithsonian as
Coordinator, Office of Membership and Development, after work-
ing as a Vice President for Government Affairs of Time Incorpor-
ated for a number of years in Washington. Mr. Howard Toy has
come to us as Director of Personnel from the Office of Economic
Opportunity. We are honored and pleased with these significant
additions to our staff, and honored also that Francis S. L. William-
son, Director of the Smithsonian’s Chesapeake Bay Center for
Environmental Studies, has taken a year’s leave of absence to serve
as Commissioner of Public Health and Social Services in the
Cabinet of Governor Jay S. Hammond in the state of Alaska.

Two retirements after many years’ service of particular im-
portance this year were those of Dr. George S. Switzer and Mr.
Jeremiah Collins. Dr. Switzer was in the Department of Geology
from 1948, and in the Department of Mineral Sciences from 1963,
and Chairman of that Department from 1968 until his retirement.
Mr. Collins has retired after nineteen years of service with the
Smithsonian’s International Exchange Service during seventeen of
which he was head of that Service, which each year on behalf of
the Library of Congress and government agencies ships many
tons of published works from the United States to libraries abroad.

Death claimed several of our men in the Smithsonian service in-
cluding the untimely loss of Mr. L. Wardlaw Hamilton of the Gen-
eral Counsel’s office in a motor accident and Mr. Jesse E. Merida,
a museum specialist in geology, of a heart attack. Howard I.
Chapelle, an internationally known marine historian and author,
who was Historian of Marine Architecture on the staff of the Na-
tional Museum of History and Technology until 1971, died on
June 30, 1975. He had been a prominent member of the Smith-
sonian staff since 1957.

For a mere nine months of the past year, our visitors to the
Smithsonian buildings in Washington, excluding the Zoo, comprised
13,128,000 people, a considerable increase over the preceding year.
However, among our problems with this continual growth of visitor
interest has been the limited space for circulation, as well as our
pitifully limited funds for renovation of the space we possess.

Statement by the Secretary / 17
Among the six major museums of natural history in the United
States from the West Coast to the East, the Smithsonian’s Natural
History Museum ranks last in space for exhibits, 166,000 square
feet, close to a third in size of the largest of those museums (the
Field Museum in Chicago), but with visitor attendance three times
as large as that of the larger museums. The resulting wear and
tear makes critical our need for renovation funds as well as for a
new support facility for research, conservation, and off-Mall
curation of collections. We are doing our best, as I have noted
earlier in this report, to match federal funds with private support
in renovation in that particular museum, but the obligation to
serve the public subsumes a similar obligation for help from the
public sources that support our museums for the public good.

Our labors would be incomplete without the many gifts which
the Institution has received over the year in funds or in kind. The
principal acquisition during the year has been the formal decision
by Mr. Bern Dibner to transfer to us his extraordinary library and
collection of artifacts in the history of science. This collection has
been referred to elsewhere in our annual report of this year and
last, but it helps to place our departmental work in the history of
science and technology in a new context. I could say with some
confidence, primus inter pares.

Gifts to the Institution are also listed elsewhere, but among them
of special note are the two outstanding Bicentennial donations of
a million dollars each from American Airlines and General Foods
for support of our Festivals of American Folklife of 1975 and 1976,
and the gift of the Summa Corporation of funds for the Howard
Hughes “Racer” plane and its exhibit in the National Air and Space
Museum. We are most grateful to the Eppley Foundation for sup-
port of fellowships at the Radiation Biology Laboratory and its
work on ozone concentration. Finally we should not overlook the
gift from eight third-grade boys at the Onate Elementary School
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who set up a research project on
mythology and organized a classroom museum exhibit, charging
one cent in admission. From this they donated their entire pro-
ceeds to the Smithsonian, $6.08. We are grateful indeed for their
wholehearted enterprise.

For the first time an ad hoc committee of members of the
National Board of the Smithsonian Associates worked together in

18 / Smithsonian Year 1975

the review of a Smithsonian project. The Chancellor appointed
two members of the Board of Regents and two members of the
National Board whose interest in oceanography and the environ-
ment were germane to the review of the Fort Pierce Bureau. It is
expected that in the future similar projects will be reviewed by
such ad hoc combined efforts.

Board of Regents

THE BOARD OF REGENTS held its customary three meetings in fiscal
year- 1975.

At the Fall Meeting of September 24, 1974, the Board welcomed
Dr. Gell-Mann as a recently appointed Regent. It was noted with
great satisfaction that Mr. Burden and Dr. Haskins had been re-
appointed, by acts of Congress.

The financial report was summarized for the Board and the
Board congratulated the Secretary for the good financial position of
the Institution. In the Financial Report presented in this report,
there will be found a full discussion of the finances of the Institu-
tion, including comment on the market value of current funds, en-
dowment funds, and plant funds.

The Board accepted with pleasure the gift of Mr. Bern Dibner
consisting of the major resources of the Dibner Library of the His-
tory of Science and Technology.

The Cooper-Hewitt Museum was discussed at some length and
the Board resolved to continue all efforts to bring the Museum into
active operation.

Hillwood Museum was found to continue in financial distress,
due to the investment market, and will remain in a holding status.
A public opening will depend on a satisfactory long-term solution
to financing of operating expenses.

The agreement with the Marriott Corporation for construction of
a three-story building to contain a restaurant, office space, and

Statement by the Secretary / 19
public education areas in the West Court of the National History
Building was ratified. This is a joint venture using Marriott funds
and Smithsonian private funds.

The Congress reauthorized the National Museum Act in accord-
ance with the recommendation of the Regents. It was noted that
the construction programs for the National Air and Space Museum
and the National Zoological Park were progressing satisfactorily.
It was further noted that additional steps should be taken by the
National Park Service and the D.C. Department of Highways and
Traffic to provide automobile parking for traffic, especially during
the Bicentennial year.

The Regents were assured that the Comptroller General had
examined a number of legal questions raised by a Senator and had
found no evidence that the Hirshhorn matter had been illegally
consumated in any particular.

The Regents complimented the Secretary on being appointed as
an Officer of the Ordre Francais des Arts et des Lettres. The meet-
ing was followed by a pre-opening tour of the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden.

The traditional Annual Meeting of the Board was held on January
24, 1975.

The financial report was summarized and presented. The new
federal fiscal year beginning on October 1 and ending on Sep-
tember 30 was adopted by the Board.

After hearing an explanation by the Treasurer of the need for
additional costs for the projected three-story building for the West
Court of the National Museum of Natural History, together with
an urgent plea from Director Porter Kier for the improvement, the
Regents approved proceeding with the project.

On the basis of an historical review of some six years of ocean-
ographic research based at Fort Pierce, Florida, the Secretary pro-
posed and the Regents agreed to a review for future guidance of
the corporate and program relationship with the donors, J. Seward
Johnson and Edwin A. Link. A Smithsonian ad hoc committee com-
prising several Regents and members of the Smithsonian’s Board
of National Associates was proposed. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Link
concurred.

Mr. John Nicholas Brown, Chairman of the National Armed
Forces Museum Advisory Board, reviewed for the Regents the long

20 / Smithsonian Year 1975
history of the unsuccessful actions taken to establish an outdoor
military museum. The combined difficulties of acquiring a riparian
site to accommodate naval as well as land-based exhibits and the
acquisition of a site with automobile access without disrupting the
adjoining residential subdivisions had defeated our numerous
efforts. The Regents recognized these barriers to an outdoor
museum in the environs of Washington. They received with favor
the description of the potential of the Eisenhower Institute in the
National Museum of History and Technology to develop future
programs to portray the historic contributions of the Armed
Forces of the United States. The Regents then directed that the
report of the Advisory Board be transmitted to the Congress
pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 87-186.

The Regents considered the six-year history of efforts to obtain
Congressional authorization of a museum support facility to
relieve the crowding of objects of historical, scientific, and artistic
significance into corridors and exhibition space. The Regents re-
solved to request the Congressional Members to reintroduce legisla-
tion to authorize planning of the support facilities, to be located off
the Mall but in a location as near as possible.

The Regents considered favorably a proposal for legislation to
reserve for the Smithsonian’s public service purposes the last re-
maining building site on the Mall, between Third and Fourth
Streets, Maryland and Independence Avenues, and Jefferson Drive.

The Board considered and approved the actions taken by the
National Collection of Fine Arts Commission, primarily the ac-
ceptance of works presented for accessions.

To assist the National Portrait Gallery in carrying out its basic
functions, the Board authorized the Secretary to request the Con-
gress to amend the founding act of April 27, 1962, so as to add to its
programs the collection and display of prints and photographs.
The Regents approved the actions of the National Portrait Gallery
Commission at its meetings on May 8 and November 11, 1974,
primarily relating to accessions.

The Regents were given further status reports on construction
projects at the National Air and Space Museum, the National Zoo-
logical Park, and the Arts and Industries Building, and accepted with
great pleasure the gift of Mr. William A. M. Burden of ballooning
artifacts, including books and furniture with a ballooning motif.

Statement by the Secretary / 21
A motion was adopted to designate the education building at the
Chesapeake Bay Center as the Jean C. Schmidt Environmental
Education Building in honor of Miss Schmidt’s development of an
environmental awareness program before her untimely death.

The Spring Meeting of the Board was held on May 14, 1975.

The Chancellor warmly welcomed Vice President Rockefeller and
Senator Frank E. Moss, who were attending their first meeting of
the Board. Senator Moss of Utah succeeds Senator J. William Ful-
bright. It was noted that on January 28, 1975, the Speaker of the
House of Representatives had reappointed Congressman George
H. Mahon as a member of the Board, and had appointed Repre-
sentative Elford A. Cederberg and Representative Sidney R. Yates,
each for a term of two years.

The Regents were presented a summary of the Federal-Budget of
$79,408,000 for operations and $17,892,000 for other special
projects including construction, and the reconstruction of the
Egyptian Temple at Philae. The status of the nonfederal funds of
the Institution were presented in detail. The Board approved the
budget of the private funds for fiscal year 1976.

The Investment Policy Committee Report was presented on be-
half of the Chairman, Mr. Burden.

In accordance with the governing statute, the Board submitted
recommendations to the President for appointment to the National
Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board.

The Regents received the report from the ad hoc committee on
Fort Pierce, Florida. The study included a tour of the facilities and
talks by members of the scientific staff. The principal programs
are the Indian River Study, the Life Histories Studies, and the
Submarine Exploration of the East Florida Continental Shelf. These
and other research programs were considered by the Smithsonian
staff to be worthwhile and should be continued. Dr. Murray Gell-
Mann of the review committee concluded in its report that the
present arrangements for accomplishing the scientific objectives at
Fort Pierce should be continued on substantially the same lines,
with a yearly review of objectives. The Regents approved.

Several bills introduced by Congressional Regents had been
favorably reported by the Subcommittee on Library and Memorials
of the Committee on House Administration. Included were a bill to
authorize planning of a museum support facility in Suitland,

the conclusion of a reception and dinner given by the Board of Regents and the

bestowed the Henry Medal on Mr. Brown on this occasion.
Maryland; a bill to reserve the last remaining building site on the
Mall for the Institution’s use; and bills for the reappointment of
Regents Brown and Watson.

The Board expressed its continued support for the position that
automobile parking at R. F. K. Stadium is not an adequate alterna-
tive to the present parking on the Mall and the additional visitor
parking expected in 1976. The Smithsonian has proposed parking
at the Jefferson Memorial, Tidal Basin, West Independence Avenue,
and the old Polo Grounds. No action has been taken by the National
Park Service.

The current status of various construction projects was given;
details will be found in Appendix 4 of this report.

After discussion with several art curators and architects, artists
Richard Lippold and Charles Perry were given study contracts to
develop scale models for the entrance to the National Air and Space
Museum. Outside financial support would be most welcome.

The agreement with the Summa Corporation regarding the giant
aircraft ““HK-1” was reviewed by the Secretary for the information
of the Regents. Because of the substantial costs involved in provid-
ing a suitable building, transporting the aircraft, and maintaining
so exceptionally large a museum display, it has been agreed that
Summa will continue to maintain the craft for one year. If it is
decided to dismantle the plane rather than to attempt to donate the
craft for display, the Smithsonian will have the right to take por-
tions of the plane.

The Secretary called attention to the comprehensive appraisal
by Dr. Crawford Greenewalt of the Smithsonian Tropical Research
Institute (str1) in Panama, circulated to the Board.

Mr. Goheen stated that he would like to know periodically the
progress of the Institution in equal employment opportunity. The
Secretary referred to a report which was given to the Regents on
the Civil Service Commission’s survey of 1973.

The Regents then joined their wives and guests for a reception
and dinner honoring Dr. John Nicholas Brown on the occasion of
the dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical
Research, at which Dr. Caryl Haskins presented the Henry Medal
to Regent John Nicholas Brown for his devoted service to the In-
stitution and the Nation.

The Board of Regents have encouragingly expressed their in-

24 / Smithsonian Year 1975
terest and concern for our measured growth, our assessment of
priorities consonant with that, and at the same time the growth
of our own awareness of staff and personnel problems. They
realize our concern for equal employment opportunity, for upward
progress in jobs, for the consensus of opinion on ratios in employ-
ment, minority representation, and equal employment opportunities
for women.

With this we welcome their support of the appropriate training
help to nourish our resolve to make museum careers attractive to
people in this country who before might have been quite unaware
of such opportunities. If we can raise the consciousness of people
in general about museum work, and its opportunities for self-en-
lightenment, for jobs, and for the fascination and fun involved, we
will have justified many times over the conviction that here is
indeed a legitimate growth industry.

FINANCIAL REPORT

T. AMES WHEELER, TREASURER

SMITHSONIAN'S FISCAL YEAR 1975 may be summarized as one of con-
tinued sound financial progress, even though financial needs con-
tinued to increase. In part, this need was to meet further large
inflation-bred increases in salaries and wages, utilities, and other
operating costs. In addition, new activities, including the opening on
October 1, 1974, of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
and the continued step-up in preparations for the 1976 Bicentennial
and next year’s scheduled opening of the new National Air and
Space Museum, required further substantial support. Fortunately,
the Smithsonian received federally appropriated funds to cover a
large part of these added needs. Federal appropriations also pro-
vided a major increase in funding for construction at the National
Zoological Park at a rate designed to achieve completion of its
master plan renovation over a ten-year period. Despite the generous
increase in appropriations, however, tight budgeting of these funds
and curtailment or postponement of a number of worthwhile
projects was necessary. Formal management reviews of the In-
stitution’s priorities have been beneficial in directing our efforts
toward the best uses of these available resources.

At the same time, our private trust funds were strengthened
further during the year, despite the need to meet from our own
resources the same types of inflationary cost increases as affected
federally funded expenses. Private fund income derived from in-
vestments, gifts, the Smithsonian Associates programs, museum
shops, concession fees, and other revenue-producing activities in-
creased substantially in fiscal year 1975. Gifts, largely for specific

27
projects, such as Air and Space exhibits and the Bicentennial
Festival of American Folklife, more than doubled those of the
previous year.

These private trust funds have normally been used principally
to take care of administrative expenses, to fund programs specified
by donors, and to assist in a modest way a variety of our Bureaux’
endeavors, such as small research efforts, publications, or the
acquisition of collection items for which federal funds have not
been available. In fiscal year 1975, larger private revenues made it
possible to initiate a long-sought program of adding to the In-
stitution’s present meager unrestricted-purpose endowment funds.
Increased private fund resources also made it possible to finance
improvements to our Museum Shops and, assisted by foundation
grants and other donations, construct a new training building for
the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies and start the
renovation of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum’s new quarters (toward
which we are still seeking another $1,000,000 of outside support).
Continued success of the Institution’s self-help efforts, which
also play a major role in bringing the Institution’s educational
values to a wider audience throughout the Nation, will enable us
to continue the strengthening of our endowment funds, the alloca-
tion of additional support to our bureaux in areas not covered by
federal funding, and the construction of improved facilities for our
visiting public and Smithsonian Associates already underway in
the West Court of the National Museum of Natural History.

Overall Sources and Application of Funds

In Table 1 there is shown a comparative listing of all of the In-
stitution’s sources of financial support for the past four years.
Federal appropriations totaling $74,511,000 provided 76.3 percent
of the $97,623,000 of overall operating funds in fiscal year 1975.
Grants and contracts at $12,292,000 equaled 12.6 percent, and
nonfederal (private trust funds) sources accounted for 11.1 per-
cent of the total; the proportions provided by both of these sources
rose in the past year, gains which are in line with the Institution’s

goal of restoring a better balance between federal and nonfederal
support. Construction funds totaling just over $18,000,000 in fiscal
year 1975 continue to be provided almost exclusively by federal
appropriations.

The application in fiscal year 1975 of all of these funds (exclud-
ing Special Foreign Currency funds, Plant funds and Endowment
funds) to Smithsonian’s diverse activities is set forth in Table 2.
Detailed discussion of the various types of income and their uses
follow.

FEDERAL OPERATING FUNDS
For fiscal year 1975, Congress provided $70,706,000 of appropriated
funds for the Smithsonian’s normal operating purposes (“salaries
and expenses”), a generous increase of $11,838,000 over the pre-
ceding year.

Of this increase, $6,500,000 was devoted primarily to furthering
the three high-priority program objectives followed in fiscal year
1974, namely: (1) continued preparation for opening of the new
National Air and Space Museum in July 1976; (2) development of
Bicentennial activities; and (3) further strengthening of the many
services needed for the protection, care, and cataloguing of col-
lections and support for related research. The remaining 45 percent,

or about $5,300,000, plus an estimated $2,000,000 more used for
other purposes last year, was required to meet the costs of
legislated and other uncontrollable increases in federal salaries,
severe increases in utility and rental rates, and the inflationary rise
in prices of other materials and services. An additional $1,805,000
was provided for the work of the Smithsonian Science Information
Exchange, a separately incorporated organization, engaged in re-
cording, classifying and furnishing information on a wide variety
of on-going research projects in such fields as water resources and
medical and environmental studies. Its scope and usefulness has
been expanding rapidly in recent years. The allocation of these
federal operating funds among major categories of Institutional
endeavor may be found in Table 3.

Additional appropriated funds for Smithsonian’s Foreign Cur-
rency Program were greatly reduced in fiscal year 1975 to
$2,000,000, of which $1,000,000 was reserved for the second of
four equal payments to cover the United States’ participation in
UNESCO’s international campaign to preserve archeological monu-
ments on the Island of Philae in Egypt. Remaining amounts of these
blocked foreign currencies allocated to the Smithsonian are awarded
to universities and similar United States organizations to conduct
research studies in a number of foreign countries (see Table 4).

FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS

Federal appropriations for construction purposes in fiscal year 1975
amounted to $10,910,000 plus $7,000,000 more toward continued
payments for the new National Air and Space Museum under con-
tract authority provided in fiscal year 1973. The advisability of
completing, over about a ten-year period, the phased renovation of
the National Zoo in accordance with its approved master plan was
given strong recognition in the boost to $9.4 million in funds for
this purpose. This fiscal year 1975 allotment will go toward con-
struction of the new elephant and bird house environs and an
education and administration building. The $1.5 million granted
toward restoration and renovation of buildings will, among other
things, provide for installation of fire control systems, repairs to
the old Arts and Industries Building, and improvements to the
unsightly grounds south of the “Old Castle” Building.

GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

In recent years a major portion of the research projects of the In-
stitution have been funded by grants and contracts from federal
agencies, and in fiscal year 1975 this contribution increased signif-
icantly to more than $12 million. As detailed in Table 2, the sci-
ence programs of the Institution benefited in largest measure; the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory accounted for more than
one-half of these funds, receiving support from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration for such projects as a Dop-
pler tracking experiment for the Apollo-Soyuz project, meteor
studies, and the satellite tracking program. Other awards to the
Smithsonian covered such diverse programs as investigations on
endangered plant species and a study of international oil spills to
research on the ethnic origins of man in America and abroad, and
a compilation of the papers of the artist Charles Willson Peale. A
breakdown of the major granting agencies to the Smithsonian,
together with the funds expended over the past four years, is shown
in Table 5.

operating funds were appropriated for the use of the Institution
($4,000), the current needs of the Smithsonian were met from the
investment income of James Smithson’s bequest to the American
people. As Congress entrusted additional responsibilities to the
Smithsonian, however, together with the annual appropriations to
fulfill them, the federal portion of the Institution’s budget grew,
exceeding $1,000,000 in 1927 and $10,000,000 in 1963. While the
private resources have also grown substantially since these early
days, the maintenance of the uniquely federal-private nature of the
Smithsonian requires constant efforts to increase our private
sources of income.

In fiscal year 1975, these efforts again met with success, and the
total private funds income to the Institution from gifts, investment
income, revenue-producing activities, fees, and other revenues
totaled $11,007,000 compared to the prior year’s level of
$8,954,000. The private trust funds provided 11 percent of the
total operating support of the Institution, up from 9 percent last
year. In addition, gifts and fund-raising efforts provided $187,000
for plant improvements, principally for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
(see Table 6).

Unrestricted Private Funds

In fiscal year 1975 the Institution was able to continue last year’s
pattern of generating unrestricted income excess to its immediate
operating needs. While administrative expenses grew, along with
the number of research and museum projects dependent on these
unrestricted funds, it was nevertheless possible to take a major step
toward our goal of building the Institution’s endowments by a
transfer of $1,442,000 from current into unrestricted endowment
funds. It is our intention to make similar transfers annually to the

36 / Smithsonian Year 1975

extent compatible with current needs, in order to strengthen the
Institution’s private resources for the future.

As shown in Table 7, total unrestricted income rose 20 percent
this past year to a record level of $3,532,000. Despite a propor-
tionately large rise in administrative expense due to salary in-

creases, other inflationary pressures, and a greater number of
allotments to Smithsonian bureaux for special needs, the net gain
before transfers for special purposes was nevertheless higher than
last year. These transfers, described below, also exceeded those of
the prior year, but left some $290,000 to be added to the un-
restricted fund balance at year’s end, raising it to $3,767,000, a
level more compatible with the Institution’s working capital needs.

Investment income, partly from unrestricted endowment and
partly from short-term investment of current funds, increased to
$950,000 this past year; of this income, however, approximately
$190,000 was transferred to Smithsonian bureaux as interest on
their restricted-purpose fund balances. Unrestricted gift income
decreased, indicating once again the difficulty of obtaining support
for general purposes. As has been the case in the prior two years,
the major contributors to the Institution’s unrestricted budget were
the educational and revenue-producing activities, which have
proven able, not only to cover their costs in extending Smithsonian
programs beyond the geographical limits of Washington, but also
to generate funds to supplement other research and museum pro-
grams of the Institution.

The Associates program, now ten years old, offers its various
categories of members such benefits as tours, lectures, exhibit
openings, special restaurant facilities, courses of study, discounts
on Museum Shop merchandise, and, of course, the Smithsonian
magazine. This program, with a membership in excess of 900,000
at year’s end, is enabling the Smithsonian to subsidize important
research projects for which funds would not otherwise be available,
as well as to improve our educational services to the public. Due
in large measure to the success of this program, the Institution will
be able to construct special facilities in Washington during the
Bicentennial year to welcome the ever-increasing number of visitors
to our museums.

Substantial investments of time and money in the Museum
Shops, to improve the quality and relevance of the merchandise as
well as the physical design of the shops themselves, has resulted
in a further gain in net income, to a level of $417,000. One-third of
these gains ($139,000) was transferred directly back to the in-
dividual museums in which the shops are located for public educa-
tion programs and purchases for the collections. The Product

38 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Development Program received net royalties of $218,000 from the
sale by outside manufacturers of licensed products developed in
concert with Smithsonian staff and related to the national collec-
tions. As with Museum Shops’ gains, distributions were made to
participating bureaux totaling $83,000. Detail on these and other
activities is shown in Table 8.

From the net gain of $2,396,000, transfers were made as noted
above to Endowment ($1,442,000 to Unrestricted, and $21,000 to
Restricted Endowment), and to the Bureaux from Revenue-Pro-
ducing Activities ($222,000). In addition, transfers were made for
land acquisition at the Chesapeake Bay Center ($97,000), operation
of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum ($34,000), special research grants
to Smithsonian scientists ($102,000), payment of interest to bureaux
on their restricted and special purpose funds ($194,000), and
miscellaneous incoming transfers of $6,000.

Special Purpose funds are set out separately in Table 6 as well
as in Table 2. These moneys include unrestricted gifts to particular
bureaux ($207,000) and receipts from various bureau enterprises
($541,000), such as parking at the National Zoological Park or sale
of commemorative envelopes at the National Air and Space
Museum, which are then reserved for improvement of facilities or
exhibits. The balance of these funds at June 30, 1975, was
$1,071,000, compared with $460,000 in 1974. This substantial in-
crease, despite the use of more than $500,000 of such funds for
numerous bureaux as shown in Table 2, reflects both the income
noted above as well as the transfers from Revenue-Producing
Activities and the payment of interest on fund balances.

Restricted Private Funds

The Institution also received $6,537,000 in fiscal year 1975 for a
wide variety of specified, or “restricted,” operating purposes, as
compared to $4,266,000 in fiscal year 1974. This total includes
gifts and grants of $4,177,000, endowment income of $1,724,000,
and miscellaneous revenues of $636,000; a partial breakdown show-
ing the principal recipients appears in Table 9.

Endowment income provided the major operating support for
the Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau, with the re-
mainder of the endowment funds (outlined below) benefiting
projects throughout the Institution. The gifts and grants to the
Institution are far too numerous to describe fully, although a
partial listing of donors follows this report. Their support to the
restricted funds, however, provided the greater portion of the
operating budgets of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative
Arts and Design and Hillwood, the former estate of Mrs. Marjorie
Merriweather Post. Major support was provided to the National
Air and Space Museum by gifts from the Summa Corporation for
general exhibits purposes and from the German Federal Republic
for construction and equipping of its new Spacearium; these gifts
are of immense value to the Institution in its commitment to open
this museum on July 4, 1976. Another Bicentennial project which
received important funding was the Division of Performing Arts

which plans an extended Festival of American Folklife in the
summer of 1976; grants from General Foods Corporation and
American Airlines are reflected in Table 9, with further payments
from these corporations expected in fiscal year 1976. Generous
support received from inland waterways transportation firms is
making possible further progress toward the building of an
exciting new American Maritime Hall in the National Museum of
History and Technology.

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars re-
ceived substantial grants both for on-going projects as well as for
the establishment of the new Institute for Advanced Russian
Studies, announced during this past year.

Miscellaneous receipts from the Freer Gallery sales desk and

Financial Report / 41

special fund-raising activities of the Archives of American Art
gave significant assistance to those programs.

As mentioned on page 35, another $187,000 of restricted funds
was also received for plant construction purposes, principally for
renovation of the Carnegie Mansion, new home of the Cooper-
Hewitt Museum. An additional $1,000,000 for this purpose is still
being sought.

Endowment Funds

The Smithsonian endowment funds had a market value on June
30, 1975, of $41,939,000. They consist of the Freer Fund, whose
income is used solely by the Freer Gallery of Art; Endowment
Fund No. 3, which supports oceanographic research at the Fort
Pierce Bureau in Florida; other restricted funds, maintaining a
large number of research projects; and unrestricted funds. As of
July 1, 1974, all Smithsonian endowment funds, exclusive of
$1,000,000 held in perpetuity in the U. S. Treasury, and some
$72,700 of miscellaneous securities, were pooled into the Con-
solidated Endowment Fund in order to facilitate investment man-
agement; separate accounting and administration continues, how-
ever, to be maintained on each fund in this pool. Table 10 shows
the market values of these funds since 1971, reflecting additions
from donations and reinvestment of income, limited withdrawals,
and changes in securities valuations.

The investment of the endowment funds of the Institution is
managed by three professional advisory firms, under the close

surveillance of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer,
and subject to policy guidelines set by the Smithsonian’s Board of
Regents. In 1972 the Board of Regents adopted the total return
policy, under which the income paid to each endowment fund in
the subsequent fiscal year is determined each March 31 by com-
puting 442 percent of the running five-year average of market
values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital. By select-
ing a fixed rate of return, regardless of what the actual yield may
be, the investment advisors may select securities for growth as
well as present yield, without being limited by the need to achieve
a specified dividend and interest income level.

One of the goals of the Smithsonian administration has been to
increase our endowment funds, particularly those for unrestricted
uses, which are still minimal in relation to the size of the Institu-
tion, providing only a small fraction of one percent of the total
operating income. Due to the unrestricted current funds surplus
achieved for fiscal year 1975, it was possible, as described above, to
transfer $1,422,000 into the unrestricted endowment funds, and
further such transfers will be a major priority in future years.
Table 11 reflects the changes in the endowment funds this past
year due to this transfer, reinvestment of income in certain re-
stricted funds, donations, and stock market action. The substantial
increase in market values over the year of $3,930,000 is attribu-

Smithsonian funds performed somewhat better during this period

Income of $1,911,000, net of managers and custodial fees, was
paid out during the year under the total return policy, which was
$207,000 in excess of actual dividend and interest yield. A break-

Accounting and Auditing

The Private Trust Funds of the Institution, as well as the accounts
of Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., the Smith-
sonian Research Foundation, and Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., are
audited annually by independent public accountants. Their report
for fiscal year 1975 on the Smithsonian is contained in the fol-
lowing pages, including a comparative balance sheet and a state-
ment of changes in the various fund balances.

46 / Smithsonian Year 1975

The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit
on grant and contract moneys received from federal agencies. In
addition, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are
subject to audit by the General Accounting Office. The internal
audit staff continues to conduct audits throughout the wide range
of Smithsonian activities and contributes greatly to smooth ad-
ministrative and financial management.

The Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution:

We have examined the balance sheet of the Private Funds of Smith-
sonian Institution as of June 30, 1975 and the related statement of
changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements
do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments,
bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under
Federal appropriations as detailed in note 2 to the financial state-
ments. Our examination was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests
of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present
fairly the financial position of the Private Funds of Smithsonian
Institution at June 30, 1975 and the changes in its fund balances
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the
preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION—PRIVATE FUNDS
Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 1975

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a. Accrual Basis—The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution—Private
Funds (note 2) have been prepared on the accrual basis, except for
depreciation of plant fund assets as explained in note 1(h) below, and are
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles included in
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit Guide “Audits
of Colleges and Universities.”

b. Current funds include capitalized improvements and equipment used in
income producing activities having a net carrying value of $597,610 and
$293,974 at June 30, 1975 and 1974, respectively. Such assets together with
funds held for additions and liabilities on acquisitions, which were pre-
viously included in plant funds, were reclassified to current unrestricted
funds at the beginning of the 1975 year to better reflect assets and liabilities
used in current operations. Figures for 1974 have been reclassified in the
accompanying balance sheet at June 30, 1974 to put them on a comparable
basis with 1975, resulting in an increase in the current unrestricted fund

balance and a decrease in the plant funds balance of $410,182 at June 30,
1974.

Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for
provisions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers
to the plant fund.

c. Fund Accounting—In order to ensure observance of limitations and re-
strictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution,
the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the
principles of “fund accounting.” This is the procedure by which resources
for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes
into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified.
Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accom-
panying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have
been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions
have been recorded and reported by fund group.

Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so
indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to specific
purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds may
only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source
of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which
the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its
institutional purposes.

Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments re-
quiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be
utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the
expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.

Financial Report / 59
While quasi-endowment funds have been established by the governing
board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such
funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts
for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be
maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board
has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the
purpose stipulated by the donor.

All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition
of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund
which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments,
receivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets,
except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar
funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted
or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.

All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current
fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted
resources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.

d. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition
when acquired by gift.

e. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.

f. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution’s magazine and asso-
ciates’ activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the
applicable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current
unrestricted funds.

g. The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment manage-
ment of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this ap-
proach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and
unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. In ap-
plying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide 442% of the
five year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and
transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures;
however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is
less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of
donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends
received.

h. Capitalized improvements and equipment used in income-producing activ-
ities purchased with Private Funds are capitalized in the current unre-
stricted fund at cost (see note 1(b)), and are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years. Depreciation
expense of $130,525 for 1975 is reflected in the expenditures of the current
funds.

Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to
the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or
appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in

60 / Smithsonian Year 1975

2.

Chesapeake Bay, Carnegie Mansion, and Hillwood Estate which have been
recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not recorded.

All the other land, buildings, fixtures and equipment (principally acquired
with Federal funds), works of art, living or other specimens are not
reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

The agency funds group consists of funds held by the Institution as
custodian or fiscal agent for others.

Pension Costs—All pension costs are funded as accrued.

The Institution has a number of contracts with the U. S. Government,
which primarily provide for cost reimbursement without fee to the
Institution. Contract revenues are recognized as expenditures are incurred.

Related Activities

The Private Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained
from private sources, from Federal grants and contracts and from certain
business activities related to the operation of the Institution.

Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, provide major support for the operations and ad-
ministration of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s
many museums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the main-
tenance and construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition,
land, buildings and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not
reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 1975 and 1974:

Substantially all of the investments of the endowment and similar funds
are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual
fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit
at market value at the beginning of the calendar quarter within which the
transaction takes place. Of the total units each having a market value of
$102.61 ($84.60 in 1974), 333,155 units were owned by endowment, and
62,239 units by quasi-endowment at June 30, 1975.

The following tabulation summarizes the changes in the pooled investments
during the year ended June 30, 1975:

Increase: ys tua is Aer n $28,217,708 30,374,046 18.01

The increase in pooled investments during the year ended June 30, 1975
resulted primarily from the addition of certain endowment funds to the
pooled investments.

. Note Payable

The note payable in the principal amount of $95,920 ($191,843 in 1974),
which is noninterest bearing, is secured by computer equipment and is
payable in monthly installments of $7,993 to June 30, 1976.

. Mortgage Notes Payable

The mortgage notes payable are secured by first deeds of trust on property
acquired in connection with the Chesapeake Bay Center. The details of the
mortgage notes payable are as follows:

Pension Plan

The Institution has a contributory pension plan providing for the purchase
of retirement annuity contracts for those employees meeting certain age
and length of service requirements who elect to be covered under the plan.
Under terms of the plan, the Institution contributes the amount necessary
to bring the total contribution to 12% of the participants’ compensation
subject to social security taxes and to 17% of the participants’ compensa-
tion in excess of that amount. The total pension expense for the year was
$815,304 ($729,068 in 1974).

Management Fees

The Institution provides financial and management services to certain
affiliated organizations. In 1975 the Institution charged fees for such
services as follows:

Income Taxes

The Institution has been recognized as exempt from income taxes as a
nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt
from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as described in
Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Formal recognition of this dual status will
be sought from the Internal Revenue Service. Should the Institution’s
position not prevail, income taxes might be imposed on certain income
of the Institution, under provision of the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with unrelated business income as defined therein.

Commitments

The Institution has entered into a contract for construction of a West Court
facility within the National Museum of Natural History at a total estimated
cost of $3,000,000 which is to be financed by a $1,100,000 construction loan
with the remainder being financed from the unrestricted general fund
balance.

SCIENCE

DAVID CHALLINOR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY

THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE at the Smithsonian and its diversity were
closely examined this past year. Some new ways were used to assess
the progress and promise of science at the Institution—most nota-
bly a seminar held at Front Royal in February.

At the Front Royal Seminar scientists from each of the bureaus
had an opportunity to describe their research to each other and to
discuss the future direction of science in general. This gathering
enabled the assembled researchers to learn about the work being
undertaken in the various bureaus and to consider the relationship
which that work might have to their own endeavors. A number of
recommendations made at this meeting addressed concerns already
on the minds of administrators while other recommendations
pointed to potential areas of investigation.

Maintenance and improvement of the quality of research were
pinpointed as the major priority of Smithsonian science by those
present. The maintenance of the highest standards of research
coupled with increased resources is the desired goal. It was clear
from the remarks of the participants that size is a major concern
to all, and the uppermost question was how or to what degree can
or should growth be limited. The Smithsonian’s current size allows
flexibility and the concomitant ability to respond quickly. This
characteristic reflects the unique quality of our Institution’s opera-
tion and is one that separates us from many of the federally funded
research institutions. Freedom from the ephemeral nature of efforts
to overcome specialization and its trappings sets us apart from most
universities. This approach allowed us to convene the seminar at

65
Front Royal in the form of an interdisciplinary dialogue, an achieve-
ment which would not have been possible in a bureaucratic environ-
ment.

Once again the threat of nascent anti-intellectualism appeared
this year with challenges to the type of basic research which the
Smithsonian performs or sponsors. While this kind of basic research
will always be subject to ridicule because of esoteric titles, the
scientist-administrators must continue to defend and promote basic
research as perhaps the most important part of their job.

When quantum leaps are made in the space sciences or medicine,
no one pauses to realize that these advances have come about only
through years of unspectacular basic research. The Smithsonian is
unigue in the federal structure for its concentration on basic
research, indeed it is one of our most fundamental premises. The
knowledge and information gained from such work has furnished
the base from which the mission agencies produce practical results.

We shall continue to seek preeminence in our research areas by
better utilizing our resources, by retaining the process of peer
review, and by exploiting our unique flexibility to respond to the
significant challenges of the future, while always maintaining our
existing strengths.

Center for the Study of Man

The Center for the Study of Man has continued research activities
in the human sciences throughout fiscal year 1975. Following its
successful conferences at the International Congress of Anthropo-
logical and Ethnological Sciences in 1973, the Center administered
and edited the publications which resulted from those meetings.
Forthcoming and in press are the following:

1. Volumes in the World Anthropology Series, published by
Mouton. The Anthropological Study of Education, edited by Craig
J. Calhoun; Toward a General Theory of Education, edited by
Frederick Gearing and Lucinda Sangree; Population and Social
Organization, edited by Moni Nag; Population, Ecology and Social
Evolution, edited by Steven Polgar; Cross-Cultural Perspectives on
Cannabis, edited by Vera Rubin; Cross-Cultural Approaches to the
Study of Alcohol, edited by J. Waddell, M. Everett, and D. Heath.

2. Conference Reports: The Cultural Consequences of Population
Change, report on a Seminar held in Bucharest, Romania, August
14-17, 1974. (Edited by the Center, includes edited versions of
papers prepared for the Seminar.)

From August 14 to August 17, 1974, the Center, in conjunction
with the Romanian Academy of Sciences and the Population Com-
mission of the International Congress of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences, hosted a meeting on the cultural implications
of population change at Bucharest, Romania. The meetings were
held prior to and in conjunction with the World Population Confer-
ence. In addition to the sixteen third world persons representing
the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria,
Kenya, Ghana, Mexico, and Venezuela, there were Margaret Mead,
Sol Tax, Steve Polgar, and Moni Nag from the United States, and
Sam Stanley and William Douglass representing the Smithsonian
Institution.

The meetings accomplished a number of related objectives. Rep-
resentatives from third world countries had an excellent oppor-
tunity to exchange views about the present condition of the human
sciences with nonthird world colleagues. The members of the
Seminar had an opportunity to review each other’s papers and also
the documents put out by the World Conference on Population of
the United Nations, 1974. Most importantly, they were able to
advance their own views on the draft World Plan of Action for the
World Population Year. As a result there was specific input from
the Seminar to the World Plan of Action. They pointed out that
the document ought to recognize that all humans are members of
social groups which are smaller than nations. They also urged the
United Nations to begin to develop a global ethic on population
with which any nation-state may evaluate its own performance.

The Urgent Anthropology Small Grants Program continued to
function during the fiscal year. Grants were made for urgent
research in North America and Africa.

During the past fiscal year the Center began research on sur-
viving American Indian groups in the Eastern and Southern parts
of the United States. This modest program has yielded some inter-
esting results. From preliminary investigation it would appear that
more Indian groups have survived than previously estimated,
though much additional work remains to be done.

Science / 67
From the Study of Child Behavior and Human Development in Cultural Iso-
lates of the National Anthropological Film Center, visual data on typical
child-handling practices has been abstracted for a number of studies: Among
the Fore people of New Guinea, infants and toddlers must take some of the
responsibility for remaining safely on the backs of those carrying them. Al-
though the carrier often holds the hands of a carried infant and sometimes
shuffles a sagging child back to a more secure position, the responsibility
for staying on falls to a significant degree to the infant, who must manage
for himself while his carrier negotiates difficult trails or darts and cavorts in
play. Facing page: in contrast, Cora Indian infants and toddlers can remain
relaxed and passive tied to the backs of their older siblings.

Another part of the American Indian Program is concerned with
learning more about the transition period between what is gathered
from ethnology and from archeology. This work is also valuable
for the forthcoming encyclopedic Handbook of North American
Indians. It is anticipated that several volumes of the Handbook,
under the general editorship of William C. Sturtevant, will begin
appearing in 1976.

RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC STUDIES

The work of the Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic
Studies for the fiscal year 1975 involved a wide-range of activi-
ties: special lectures and participation in professional meetings on
ethnicity and immigration; publications in professional journals;
supervision of graduate fellows in ethnic studies; and rendering
consultation services to other sectors of the Smithsonian Institution.
Under the directorship of Roy S. Bryce-Laporte, a comparative
sociologist, Rm1ES obtained internal support for a bicentennial project
on new immigration to the United States. The project being coordi-
nated by Ms. Dolores Mortimer takes the form of a series of
seminars on various aspects of the new immigration which will
culminate in a national conference and publication. Various con-
sultation visits and advisory seminars in Washington, D.C., Cali-
fornia, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, have been carried out by
rues staff and it has contracted for data surveys on special immi-
grant populations. Lecture presentations by the Director of RtES
were made at Howard University, the Caribbean Studies Associa-
tion, and the International Studies Association.

THE NATIONAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL FILM CENTER

The National Anthropological Film Center was established this year
to take fuller advantage of the scholarly potential of film as a tool
of inquiry into the vanishing and changing ways of life and cul-
tures of the world. Like its parent discipline, anthropology, the
Center will bridge both science and the humanities, dealing with
the full range of the human condition. Strictly scientific studies
will be balanced by more humanistic interests dealing with the arts,
historical process, and cultural values.

Physically, the Center will serve as a research facility and reposi-
tory for visual studies in much the way that museums obtain and
preserve important objects and materials for continued study and
to support findings. The Center will also provide cultural informa-
tion to peoples who have little written history, thereby helping
fulfill their need for information related to their own development.

Projects have been started which involve filming a number of
cultural survivals. The Center is giving special attention to the few
remaining small, isolated cultural groups of the world which have
evolved independently over thousands of years, and to other small
social enclaves which represent vanishing unique expressions of
human organization and behavior. It also collaborates with docu-
mentary film projects sampling the range of better known, more
stable cultural variation, including traditional folk cultures, as well
as selected aspects of our changing modern society.

Presently being planned is a research film library in which film
prints will permit review, study, and scholarly assembly, leaving
original films undamaged to take advantage of future advances in
the copying technology. The basic collection is being developed so
that access will ultimately be possible via cable connecting a cen-
tral automated videotape library with study centers and museum
displays.

The Center has been able to develop collaborative projects with
scholars in various parts of the world; and it has been able in a
few crucial areas to provide raw film stock, film processing, equip-
ment, and guidelines to anthropologist-filmmakers interested in
preparing scholarly visual documents as a permanent research
resource. Experimental field studies are also underway in an effort
to develop and improve visual sampling methods and equipment.

Affectionate play among children of different ages is characteristic among
the Fore of New Guinea. Knives or other potentially dangerous objects are
also part of the play environment experienced by young children. One of the
findings coming from the Study of Child Behavior and Human Development
in Cultural Isolates is that such aspects of child handling have a direct in-
fluence on the behavior patterns developed as children grow older.

With Mr. John Marshall, world-famous anthropological filmer
of the Kalahari Bushmen, the Center has begun assembling and
annotating his film record, the most extensive ever made of a tradi-
tional hunting-gathering society, and preparing research films for
deposit in the National Anthropological Film Center.

Although facilities to store film have not yet been completed, the
Center has begun its search for existing anthropological film foot-
age of research value which may be in danger of deterioration or
loss. Film historian Emilie de Brigard has agreed to join the staff

Science / 71
for a short period to apply her extensive knowledge of work already
done in anthropological film.

With the cooperation of Dr. Norman Miller, Director of the
American Universities Field Staff Film Project, the Center has now
accessioned 126,800 feet of research filmed material of human
adaptation in three modernizing cultures: a Tadjik-Pashtoon-Uzbek
agricultural village in northern Afghanistan, a highlands Aymara
subsistence agricultural community in Bolivia, and a cattle-herding
Boran nomadic group in Kenya. The Afghanistan footage has
already been annotated by anthropologist Dr. Louis Dupree. The
others are now being prepared for annotation. The Center cele-
brated its formal opening with premier showings of several educa-
tional films prepared by the American Universities Field Staff from
this research filmed material.

With anthropological filmmakers Asen Balikci of the University
of Montreal and Timothy Asch of Harvard University, and the
collaboration of Professor Bayazid Atsak of Kabul University, the
Center has begun a research film study of the Pashtoon Nomads of
Afghanistan, whose way of life is now rapidly disappearing.

At the invitation of the Premier of the Cook Islands, Sir Albert
Henry, and with a grant obtained from the National Geographic
Society, the Center is preparing to document representative tradi-
tional dances from each of the three major Polynesian culture areas
comprised by the Cook Islands.

As part of the Study of Child Behavior and Human Development
in Cultural Isolates and with the support of the Instituto Nacional
Indigenista of Mexico, the Center is proceeding with a long-term
film study of traditional Huichol Indian life in the San Andres
region of Mexico. Dr. Kalman Muller, an anthropological filmmaker
now resident in this region, has been participating as chief ethno-
cinematographer.

With Dr. William Crocker of the Department of Anthropology,
the Center is collaborating in a research film study of child behavior
and human development among the relatively unacculturated
Canela Indians of Brazil.

In collaboration with Dr. Kalman Muller, the research film study
of remaining surviving traditional Melanesian cultural groups in
the New Hebrides Islands is continuing. This footage is now being
prepared as annotated research films at the Center.

Research film studies of naturally occurring human behavior in different
parts of the world not only make possible comparative studies of play and
child interaction but also of such culturally variable characteristics as gait.

In an effort to devise methods by which film footage shot by
educational filmmakers may also be prepared as a research resource,
the Center is exploring a variety of strategies with filmmakers from
the American Universities Field Staff, the University of Montreal,
Harvard University, the University of Illinois, Bellevue Community
College, the University of California, Indiana University, the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Delhi University (India), and the Anthro-
pology Film Center (Santa Fe).

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies

In January 1975, Dr. Francis S. L. Williamson, after six years as
Director of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies,
resigned to accept an appointment as Commissioner of Health and
Social Service for the state of Alaska. Dr. J. Kevin Sullivan assumed
the position of Acting Director.

Dr. Williamson and his colleagues conceived of the Rhode River
Program, which is the core of the Center’s research effort. This
project is a study of the interaction of the Rhode River estuary
with its watershed and man’s impact on this system. The comple-
tion during fiscal year 1975 of a full year of monitoring material
entering the estuary from land runoff and other non-point sources
and the initiation of a Forest Ecology Program are steps toward
understanding how man’s use of land affects this ecosystem. The
Forest Ecology Program is part of the Smithsonian’s Environmental
Sciences Program (ESP).

The watershed of the Rhode River is composed of many small
basins, some of which drain into discrete creeks. As part of the non-
point sources study, the Center constructed instrumented weirs
(notched dams) to monitor the runoff from eight of these basins.
The weirs record the volume of water discharged while taking
volume-integrated samples. These samples are analyzed for sedi-
ment and nutrient concentrations.

Each drainage basin contains a different proportion of five land-
use types: cultivated cropland; wet areas such as ponds, swamps,
and marshes; pasturelands; natural areas such as forest and brush-
land; and residential areas including dwellings and roads. The total
area being monitored is 2100 acres.

Data gathered have been used to determine mathematically the
area loading rates to the Rhode River from each of the five land-use
categories at different times of the year. These rates are applicable
to predicting the effects of land-use changes upon the turbidity and
nutrient loading of an estuary on a seasonal basis.

Stream samples were also taken at times of known water dis-
charge and analyzed for total and fecal coliform bacteria as indi-
cators of pollution with human pathogens. Analyses revealed high
correlations between fecal coliform levels and water runoff rates
for each watershed. At times of heavy runoff, contamination of the

74 / Smithsonian Year 1975

Rhode River estuary with bacteria of fecal origin was a serious
problem. As the volume of the Rhode River increased toward the
mouth, fecal coliform bacteria were diluted and the higher salinity
levels further contributed to their decline in numbers.

The non-point sources study is funded by NsF-RANN (National
Science Foundation-Research Applied to National Needs) through
the Chesapeake Research Consortium. It is the most extensive study
of its kind currently underway on an estuarine system in the United
States. Investigators from the University of Maryland and the
Johns Hopkins University are working with Smithsonian scientists
on this project. Dr. David Correll is coordinating the Rhode River
Research Program.

In addition to the land runoff studies, scientists at cBcEs partici-
pated in the development of a Forest Ecology Program. This Pro-
gram has as its objective the monitoring of species succession
among primary producers at sites which have been subjected to
various land uses. Studies of small mammals, birds, insects, soils,
and minerals are coordinated with the studies of vegetational
succession.

Eight forest ecology study sites have been identified in the Java
Farm area. They include sites which have been undisturbed for
several hundreds of years (Hog Island) and others intensively culti-
vated until abandonment in the 1940s. A wide disparity exists
between plant communities at these sites, even in those which have
had the same land use. csces scientists hope to determine the fac-
tors controlling species succession in the forest community. Base-
line data collected in this study will also be used to predict the
impact of man’s perturbations on the forest ecosystem.

EDUCATION

With the addition of a full-time Program Director this past year,
education activities were restructured and several new starts were
made. A large-scale model field trip program in outdoor education
at the cBces was initiated. These teacher-led experimental tours,
which occur daily during the spring and fall, are designed to satisfy
specific curriculum requirements in science education in Anne
Arundel and other nearby counties.

Efforts were also made to develop a model Outdoor Environ-
mental Education Program for Adults. The caces played an active

Facing page, above: In order to measure land runoff and other non-point
sources of pollution, csces investigators have instrumented the Rhode River
watershed’s key tributary streams with a system of wiers—notched dams
that permit water to flow through. The wiers record volume and velocity of
flow while automatically collecting samples at intervals determined by flow
rates. The samples are collected weekly and analyzed for nitrogen, phos-
phorus, particulate load, total and fecal bacteria and pathogens.

Facing page, below: With the aid of sweepnets and plastic bags, students

Director, as part of the opis (Outdoor Biology Instructional Strategies) Pro-
gram. It is one of many osis activities which are designed to promote the
understanding of ecological relationships by youngsters from eleven to fifteen
years of age.

Below: A major new facility—the Jean C. Schmidt Environmental Education
Building—was completed at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental
Studies in March 1975. This building is divided into two sections: a visitors’
area which contains an auditorium seating 200 people and a dormitory area
which houses twelve and includes a kitchen, a study room, and a lounge. The
visitors’ area will serve as a center for workshops on environmental educa-
tion, for meetings of citizen groups, and for conferences on environmental
research. The dormitory will be quarters for college students on work/study
projects and visiting scientists.

mental Education in cooperation with the National Park Service
and the National Audubon Society and several adult groups partici-
pated in trial programs during the fall and spring.

The csces was the recipient of a National Science Foundation
(NSF) grant designed to implement opis (Outdoor Biology Instruc-
tional Strategies) within out-of-school community institutions. In
addition, cBcEs was designed as an opis National Field Center.

opis is an outdoor biology program that gives young people
between the ages of eleven and fifteen years the experience of
observing and investigating organisms and events in the out-of-
doors. Under the nsr grant, the Center is conducting instructional
workshops on osis activities for elementary and junior high school
teachers, summer day camp directors, and high school students.

For the second year, a Summer Ecology Program for children in
grades three through twelve was operated at csces. The objective
of this program is to train college students in outdoor education
techniques and is aimed at future elementary and secondary school
teachers. In addition, the Center continued its successful Speakers
Bureau Program in which Center staff present talks on environ-
mental subjects to a variety of local and regional groups.

INFORMATION TRANSFER

Funded with a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the
Information Transfer Program has as its goal the translation of
scientific results into forms which can be used by planners, govern-
ment officials, and resource managers who make decisions which
affect the Bay. In addition, the program makes environmental
information available to organizations and individuals.

Projects undertaken this year include a study on the opportuni-
ties for citizen participation in the water quality planning process.
An information specialist identified and evaluated these major areas
for citizen participation in the state of Maryland: Public Advisory
Councils on river basin planning, public informational meetings
and hearings on basin plans, and hearings on discharge permits
and the state’s Priority List for construction of sewage treatment
plants. The study resulted in recommendations for improving citi-
zen participation in the planning process and many of the recom-
mendations were adopted.

78 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Over the past year, the Center greatly expanded its informa-
tional services to management agencies, citizen organizations, and
the general public. News releases summarizing on-going research
activities at cBces were distributed to resource managers, environ-
mental leaders, and other interested groups and individuals. cBces
staff also developed information on specific environmental issues
such as land use, solid waste disposal, and off-shore energy tech-
nology for citizen groups and government officials.

The Center provided support in the form of staff time and exper-
tise to a number of local citizen organizations. Support activities for
these groups included organizing workshops and conferences,
researching environmental issues and planning public programs.

cpces helped organize two workshops on Maryland’s Coastal
Zone Management Program (czmp). The first workshop focused on
major environmental problems affecting Maryland’s coastal zone;
the second explored citizen participation alternatives in Maryland’s
CZMP.

PAGTEFTIES

The Jean C. Schmidt Environmental Education Building was com-
pleted in March 1975. The brick building is divided into two sec-
tions. The visitor area contains an auditorium seating 200 people.
Movable storage dividers convert it into smaller rooms. This area
will be used for meetings and workshops and as a reception center
for visiting groups and individuals.

The dormitory area houses twelve and includes a kitchen, a study
room, and a lounge. It will be quarters for college students on
work/study projects and visiting scientists.

STAFF

The Center’s full-time staff numbered approximately forty-five at
the close of the fiscal year. Over one-half of these employees are
private employees. Additions to the permanent federal staff in-
cluded Dr. James Lynch, zoologist, and Mr. Gary Chirlen, bio-
logical systems analyst.

Some thirty additional researchers are actively engaged in proj-
ects at the Chesapeake Bay Center, including principal investigators
for the Rhode River Research Program from the Johns Hopkins
University, the University of Maryland, and the United States
Geological Survey.

Fort Pierce Bureau

The scientific objectives of the Smithsonian Institution’s Fort Pierce
Bureau for the next five to ten years was approved on a year-to-year
basis in a Resolution by the Board of Regents during its meeting in
May. The Fort Pierce Bureau has three long-range and interrelated
programs which are designed to understand the estuarine and
marine environments along the east coast of Florida and adjacent
continental shelf and to establish baseline information for measur-
ing natural and man-caused stresses and changes. These are the
Indian River Study, Life Histories Studies, and Submarine Explora-
tion of the East Florida Continental Shelf.

The Indian River Study is a ten-year joint program with the
Harbor Branch Foundation, Inc., to obtain baseline information on
the biota in the Indian River lagoon, environmental quality and
sources of pollution, and a predictive capability of natural and man-
induced changes. Quantitative benthic sampling at seagrass (Halo-
dule wrightii) stations has resulted in almost 50,000 specimens,
which will provide information on community structure. Effects of
predation on the seagrass-associated benthos have been studied by
using field enclosures (cages). A checklist of over 500 fishes from
the Indian River region has been completed, based on 100 con-
tinental-shelf trawling stations and 1000 estuarine seine collec-
tions, along with a literature survey. Fifteen percent of the fishes
sampled have not been recorded previously. Twelve cruises of the
houseboat research laboratory have measured chemical parameters
of the water column along the estuary for fluctuations of major
nutrients, heavy metals, phytoplankton composition, and standing
crop. Indian River Study data from 1383 biological stations, 521
chemical stations, and 75 physical oceanographic stations have been
stored in the Smithsonian’s s—ELGEM data management system in
Washington, D.C., from the remote computer terminal on the
laboratory barge at Fort Pierce.

Objectives of the Life Histories Studies are to obtain baseline
information on reproduction, developmental patterns, and larval
development of common marine organisms in the Indian River and
offshore oceanic waters in the vicinity of Fort Pierce. The knowledge
of these critical phases of development, essential to survival and
dispersal of species, is to be utilized as part of the consortium effort

Science / 81
in the understanding of marine ecosystems and the assessment of
environmental stresses. During the past year studies have con-
centrated on two groups of benthic invertebrates, which form
prominent communities in the Fort Pierce area, sipunculans and
sabellariids. Twenty-four sipunculans have been collected in the
Indian River and adjacent continental shelf, five of which appear
to be previously undescribed species. Observations have been made
on the spawning and breeding seasons of nine species of sipuncu-
lans, including the unusual self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, Themiste
lageniformis, which occurs in densities as great as 500 per square
meter in the Fort Pierce Inlet. Developmental patterns of local spe-
cies vary from direct development with no larval stage, through
those with short-lived swimming larval stages to sipunculans with
long-lived planktonic larval stages. Electron microscopy of larval
cuticle has revealed distinguishing patterns of structure which can
serve to identify planktonic larvae to species. An investigation is
also underway on the role of various substrates in inducing meta-
morphosis of sipunculan larvae.

The Submarine Exploration of the East Florida Continental Shelf
is intended to build an inventory bank of continental-shelf orga-
nisms correlated with environmental and ecological information
with a precision heretofore unavailable by conventional sampling
methods. It is being carried out by the Harbor Branch Foundation.

National Air and Space Museum

The grand event of fiscal year 1975 for the National Air and Space
Museum was the move of the staff from the Arts and Industries
Building to the new museum on Independence Avenue, between
Fourth and Seventh Streets. Construction of the building is com-
plete, and it has been transferred from the General Services Admin-
istration to the Smithsonian. The first aircraft, the Douglas World
Cruiser ‘“Chicago’”’ was moved into the museum in April. The task
is now to fill the museum with educational and interesting exhibits
and artifacts. This assignment, though formidable, will be possible
as a result of a successful Arts and Industries Building exhibits trial
program, which marked the beginning of a most ambitious design
and fabrication program. The program, to provide approximately

200,000 square feet of exhibit space in two calendar years, was
undertaken for a building not to be completed until midway through
the program. To date, the program is on schedule. The July 4, 1976,
targets are: to have all major galleries open and to have between
40 and 50 percent of this space filled with long-term or “core”
exhibit units.

The major exhibits program tasks completed during fiscal year
1975 were:

1. Conclusion of a successful Arts and Industries Building ex-
hibits research and development program toward exhibitions for
the new naso. This included review and subsequent revision of the
exhibit “Air Traffic Control’ to strengthen and to improve its
understandability by unification of design elements and rewriting
of the labeling. The completion of an outside evaluation of the
exhibit “Life in the Universe” resulted in a report which indicates
a high degree of success in terms of public acceptance and under-
standing of the material presented.

2. Exhibits Division design for twenty projects (twelve gallery
exhibit designs and eight exhibits-related designs). Establishment of
standard specifications for contract design of exhibits and for sepa-
rate contracts for fabrication and installation.

3. Evaluation and resulting award of twelve contracts for exhibit
design and four contracts for exhibit fabrication and installation.

4. Research and resulting concept design for the world’s first
museum automatic central control system which led to the award
of a contract to install the highly innovative five megabit multi-
plexing system currently being produced on schedule.

5. Initiation of two functions vital to the long-range exhibits
program and the Bicentennial opening of the new NASM:

a. Provision for basic label production and photoprocessing
of silk screen materials for the Exhibits Division Production Unit,
located at Silver Hill.

b. Establishment of a Media Unit in the Exhibits Division
responsible for presentation of the “message” for overall exhibits.
The tasks include creative writing, film storyboarding, and accom-
panying narratives, film production, all exhibits editorial functions,
and illustration required in all facets of museum exhibits. This Unit
will bridge the gap between the curatorial research and information
input and the design of environmental aspects of exhibits.

HISTORICAL RESEARCH

The research performed by the staff during the year was directed,
for the most part, toward the planning and preparation of exhibits.
The Department of Science and Technology completed scripts for
numerous exhibits including:

“Benefits from Flight’’—this major exhibit portrays the complex
and diverse ways in which air and space flight have affected our
civilization, from important technological developments to broad
cultural changes.

The Department of Aeronautics completed scripts for:

“Air Transportation’”’—this exhibit covers the development and
growth of air transportation, both United States and foreign.

“General Aviation’’—the various facets of general aviation in-
cluding the many types of aircraft and the vast airport network
are featured here.

“Sea-Air Operations’—the hangar deck and other areas of an
aircraft carrier will be recreated in this gallery.

“Balloons and Airships’’—the history of lighter-than-air craft,
including both balloons and airships, is told in this gallery. One
feature is a 30-foot model of the dirigible ““Hindenburg.”

“Exhibition Flight’’—the glamour and excitement of barnstorm-
ing, aerobatics, and air racing are featured in this gallery.

The Department of Astronautics completed scripts for:

“Apollo to the Moon’’—this exhibit depicts United States manned
space flight and lunar exploration; Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo
missions.

“Life in the Universe’’—this exhibit considers the possibility that
life exists beyond the Earth.

“Rocketry and Space Flight’’-—this is an exhibit of the history
and evolution of rocket propulsion, rocket engines, and space suits.

RESTORATION

During fiscal year 1975 the Silver Hill Shops restored nine major
aeronautical artifacts and two major space artifacts—the Jupiter C
and Vanguard Launch Vehicles. In addition, 175 other space arti-
facts were removed from storage, and inspected for exhibit. Twenty
were selected and the necessary restoration was performed.

Over twenty volunteers worked with the regular staff in the
restoration process.

PRESENTATIONS AND EDUCATION DIVISION

During the year the division acquired three additional staff mem-
bers, two of them in the Education Unit and the third in the Space-
arium Unit. Activities centered on planning for the new building in
all of the areas of responsibility: Education, Theater, and Space-
arium.

Education Unit

Two nasm-subject-matter guided school activities were developed
and used to gain experience for the future. One of these titled
“The History of Flight,” a study of the evolution of flight, was
presented to 103 groups. The other, “Space Age,” combined a
planetarium lesson and examination of selected space artifacts. The
planetarium lesson, “The Lunar Experience,” was written and pro-
duced by the division and presented in the Experimentarium located
in the Air and Space Building. This combination of planetarium
lesson and specimen examination proved to be very popular and
received excellent response by the 415 groups involved, verifying
the model of combinations of Spacearium, Theater, and gallery
activities planned for the new museum. In all, approximately 9000
students participated in the guided events.

The Education Unit staff also gained experience in going out to
school classrooms in conjunction with studies related to Nasm. They
also provided special programs of activities at Nasm for Fairfax
County high school students participating in a summer space science
institute, for Civil Air Patrol Cadets, and for 150 elementary school
teachers from California.

NasM’s first Holiday Lecture Series was presented at the Car-
michael Auditorium on December 26, 27, and 28, with about 250
high school students attending each session. The general topic of
the series was “Life in the Universe,” and the speakers were Von
Del Chamberlain of nasm, Cyril Ponnamperuma of the University
of Maryland, and Richard Berendzen of The American University.
The lecture series received enthusiastic response, encouraging its
continuation.

NASM Theater

As the year draws to a close, the nasm Theater nears completion.
The 50-foot by 75-foot screen has been installed, 485 seats have
been attached to the risers, an max projector has been ordered and

scheduled for installation in early 1976, and the sound system is
being described for contract purposes. In addition, the first imax
film for showing to NASM visitors is under production by Francis
Thompson, Inc., of New York City with funding by the Continental
Oil Company. The facility promises to become one of the major
features of public interest on the Mall. It will be used to help tell
the aerospace story to millions of people who visit the Smithsonian.

Spacearium Unit

Public use of the Experimentarium in the Air and Space Building
has ended. Attendance for the year was about 43,000. The facility
will be used for the next few months in developing the first Space-
arium show. The planetarium projector and projection dome will be
removed and used in an exhibit in the new building. Other Experi-
mentarium equipment will be used in the Spacearium.

In June 1975, the Government of the Federal Republic of Ger-
many announced the gift to the American people of a Zeiss Model
VI planetarium projector and funds for an associated automation
system. This equipment is given in honor of the Bicentennial of
the American Revolution, and will reside in the Spacearium of the
National Air and Space Museum. It will help millions of Americans
and visitors from many other countries begin to comprehend the
significance of what they see above the landscape and to judge for
themselves their own relationship to the universe.

The Spacearium theater is rapidly taking form. The seventy-foot-
diameter projection dome is being erected, the lift for the plane-
tarium projector is being completed, and the sound system is being
designed as fiscal year 1975 ends.

Plans are proceeding for the first Spacearium show to be pre-
sented for general visitors. Additional programs are being written
for visiting school classes.

CENTER FOR EARTH AND PLANETARY STUDIES

During its second year of operation, Nasm’s Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies has engaged in several space research projects.
The basic research material is a complete collection of photographs
of the Moon taken both by unmanned probes and by Apollo astro-
nauts. This photographic library was increased by the addition of
a large library of photographs of the Earth taken from orbit. The

88 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Center is also acquiring photographs of Mars and Mercury. Its
research collection will be one of the most complete for compara-
tive planetology in the world.

The major research project of the year was related to the Apollo-
Soyuz Test Project (astr). Dr. Farouk El-Baz, Research Director of
the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, is Principal Investigator
for “Earth Observations and Photography” on this mission. His
research team is comprised of thirty-four experts in the fields of
geology, oceanography, desert study, hydrology, meteorology, and
environmental studies. The purpose of the experiment is to use the
capabilities of the trained astronauts in obtaining scientific data
while in Earth orbit.

The lunar photographic collection of the Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies was used in the selection of photographs for an
Atlas of the Moon to be published by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. As material for scientific research, the
collection was used in global studies of the Moon as well as detailed
investigations of some surface features. The global studies included
mapping of all occurrences of the relatively dark volcanic rock
(basalt) on the Moon to study its distribution and reasons of local-
ization. Also a synthesis was performed of geochemical and geo-
physical data on the east side of the Moon to correlate those with
photogeologic interpretations. A detailed study of sinuous rilles
near the crater Prinz was performed using topographic data. This
study concluded that these rilles emanate from circular depressions
on top of a dome and meander in lower terrain, supporting the idea
that they originated as lava channels.

In cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration the lunar topographic collection was used in connection
with the lunar mapping program to: (1) select areas to be topo-
graphically mapped; (2) select photographs to be used in the mak-
ing of the maps; (3) assign the production priorities based on scien-
tific value and interest; and (4) define the exact borders of map
sheets. The maps which are being produced by the Defense Map-
ping Agency, Topographic Center, are important in both global
studies of the Moon (1:250,000 scale maps) and detailed studies of
particular surface features (1:50,000 and 1:10,000 scale maps).

As a member of the Task Group on Lunar Nomenclature of the
International Astronomical Union, Dr. El-Baz is responsible for

Science / 89
the selection of features to be named on the Moon. Much of the
work necessary for the revision of the lunar nomenclature system
is being made at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies. The
Research Director was also appointed by the Secretary of the
Interior to membership on the Advisory Committee on Extraterres-
trial Features of the United States Board of Geographic Names.

Dr. Farouk El-Baz made a trip to India and the Middle East to
lecture on “Scientific Findings of the Apollo Missions” and “Earth
Observations and Photography on ASTP.”

While in Egypt, he conferred with officials of the Academy of
Scientific Research and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scien-
tific Research concerning a joint project with the Smithsonian. This
project will deal with the ‘Geological Characteristics of the Deserts
of Egypt” and will be based at the Geology Department of the
University of Ain Shams in Cairo. During the ten-day visit, Dr.
El-Baz was received by President Anwar Sadat, who encouraged
the project and emphasized the importance of scientific research in

Egypt.

ART

During fiscal year 1975 a Curator of Art was appointed. Steps were
taken to commission two major pieces of sculpture to be shown
outside the new nasm building at both the Mall and Independence
Avenue entrances. The sculptors, Richard Lippold and Charles
Perry, were selected after an extensive search, which involved rep-
resentatives of the National Gallery of Art and the National Col-
lection of Fine Arts, as well as the Architect and the General
Services Administration.

Arrangements have been made with artists Robert McCall, Eric
Sloane, and Keith Ferris to paint large murals in the NasM. Robert
McCall will depict the Space Flight Environment, Eric Sloane the
Earth Flight Environment and Keith Ferris will render in nearly
full size a portrait of a B-17 Bomber in flight as part of the World
War II exhibition.

During this reporting period, NAsm was offered and accepted the
NASA collection of art which documents many space program activi-
ties. Delivery of hundreds of sketches, drawings, watercolors,
paintings, and sculpture was made and the cataloguing process
started. A selection of pieces from this collection, as well as pieces

This documentary art, along with many other drawings and paint-
ings commissioned by the military services and spanning several
decades, provides a unique record of man’s activities in developing
his ability to fly through air and space. The art work displayed on
opening day will provide a record for the future of some of the
greatest moments of the present through a medium that is as old
as our recorded past—this intimate, human medium of the artist’s
eye and hand.

National Museum of Natural History

The National Museum of Natural History’s service to the public
is a continual commitment that goes back to its founding. The
Museum is proud of its efforts during the past year to keep this
tradition strong and vital. Major projects are underway that will
bring the Museum closer to the people by making its exhibits more
stimulating and informative and by creating a friendly and com-
fortable atmosphere in which the three and a half million visitors
who walk through the Museum every year can find the answers
to their questions about the natural world and their relationship
tO it.

With this end in mind, the Museum’s Exhibits Committee in
February 1975 finished drawing up a long-range plan for the recon-
struction and refurbishment of virtually all of the present halls of
the Museum over the next twenty years. The schedule is for at least
one or two major openings every year. The first of these new halls,
Ice Age Mammals and the Emergence of Man, opened in October
1974. This exhibit’s thematic rigor, cool esthetic ambiance, rich
cross-disciplinary scientific content, and logical positioning of ob-
jects, sets a standard for exhibits that will follow. It is not a hall
dominated by audiovisual techniques or long textual labels; its
message and excitement are in the realism of its objects: the huge
reconstruction of the woolly mammoth that once roamed the
Alaskan tundra, the saber-toothed tiger depicted attacking a giant
ground sloth at the LaBrea tar pits, and the archeological sites
where we see evidence of man’s biological and cultural evolution
during the Ice Age—from a crude circle of rocks constructed almost
two million years ago at Olduvai Gorge in East Africa to the flutes
and ceramic art created 30,000 years ago at Dolni Vestonice in
Central Europe.

Future exhibits will deal with such topics as the dynamics of
organic evolution, cultural adaptation to differing environments,
diversity of life, the evolution of the earth, origin of Western civil-
ization, and evolution of man. Broad concepts of natural history,
most of them related in their content to the major theme of organic
and inorganic evolution, will be constructed in axial halls—the
building’s major architectural spaces. These large halls will be
designed to serve as the public’s major passageways into and
through the Museum.

The Museum foyer’s Bicentennial exhibit, ‘““Our Changing Land,”
is the first of these axial halls to be developed. It does not deal
directly with evolution but will form a base for the understanding
of a projected hall of the Dynamics of Organic Evolution above it
on the first floor. General principles of ecology will be illustrated
in the Bicentennial exhibit by depicting environmental changes that
took place over 10,000 years in a single geographical area of the
country—the Potomac Valley. An escalator is being cut through
the ceiling at the south end of this hall to take the crowds coming
in the Constitution Avenue entrance up into the Rotunda.

The smaller peripheral halls on the Museum’s first and second
floors will be used to provide more detailed information about the
broad conceptual exhibits, as a space for temporary exhibits, and
for a variety of exhibit halls on specific topics. One of these cur-
rently under development and scheduled for opening in the fall of
1975 is a hall devoted to South American anthropology, entitled
South America: Continent and Cultures.

NEW WEST COURT BUILDING

Ground was broken in 1974-1975 on the first major addition to
the Museum building since its east and west wings were added in
the late 1950s and early 1960s. The three-story structure—adding
48,324 square feet of space to the Museum building—will be built
in the Museum’s west courtyard. When it is completed in mid-
1976, there will be a new and enlarged Museum Shop, which will
house a natural science bookstore and a sorely needed public cafe-
teria, that will seat 400 persons.

In the middle level of the new building will be a specimen refer-
ence library that will have natural history collections that can be
handled and studied by interested hobbyists and students. Staffed
by trained volunteer docents, it will serve to bridge the gap that
now exists between the exhibits and the research collection area.

An important facility on the new building’s ground floor, in addi-
tion to staff and Associates cafeterias, will be a school tour recep-
tion and classroom area operated by the Museum’s Office of Educa-
tion. School groups coming into the Museum will go directly to this
area where there will be a lounge to check their coats and bag
lunches. The docent can then give them a brief orientation lecture
before taking them out into the Museum on their tour.

Corporation; Ames T. Wheeler, Treasurer of the Smithsonian; Paul N. Perrot,
Smithsonian’s Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs; and James F. Mello,
NMNH Assistant Director.

During the 1974-1975 year the Office of Education introduced a
number of new programs at the Museum. With the help of a grant
from the Smithsonian Women’s Committee, it instituted programs
that will make many of the Museum’s exhibits, films, and lectures
more enjoyable to the deaf and the blind. Cassette tape players and
embossed maps were made available to the blind and braille labels
were installed in the Museum’s Discovery Room. Interpreters for
the deaf were provided for many of the Museum’s Friday films and
lectures in Baird Auditorium.

PLANS FOR A MUSEUM SUPPORT FACILITY

In February 1975, three of the Museum’s staff, Donald W. Duck-
worth, Frederick J. Collier, and Dieter C. Wasshausen, made a tour
of a number of major European museums to gather information
about methods of modern, high-density storage technology. The
trip was part of a preliminary planning effort being made by the
Museum to prepare for the long-range storage of part of its collec-
tions in the proposed off-Mall Museum Support Facility at the
Smithsonian’s Silver Hill facility, located in the Suitland Federal
Center, Suitland, Maryland. This building will be of immense
future importance to the Museum. It would provide space for ex-
panding collections—which for the past two decades have been
growing at the rate of one million objects and specimens a year—
and it would free valuable space within the Museum for badly
needed exhibits and research functions.

DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY

The prehistory of the Labrador coast was long obscured by a be-
wildering melange of Indian and Eskimo archeological remains that
defied clarification. But now the National Museum of Natural His-
tory’s Dr. William W. Fitzhugh has worked out a framework for
7000 years of that region’s prehistory. He believes that to under-
stand its shifting cultural patterns one must take into account strong
environmental influences that overrode other events.

Dr. Fitzhugh’s first few years of Labrador field work testing this
hypothesis focused on an area along the central coast. The results
were published in Environmental Archeology and Cultural Systems
in Hamilton Inlet, Labrador. During the past two years he has
shifted his attention northward.

The basic cultural adaptions to the Labrador environment are
at times subject to disruptive cultural-historical and ecological
pressures—especially the latter. Climatic controls, operating through
changes in the prevalence of forest fires, winter icing of caribou
feeding grounds, and shifts of sea-ice distribution have caused
ecological crises.

For the Indians in the interior, the icing over of the barren
ground lichen cover or its destruction by fire means the starvation
of the herds of caribou upon which they are dependent. It takes
many years for the caribou herds to rebuild when this happens and

the Indian populations starve because they cannot sustain them-
selves on a year-round basis by hunting other animals and fishing.

Dr. Fitzhugh says that there is evidence that this drastic caribou-
Indian population collapse—which we know occurred in both the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—was a fairly common
occurrence in the prehistory of the Labrador-Quebec peninsula. The
consequence for the famine stricken Indians was often cultural
extinction. Eventually the caribou herds would reestablish, Indian
hunters would drift upward into Labrador from Quebec, and a cul-
ture would form and the cycle would repeat itself.

Labrador’s Eskimo populations were dependent on a diverse ma-
rine ecology that was much more stable than conditions in the
interior. But during very cold periods, when ice pack conditions in
the north made it difficult to hunt along the coast, their populations
shifted southward. This happened most recently in 800-100 B.c.

(the Little Ice Age) when the Eskimo Dorset culture displaced the
Indians from their important fishing territories in southern Labrador.
There was tension and perhaps warfare between the Indians and
Eskimos during this period. The Eskimos would have been at a
tactical disadvantage. The Indian was nomadic and highly mobile
and the permanent Eskimo settlements would have been an easy
target, especially as the Eskimos extended themselves farther and
farther down the coast.

African Ethnology

The Himba are a pastoral cattle-keeping people that live in a harsh
and remote mountainous area of Angola and South West Africa.
Dr. Gordon D. Gibson, the National Museum of Natural History’s
specialist on African ethnology, is studying the life of these people.
Demographic information is one part of this life but it is not easily
accessible because the Himba, like most preliterate peoples, do not
count the years of their lives or the years passed since critical
events. Their time chronology is based on important events or
“epochs” in the region in which they live. Thus, if an investigator
asks a Himba when he was born, he might reply that it was during
the epoch of the locust invasion as readily as we would reply to the
same question with a numerical year, like 1923.

Dr. Gibson found that drought and famine, which are common
to southwestern Angola and South West Africa, are the events
most frequently memorialized in epoch names. Seasons of plentiful
rain are also recalled, as well as pestilences (animal rather than
human), plagues of insects and vermin, wars, problems brought by
administration, magicians, problems (other than wars) concerning
relations with other tribes, acculturative changes, deaths of impor-
tant people, and the abundance of certain wild fruits.

Some events that brought neither bad nor good to the Himba but
were merely remarkable are also found as names of years; for
example, an airplane disaster in the region, a rainy season with
many lightning storms, an abundance of red velvet mites, and the
occasion when the chief of the Ngambwe asked the Himba to kill
a rhinoceros so that he could have shoes made of rhino hide.

Most adult Himbas that Dr. Gibson questioned were able to pro-
vide a sequence of epoch names relating to specific events in their
region, but before a number of these could be combined into a

correctly ordered master list and correlated with European years,
some troublesome obstacles had to be overcome.

Dr. Gibson found that persons from the same area who claim to
be able to recite the names of the years in continuous order gen-
erally do not agree completely, either in the order they give them
or the names of the year included. Names often differed from place
to place also, some having widespread usage while others were very
localized; and there were many synonyms as well as some homon-
ymous year names among the more than 300 epochal names Dr.
Gibson collected.

In spite of these problems, Dr. Gibson was eventually able to
come up with a well-supported sequence for his master list of
epochs. By consulting archival sources he then documented several
of the epochs in the list, so that “tie points” to the Christian years
are not separated by more than about five years. With this list he
can determine with a good degree of approximation Himba indi-
viduals’ current ages and their ages at life crises—data important
for certain kinds of sociological research.

DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY

Cactus plants, once plentiful in desert areas of the United States,
are being hunted and sold in plant shops for large sums of money—
rarer species fetching as much as $300 apiece. As a consequence
botanists fear that they may soon become extinct. They are among
a growing list of native American plants that are vanishing because
of exploitation or because the areas in which they grow are being
destroyed by development. Scientists estimate that about 10 percent
of the total flora in the United States is either endangered or
threatened.

In September 1974, Dr. Edward S. Ayensu, Chairman of the
National Museum of Natural History’s Botany Department, con-
vened an international meeting of botanists and administrators
at American Horticultural Society headquarters, Mount Vernon,
Virginia. He was acting in accordance with Congress’ 1973 En-
dangered Species Act, which requested that the Secretary of the
Smithsonian, in conjunction with other affected organizations, begin
reviewing the species of plants which are now or may become
endangered or threatened and methods of adequately conserving
such species.

Science / 103
Attending the meeting were representatives of the Departments
of Interior and Agriculture, Council on Environmental Quality,
National Science Foundation, Nature Conservancy, and a number
of universities and botanical gardens. Foreign representatives were
also present, including Dr. J. K. Morton of Canada, chairman of
the committee on Rare and Endangered Species in the Canadian
Flora, and Grenville Lucas, Royal Botanic Gardens, England,
Threatened Plant Committee, Secretary, International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

Nine recommendations, compiled under Dr. Ayensu’s super-
vision, were subsequently submitted to Congress in a report by
Secretary Ripley. Sent to Congress with the recommendations was
a list of about 750 endangered and 1200 threatened plants in the
mainland United States. A separate list of over 1000 endangered
or threatened kinds for Hawaii was also included. These species,
either very rare or with local or limited distribution, are subject to
threats, or are heavily depleted by destruction of habitats or by
commercial or private collectors.

The report was the first organized attempt to produce a list of
threatened and endangered species for the entire United States.
Museum of Natural History botanists realize that this is only a
start, but a continued program is proposed to review and assess
natural areas that contain endangered and threatened plant species.

Pollen Research

Dr. Joan W. Nowicke, whose speciality is the study of pollen
grains, is part of an international group which is gathering scien-
tific data on one of the most unusual and controversial groups of
flowering plants, the Order Centrospermae. This Order has at least
10,000 species distributed among eleven families including the
cactus, pokeweed, four-o’clock, cockscomb, and carnation families
and several others. Studies have shown that nine of this Order’s
eleven families have a unique red pigment, the nitrogen-containing
betacyanins which substitute for the anthocyanin pigments found
in other flowering plants.

Part of the controversy is over whether the two families without
betacyanins should be included in this Order. In examining the
pollen grains of more than 200 species Dr. Nowicke has found that
the vast majority of the grains in the betacyanin families and the

two disputed families have the same surface patterns. Thus pollen
morphology supports a close tie between the betacyanin families
and the two anthocyanin families. Using the result of the study as
a base, Dr. Nowicke is surveying the pollen surface patterns of
families which are thought to be related or derived from the Cen-
trospermae, and thus far it appears that no other flowering plants
branched off from the Centrospermae group.

DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY

“Where Have All the Ground Beetles Gone?” was the title of a
lecture given last year by Dr. Terry Erwin at the National Museum
of Natural History. Only a handful of scientists in the world are
as well qualified as he is to address such a question even though
the ground beetle family (Carabidae) is the third largest family of
beetles (40,000+ species).

Dr. Erwin’s field observations at the Smithsonian Tropical Re-
search Institute’s (str1) Barro Colorado Island have given him evi-
dence that ground beetles moved from tropical wetlands—the “‘boil-
ing pot” for their evolution—in an ecological progression from the
wetlands onto the forest floor, then into the forest undercanopy,
and finally upward into the treetops. He has pioneered in tracing
the specialized tropical life cycles developed by the beetles on the
forest floor and undercanopy and plans future work at str1 and
elsewhere that will eventually take him on eighty-foot-high cat-
walks so that he can study life in the treetops. There is an urgency
to this project because when the forests are cut, as is happening in
Latin America, hundreds of these forest top species are irretrievably
lost.

The National Museum of Natural History has a half-million
ground beetles in its collections, making it probably second in size
only to the British Museum. When Dr. Erwin came to NMNH in
1971 he found these collections poorly organized because no ground
beetle specialist had ever been employed at the Museum before.
He has since sorted all of these specimens to tribe level, and many to
generic and species level. The wealth of data available in the col-
lections and the opportunity to work at str1 launched him into a
massive systematic study of the ground beetles of Central America.

When completed, this study will cover more than 2000 species,
probably 40 percent of them undescribed in scientific literature.

Science / 107
All of the natural history and geographical information on each
species is being computerized by Dr. Erwin’s wife La Verne, who
is a full partner in the project and will co-author the six-volume
study. Heretofore, projects one-third this size have taken from
twenty-five to thirty years but computerization will enable them to
finish it in a fourth of the time.

The computer will be able to generate ground beetle distribution
maps and keep them updated as new material is acquired; and make
it possible to correlate faster than ever before such specimen-
related data as altitude, range, plant association, parasites, and so
on. Up to sixty categories of data are being fed into the computer
for each newly acquired specimen, as compared to an average of
only fifteen recorded for older specimens.

The Erwins have designed each volume to be a systematic study
with much natural history data included which can be used by
amateurs or mathematical ecologists to simply identify specimens
or to seek geographical and ecological data. And from volume six,
the all-important faunal analysis, people will be able to learn where
all the ground beetles have gone.

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

At the National Museum of Natural History a great deal of
interest in Ascension Island’s invertebrate animals has been stimu-
lated by a field trip made there in 1971 by Dr. Raymond B. Man-
ning, a specialist in decapods (an order of crustaceans that includes
shrimps, lobsters, and crabs). Like earlier scientists, he was inter-
ested in Ascension’s land crabs. But casting his net over a wider
area, he took the opportunity to make an intensive survey of the
marine life in the Island’s lava tidal pools and shallow shore waters.

Because of Ascension’s isolation and relative geological youth—
estimates of its age make it no older than one million years—it is
an excellent natural laboratory on which one can study where its
marine animals originated, how this life was dispersed and carried
to Ascension by currents and other means, and what adaptions it
has made to its environment since its arrival.

An example of the Island’s puzzling fauna, collected by Dr.
Manning in two tidal pools on the western edge of the Island,
were two unusual shrimps, one unique in being clawless and lack-
ing sexual modifications. In the report on the two shrimps, written

with his colleague Dr. Fenner A. Chase, Jr., Two New Caridean
Shrimps, One Representing a New Family, from Marine Pools on
Ascension Island, the NMNH scientists noted that one of the shrimps
had relatives living in subterranean fresh water habitats in the West
Indies and Galapagos Islands whereas the other one had no obvious
close relatives. Within a year a relative of the latter shrimp was
found in a similar habitat, a saltwater pool in a lava flow, in Hawaii.
How two very similar species of the same genus came to occupy
the same habitats in such widely separated areas remains an in-
triguing mystery.

Drs. Manning and Chace are now engaged in completing their
study of the more than forty other species of decapods collected
by Dr. Manning on Ascension, based on samples taken from a
variety of shallow-water habitats there. Dr. Joseph Rosewater has
recently published a survey of the Ascension mollusks collected by
Dr. Manning An Annotated List of the Marine Mollusks of Ascen-
sion Island, South Atlantic Ocean, and Dr. David L. Pawson is
studying the echinoderms Dr. Manning brought back. The deep-
water fauna off Ascension remains poorly known.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL SCIENCES

“The ocean is almost like a mirror today—almost glassy smooth,
like a great quiet lake. An intense morning—looking at our longest
core so far—core 44—7.1 meters of gloriously interesting material.
All is well! All is delightful for Leg 37” so wrote Dr. William
Melson, Chairman of the NMNH Department of Mineral Sciences,
who spent part of last year on board the U. S. Research Vessel
Glomar Challenger, the ship that for six years has been circling
the earth, relentlessly drilling and coring the ocean floor for scien-
tific purposes.

This notation in his log was written the day the drill reached 563
meters (about 1800 feet) on its way to an historic 1910-foot pene-
tration of the ocean floor.

It was to be the deepest of five borings made during Leg 37 in
1600 feet of water at sites off the Azores near the Mid-Atlantic
ridge. Each of the five holes—measuring 333, 405, 1102, 1092, and
1912 feet—exceeded the previous record penetration into the vol-
canic rocks beneath the ocean floor. The five borings yielded more
than 3000 core samples of igneous and sedimentary rock, which

Science / 111
are now undergoing laboratory analysis at the Smithsonian and
other major research centers in the United States, Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, Canada, France, Germany, and Great Britain.

Earlier legs of the Glomar Challenger had only sought to bring
up cores of the sediment layers that overlie the hard rocks of the
ocean floor. These have given an immense amount of paleonto-
logical information about the early history of the earth. On Leg 37,
however, the Glomar Challenger had for the first time directed its
capabilities at the ocean’s basement rock.

Its probes made it possible to study how crust forms during sea
floor spreading. The data from Leg 37’s sites confirmed that the sea
floor is spreading from the Mid-Atlantic rift at the rate of 1.1
centimeters a year a few hundred miles south of the Azores. The
scientists were also able to see what is happening deep inside the
earth’s mantle, locate mineral and oil deposits in the oceanic crust,
and study the origin of the magnetic strips below the earth’s ocean
basins and past reversals of the earth’s magnetism.

Dr. Melson was cruise co-chief scientist with Dr. Fabrizio
Aumento of Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
Assisted by information provided by the thirteen other scientists
comprising the international crew, they made such critical decisions
as the exact location of the drill sites.

DEPARTMENT OF PALEOBIOLOGY

In late January 1975 in the cattle ranching country of northern
Queensland, Australia, paleobotanist Dr. Francis Hueber pried out
of a low sandstone ledge the fossilized remains of a 360-million-
year-old Devonian plant. It was the best preserved specimen found
of this Devonian genus and for Dr. Hueber it was a major stride
forward on a project that began seventeen years ago.

Back in 1958 he had collected four or five isolated fragments of
the same genus in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Unfortunately,
the fragments, which, oddly, were starshaped in cross section, were
not large and complete enough to indicate much about the plant.
More fossil material was needed. Because it was unlikely that any
more would turn up in New York, Australia seemed to be the best
place to look, since a piece of the same genus had been found
there in the nineteenth century at a site on the Fanning River in
northern Queensland.

112 / Smithsonian Year 1975
It was nine years before Dr. Hueber was able to get to Australia.
When he did it was to collect fossil material in the State of Victoria
connected with research he was doing on other Devonian plants.
But he took the opportunity to go north for a few days and locate
the site on the Fanning River. In Devonian times the area appar-
ently had been a great river delta near the ocean,and trees and other
plants had floated down river and sunk into the delta sands and
muds. Dr. Hueber hastily surveyed the area’s sandstone formations
and was encouraged when he found more scraps of the fossil. The
material that he was able to collect turned out to be rather poorly
preserved but revealed the fact that the plant instead of being
herbaceous of habit was in truth a tree. But another problem arose
—were the star-shaped strands of wood the tree’s roots or branches?
The anatomy of the trunk was of a complex nature and did not give
clear evidence for orientation of the specimens. Therefore, which
way was up?

In 1970, Dr. Hueber returned to northern Queensland after Don
Wyatt, an Australian geologist, wrote that high water in the Fan-
ning River area had cleared a mudstone layer in which two masses
of the fossilized tree he was looking for were exposed. The geolo-
gist had interpreted the fossils as the tops of the trees with their
branches spread out through the matrix. Dr. Hueber collected a
considerable amount of the fossil material but when he got it back
to the Museum found it useless in solving the problem. The tree
fragments had so badly rotted before fossilization that it was im-
possible to determine clearly the orientation of the specimens.

It was on his third trip in 1975 that Dr. Hueber and Don Wyatt
discovered the key 8-inch by 11-inch chunk of log weathering out
of the sandstone ledge. Though it has not yet been cut into sections
at the Museum and studied, Dr. Hueber is reasonably certain that
the anatomy of the specimen is intact and that the orientation of
the specimen indicates that the star-shaped strands are the tree’s
roots.

Importantly in tracing the early evolution of the plant kingdom
this discovery marks a point in geologic time at which roots can be
defined as an integral part of the plant body. Most land plants
during the Devonian Period (which began 395 million years ago)
relied upon the absorptive abilities of their stems which trailed
along or were partially buried in the muds and swampy soils of the

evolved over a period of about twenty-five million years and the
plant Dr. Hueber is studying represents one of those very early
plants in which the differentiation of the plant body into stem and
root was achieved. It marks an important step in the history of the
plant kingdom.

DEPARTMENT OF VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Dr. Richard Thorington continued his studies on troops of howler
monkeys on Barro Colorado Island at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute. The monkeys usually can be located by their
strong smell and noisy chorus. A troop’s eighteen monkeys move
slowly along through the treetops, feeding on the fruit of fig and
hog plum trees and roaring and howling at any stranger who dares
invade their territorial area.

Many studies of the social behavior of the Barro Colorado howl-
ers have been made, dating back to the work of Dr. C. R. Carpenter
in the 1930s, but Dr. Thorington is the first scientist to undertake
a study of their long-term population dynamics and the factors that
influence it.

An anesthesia dart-gun is used to get the monkeys out of the
trees. When they wobble and fall they are caught in a net and then
morphological measurements, toothcasts, fingerprints, blood sam-
ples, and biopsies are quickly taken. Before they are released white
bands are freeze branded on their tails so that they can be identi-
fied in the future for recapture. More than forty howlers have been
marked in this way since 1972, when the study began.

The project has already yielded interesting information. Chromo-
some analysis of tissue cultures sent to Dr. Ma and Dr. Jones at
Harvard’s New England Regional Primate Research Center, shows
that there is an odd translocation of a Y chromosome in the male
howler over to one of the (nonsex bearing) autosomes. This gives
the female 54 chromosomes to the male’s 53; and the patterning
of footprints, fingerprints, and tailprints of the Barro Colorado
howlers and those of Costa Rica have been found to be curiously
different. Dr. Thorington and Dr. Jefferey Froehlich (at that time,
a postdoctoral student) are studying this patterning to see if there
is any basic genetic difference in the two monkey populations.

One of the howler monkeys in a troupe on Barro Colorado Island studied by
Dr. Richard Thorington. Below: Dr. Thorington measuring the circumference
of one of the trees where the howler monkeys feed. Such data is used in the
study which correlates productivity of the forest with fluctuations in the
monkey population.

Most of Dr. Thorington’s findings will come in over a much
longer term because howler monkeys live for a long time, perhaps
twenty years. Gradually he is documenting life spans, death rates,
and the frequency of births to different aged females.

By marking and mapping the trees in the forest that the monkeys
use—and studying the trees’ flowering, fruiting, and leafing cycles
—Dr. Thorington hopes to obtain indices of the annual produc-
tivity of the forest and find what impact its fluctuations have on
the monkey population.

Results of the research have indicated a long-term stability of
food resources. In 1955 there was a study of where the monkeys
moved and where they fed. Many of the trees are the exact same
ones in which the howlers feed today. Over a twenty-year period
the distribution of resources appears to have changed little. This is
an important factor in the social life of these monkeys, as well.

But there are gradual inexorable changes occurring in the mon-
keys’ habitat. Botanists who have examined the Island’s fig and hog
plum trees for Dr. Thorington have noted that the trees do not
seem to be producing seedlings, which leads him to believe that the
main food supply of the howlers is going to become less and less
abundant in the years ahead.

Yellow fever has the potential of causing a swift and devastating
impact on the monkey population. Dr. Thorington in collaboration
with the Middle American Research Unit (Maru) has been able to
establish that howlers do not have antibodies to this disease. In
1949, the last time yellow fever swept through the Central Ameri-
can forests, it killed up to 75 percent of the Island’s monkeys.
Since then the Island howler population has increased from 250 in
1951 to 800 in 1959 and in the last eight years has risen to 1500.
But in 1974-1975 yellow fever cases have been reported again in
the forest, spreading toward the Canal Zone, and Dr. Thorington
is afraid that an epidemic could strike Barro Colorado Island.

National Zoological Park

In the Orient, this is the year of the hare. The past year at the
National Zoological Park could be well called the year of the cater-
pillar—tractor that is. The highest visible sign of activity to the
visitors and the staff has been the construction program throughout
the Zoo. One-third of the exhibition areas have been in the process
of renovation. The lion and tiger exhibits have grown from a hole
in the ground to a recognizable structure. One can now see the
outline of the walls, moats, and the viewing areas. Internally, the
quarters for the big cats are evolving in an orderly fashion from
the beginning of seeming chaos. Delays from strikes and weather
have occurred but it is now hoped that occupancy and dedication
will take place about Easter of 1976.

The occupants of the elephant house suffered the most incon-
venience for they were confined to their quarters almost the entire
year while their outside yards were being enlarged by a factor of
three. The visitor has had on display the lumbering antics of bull-
dozers, backhoes, cranes, and cement trucks accompanied by their
frantic hard-hatted keepers. They have pushed their work so that
the giraffes were returned to their outside yard five months ahead
of the contract completion date. When the outside doors were
finally opened, the giraffes gazed out on their new yards, which are
five times larger than their previous inadequate space, for three
days. Finally, the late afternoon the third day the young colt which
had been born in late spring ventured out and was quickly followed
by his mother and the other giraffes. For the first time in the history
of the Zoo, the giraffes have enough space to run, kick up their
heels, and frolic. The sight of these graceful animals cantering is
indeed a reward for the months of planning, contract negotiations,
confinement, and general inconvenience to the visitors. The giraffes
are viewed behind a low moat. The path around the yard extends
up on a low hillock to the north of the building so that the visitors
actually have a giraffe eye-level view of these graceful animals.
Also completed were the new pygmy hippopotamus yards which
are the same size as previously but have a new moat system and
outside pools. It is anticipated that shortly the Indian elephants will
have the use of their new yard with its much enlarged bathing
pool and that by Thanksgiving of 1975 the hippopotamuses,

Science / 119
African elephant, and Indian rhinoceroses will be enjoying spacious
outside quarters.

The level plaza surrounding the bird house is being completely
redeveloped for three new duck ponds in front of the building,
crane yards on the left, new flamingo pool, and exhibit behind in
additional small cages scattered throughout the area. The project
has been divided into two phases. Roughly half of the work is to be
completed before the second half starts so that the birds are not
completely removed from their homes. Visitors arrive at the side
entrance to the bird house after passing the old eagle cage on the
right and the new waterfowl pond construction on the left. The
breeding pair of American bald eagles rather disdainfully super-
vised the work in progress. They did take time off to build a nest
and lay two eggs but, unfortunately, the eggs did not hatch. With
good luck and fair weather the project will be completed about
Thanksgiving of 1975.

Remodeling of the 1904 monkey house, as described in Smith-
sonian Year 1974, was completed early in the winter and the
cage decorations were assembled. Because it is so difficult to dup-
licate natural trees in such a manner that the animals cannot
destroy them with their ingenious minds and busy fingers, it was
decided that the timbers developed in the past few years for chil-
dren’s playground equipment would be used. The monkey habits,
whether they be climbing, jumping, leaping, or swinging were taken
into consideration and a specific design was made for each species.
The swinging monkeys, such as the spider monkey, have plenty of
ropes to swing from while the leaping monkeys, like the colobus,
have platforms on which to bounce back and forth. Altogether it
has produced a very active exhibit which is pleasing to the visitors.
Zoo personnel are highly pleased that the monkeys accepted their
new furniture with joyous abandon. Despite an aggressive, com-
petent, supple minded, and knowledgeable staff, it is with trepida-
tion that we attempt to predict the behavior of animals. It is very
heart warming to have the monkeys’ approval of our plans and
efforts.

The first Smithsonian Associates Women’s Committee auction
in mid-May of this year marked the official dedication and opening
of the monkey house. Following a delightful meal served in the
newly refurbished center of the old building, items and services

are two-inch thick manila rope. All the cages in the Monkey House have
been designed with special features for the specific monkeys involved.

were spiritedly bid for by a distinguished company of humans. One
of the elderly and distinguished colobus monkeys was heard to com-
ment that even for the sake of education he would never make a
human out of himself. All in all,the monkeys seemed to enjoy the
evening with slightly blase tolerant amusement. The visiting public
has expressed great pleasure in the “new” old monkey house, com-
menting that the lowered cage floors give good visibility to small
children and that the plateglass does not obstruct the viewing. The
monkeys are appreciative of the fact that they no longer have to
smell human beings.

In addition to the three major pieces of construction all through
the Zoo there have been smaller jobs being accomplished prepara-
tory for the Bicentennial year. At the year’s end, one dozen projects
were underway and on target, with twice as many due to be active

122 / Smithsonian Year 1975

by late fall. Work is now in progress on ramps for the small
mammal house and reptile house. When these are completed, all
exhibits will be accessible to wheel chairs and baby carriages.

Since the Zoo has changed its contracting practices to one of
direct contracting rather than, as formerly, through the General
Services Administration, the workload has increased tremendously.
The Zoo was fortunate in having Mr. Robert C. Engle join the staff
as engineer and Mr. Fred Barwick as Zoo contracting officer.

CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH CENTER,
FRONT ROYAL, VIRGINIA

On June 22, 1975, the General Services Administration transferred
some 3100 acres of magnificent fields, forest, pasture, springs, and
farm structures to the Smithsonian Institution, thus making official
and legal the Zoo’s tenancy at the old cavalry remount station at
Front Royal. Previously, the Zoo had been occupying and develop-
ing this area under a use permit. Dr. Christen M. Wemmer, who
joined the Zoo staff from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, heads up
the Center ably and is enthusiastically assisted by fifteen employees,
some of whom were previously state or federal agricultural em-
ployees and are continuing their long careers at the site. Together
they have established successful farming, maintenance, and animal
management programs. Last year two large pastures were enclosed
and one of the old horse barns refurbished. This year two addi-
tional horse barns were refurbished and four more large pastures
were enclosed. Now in residence are Felds deer, bongo, kangaroo,
zebra (two foals born), bactrian camels, rheas, as well as the scimi-
tar horn oryx and Pere David deer which were established last
year. In cooperation and conjunction with the newly formed Minne-
sota State Zoological Garden at Minneapolis, eight bactrian camels
were secured and are now in residence at the Center. Maria, our
female bactrian camel, returned to us from Cleveland bringing her
consort, Jimmy. Early this spring one of the new females produced
a lovely, if somewhat grotesque, calf.

Dr. D. Kleiman planned a facility at one of the barns in the cen-
tral part of the Center’s campus for a comparative canid behavior
study. The cages for maned wolves, bush dogs, and crab-eating
foxes have been constructed and presently two pairs of maned
wolves are in residence and under study. These animals were

Science / 123
secured through the cooperation of Brazilian officials and Dr. Mario
Autuori of the Sao Paulo Zoo. The study of these animals, with
particular emphasis on their social and reproductive behavior, will
continue for several years.

Besides maintaining the present facility and producing 300 tons
of hay for general Zoo use, exciting plans and programs are being
formulated for the Center’s future development.

OFFICE OF ANIMAL MANAGEMENT

The most notable event for the Office of Animal Management was
the hatching of a kiwi chick early in the year. This is the first time
that this New Zealand bird has hatched outside of New Zealand
and Australia. The incubation period is uncertain although reported
to be fifty days. The male, who incubates the egg, hid the egg for
a time, and the office was only aware of its presence for the twenty
days prior to its hatching. Great consternation prevailed since there
was no knowledge of how to feed the young chick; finally it was
decided to double the amount of feed being fed to the adults and
hope for the best. Fortunately, the male instructed the young chick
in the proper methods of feeding and under this regimen it has
thrived and grown mightily. The female pays little or no attention
to either the egg or her offspring, leaving everything after egg-
laying entirely up to the cock.

The lesser pandas produced a litter of four kits, which means
that these animals are now breeding into the second generation.
It is hoped a strong breeding colony of this charming Asiatic animal
can be established.

The nene geese, inspired by the example of the previous years,
decided to outdo themselves this year. Between February and March
nineteen goslings were hatched from the eggs of three laying pairs.
At one time the Zoo’s exhibit consisted of twenty-eight of this
highly endangered Hawaiian state bird.

The Utah prairie dogs produced ten babies this year. The Office
of Animal Management completed its studies of these animals and
contemplates sending them to the University of Utah for additional
observations.

The white tiger cubs, reported last year at Cincinnati, continue to
thrive. They are straight-legged, big-boned, husky young cubs, and
are expected to be returned to Washington, D.C., next Easter.

The first kiwi ever hatched and reared outside of its native New Zealand, except for
Australia, was an outstanding event for the National Zoo. After the female lays the
egg she has no further interest in it and the egg is incubated for a period of 75-80
days by the male. The chick was named Toru, the Maori word for “three.” Photo:

In keeping with the Zoo’s plans and responsibility toward the
animal kingdom, animals continue to be paired by sending them
out on breeding loan to other zoos. At the present time thirty-two
mammals, eight reptiles, and numerous birds are deposited in other
zoos. Cooperation among all zoos in the United States is growing.
More and more emphasis is being placed on replacement of zoo
stock by zoo breeding and interexchange of animals.

The Office of Animal Management, under general curator Jaren
Horsley, is continuing efforts to enrich contributions to animal-
keeping and to broaden representation in the ranks with the hiring
of ten women animal-keepers. Curatorial involvement in animal-
exhibit planning resulted in excellent cage furnishing of the monkey
house. Research activities increased in the office with two papers
given by animal-keepers at professional meetings and with the
addition to the staff of a herpetologist, Dr. Dale Marcellini, who will
develop the research programs based on the collection.

The most distressing death during the year was that of the large,
old male komodo dragon, Kalana, who had been in residence for
five years. During the past few months he failed noticeably, losing
weight, and decreasing in activity. It was finally determined that
euthanasia would be best for the animal. Post mortem revealed
that he had a growth on the heart valve which produced a valvular
insufficiency, with the associated backup of blood and circulatory
deficiencies common in this condition.

The giant pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, continue to be a
main visitor attraction. This past April the young female came into
heat for the third year. As reported last year, expectations of having
a successful breeding were high. Unfortunately, the male was still
not physically mature during this meeting. We hope the next meet-
ing in April will prove successful.

OFFICE OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH

The year for the Office of Zoological Research has been most pro-
ductive. Previous programs and studies have continued with some
major additions. In the fall of 1974, final plans were made with
Venezuelan scientists to inaugurate a program of field studies in
vertebrate behavior and ecology in conjunction with Venezuelan
researchers and students. Dr. G. G. Montgomery visited Venezuela

126 / Smithsonian Year 1975

in June and July and radio-tracked both the giant anteaters and
golden anteaters on the ranch of a Venezuelan collaborator, Sr.
Tomas Blomh. In January Dr. Eisenberg and Dr. Marcellini under-
took preliminary field investigations on herpetological and mam-
malian studies. In March Dr. Eisenberg and Dr. Eugene Morton
continued the field research undertaken in January by Dr. Eisen-
berg. In June Dr. Eisenberg and two graduate students spent con-
siderable time in the field working on the general problems and
specifically that of the small mammals. It is anticipated that the
work in Venezuela will continue for several years and should prove
extremely fruitful.

Dr. Devra Kleiman of the research staff has started a study in
the communications and reproduction behavior of South American
canids. This animal group provides a variety of social organization
(e.g., the maned wolf is a solitary animal, the crab-eating foxes
live in pairs, and the third individual to be studied, the bush dog,
lives in family groups or small packs); a difference in physical size;
and a separation in geography. Cage facilities have been con-
structed at the Front Royal Conservation and Research Center and
two pairs of maned wolves are now in residence and under study.

Dr. Eugene Morton joined the Office of Zoological Research this
past fiscal year as staff ornithologist. Dr. Morton has previously
worked at Smithsonian facilities in Panama and the Chesapeake
Bay Center on behavior and vocalization of avifauna. Currently,
Dr. Morton is working in Venezuela and at Front Royal, where he
has initiated studies on bluebirds and turkey vultures.

W. P. Dittus received his Ph.D. in August 1974 on work done
in Sri Lanka on the tocque macque. Dr. Dittus, at that time a mem-
ber of the research department staff, is presently continuing his
work in Sri Lanka under the auspices of the Max Planck Institute.

In April, Victoria Guerrero received her Ph.D. degree on studies
concerning the hormone control of courtship behavior in the green
acouchi. All of her investigative work was done at the Zoo.

In May 1975, Dr. Montgomery chaired a conference on arboreal-
folivore at Front Royal. The conference gathered together thirty
international scientists to discuss the impact of vertebrate and
invertebrate feeding on the leaves of the tropical forest and the
co-evolution of animals and plants in the tropical forest. The pro-

Science / 127
ceedings of the conference will be published later as part of the
Smithsonian series.

Under the joint auspices of the National Zoological Park and the
National Institutes of Health, about forty scientists participated in
a conference on the behavior and neurology of lizards held at Front
Royal in May 1975.

OFFICE OF ANIMAL HEALTH AND PATHOLOGY

Work in this department has continued with daily treatment and
disease investigation throughout the Zoo. Studies described in last
year’s annual report have continued. Dr. Robert M. Sauer resigned
as pathologist and has been replaced by Dr. R. Montali, from Johns
Hopkins University.

Of interest was the initiation of a cooperative study with Dr.
U. S. Seal, of the Veterans Hospital in Minneapolis, on contraceptive
techniques in lions and other cats. Dr. Gray and Dr. Bush have
participated in this project, most of the work being done at the Lion
Country Safari at Doswell, Virginia. The study will continue for the
next several years.

A veterinary intern position was established. This will be a fif-
teen-month appointment with the purpose of giving practical
clinical experience to young veterinarian graduates wishing to
specialize in exotic animal medicine. Dr. P. K. Ensley has been
appointed to fill the first internship.

The program of seminars, as described in last year’s annual
report, continues with growing success and participation by veter-
inarians associated with exotic animal medicine in the eastern region
of the United States.

Probably the most noteworthy activity for the Office of Animal
Health and Pathology occurred this late spring and early summer
when there was a sudden outbreak of duck viral enteritis in the
waterfowl ponds. An early diagnosis was made in cooperation with
the Wildlife Disease Laboratories of the United States Department
of Interior. Through the cooperation and assistance of the United
States Department of Agriculture and the Cornell School of Veter-
inary Medicine, vaccine was obtained and promptly administered.
The outbreak was held to a loss of some forty birds. There has
been no recurrence since the waterfowl collection was completely
vaccinated. It is perhaps too soon to feel that all danger is over;

128 / Smithsonian Year 1975
however, it does appear that this disease has been brought under
control by the alert veterinary staff, the early diagnosis, and the
preventative vaccination of the entire collection.

VISITOR SERVICES

The recently created Office of Education and Information is build-
ing into the Zoo’s visitor programs new dimensions in visitor
learning and is guiding the Friends of the National Zoo in their
active volunteer guide and docent program.

The Office of Graphics and Exhibits undertook a wide-ranging
program, highlighted by developing a new standard identification
label and the counseling of designers on the new graphics master
plan for the Zoo. This plan will go into production in 1976 with
a unique trail system for visitors.

In the Office of Protective Services a new health and safety unit
was formed to focus on Zoo needs for improved visitor and em-
ployee safety. New leadership of the police unit has emphasized
officer training and service to visitors.

In the central support group, the Office of Facilities Management
continued to advance the skill levels of employees. A helpers’ train-
ing program was put into effect under capable management, giving
unskilled employees an opportunity to progress in mechanical
abilities, thereby enabling them to compete for positions as skilled
tradesmen in the future. Maintenance programs were expanded,
with the custodial force assuming responsibility for cleaning the
public areas in the animal exhibit buildings; this action released the
keepers for attention to the collections. Great credit must be given
to the skill and devotion of the excellent trade and craft employees,
who maintained the Zoo in an orderly fashion despite the disrup-
tion caused by the construction program.

ADMINISTRATION

At the core of the Zoo’s administrative operation is a small but
highly effective management services unit. The main emphasis of
this office is to help develop administrative control and understand-
ing within each Zoo office by assisting with good central informa-
tion and guidance. There was an overall step-up in staff education
efforts with more than a threefold increase in employee participa-
tion in training over fiscal year 1973. During the year, 118 em-

Science / 129
ployees accomplished 191 educational improvement experiences.
Major emphasis is being made to increase knowledge and skill by
wider participation in this educational program through all areas
of the Zoo. Such noteworthy successes in management, throughout
the Zoo, left the Office of the Director free to concentrate on the
broader problems of guidance and overall management.

As noted earlier in this report, construction was visually domi-
nant within the Zoo in fiscal year 1975. Plans are proceeding for
construction next year in the peripheral areas of the Zoo and the
eventual complete modernization of the entire Zoo. Despite the
turmoil, 1975 has been a busy and exciting year with many notable
advances. The Zoo is anticipating a Bicentennial year that is mean-
ingful and educational for all its visitors.

Office of International Programs

The Office of International Programs provides support to United
States institutions of research and higher learning, including the
Smithsonian, through Foreign Currency Program grants; provides
for the rapid communication of data on natural and environmental
phenomena of short duration through the Center for Short-Lived
Phenomena; provides assistance to Peace Corps environmental and
natural resources programs; and provides liaison services and
assistance in foreign affairs for other offices of the Smithsonian.

SMITHSONIAN FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards grants
to support the basic research interests of American institutions,
including the Smithsonian, in those countries where the United
States holds blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of
surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. The Pro-
gram is active in countries where the Treasury Department deems
United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of normal
federal requirements, including at present India, Pakistan, Egypt,
Tunisia, and Poland. The Smithsonian received a fiscal year 1975
appropriation of $2 million in “excess’’ currencies which was used
to grant support to over seventy-five projects in the disciplines of

130 / Smithsonian Year 1975
archeology and the anthropological sciences, systematic and en-
vironmental biology, astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum-
related fields. Since its inception in fiscal year 1966, the srcp has
awarded more than $26 million in foreign currency grants to some
eighty-seven institutions in thirty-two states and the District of
Columbia. Within the framework of the program, the Smithsonian
this year made a second contribution of $1 million in support of
international efforts to save the submerged temples at Philae, Egypt.
The srcp participated in interagency negotiations leading to the
establishment of a United States-Polish Joint Board to fund scien-
tific and technical cooperation. This Joint Board, similar in purpose
to the United States-Yugoslav Joint Board, makes it possible to
extend the period for which Polish funds will be available for
research under the srcp.

INTERNATIONAL LIAISON SECTION

The International Liaison Section (11s) provides liaison and assist-
ance to individuals and units of the Smithsonian in dealing with
the Department of State and with foreign governments. It handles
international matters involving travel and research abroad, and
foreign participation in domestic programs of the Smithsonian. 11s
provides passport and visa services for Smithsonian staff, and
assists in research arrangements for foreign visitors. 11s has been
working closely with the Division of Performing Arts in arranging
Bicentennial-related foreign participation in the Festival of Ameri-
can Folklife, and has been involved with foreign participation in
other special Bicentennial activities of the Institution.

CENTER FOR SHORT-LIVED PHENOMENA

The Center operates a worldwide electronic alert system for rapid
communication of scientific data on phenomena of short duration
involving significant changes in biological, ecological, and geo-
physical systems, including rare or unusual animal migrations,
population changes, major floods, forest fires, volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, landslides; pollution events such as oil and chemical
spills, gas and radioactive substance leaks; and occasional astro-
physical events such as meteorite falls and fireballs. During the
year, the Center reported 235 short-lived events that occurred in
forty-five countries, islands, and ocean areas. Scientific field teams

Science / 131
investigated 160 of the events. The reporting network consists of
2874 scientists, scientific research institutions, and field stations in
185 countries, and is augmented by an International Environmental
Alert Network of 60,000 secondary school and university students
in 691 schools in the United States and twenty-three other coun-
tries.

PEACE CORPS ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM

The Smithsonian-Peace Corps Environmental Program provides
assistance in two general areas. It develops Peace Corps projects
and assignments dealing with environmental and natural resource
problems in the developing countries, and it recruits and places
applicants skilled in the environmental biological sciences. Over
800 applications were received in fiscal 1975, and 203 volunteers
with environmental skills were assigned to twenty-six countries.
Within the framework of Peace Corps agreements, host govern-
ments assigned these environmental sciences volunteers to scien-
tific and natural resource conservation programs.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

Sunlight is important for the maintenance of life on the earth. The
energy from sunlight is used by biological systems in two principal
ways: either the energy is converted to food,or the energy is used
to regulate growth and development.

In order for the sunlight to be used in these two ways it must be
absorbed by pigments. A large portion of the laboratory research
this year has been directed toward research on plant pigments
involved in these processes.

Specifically, the laboratory has continued its investigations in:
(a) regulatory processes of plants, such as membrane synthesis and
pigment synthesis; (b) environmental processes and energy flow in
biological systems, such as photosynthesis and phosphorus metabo-
lism; (c) the measurement of the amount, duration and color quality
of sunlight present in the environment; and (d) the age estimation
of biological artifacts based upon their radioactive carbon content.

REGULATORY BIOLOGY

As they evolved, aerobic photosynthetic organisms adapted to the
environment in various ways. In order to harvest a maximum
amount of light from the sun, many organisms evolved pigments
in addition to the principal photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll a.
These additional pigments absorb sunlight in regions in which there
is only partial absorption by chlorophyll a. Thus, these accessory
pigments extend the range of light available for growth and confer
a survival advantage upon the organisms where they are present.

In the red and blue-green algae, for example, these accessory pig-
ments are packaged in structures known as phycobilisomes. The
phycobilisomes are light-harvesting aggregates of protein pigments
and are arranged on membranes in such a fashion that energy
caught by them from sunlight is transferred to chlorophyll for
photosynthesis.

These phycobilisomes can be seen in electron micrographs of red
and blue-green algae, and methods for isolating and purifying them
have been developed in our laboratory. Analyses of the purified
phycobilisomes have been made by electron microscopy, immuno-
chemistry, fluoresence and absorption spectra, and selective disso-
ciation in various ionic strength buffers over a wide range of pH.
These measurements led to a detailed structural model for light-
harvesting antennae in the red alga, Porphyridium cruentum.

It was found that the physical dissociation, i.e., the sequential
release, of the phycobiliprotein pigments corresponded directly
with the decreased activity of the aggregate in energy transfer. The
phycobilisome, in confirmation of the previously proposed model,
is structured for maximum light energy absorption and unidirec-
tional transfer of this energy to the chlorophyll, where it is utilized
for photosynthesis.

The pathway discovered is a transfer of energy from the shorter
wavelengths of sunlight toward the long wavelength absorption
maximum of chlorophyll a in the following sequence: phycoerythrin
to R-phycocyanin to allophycocyanin to chlorophyll a, which is
attached to the photosynthetic membranes of the algae.

The biosynthesis of the photosynthetic membranes of chloro-
plasts is also being studied, using a polyribosome-membrane com-
plex isolated from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A
principal component of biological membranes is protein. Proteins

Science / 133
are synthesized on ribosomes, some of which are tightly attached to
the photosynthetic membranes. These membrane-bound ribosomes
contain incomplete proteins, that is, proteins in the process of being
made. If synthesis of these incomplete proteins is artificially ter-
minated, for example, by inhibitors, the prematurely completed
protein chains remain with the membrane and not with the ribo-
somes as might be expected. This observation has led us to con-
clude that ribosomes attached to the photosynthetic membranes
make membrane proteins that become part of the membrane as the
proteins are made. This system probably is part of the process by
which the total amount of photosynthetic membrane is increased.
It may also apply to the formation of other biological membranes.

Another pigment system investigated this year is the carotenoids.
Carotenoids are found in all families of both plants and animals.
For example, they are responsible for the yellow-orange, and red
colors of carrots, tomatoes, leaves in autumn, starfish, flamingos and
other birds. We have been investigating the biosynthesis of carote-
noids in an orange bread mold, Neurospora crassa. This organism
has the interesting property of requiring blue light to initiate syn-
thesis. At least eight different carotenoids are produced after the
light treatment.

Considering the temperature requirements and the effects of
various inhibitor compounds, we have proposed that an inducer
used to activate a gene is produced by the light reaction. The
genetic code contained in the activated gene is used to specify the
amino acid sequence of an enzyme required for carotenoid syn-
thesis. The hypothesis was proposed that this enzyme is absent in
dark-grown cultures. However, the interesting possibility remains
that a whole series of genes is activated by light, and, as a result,
more than one enzyme is produced.

Two approaches are being used to test this hypothetical model:
genetic and biochemical. The genetic study involves the use of
ultraviolet light to mutate wild type Neurospora. Using this muta-
gen, we have obtained four different types of strains. These are
albinos that do not make pigment even in the presence of light,
yellow-orange mutants that synthesize a different distribution of
pigments, mutants in which the sensitivity of carotenoid synthesis
to temperatures above 6C has been reduced, and mutants that can
make pigment in the dark. We are in the process of determining the

134 / Smithsonian Year 1975
location of these mutants on the seven chromosomes of Neuro-
spora.

From a biological standpoint, phytoene, a colorless compound
which accumulates in dark-grown Neurospora, is a likely precursor
of the carotenoid pigments. Since phytoene can be synthesized by
Neurospora in the dark, it is predicted that light induces the syn-
thesis of enzymes for the conversion of phytoene to the carote-
noids. Furthermore, one might predict that the level of enzymes
involved in phytoene synthesis itself would be unaffected by a light
treatment. However, preliminary results using radioactive pre-
cursors of phytoene indicate that a blue light exposure of two
minutes does induce in vivo the de novo synthesis of one or more
of the enzymes involved in phytoene synthesis. Thus, blue light
may affect both the synthesis of phytoene, as well as the synthesis
of carotenoids from phytoene.

The single-celled fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus, demon-
strates a phenomenon known as light-dark adaptation. That is, it
has the ability to change its sensitivity to light stimuli, depending
upon the previous history of light exposure it has received. The
nature of the pigment receiving the light stimuli in the cells is as
yet unknown. However, by measuring the bending responses of
these cells to unilateral light stimuli of varying irradiance (in-
tensity), it is possible to measure the time constants of the dark-
adaptation rate after very high intensity blue light exposures
(> imWw-cm~*).

Experimentally, it is found that the cell can adapt to a new,
lower intensity at the rate of a factor 2 in intensity about each four
minutes, in agreement with previous data from light-growth re-
sponse measurements. Surprisingly, it has also been found that in
the range of intensities so large that no responses can be observed
physiologically, such as bending or light-growth responses, the
adaptation mechanism still functions. This was demonstrated by
adapting the cell to intensities many fold higher than it can respond
to and then measuring the time it takes for the cell to become
sensitive to a standard lower intensity in the responsive range.
Even for intensities not effective in producing responses, the cell
has a method for evaluating the intensity. We conclude that these
data indicate that a photobleaching of the pigment itself is oc-
curring, which is used by the cell for intensity measurement, and

Science / 135
that the sensitivity changes of the cell in light-dark adaptation are
not simply due to limitations in the capacity of responding systems.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

From a photosynthetic standpoint salt marshes are thought to be
among the world’s most productive plant communities. It is also
thought that this productivity (excess carbon matter after neces-
sary growth and maintenance) is exported from the marsh to be
utilized by consumers living in the estuary subtended by the marsh.
One of our objectives has been to understand the capacity of the
marsh to utilize light. We have studied carbon dioxide assimilation
in the light and dark in sections of salt marsh communities that
were enclosed in a plexiglass chamber of approximately one cubic
meter. A system for monitoring the in situ rate of CO» exchange
which utilizes an infra-red gas analysis system has been constructed
in the marsh. During the night, metabolism of organisms in the
community evolves CO:, but when there is sufficient light, the
green plants and algae on the surface of the marsh assimilate CO2
at a rate that exceeds CO: evolution and is dependent on light
intensity. Figure 1 shows results of measurements of net COsz ex-
change in the light over a two-hour period in a community that
includes approximately 60 percent of one species, a sedge Scripus
olneyi, and approximately 40 percent of a mixture of the two
grasses Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata.

Analysis of many such records (Fig. 2) has shown that the com-
munity light saturation for net CO. exchange occurs near four
moles of quanta m-* h~! (about 5/7 of full sunlight intensity),
suggesting that the community is adapted to utilize rather high
light intensity. Efficiency of the light utilization (the ratio of energy
received to energy stored in carbon compounds) is about 60 percent
of that of agricultural crops, such as corn and potatoes, and this
adds to the earlier evidence that salt marshes are highly productive
and, therefore, valuable natural resources.

Plants have also evolved special mechanisms to enable them to
survive harsh environments of temperature extremes. During the
past year, studies of the effects of chilling on the photosynthetic
apparatus of leaf cells were continued. It has been found that it is
possible to isolate from whole leaves cells which, by two criteria,
are able to carry on photosynthesis independently of the leaf struc-

ture. They evolve oxygen and assimilate CO: in the light in the
absence of artificial electron donors or acceptors. The conditions for
obtaining such a preparation of cells are that a high molecular
weight compound, polyvinylpyrolidone (40,000), be included in the
initial medium in which the leaves are bathed during the brief (35
sec) grinding, and that the pH be controlled by a buffer (at
7.0 = 0.2 pH units). Whole and broken cells are separated by mild
centrifugation. Using this method to obtain active cells from whole
leaves that have been exposed to a succession of cool (5°C) nights,
we were able to show that the reduction in oxygen evolution occurs
at the same time and to the same extent as does the loss in capacity
for carbon dioxide assimilation in whole leaves. Rates of oxygen
evolution with this cell system are of the order of 25 percent of
those for carbon dioxide assimilation in whole leaves. It has been
suggested by some workers that the plant hormone abscisic acid
(ABA), which is known to effect photosynthetic CO: assimilation
by closing the stomata of leaves, may also have a direct effect on
the photosynthetic apparatus within the leaf. However, we could
find no immediate effect of abscisic acid on oxygen evolution in
whole green cells separated from the leaf by our methods.

As part of the studies investigating the flow of energy in the Bay
area, the relationship is being investigated between land use prac-
tices on lands in Maryland adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay and the
composition of the runoff waters flowing from these lands into the
estuary. The water discharge rates and volume-integrated concen-
trations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon)
were monitored for a year on five watersheds. The watersheds were
mapped in detail with respect to land use, and the nutrient data
were analyzed to give mean seasonal area yield loading rates for
each of five land use categories (cultivated cropland, pastureland,
forest, swamps and freshwater marshes, and residential). Rainfall
was also monitored for amount and nutrient composition. It was
found to contain high levels of both nitrate and organic nitrogen.
A quantitative analysis was computed of the sources of organic
matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the Rhode River, a subestuary
of Chesapeake Bay. Rainfall and the exchange of water masses
with Chesapeake Bay proper were found to be the principal sources
of nitrogen, while residential areas and cultivated cropland were
the largest sources of phosphorus. In the case of organic matter,

138 / Smithsonian Year 1975

less than one percent was derived from the watersheds and air-
shed, and the greatest source was primary production by phyto-
plankton in the estuary.

Studies were also conducted of phosphate uptake by bacteria
and phytoplankton in the Rhode River. Uptake was closely cor-
related with cell biomass, but bacterial uptake rates were between
10* and 10° times higher per biomass. Thus, although bacterial
biomass was usually much lower than phytoplankton biomass, bac-
teria usually accounted for over 90 percent of total planktonic
phosphorus uptake.

Phosphorus compounds which are biologically important are
polymers of phosphate commonly called polyphosphates. In the
laboratory these polyphosphates have been isolated from syn-
chronously dividing Chlorella cells. Two classes of polymer have
been characterized. The first, a, is formed in large amounts during
the cell expansion phase of the cell cycle and then decreases rapidly
in amount. The second, 8, increases when a decreases. Radioisotope
labeling studies have shown that a is labeled twice as fast initially,
but both become labeled with the same specific activity as the
medium within two cells’ cycles.

Neither class of polymer is homogeneous with respect to mo-
lecular weight, but a has a molecular weight range of 50,000—
125,000, while 8 has a range of 5000—25,000. A true polyphos-
phate is inert to alkaline hydrolysis, but both a and f give the same
size product upon alkaline hydrolysis, a smaller more homogeneous
polymer of about 5000 daltons. Both a and £ release about 80-85
percent of their phosphorus as orthophosphate upon mild acid
hydrolysis under conditions which give 100 percent orthophosphate
from true polyphosphates. The molecular structures of a and 8, as
well as their degradation products, are unknown but are currently
under investigation.

SOLAR ENERGY

One of the pigments which controls a wide range of diverse bio-
logical responses from flowering to seed germination is phyto-
chrome. Phytochrome is a photochromic pigment which can exist
in two major absorbing forms (wavelength maxima in the red or in
the far red regions of the spectrum). It is believed that many sea-
sonal phenomena in plants are regulated through this pigment. If

Science / 139
only the far red form is physiologically active, then plants having
this pigment would be sensitive to subtle changes in the naturally
occurring amounts of red and far red light from sunlight.

We know from laboratory experiments that changes in red and
far red do cause marked developmental responses when all other
conditions of the environment are maintained constant. Therefore,
measurements of sun and sky light have been made, and the ratio
of the amounts of red and far red light occurring naturally deter-
mined. The data from the monitoring stations for the years 1968 to
1973 have been published in tabular form showing the amount of
energy in each spectral region, as well as the percentage of the
total energy.

Ozone is a naturally occurring trace gas of the earth’s atmos-
pheric envelope. It is concentrated primarily in the stratosphere be-
tween fifteen and thirty-five kilometers altitude. Ozone is also
formed near the earth’s surface from man-made and _ naturally
occurring sources. Ozone concentration in the stratosphere varies
with latitude from about 2.4 mm at standard temperature and
pressure (stp) at the equator to about 4.5 mm at high latitudes.
There are also seasonal and geographical variations. This layer of
ozone is the principal absorber of ultraviolet radiation from the sun
for wavelengths of 320 nm down to about 225 nm and serves as a
shield for terrestrial organisms.

In view of the recent concerns about ozone and ultraviolet radia-
tion and the admitted uncertainties that now exist, the Radiation
Biology Laboratory has developed and recently installed at several
monitoring sites ultraviolet measuring instruments to measure
energy in narrow bands from 280 nm to 320 nm.

In the skin of mammals there are a number of pigments present.
One of these, as yet not clearly identified, is involved with the
reddening of skin (erythemal response) and is associated in some
way with the induction of skin cancer. Previously, the short wave-
length limit of ultraviolet light, reaching the earth, which produces
these responses was thought to be about 290 nm. During the past
year, we have detected energy below 290 nm at the surface of the
earth on a relatively consistent basis, using the rBt radiometer.

CARBON DATING

All living organisms are in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon
dioxide until death, when radioactive *Carbon begins to decay. By

140 / Smithsonian Year 1975
measuring present '*Carbon activity in dead biological specimens,
it is possible to determine the age, or time of death, of those orga-
nisms, and thus provide chronologies necessary for the researches
of archeologists, geologists, palynologists, etc. A small portion of
the research time of the Carbon Dating Laboratory is devoted to
basic research of the method itself, such as the development of
chemical pretreatments to extract the most representative and reli-
able fractions of sample materials. Major efforts, however, are
devoted to providing chronologies for the research staff of the
Smithsonian Institution, to the investigation of the relationships
between environmental change and cultural change, and to the
problem of the early occupations of the Americas.

In collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution staff, as well as
cooperative research with some twenty other institutions and uni-
versities, the laboratory has been engaged in such studies as late-
glacial and post-glacial sea-level rise along the Middle Atlantic
coast, cultural change in response to environmental change along
the New England and Labrador coasts, and the early occupations
of coastal Labrador some 8000 years ago.

Recent discovery of sea current reversal at the Strait of Gibraltar
about 10,000 years ago conjures up visions of drastic environmental
and cultural changes within the Mediterranean Basin, and studies
are continuing to determine the extent of such changes throughout
the basin. To the south, the dating of ancient lake levels at Alex-
andersfontein near Kimberley, South Africa, has led to the study
of climatic changes in that area and their possible correlation with
Middle and Late Stone Age occupations around the lake.

A cooperative sampling program by United States and Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics scientists has involved the laboratory in
a joint dating effort with Russian laboratories in the investigation
of late-glacial and post-glacial climates of east-central Siberia. A
joint U.S.S.R.-U.S. expedition provided the laboratory with samples
confirming a continuous occupation of the Aleutian chain beginning
some 8000 years ago, and the dating of materials from several sites
in southeastern Alaska indicates initial occupations there by 10,000
years ago.

The most striking project recently undertaken is the dating of
materials from the Meadowcroft Rockshelter in western Pennsy]l-
vania. Several samples from hearths in the lowest occupation levels
of the site indicate that man was already in northeastern North

Science / 141
America by 16,000 years ago. Since the most recent, and generally
accepted, entry to North America by way of the Bering land bridge
could have taken place only between 14,000 and 17,000 years ago
when land was exposed there, the '*Carbon dates from Meadow-
croft suggest that man’s entry must date to the prior land bridge,
some 25,000 to 30,000 years ago. Archeologists are now quickly
revising their estimates of man’s antiquity in the New World as a
result of this project.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Since 1973, the related research activities of the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory (sao) and the Harvard College Observatory
(Hco) have been coordinated under a single director. This coopera-
tive venture, combining the facilities of both observatories in a
Center for Astrophysics at Cambridge, Massachusetts, has as its
primary goal “the conduct of excellent astrophysical research in a
variety of interdependent subfields.”

Recognizing the limitation to the amount of resources currently
available as well as to the potential growth in these resources, a
plan has been drawn up, covering the next five years, for utilizing
the available resources effectively in attaining scientific goals and
objectives. In brief, this plan calls for specific steps to strengthen
the research in each division, by provision of new staff and re-
sources, as Well as by phasing out programs which are of less scien-
tific interest or could not contribute directly to the overall goal.
They also call for greater effectiveness in the administrative opera-
tion of the observatories.

During 1974, major new research appointments were made in
high-energy astrophysics, theoretical astrophysics, planetary sci-
ences, and solar physics. New programs were started in x-ray
astronomy. A major objective for the next few years is the pro-
vision of institutional funds to undergird these new programs and
other ongoing programs deemed to be excellent.

Certain scientific programs have been instituted at the Center,
including a Visiting Scientist program and a Center Postdoctoral
Fellowship program. Under the latter program, six fellows were

appointed in July 1974 for a two-year period, to pursue research
of their choosing. It is expected that four more fellows will be
appointed in July 1975, with interests in radio astronomy, solar
physics, and theoretical astrophysics.

More detailed discussion of the current research objectives of
each of the Center’s eight divisions follows.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS

This division embraces the spectroscopy laboratory at Hco and the
theoretical atomic physics group, largely at sao. Experimental work
includes the measurement of photoionization cross sections and
oscillator strengths for species of astrophysical interest. Theoretical
work covers the calculation of atomic and molecular structure and
the associated cross sections for interaction with radiation, using
such techniques as model-potential methods. The resulting data are
being used in studies of processes in the upper atmosphere and in
interstellar clouds.

Future directions include the development of an ion-beam ap-
paratus to measure the interaction of multiply-charged ions with
electrons and radiation; currently supported by sao.

GEOASTRONOMY

This division utilizes a worldwide network of tracking stations to
observe precise positions of artificial satellites (using optical tele-
scopes and laser ranging) and employs the resulting data to extract
information about the earth’s shape and gravitational field. Previous
results have been summarized in a publication called “The Smith-
sonian Standard Earth.”

The French Startette satellite, placed in orbit in March 1975,
and the Geos-c satellite, launched in April 1975, are being tracked
now; it is planned to analyze radar altimeter data from the latter
satellite to determine the ocean geoid. Laceos, a satellite conceived
by the group, is expected to be launched in February 1976. Using
laser ranging to its corner reflectors, it is hoped that 2-cm range
accuracy can be achieved. The resulting data will be used, as part
of nasa’s Earth and Ocean Physics Application Program (EOPAP),
to deduce basic information about the earth, including the direct
measurement of continental drift. Emphasis will be placed on
dynamics of the earth, including plate tectonics and the response to
loading by tides and glaciation.

144 / Smithsonian Year 1975

STARLETTE, a satellite designed specifically for research in geodesy and geo-
dynamics and launched in February 1975, is currently being tracked by the
worldwide laser and camera network operated by the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory. STARLETTE is a solid sphere with an extremely low
area-to-mass ratio which minimizes all non-gravitational effects on its orbit.
Extremely precise ranging from ground stations is facilitated by the complex
laser array on the satellite. The resultant orbital data should allow study of
long-period perturbations of gravitational origin as well as provide precise
positional determination of the ground stations for tectonic purposes. Photo:
CNES/GRGS, France.

Another project in this division is to fly an extremely precise
hydrogen maser clock in a high-altitude rocket probe to check
Einstein’s prediction that such a clock will “tick” faster than an
identical clock on the earth. This prediction, fundamental to the
theory of relativity, has so far been verified at the 1 percent level;
this experiment should be one hundred times more accurate.

Finally, the division is conducting an experiment aboard the joint
usa-ussr Apollo-Soyuz Test Project scheduled for launch in July
1975. One of the very few experiments selected for this flight, it
will permit accurate determination of gravitational anomalies by
extremely precise monitoring of the distances between the United
States and Soviet spacecraft.

Future directions include a long-term commitment to the EOPAP
program, and further work aimed at increasing the stability of
hydrogen maser clocks beyond the current 10~*° level with a num-
ber of possible applications in astronomy.

The twenty-year Moonwatch program involving an international
network of volunteer visual satellite observers was disbanded at the
end of June 1975. Since the first observations of Sputnik I in 1957,
the network has made approximately 400,000 observations of
artificial satellites in support of the federal space program.

HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS

In 1967, sao started a small group working with a novel Cerenkov
detector at Mt. Hopkins Observatory to detect gamma rays of
1011-10!” eV from celestial sources. This project succeeded in de-
tecting gamma rays from the Crab pulsar, placing severe constraints
on theoretical models. More recently, the group has used equip-
ment in Australia to demonstrate that the Centaurus-A radio source
(NGc 5128) also emits high-energy gamma rays.

In 1973, a major new program of x-ray astronomy, using rocket-
and satellite-borne detectors, was added at sao. This group is
analyzing the data acquired by the uHuRU x-ray instrument. Many
stellar x-ray sources have been discovered, which appear to be
associated with collapsed stars orbiting normal stellar companions.
Black holes are predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity, but they
had never been observed before.

Extragalactic sources were also found, including many clusters
of galaxies. The source of x-rays in clusters appears to be extremely
hot gas, whose origin and heating may be connected with basic
processes in cosmology.

Current projects include rocket flights and participation in ex-
periments aboard the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite, launched
in August 1974. Observations of increased x-ray activity in the
object Cygnus X-1 between May 1 and May 5 by the Smithsonian
experiment aboard that satellite sparked a series of ground-based
searches leading to the detection of increased radio emissions by
astronomers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).
The corresponding activity in two wavelengths confirms observa-
tions of dual intensity changes from Cygnus X-1 first seen four
years earlier, thus supporting the contention that the object is a

146 / Smithsonian Year 1975

black hole and suggesting physical mechanisms unique to such
stellar systems.

Investigators at the Center are also involved in the experiments
aboard Sas-c an x-ray observatory launched in May 1975. A
laboratory facility for the design and calibration of x-ray detectors
and telescopes is being built at the Center.

Future plans heavily emphasize participation in a program of
High-Energy Astronomy Observatories (HEAO), with major effort
going into the design of a large x-ray telescope on HEAO-B, which
will have a resolution better than two arcseconds. This experiment
will be launched in 1978. Instruments to be placed at the focus of
this telescope are being designed by various groups around the
country, including the one at the Center.

OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY

In addition to using Harvard’s 61-inch reflector at Agassiz Station
and Smithsonian’s 60-inch reflector at Mt. Hopkins, observational
astronomers in this group enjoy guest privileges at a number of
observatories in the United States and abroad. They also use a
40-inch balloon-borne telescope developed jointly by Hco, sao, and
the University of Arizona for observations in the far infrared. This
division utilizing numerous facilities has made observations of
comets and asteroids, planets, stars, x-ray sources, nebulae, inter-
stellar clouds, pulsars, quasars, and galaxies. Some recent high-
lights include the study of halos of spiral galaxies at one-micron
wavelength, discovery of high winds in the atmosphere of Venus,
high-resolution mapping of the Orion nebula in the far infrared, a
demonstration that the brightest x-ray source in the sky (Sco X-1)
exhibits regular light variations with a period of approximately
nineteen hours, and the discovery that for a brief period the quasar
3C 279 exceeded the luminosity of 100 trillion suns.

The future activities of this division are heavily oriented toward
the completion of the Multiple-Mirror Telescope, which is being
constructed jointly by sao and the University of Arizona on Mt.
Hopkins. A telescope of novel design based on altitude-azimuth
mounting of six lightweight 72-inch mirrors, the mot will have an
equivalent aperture of 175 inches, and an optical resolution better
than 0.7 arcsecond; it will be optimized for operation in the infra-
red. The mnt is scheduled to draw first light in 1976; some of the

Science / 147
major components are already complete and await assembly, while
others are in various stages of construction. However, full-scale
operation will not take place until 1977. A high priority for this
project is its successful observation of faint optical and infrared
objects, especially extragalactic ones.

PLANETARY SCIENCES

In this division observations of the smaller bodies in the solar
system—comets, meteors, asteroids, and satellites—are empha-
sized, as are studies of meteoritic and lunar material. Theoretical
work centers on the origin of the solar system and of various bodies
within it. Recent studies include a campaign to study stellar occulta-
tions by Eros, which led to new estimates of the size and shape of

that asteroid. Mutual occultations of the satellites of Jupiter are

leading to better estimates of their sizes. Theoretical work indi-
cates that the obliquity of the earth may increase dramatically in
the future, and that the presence of resonance gaps in Saturn’s rings
implies that the particles making up the rings must be of the order
of ten meters across.

Several research programs involving lunar and meteorite samples
are continuing, including mineralogical and petrological studies on
a complex brecchia boulder from the Apollo 17 site and on particles
from the Allende carbonaceous chondrite, as well as isotopic in-
vestigation of lunar material. In a related program, inexpensive
detectors to determine the neutrino fluxes from various cosmic
sources have been developed. The Prairie Network, a ten-year
project to photograph fireballs, is being discontinued.

Future directions will probably emphasize further the origin of
the solar system, including cosmochemistry and theoretical analysis.

In spring 1975, a new asteroid discovered by two members of
this division using the telescope at Agassiz Station was named
“Whipple” in honor of the former director of sao, Dr. Fred L.
Whipple.

RADIO ASTRONOMY

This group is comprised of both uco and sao scientists. The Cen-
ter’s efforts include the Harvard Radio Astronomy Station at Ft.
Davis, Texas, where studies of extragalactic radio sources and of
solar radio bursts are made. Center scientists are also heavily

involved in studies of the interstellar medium and maser sources at
microwave and millimeter wavelengths. Observational facilities at
Agassiz, Haystack, nrao, and the Texas Millimeter Wave Observa-
tory are used in this work.

Recent studies include the detection of ethanol (grain alcohol) in
interstellar clouds and CH in Comet Kohoutek. Isotopic abundances
were studied in the Orion nebula, and heavy ions were identified
in the recombination-line spectrum of H I clouds. Evidence has been
presented both from visi and single-dish measurements that milli-
gauss magnetic fields exist in Orion. If confirmed, this would imply
energy densities a million times greater than in the typical inter-
stellar medium, suggesting interesting new effects.

A new program has been initiated in response to the recent find-
ing that chlorinated hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere
may, via a series of photochemical reactions, attack the ozone in
the earth’s upper atmosphere, with potential dire consequences for
living things. Experiments in Texas have demonstrated the feasi-
bility of detecting some of the key molecules in the stratosphere
by their millimeter lines.

Emphasis in future research will be placed on short millimeter
and submillimeter wavelengths, where good work can be done at
a more moderate cost. This spectral range is rich in molecular fea-
tures of prime interest to various groups at the Center.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS

This division comprises the uco Solar Satellite Project, an Hco
solar x-ray group, and a variety of studies, many of them theo-
retical, at sao. The Solar Satellite Project is deeply involved in the
analysis of the large amounts of solar ultraviolet data gathered on
Skylab. All the evidence points to strong magnetic control of the
chromosphere and corona, evidenced by prominent arch structures
and bright points. Recent work has developed evidence for wave
propagation from lower to upper layers; if expectations are fulfilled,
the long-sought heating mechanism for the corona will be found.

Starting in 1974, the ultraviolet data at the Center have been
complemented by x-ray observations from the same spacecraft
obtained by a group that joined uco last year. Among the more
striking findings is confirmation of the fact that ‘coronal holes,”
regions where the coronal density and temperature are low, appear
to be the source of streams of solar wind. Further work concerns
the high densities and temperatures along magnetic coronal arches.
This work will lead to a better understanding of the solar corona,
and how the solar wind originates in it.

Theoretical work among the sao members of the division con-
tinues on a variety of problems involving non-.tTE radiative transfer.
This work is being applied to models of the chromosphere and
corona and, in particular, to the analysis of the region of the tem-
perature minimum.

Stellar research is being carried out using orbiting ultraviolet
telescopes such as the Princeton instrument aboard Copernicus.
A recent finding is that Capella, a nearby star of solar type, may
have a stellar wind. By applying the analytical tools developed for
the sun, we hope to infer the properties of this wind. In the future,
the division expects to participate in the International Ultraviolet
Explorer and Large Space Telescope missions of NASA.

Finally, there is increasing interest in solar-terrestrial relations,
based on recent studies that seem to show correlation between
indices of solar activity and meteorological changes. Because of the

Science / 151
Center’s involvement with research on the sun and the upper at-
mosphere, it may be possible to make significant contributions to
this controversial but exciting field.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS

Members of this division are engaged in a wide variety of theo-
retical studies, ranging from stellar atmospheres to cosmology. Re-
cent work has included studies of the equilibrium and stability of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies, novel methods of integration of
the equation of transfer, molecular processes in interstellar clouds,
weak interactions in supernova explosions, the heating of the inter-
galactic medium, the physics of neutron stars and pulsating white
dwarfs, deuterium production in supernovae, and tidal effects in
binary systems.

Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc.

The Exchange has experienced a considerable expansion of its
activities during the year, both with regard to an expansion of the
services provided and in terms of internal improvements designed
to enhance the value of its services to users and to incorporate the
latest technological improvements which distinguish the Exchange
as a major scientific and technological information center.

The Exchange undertook a series of projects for various Federal
Agencies which were directed toward meeting national needs in
major areas of research interest. Among these were the designation
of ssre as the Current Cancer Research Project Analysis Center
(ccrespac) by the National Cancer Institute as a part of its Inter-
national Cancer Research Data Bank (1crps) Program. In its role
as such a center, the Exchange will be involved in the collection,
storage, and retrieval of comprehensive information about current
research projects in cancer and cancer-related fields from both
national and international sources; transfer of this information to
the National Cancer Institute for use through CANCERLINE (an on-
line computerized file searchable through the MEDLINE network)
which will make this information available to thousands of users
engaged in research or the management of cancer projects and

152 / Smithsonian Year 1975
programs. In addition, the Exchange will be developing new vocabu-
lary tools for the indexing and retrieval of such information and
will prepare a number of catalogues for publication by the National
Cancer Institute intended for dissemination on a worldwide basis.
The ss1e will also be providing direct search services to investigators
in the cancer field who do not have access to remote terminals.
This activity is expected to continue and expand over the next
several years and could serve as a prototype for future international
centers of ongoing research information in selected areas.

In the field of energy research the Exchange has engaged in a
major effort to expand its data base in this field. New input has
been obtained from state governments as well as industry. At the
international level the Exchange has negotiated arrangements with
five European countries and Canada to obtain information in whole
or in part on their ongoing energy research projects for input into
the system. A directory of international research in energy will be
produced during 1975 under a grant from the National Science
Foundation, at the request of the Intergovernmental Committee on
International Cooperation in Energy Research and Development.
The information collected is expected to be helpful in the review
and planning of new international efforts in this area.

With support from the National Science Foundation and in an
effort to expand United States knowledge of other ongoing research
information systems worldwide, and to facilitate the exchange of
information, sste has taken a series of steps designed to identify
and subsequently expand its coverage in selected areas of major
national interest. As an important part of this effort the uNISIST
Program of uNnEsco in conjunction with ssre has organized a three-
day International Symposium on Information Systems and Services
in Ongoing Research in Science to be held in Paris in October 1975.
Dr. Hersey has been designated as symposium chairman and head
of the program committee, which has outlined the purpose of the
symposium as threefold:

1. To expand international understanding of the need and uses
for information about research in progress,

2. To stimulate the development of improved data collection and
dissemination,

3. To encourage worldwide exchange among national and inter-
national systems working in this field.

Science / 153
Speakers from all over the world will be representing their organi-
zations and countries. More than forty papers will be presented in
addition to two panel sessions involving discussions on problems
of operating such systems and meeting user needs.

In addition to the International Symposium, the Exchange has
begun discussions with a number of countries which now have, or
are in the process of developing, information systems of ongoing
research, with the possibility of developing bilateral agreements for
the exchange of information in selected areas. These discussions
involve problems of compatibility, language, indexing techniques,
and the economics of exchange methods. It is particularly note-
worthy that an increasing number of countries are developing data
bases comparable to ss at the national level. The Exchange, which
had its inception some twenty-five years ago, is providing other
countries with information about its experience gained over that
period of time regarding the problems and pitfalls which can be
encountered in the operation of such a system. It is expected that
the Exchange’s discussions in this area will result in making infor-
mation about ongoing research more widely available not only to
United States users but throughout the world in consonance with
the Smithsonian’s raison d’etre, “the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.”

Among other activities designed to increase the availability of
information to the research community, the Exchange completed
an agreement with the System Development Corporation of Cali-
fornia to make its data base available for remote interrogation
throughout the country for on-line searching. The new spc/ssIE
service is designed to give quick, easy, and economical access from
remote computer terminals to a file of over 125,000 summaries of
ongoing research projects in the life and physical sciences.

spc’s retrieval program, called orbit, permits subscribers to con-
duct extremely rapid searches through two-way communication
terminals located in their own facilities. Searchers may specify their
search information inquiry by subject terms, names of researchers,
performing organizations, or a number of other access points, or
by any combination of these.

After examining the preliminary results of inquiries, searchers
will be able to refine their questions further to make them broader
or narrower in scope. This interaction between searcher and com-
puter is conducted in simple, English-language statements.

154 / Smithsonian Year 1975
The spc system is tied into a nationwide communications net-
work, so that most subscribers can link their terminals to the com-
puter through the equivalent of a local telephone call. The spc
Search Service is the world’s largest with over five million items
(mostly bibliographic) on file for daily use. Users of other spc
services are expected to find access to ssIE an important adjunct to
their regular bibliographic searches of such data bases reinforcing
the importance of ongoing research information as well as biblio-
graphic information in the overall research management process.

In other major research program activities, the Exchange has com-
pleted a number of directories of ongoing research for several
federal agencies designed to support research management in such
areas as water resources, pesticides, and disaster-related technology.
This latter project is particularly noteworthy since it combined
information about both ongoing research and abstracts of published
technical reports. The Exchange has also developed in conjunction
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the first
federal semimonthly publication containing both ongoing research
and bibliographic information. The inclusion of ongoing research
in this publication has been well received and is expected to be
continued for another year.

The Exchange has continued to develop new techniques in data
processing in order to achieve optimum utilization of its staff and
equipment. Several of these, such as machine-aided indexing, have
already been published and may prove useful to information sys-
tems on an international level. The sste also produced during the
current year several output products in computer output microfiche
which may open a whole new approach to improving the use of
the Exchange’s information. It remains to be seen what kind of
user acceptance this type of output receives from the science com-
munity. Improved internal operational methods have allowed the
Exchange to accomplish its largest input ever, over 130,000 research
projects in fiscal year 1975, with only minimal increases in staff.
Improved computer programming changes have not only reduced
processing costs but increased the speed with which information is
now processed through the system. Overall demand for the Ex-
change’s services continues to rise as greater realization of the use-
fulness of ongoing research information in the research process
becomes evident to both governmental and nongovernmental
organizations.

Science / 155
In summary, the Exchange has taken a major leadership role in
the awareness of ongoing research information, not only in terms
of developing and testing a variety of new modes to enhance use
of the data collected but in the international area of scientific
research in selected special areas. The identification of and ex-
changes of information which are expected to come from these in-
ternational activities are expected to benefit not only the United
States but the entire worldwide research community as well.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Research at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (sTRI) is a
multi-faceted compound of the individual efforts of the scientific
staff, research fellows, and associates. A deliberate policy of bring-
ing together a community of permanent staff, who are intrigued
and fascinated by the complexity of tropical biotas, has achieved
a unity of purpose in seeking to explain this intricacy at all levels
of biological organization. They have found the interactions of a
variety of disciplines to be a powerful aid to studies of the eco-
logical and evolutionary adaptations of tropical organisms. In a
field as relatively unexplored as tropical biology, the work of
analysis and synthesis can go on more or less simultaneously; this
is certainly the case with the str1 research. This simultaneous
approach is illustrated by a sampling of our studies, here reported
in brief outline.

The complexity of systems of sexual reproduction and sexual
behavior are fundamentally important to organic evolution. Among
vertebrates the greatest diversity of patterns of sexual reproduction
occurs in the fishes, where several types of hermaphroditism have
evolved. Two groups of marine fishes, common on the Caribbean
coasts of Panama,are protogynous hermaphrodites (i.e., individuals
are first functional females and then become functional males).
These fishes, the wrasses and parrotfishes, have been intensively
studied by a multidisciplinary group of str scientists and fellows.
D. R. Robertson, R. W. Warner, D. Diener, and S. Hoffman have
conducted extensive field and laboratory research into the behavior,
ecology, and physiology of these fishes and E. Leigh has worked

156 / Smithsonian Year 1975

with them to develop mathematical models of the evolution of
protogyny and protandry. Models of protogyny have been tested
by studying the mating system of one species in great detail. Alto-
gether eighteen species of protogynus hermaphrodites have been
the subject of str1 comparative studies. These studies have revealed
that there is a great deal of variability in the population structures
of the hermaphrodites; in sex ratios, sexual color-phase ratios, and
in the proportions of hermaphroditic and nonhermaphroditic indi-
viduals present. Alongside studies of the ecology and behavior of
free-living fishes, studies have been made of the role of hormones
in the process of sex change and also of their role in the equally
interesting process of color-phase change. These investigations
show that there is much variation between species in the effects of
hormones on these two processes and that, in fact, the two processes
are often independent.

These studies of hermaphroditism have already yielded an ac-
cumulation of basic information on the many aspects of the phe-
nomenon that were previously unknown and at the same time they
have led to syntheses of comparative data that permit evolutionary
generalizations. Off the coasts of Panama another kind of her-
maphroditism is found in the relatively abundant groupers. These
fishes are synchronously hermaphroditic, individuals may be male
and female at the same time. Work is already in progress on the
possible adaptive value of this type of system and E. Fischer will
shortly begin a year’s pre-doctoral study.

A really basic question about tropical ecology is being asked,
and studied, by H. Wolda. He is concerned about fluctuations in
the abundance of insects in tropical forests. Many scientists have
argued that since tropical forests are extremely complex they should
be ecologically much more stable than forests of temperate regions,
and insect populations should, accordingly, fluctuate less than in
the temperate zone. Wolda’s work suggests strongly that this is not
true. His data are derived from studies of two separate groups of
insects, lepidopterans and homopterans. In the first case, Wolda
studied the caterpillars feeding on a tropical violaceous plant and
others feeding on figs. Over a period of four years the populations
of caterpillars in the Barro Colorado forest showed very consider-
able fluctuations. One species reached outbreak densities—plague
proportions—during two of the study years. Data from homopteran

Science / 157
catches at light traps shows that the lepidopterans are not merely
exceptional cases that prove the general rule of constancy and sta-
bility. Wolda has taken data from light traps operated at the same
sites on Barro Colorado for several years and calculated ratios that
highlight changes in abundance from year to year. Data from 110
species have presently been converted to ratios of annual variability.
These can be compared with data on temperate insects that are
already available in the ecological literature. The results of this
comparison are very striking indeed. The variability in the insects
in tropical forest is of the same order of magnitude as that for the
various groups of insects from the temperate zone. Further studies
of other groups on tropical insects are in progress. In these studies
Wolda is collaborating with specialists in the groups concerned. He
recently communicated his findings at the symposium on Tropical
Ecology held at Lubumbashi, Zaire.

Work on adaptive aspects of plant morphology is a comparatively
recent focus of tropical biology. At str1, Alan P. Smith is actively
pursuing researches into several problems where preliminary studies
of morphological patterns lead directly into quantitative studies of
life history and physiological adaptations. Smith is studying adap-
tive aspects of leaf form in tropical lowland forests, the support
systems of tropical trees and has embarked on a long-term study
of the life form and life history of tropical alpine plants belonging
to the genus Espeletia. Three aspects of leaf form are being studied:
the elongation of leaf tips into characteristic “drip tips’’—long
believed to be correlated with the heavy rainfall occurring in tropi-
cal forest, lateral asymmetry in leaf shape, and variegation in leaf
color. In the latter case, Smith is testing the hypothesis that varie-
gation may be a defense against the leaf-eating larvae of insects,
that it may function to deter insects from laying their eggs on the
leaf by simulating the effects of insect attack. Smith’s studies of
Espeletia species are being carried out in the Andes of Venezuela
and Colombia where the plants are a conspicuous feature of the
alpine regions. It is distinguished by a large-leaved rosette sup-
ported by a central unbranched or little-branched stem. Beneath
the rosette of hairy living leaves the plant accumulates dead leaves
as growth takes place. The dead leaves are retained around the stem
and persist for many years. This bizarre growth form has evolved
repeatedly in tropical alpine areas but is absent in alpine areas to

158 / Smithsonian Year 1975

the north and the south. It is thus an ideal subject for studies aimed
at determining the selective forces that operate in tropical alpine
environments. Smith has initiated long-term studies of Espeletia
species, concentrating on growth form and demography. His studies
include species with unbranched stems and rosettes of leaves,
branched stems and rosettes of leaves, and forms that are simply
arborescent. Early results are revealing exciting correlations between
growth form, life history, and environmental constraints.

Most studies of animal communication have involved visual and
acoustic signaling systems. These are certainly the types of signals
most readily understood, and studied, by humans. Michael and
Barbara Robinson are studying the courtship and mating behavior
of web-building spiders where the signals involved are almost
entirely tactile or vibrational. In a broad comparative study they
have so far investigated over thirty species in detail. Their aim is
to understand the types of signals involved in the contact between
male and female, the functional significance of the signals used,
and to elucidate the evolutionary stages through which the court-
ship of spiders has passed. The Robinsons’ studies have already
shown that early generalizations about spider courtship, based on
data from temperate regions, were inaccurate and premature. As in

Espeletia timotensis (Compositae) at 4200 m in the Venezuelan Andes,
specialized plants under study by Alan Smith.

all tropical studies, the overwhelming impression from this investi-
gation is that of staggering complexity. The courtship behavior of
the male spider has two very important functions; he has to iden-
tify himself as nonfood and then stimulate the female into accept-
ance of his mating attempts. This twofold function of courtship
has led to some bizarre behavioral adaptations. In one case the male
spider leads the female out onto a line that is directly connected
with his silk-producing organs, and, as she rushes towards him he
pays out silk so that she never quite catches him. Eventually the
female abandons the futile pursuit and either accepts a mating or
goes back to her web. While in New Guinea the Robinsons cen-
sused all the trap-building spiders in 200 square meters of coffee
plantation. With the census data and the results of their previous
studies on the prey-consumption of tropical spiders they were able
to work out an estimate of the insecticidal effect of the spiders in
a hectare of coffee. They calculate that the spiders consume a mini-
mum of forty million insects per hectare annually. This suggests
that spiders have an important ecological role and may be of con-
siderable economic importance.

During the past year, Jeffrey Graham was a visiting investigator,
for two months, at the National Marine Fisheries Service Labora-
tory in La Jolla, California. There he collaborated with John L.
Roberts of the University of Massachusetts in a study of red and
white muscle temperatures and electromyograms of fast-swimming
scombrid fishes. Roberts and Graham perfected a technique for
surgically implanting thermocouples in fish swimming muscles to
enable them to measure muscle temperatures as the fish swam at
controlled speeds in a respirometer. In addition, while at La Jolla,
Graham completed his study of the types and distribution of retial
countercurrent heat exchangers in scombrid fishes. This study has
shown that for the seven known species of tuna (Thunnus) there
is a relationship between the level to which the body temperature
is raised and both the type of heat exchanger and the latitudinal
distribution of a species. Tropical and subtropical tunas and skip-
jacks have the most primitive arrangement of heat exchangers, they
have small central heat exchangers, and, in some cases poorly de-
fined lateral ones. On the other hand the three high latitude tuna
species have lost central heat exchangers, but have highly developed
lateral systems.

160 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Other work on fishes has been carried out by stri postdoctoral
fellow Donald Kramer. Kramer has studied the ecology and be-
havior of freshwater fishes in Panama, concentrating on detailed
studies of feeding behavior and feeding strategies. He has also
carried out cooperative studies with Graham on air-breathing fresh-
water fishes. Graham and Kramer have discovered a phenomenon
that they call “synchronous air-breathing.” Fishes that exhibit syn-
chronous air-breathing rise together in groups to break the water
surface and breathe in air. They break the surface either simul-
taneously or in rapid succession. Graham and Kramer believe that
synchronicity of air-breathing constitutes an antipredator adapta-
tion. Graham, Kramer, and E. Pineda (a graduate fellow from the
University of Panama) have recently discovered populations of the
characin Piabucina festae which is an air-breather and are studying
this species and the closely related Piabucina panamensis, which is
not an air-breather.

The str1 program on human adaptations to tropical areas began
this year with an exciting week-long seminar at Barro Colorado
Island, where a number of distinguished anthropologists and biolo-
gists were invited for informal discussions of new research and
recent methodology. Representing the Instituto Venezolano de
Investigaciones Cientificas were Dra. Erika Wagner, and Dra.
Alberta Zucchi, who is working on the ridgefield systems of the
Venezuelan Llanos. From Colombia came Drs. Gerardo and Alicia
Reichel-Dolmatoff, well known for their pioneering work on the
archeology of northern Colombia, and on the ethnology of various
Colombian Indian groups. Representing the biological disciplines
were Dr. C. Earle Smith of the University of Alabama, and Dr.
Alan Covich of Washington University, who together discussed
the dynamics of plant domestication and their interaction with
faunal communities in the tropics.

Besides holding discussions with the stri staff and graduate stu-
dents, as well as with Panamanian professionals, the visiting scien-
tists were taken on a tour of archeological sites in the central
provinces. On hand to discuss his own research on the transition
from hunting-gathering to agriculture on the Isthmus was Dr.
Anthony J. Ranere, a str1 associate, who led the group to show
them the Aguadulce preceramic rockshelter, where he is continuing
excavations this year. A second morning was spent visiting the

doctoral fellows.

Sitio Sierra began as a small prehispanic maize-growing village
located on the shores of the Santa Maria river, Coclé province,
during the first centuries after the Christian era (circa A.D. 200).
Despite having to work one step ahead of bulldozers ready to level
off the mounded area in order to plant sugarcane, Dr. Cooke was
able to recover an impressive sample of the faunal and floral re-
sources exploited by the riverine group in the drier section of the
Isthmus during pre-Sitio Conte days. This was accomplished by
fine-screening, excavating housefloors, and concentrating on the
horizontal exposure of activity areas. Comparisons of the Sitio
Sierra materials with those excavated by Dra. Olga F. Linares of
sTRI, and members of her research team, is resulting in a volume
on the evolution of differential adaptations to the wet versus the
seasonal tropics of Panama.

STRI makes an important contribution to interbureau cooperative
science programs at the Smithsonian through its support of the Esp
(Environmental Sciences Program) Tropical Projects. These are
being conducted at stri facilities, with str logistic and technical
support, and involve several stri scientists. The appearance of the
465-page report Environmental Monitoring and Baseline Data—
1973—Tropical Studies in December 1974 marked a major step in
the development of the esp program in Panama.

The esp is a long-term study of natural fluctuations in several
contrasting environments on Smithsonian-controlled preserves. The
tropical projects are sited in the Canal Zone, on a coral reef at
Galeta Point, and in forest on Barro Colorado Island.

Even the proverbially stable tropics are not unchanging but are
in dynamic rather than static equilibria. They undergo considerable
and important fluctuations within each year and also from year to
year. To understand the magnitude and impact of these fluctuations
careful and repeated measurements must be made at different times
of the year and for a number of years. The most valuable results
of these studies will not come until a number of years have been
studied and the data analysed and compared. The data that have
already been collected and published are valuable both to investi-
gators working at the esp sites and to ecologists studying other
environments elsewhere in the world.

The report for 1973 is intended as the first in a series of annuals
which will make available the results from a wide range of en-
vironmental measurements. These include solar radiation, me-
teorological, hydrological, botanical, and zoological variables. These
data, particularly those collected by the core, or baseline, monitor-
ing programs of N. Smythe on Barro Colorado Island, and D. Meyer
and C. Birkeland at Galeta,are presented in considerable detail for
1973 and also summarized in various ways to facilitate comparisons
with other years and places. Though the report concentrates on
measurements that will be repeated in successive years, it also in-
cludes other kinds of baseline data such as maps and species lists.

In this first report the editor, R. Rubinoff, put strong emphasis
on developing a format that would allow direct comparison between
the tropical marine and terrestrial environments under study, as
well as with the temperate Esp projects being conducted at cBCES.
A second in the series of annual reports, that for 1974, is currently
in preparation.

Investigators from the Smithsonian Institution involved in the
EsP Tropical Projects during fiscal year 1975 included: W. Klein,
RBL; T. Erwin, M. Hale, C. Handley, R. Heyer, R. Thornington, and

G. Zug, all of mnu; G. Montgomery, NzpP; as well as C. Birkeland,
E. Leigh, D. Meyer, S. Rand, R. Rubinoff, N. Smythe, and H.
Wolda, stri. Several investigators from outside the Smithsonian
were partially supported by esp, particularly R. Foster, University
of Chicago, and J. Lawrence, Harvard University. A number of
students and visiting scientists at str1 have also made important
contributions to the projects.

During April, Drs. Glynn and Birkeland accompanied by Martin
Wells of Cornell University made an expedition to the Galapagos
Islands where a survey of the coral reefs was initiated in coopera-
tion with G. M. Wellington of the Charles Darwin Research Station.
Through the cooperation of the cprs and the Ecuadorian National
Park Service, about twenty species of corals were identified, at least
three of which are new to science, and a preliminary analysis of
the distribution and ecology of Galapagos corals was begun.

Based upon a visit to Papua, New Guinea, by Rubinoff and Rand,
the Smithsonian became a sponsoring member of the Wau Ecology
Institute. With support from the International Environmental Pro-
gram and the Fluid Research Fund, stri sent Dr. Tyson Roberts to
initiate an ecological investigation of the fishes of the Fly River
and Dr. Alan Smith to begin studies of tree ferns on Mt. Wilhelm
in Papua, New Guinea.

Our program of providing short-term fellowships to introduce
students to tropical research was continued with grants from the
Henry L. and Grace Doherty and the Edward John Noble founda-
tions. More than twenty-four students from the United States,
Panama, Colombia, Canada, and the Virgin Islands participated in
the program during fiscal year 1975.

Dr. D. R. Robertson, a fish behaviorist, has accepted an appoint-
ment as our newest staff member. He will continue his work on the
sexual behavior of fishes.

During 1975, major rebuilding was begun on the main laboratory
on Barro Colorado Island. When completed, the building will in-
clude a series of centrally air-conditioned individual laboratories,
a classroom, instrument room, and dark room. The first phase of
the Tivoli laboratory has been completed. The first wing includes
space for the herbarium which occupies what we hope will be its
final home. A contract has been awarded for the second phase of
the Tivoli renovation.

HISTORY AND ART

CHARLES BLITZER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY

IN HIS RECENT VOLUME of reminiscences, charmingly and most ap-
propriately titled Self-Portrait with Donors, the former Director of
the National Gallery of Art laments a change he has observed in
the thinking of museum directors. “Until recently the directors of
European and American museums have had the same basic phi-
losophy,” John Walker writes. ‘Their primary interest has been
the acquisition of masterpieces.” Of late, he observes, this interest
has been subordinated to a concern for “relevance” and for rather
vaguely defined programs of “social service.” Mr. Walker leaves no
doubt where his sympathies lie: “I fervently hope my colleagues
will regain faith in their original mission, which once was to as-
semble and exhibit masterpieces.”

Despite the survival in the art museum world of a few individual
directors who compete flamboyantly for the title of Grand Acquis-
itor, Mr. Walker’s characterization is evidently correct for the
profession as a whole. In a survey conducted last year for the Na-
tional Endowment for the Arts, a national sample of museum
directors was asked to evaluate in order of importance ten specified
functions of museums. In the resulting list, “acquiring works or
specimens” was rated fifth by the respondents; art museum di-
rectors rated acquisition as fourth in importance, history museum
directors rated it as fifth, and art/history museum directors rated
it as fifth.1 Exhibitions, conservation, the education of children, and

service as a “scholarly and information resource” were all deemed
to be more important. The current attitudes of the public seem to
reflect a similar skepticism about the overwhelming importance
of acquisitions. Understandably, a would-be visitor who finds his
favorite museum closed due to financial difficulties is apt to be less
than enthusiastic when that same museum purchases a multimillion
dollar object or collection; and he is not very interested in talk of
restricted endowments and earmarked purchase funds.

Granting that Mr. Walker’s explicit emphasis on the acquisition
of “masterpieces” severely limits the generality of his message,
which is primarily addressed to the directors and trustees of great
and wealthy art museums, there does seem to be an element of
paradox in the results of the Arts Endowment survey. For the fact
is that each of the functions regarded as more important than the
acquisition of collections presupposes the existence of collections.
One is reminded of a similar paradox that at least used to exist in
colleges and universities: the marriage of a faculty member and
a student tended to be viewed with great pleasure in the com-
munity, but the courtship of a student by a faculty member was
generally thought to be improper if not positively indecent. Simi-
larly, it is assumed that museums have collections, but there is
some uneasiness about the notion that they should get collections.

In all fairness one must admit that attitudes in the museum world
are no less pendulum-like than those in other areas of human en-
deavor. The results of the Arts Endowment survey mirror a rather
recent shift of emphasis from the goal of acquiring objects to the
goal of preserving and using them. Mr. Walker himself applauds
the development of long-term loan programs, through which mu-
seums with vast collections in storage can help to fill the galleries
of less fortunate museums. The growing concern for conservation of
museum objects should undoubtedly lead to a welcome redis-
tribution of museum resources. Similarly, a persuasive case can
be made for the variety of activities designed both to widen and to
deepen the use of objects that museums already have in their col-
lections. The Smithsonian is proud of having participated in each of
these developments, and intends to continue to do so.

But perhaps the pendulum has swung a trifle too far? Perhaps we
should heed Mr. Walker’s advice and regain faith in our original
mission of acquiring? To do so, to maintain an active interest in

168 / Smithsonian Year 1975

acquisitions, would seem to be required as part of our obligation to
posterity, to the future generations who will then be able to use
what we have collected as we use what earlier generations
collected.

Various branches of the Smithsonian Institution illustrate in very
concrete terms some of the forms this obligation can assume. The
case of the National Zoological Park is admittedly unique, for here
the mortality of living animals absolutely requires constant re-
plenishment of the collections. But the case of a museum of con-
temporary art is not so very different; the necessity of keeping
abreast with interesting and important new artistic developments
is absolute if such a museum is to fulfill its role. Similarly, unless
we assume that the history of American art and the history of
technology are somehow going to come to a halt, museums devoted
to these subjects must continue to acquire objects of historical sig-
nificance in their fields. A national gallery of portraiture, repre-
senting men and women who contribute to the development of our
Nation, must assume that such men and women will continue to
appear on the scene, although their likenesses may increasingly be
photographs, films, and videotapes rather than paintings and
sculptures. Even in museums less obviously committed to keeping
up with new developments, the case for filling the gap in the record
of the past is powerful indeed. It is precisely because we are con-
cerned with the use of our collections that we feel so strongly the
need to make them more useful, which more often than not means
making them more complete. And this, of course, is what acquisi-
tion is.

The Smithsonian can also serve to illustrate, however, the fact
that acquiring does not necessarily mean purchasing. Again the case
of the National Zoo is unique, for its collections have the happy
ability to reproduce themselves—an ability that will presumably be
enhanced by the Zoo’s new breeding farm. In many other cases,
notably those covered by the rubric Natural History, objects are
typically acquired by scientific expeditions. But, in the arts, and to
a very large extent in the various fields of history, the usual options
are gifts (including bequests) and purchases. Throughout its his-
tory, the Smithsonian has relied overwhelmingly upon gifts in
forming the national collections, and it continues to do so. The fact
that virtually every imaginable sort of object is now avidly col-

History and Art / 169
lected by someone, and the fact that the prices of things that are
collected rise at a rate considerably in excess of the general rate
of inflation, have combined to make our reliance upon gifts and
bequests more important than ever. The day when the knowledge-
able and energetic curator could find objects of museum quality
in attics or rubbish heaps, or could purchase them for a pittance
because they were out of fashion, is surely gone and will not return.

The Smithsonian’s dependence upon gifts, and its very notable
success in attracting them, is surely not unrelated to its performance
in using what it has been given. In a sense, then, we are led to
another paradox, one which perhaps resolves the apparent conflict
between acquisition and use. Donors, who should not be assumed
to be any less intelligent and sensitive than other people, want to
know that what they give to museums will be cared for, will be ex-
hibited, and will be used by scholars and perhaps even school
children. Thus acquisitions may well be the result of other activities,
not an alternative to them. If the age of sheer acquisitiveness, of
acquisitiveness for its own sake is over, museum officials must not
react to its excesses by turning their attention away from a prudent
and measured program of acquisitions, acquisitions for use.

In the case of the Smithsonian, this will involve several things
apart from encouraging our Zoo animals to reproduce and our
natural historians to collect in the field. It will involve continuing
efforts to demonstrate that what we acquire is properly cared for
and imaginatively used. It will involve continuing requests for funds
to be used in the acquisition of objects that are urgently needed to
fill gaps in our collections, objects that complete the historical record
or make possible an important exhibition, which might never come
to us if we were to rely solely upon the uncertainties of gifts and
bequests. It means also that we will continue to hope for a change
in the tax laws that will once again encourage artists to donate their
own works to musuems. To the extent that these efforts are suc-
cessful and this hope is realized, future generations will be able
to build upon our achievements as we endeavor to build upon those
of our predecessors.

170 / Smithsonian Year 1975
Archives of American Art

That research in American art is a thriving activity is clearly re-
flected in the growing use of documentary resources at the Archives
of American Art. During the past year students and more advanced
scholars made 1750 visits to consult Archives holdings at the five
regional offices in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Detroit,
and San Francisco, an increase of more than 400 over the number
in 1974. Researchers in thirty-two states and three foreign coun-
tries borrowed 550 rolls of microfilm through interlibrary loans.

In serving the needs of art historians, the Archives continues
to seek out and assemble the records of artists, dealers, critics, and
art societies. Over 250 collections were accessioned this year,
some of them of major significance for investigations of American
art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The papers of the
contemporary sculptor Joseph Cornell, the largest single group
received, include quantities of notes, correspondence, clippings,
and the objects and artifacts that comprised the elements of
Cornell’s work. Other especially useful collections were the papers
of the art historian William Seitz; of the painters Philip Evergood,
Abraham Rattner, and Moses Soyer; of the dealers Martin Birn-
baum and Betty Parsons; of the architect Albert Kahn; and of the
photographer Imogen Cunningham. Diaries kept by the painter
Robert Henri over a fifty-year period were lent for microfilming,
as were important groups of letters from Frederick Remington,
Charles Burchfield, Frank Duveneck, and Bernard Berenson.

“From Reliable Sources,” the first exhibition of letters, photo-
graphs, and other documents selected from Archives holdings,
commemorated the Archives’ twentieth anniversary. Installed in
an attractively designed room made available by the National
Portrait Gallery, the exhibition opened in November to enthus-
iastic acclaim from both press and public. An illustrated catalogue
published for the occasion includes transcripts of the documents
shown, together with introductory essays on the Archives and on
the significance of historical papers.

The Archives staff devoted much effort during the year to the
preparation of a comprehensive checklist of Archives holdings.
Over 3000 entries incorporate information on quantity, inclusive
dates, and forms of documentation. The checklist will be pub-

lished for distribution to libraries and art history departments on a
national basis. The Archives continues to bring its resources to the
attention of the scholarly community through its quarterly Journal,
which carries articles based on Archives holdings and describes
recent acquisitions. In another move to inform students of useful
research material at the Archives, the Area Directors instituted a
series of talks at university art history departments in Massachu-
setts, Michigan, and California.

The Archives Oral History Project carried on its work of
recording reminiscences and thoughts of persons involved in
American art. Taped interviews with two elder statesmen of the
museum world, Bartlett Hayes and William Milliken, provide

172 / Smithsonian Year 1975
detailed information on their careers. Among artists interviewed
during the year were Andrew Dasburg, Jimmie Ernst, Robert
Motherwell, Isama Hoguchi, and Claes Oldenburg.

More than fifty books, articles, exhibition catalogues, disserta-
tions, and theses completed in 1975 acknowledged assistance from
the Archives. These included published monographs on Albert
Bierstadt, Ward Lockwood, and Everett Shinn, catalogues on Cecilia
Beaux and David Smith, articles on Raphael Peale and Benjamin
West, and dissertations on Alexander Calder and Max Weber.
Articles on the Archives appeared in the New York Times and
several art periodicals, including three published in California.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum
of Decorative Arts and Design

Renovation was begun in the summer of 1974 on the Andrew
Carnegie Mansion—future home of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
of Decorative Arts and Design—at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue
in New York City. Work is scheduled for completion by October
1975 at which time the Museum will install its collections, library,
and exhibitions for a March 1976 opening. The opening exhibition
is being designed by architect Hans Hollein, with significant inter-
national participation. In conjunction with the main exhibition,
the Museum is organizing thirty satellite exhibitions in museums,
libraries, and universities in New York—lending collections which
are particularly suited to those institutions. The satellite exhibitions
will serve as an “homage” to the Cooper-Hewitt.

The Museum organized the first full-scale exhibition of Winslow
Homer drawings, water colors, and paintings to appear in Europe.
The exhibition opened at the Victoria and Albert in London in
November 1974 to great acclaim. Other exhibitions of Cooper-
Hewitt material during the year were ‘““Thomas Moran: Drawings
of the West,” “Frederic E. Church Oil Sketches and Drawings,”
“Italian Drawings and Master Printmakers,” and “Prints by
Whistler, Hassam, and Moran.” In addition, the Cooper-Hewitt
participated in exhibitions at twenty museums and galleries.

A first in a series of exhibitions outside the Museum’s walls took
place in June. The exhibition “Immovable Objects” invited visitors

History and Art / 173
to view objects in Lower Manhattan—buildings, plazas, piers,
parks, street furniture—either for their intrinsic architectural
quality or for their effect on the design of the city. A catalogue
was published which served as a guide to the objects and which
listed a series of events—parades, tours, special exhibitions—in
the area.

The Museum accepted 886 gifts for the collections and 39,317
items for the library. Among the most important were a large
group of designs by Simon Lissim for porcelain, silver, playing
cards, and screens; an eighteenth-century altar frontal embroidered
in China for the Western market; and seventeen pieces of art
