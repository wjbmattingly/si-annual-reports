THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accept-
ing the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establish-
ment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice
President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart-
ments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the
Smithsonian Board of Regents.

A Decade of “Increase and Diffusion”

S. DILLON RIPLEY

THIS IS THE TENTH Annual Report of the Institution which I have had
\the honor to prepare. In these years it has been a surcease to find how
stable the aspects of the Smithsonian have been which match the
needs of the people. “Increase and diffusion,” that tantalizing phrase,
continues to be our watchword. We attempt to adhere steadily to cer-
tain goals, and to eschew transitory fads.

This past year in Washington has been one of a kind of misty sus-
pension, like the haze that hangs over the river bottom in the early
mornings spring and fall, in our famous marshes of reclaimed land,
known as “Foggy Bottom.” This curious state of suspense has been
somewhat akin to sitting in an operating theatre, although the sur-
geons were invisible and the body only faintly lighted in a penumbral
shade, waiting for the eclipse to go away. Day by day there were con-
flicting sounds, adumbrations which swirled about us through the
medium of the news. The shadows lengthened during the year as if
the operation was too long and the body might turn into a cadaver.
But later the pall eased, we breathed again, realizing that the patient
would recover, the body politic was alive after all. For in the process
we all survived. The surgery had not really been directed entirely to
any one person. It has been a kind of psychosurgery or mental vivi-
section directed at us all, and in the end we may have emerged better,
we hope, for the ordeal. From the Smithsonian towers we can docu-
ment the events, hopeful that in time we can present an objective vi-
sion of this segment of the history of our times for those who come to
see and learn from our “diffusion.”

In science the Smithsonian’s research, our “increase,” continues in
the study of the natural world about us, the objects of creation on the
land, the seas, and the phenomena they enclose; and the planets, the

measuring of our Earth against them, the Sun and its effect upon us;|
and the steady tabulation of the phenomena of outer space.
In history we continue with our encyclopaedic endeavors in the}

they represent.

In art we continue to follow our mandate to preserve, collect, ex-|
hibit, and encourage the study of American art, its roots in the rest of|
the world, and its current evolution. With the present interest of our!
government in sponsoring and supporting the arts and humanities, a
new PAVESI) in TSG at Jeast, begins to emerge. Although sepagy

share common tasks, and both work together progressively oll
the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. This is especially,
important in the forthcoming events of the Bicentennial years. In ad-|
dition there is much to interest the Endowments in the new art mu-|
seum opening on the Mall in October, 1974, and in the burgeoning;
studies in art and art history being undertaken by the various Smith-|
sonian enterprises, as well as in the living Folk Festivals. What a!
celebration of the American Spirit these Endowments have become,,
and how vital their part in encouraging American creativity as well as)
cultural history and research! |

All of which is to say that like the Endowments the Smithsonian i ia
alive and well, whether in science or in art, and that each year its:
purposes and its services are becoming increasingly apparent and:
comprehensible to our people. As the Institution becomes more un-,
derstood so the morale of its staff improves. We all realize the impor-|
tance to our citizens of what we are doing, and this improves our own}
quality and our dedication. So be it. |

As we become more important to people, our visitors increase, our)
memberships in the Associates increase, our magazine and related,
publications and benefits reach out further and further (our member-:
ships now are 622,000) and so our responsibilities to be true to our}
goals and to increase and diffuse knowledge become more evident. |
Our obligations to ourselves for standards and quality have not’
changed, but these very traditions of ours become more visible. As’
this happens, we pay a kind of penalty—that of being noticed. For)
years I had thought many of the things that the Smithsonian justi

4 / Smithsonian Year 1974 |
went on doing quietly and competently were underappreciated and
‘in effect undervalued. Our knowledge about the environment of the
planet and our knowledge of the solar system seemed to me so com-
prehensive that I was disturbed that more people did not know about
all this, or that only those in cloistered circles were party to our work
and failed to noise it abroad. Now with our new exposure there is by
contrast a penalty to popularity. It is what I used to call “joining the
old shower club.” By becoming noticed one becomes the subject of
uriosity, sometimes the object of criticism, or even envy (if doing
things well). We are, I am sure, prepared to pay the penalty for con-
tinuing to do well what we are charged with doing, and to that we can
say, amen.

Suffice it to affirm that we will continue to prepare to play host to

an increment of several million visitors a year who come in spite of
the obstacles of traffic, outmoded transportation, increasing costs,
and stultifying living and travel handicaps. And we will continue to
ight for their right to come in spite of obstacles placed in their way
by time and circumstance. For we know that it is in the interests of
the people and their increasing desire to know themselves that they
hould come and see our Institution, and we know that in this we
ave the support and the enthusiasm of the Congress who continue
o find the work of the Smithsonian refreshing.*

Last year I wrote a good deal about the Bicentennial and the Smith-
onian’s essential activities in the long-past Centennial of 1876.
eanwhile, sparked by the new administration under John Warner,
the 1976 Bicentennial approaches with every breath we breathe, and
our own preparations for “76 wax apace. Our first major Portrait Gal-
ery exhibition has opened to critical acclaim. Our renovations of the
rts and Industries Building have started in order to make it an evoc-

? Professor Wilcomb Washburn reminds me of a diary entry of Congressman

denry L. Dawes of Massachusetts who came to Washington to serve in 1852,
ind speaks of the Institution —
_ “The Smithsonian Institute is the noblest of all monuments ever erected in
he United States. Washington lives in the affections and reverence of his coun-
tymen justly before all others and the great monument going up to his memory
s in a corresponding degree an object of interest. (The Washington Monument
nas still under construction.) But the Institute is at once a monument and an
ngine of power, a fountain of knowledge, a bulwark for the preservation of
he liberties Washington bequeathed. It has been founded and is rising in grand
‘ofty proportions ‘for the diffusion of knowledge among men.’ And so long as
t shall fulfill its mission fears are idle — Man will be free.”

ative setting of what the Centennial of 1876 was all about. Addition-|
ally we are planning on a strong effort to accommodate our visitors |
with guidance, information, food, protection, and a sense of wel-'|
come and enthusiastic reception.
A whole series of things—exhibits, happenings, publications, tes-
taments to human curiosity, and just plain fun—will be awaiting |
them in 1976, not least of which will be an entire new museum dedi-
cated to America’s single and most salutary technological achieve-
ment, an achievement which has helped to expand and rework our |
culture in all its ramifications, the conquest of air and space. Can |
there be any insentient people alive today in this country who do not
realize that the conquest of air, and now of space, has changed our
perspectives, our culture, indeed our ethos? In essence increasingly |
rapid modes of flight have abolished time, pressed the concept of
communications close to human tolerance through the continuing |
evolution of the computer, helped to abolish faith, and prepared us
for anew and as yet uncharted way of viewing the human condition. |
America, I hope, will be thinking of 2076 by the time the Bicenten- |
nial comes along. And in that connection we might as well have a |

|
look at the panorama showing how we reached our present predica- |
ment. Our untrammeled will to succeed, to better our style of life i
through our communication and transport, has put us where we are. |
We could call our Air and Space Museum last year’s Pandora’s Box, |
and looking in visualize what we had better do about next year’s. For |
we have not stopped the clock in the past, and if we are to slow it
down in the future we will have to realize what has been happening |
to make so much of that future inevitable. In his recent (1974) short
book, Robert Heilbroner questions the continued hegemony of |
organized science under the present threat of anew Dark Age for our |
civilization. That we face the possibility of anew Dark Age in history _
is evident to many. As an ecologist, I have found the recent discus- |
sions of economists and social scientists on the subject of the inter- :
dependence of population trends and the use of natural resources, |
agriculture, industrial growth, and pollution, a kind of coming home >
to roost, neo-Malthusian thinking caught up with Volterra-Gause ©
hypotheses of strategies of competition in nature. Heilbroner believes |
that science and technology have developed in an inimical manner to
foster runaway population, cataclysmic wars, and environmental —
degradation without compensating restraints and standards, includ-

ing moral and ethical controls. He postulates that religion will and
must rise again to insure the reawakening of civilization itself. As
with a see-saw, he envisages science losing its paramountcy as reli-
gion arises once more. This to me is overly simplistic. An economist
can afford perhaps to be an agnostic, but most philosophically in-
clined scientists—physicists (who perforce must be philosophers),
molecular biologists, and the best of the ecologists—will tell you that
they hold to an essential faith in laws of creation, which are indeed
the moral and ethical presumption on which religion is based. What-
ever limits to creation we may have plumbed, it is a popular fiction
to assume that in the process scientists have destroyed our faith.
All of which is not to say that it is not worthwhile to have men of
the caliber of Heilbroner, as social scientists, becoming aware of eco-
logical principles. Jan Tinbergen, winner of the Nobel prize in eco-
‘nomics, told me recently that he owed a great part of his somewhat
unorthodox theoretical assumptions to new insights he had gained
from his brother Nikolaas, a Nobel prize winner in biological medi-
‘cine, who is a pioneer in the study of the behavior of animals under
field conditions, away from laboratory controls, where they are
guided by and demonstrate ecological principles. It is sad that the
social sciences have classically paid so little attention to the broad
truths of ecology.
| In the past year we had the novel experience of the turning off of
the taps which supply our gasoline pumps, and Americans—repre-
| senting six percent of the world’s population but conditioned to
gobbling up nearly forty percent of the world’s resources—are just
| now beginning to get the message. Our massive indifference to in-
ternational bureaux and offices talking about one-world politics, eco-
emacs, and world interdependence has been conditioned over the
years by the perfect conviction that being an American is a natural
‘condition which we assume carries with it all the perquisites of tech-
nological superiority over our fellow inhabitants of the planet. No
matter that there are inequities in the United States itself—-we know
that also—but what many citizens, temporarily enraged by such in-
‘equities, overlook is our commonly held assumption, all of us, that
the automobile and the open road, the shopping center, and the fan-
tastic and dazzling distribution of material goods at all levels is a
‘natural right. As Americans, either richer or poorer, we have it way
‘over eighty percent of the rest of the people of the world.

Statement by the Secretary / 7
Whether we deserve it all or not seldom gives us pause, although
last winter’s threat of gas rationing was at least a temporary aberra-
tion in the hiatus between winter holidays and summer vacation. 3
Now that the gas taps have turned on again, it is easy to believe that |
all’s right with the world once more. It is easy to forget the unpleas-
antness of the spectre of declining resources.

In this state of vague malaise the conviction has come to many
younger and also minority group members that the survival of the }
Republic is uncertain. Whereas historians or political scientists glori- |
fied the successes of America, based on the application of intelli-
gence, others such as Jean-Francois Revel now describe what is hap- |
pening in America as a revolution, which indeed it is. But we can take |
heart in his definition of revolution, provided ethics survive, for in |
the process we may approach a truer mode of life and an understand- |
ing of what we are about. I have written before of what the Smith- |
sonian could provide as a means of exhibiting this process of under-
standing. I feel it could be done in what I have called a Museum of |
the Family of Man, a synthesis of thinking about man’s place in the |
universe.

People in the United States have come full circle in their ideas. Two |
generations ago and more the thought was that this new frontier, this I
boundless Nation, would serve as a melting pot wherein all would |
be remade into an indigenous American mold. Here all the nations —
would provide of their best, most daring, and adventurous spirits,
who, in this heady atmosphere of opportunity, would become
blended into what de Tocqueville and others thought of as the new
American breed. |

The romantic spirit, descendant of the philosophical idealism of |
the spirit of the revolutions, took no account of the remainder of the |
native Americans, that remnant which thoughtful men at the time of
the Nation’s Centennial had feared would have gone extinct by the |
twentieth century. Nor were the blacks or Mexican-Americans con- |
sidered. Eighty years later, by the 1930s, the Indian population was |
recovering from its doldrums of the turn of the century, the Mexican _
and Latin American minorities were increasing in the Southwest and _ |
in the eastern urban centers, and the blacks—Raymond Pearl had |
prophesied that the black population would disappear for genetic |
reasons in two hundred years or so. Instead of homogenization we .
now, approaching our Bicentennial, celebrate ethnic diversity and

8 / Smithsonian Year 1974
cultural pluralism. Whether our blacks or other minority types with
recognizable physical features disappear or not is moot. Black is
beautiful and the liberated American today eschews the melting pot

and embraces the reawakened realization that traditions of old ways

persist in the New World, that song, dance, drama, the arts, lan-

guage—all the stuff of culture—continue to exist, to be perpetu-
ated in strongly persistent patterns. We cannot entirely forget our

cultural heritage even as a multiplicity of physical types remains

permanent in our midst. Perhaps then we have learned a lesson that
biologists of years ago would have been tempted to support, that
blending inheritance is far more rare than the persistence of basic
traits and types, and that cultural patterns mirror in their persever-
ance these physical verities.

Under the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Smithsonian,
too, should come full circle. We can create a summing up of the
American experience, a synthesis of all that we have learned, the in-
teractions of man on this part of the planet, the interface between

_ ourselves and our environment. A Museum of the Family of Man

then would include certain demonstrable American themes, includ-

_ing the history of the United States folk, who had come here, when
_and how, and how this had changed the land and sea and air, its past

and present face. Hopefully, such an illumination of our times could

include, with the aid of computer systems and current technology, an
informed projection of our evolution, both physically and culturally,
into the future, our own “Brave New World.”

More importantly, as my colleague Under Secretary Brooks has

_ emphasized, such a museum must suggest the continuing process of

man’s evolution as a creator. As he phrases it, “From all the testa-

ments of man’s creativity, we can recognize at least two kinds of

multi-millennial chains of men and women who have created things,

technique’, or concepts relating to the physical world. The first kind

is in its important phase pre-literate and inventive; it has evolved the

_ basic physical conditions of human society and survival— as for in-

stance the cultivation of grains, domestication of animals, shelter,
mobility, etc. The second kind of succession is post-literate and con-

-ceptual; it has evolved understanding of the world, the universe,

man’s own nature, and the structures of thought itself. The two have

common ground but different approaches to understanding, and de-

serve equal honor. They proceed in common from man’s bio-psycho-

Statement by the Secretary / 9
logical heritage—his visual brain, manual dexterity, capacity for use

of symbols and language.”

To suggest the process means, of course, to avoid the static quality
of museums encompassed in arrays of finite objects, but rather to
formulate a kind of multimedia display, “engaging the viewer’s own
processes of thought and imagination.” The process is a speed-up
process too. From the unique fact that evolution provided the tools,
man’s ability to communicate effectively, and the evolution of man-
ual dexterity, has come the unfolding of brain integration in these
functions. Each system has buffered and supported the other, devel-
oping an end product unlike any other known on the planet. Thus
the diverging into the two types of creativity: the technologies of sur-
vival and the evolution of thought. In this latter aspect of creativity
there are the social inventions: ‘elaborations upon the family, the
tribe, the state, the organs of justice, legislation, administration,
caste, class, trade, education, war.” Then there is the invention of
social institutions, ““and the creators who formulated social thought

and promoted social action.” These historical creations are all rooted —

in man’s biological heritage as well, and of course have speeded up
enormously along with the evolution of technology.

In any discussion of process it is instructive to speculate about the —
possibility, achieved five years ago, of landing a man on the moon. |
Although the technologies existed to create orbiting machines in

space, James Webb has pointed out to me that the human factor, the
men who could manipulate the machines effectively enough to land
themselves on the lunar surface, and then blast off again to join up
with their circling companion, must have been brought up from
childhood in an atmosphere where the commonplaces of advanced

technology all worked. Communication by telephone, for example, is —

randomly so taken for granted in the U.S.A., because the telephones

work so relatively perfectly, that we are brought up and accustomed ©
to have perfect transmittal of ideas or mechanical concepts in using —

them. We do not have to have meetings or conferences face to face.
Our generations of people are thus habituated for learning and the
transfer of vital information in a way that a considerable part of the

H

rest of the world’s population is not, or has not been until very re- |

cently indeed. Thus the time lags implicit in technological condition-

ing and familiarity make for different phased levels of assimilation ©

of the processes of learning. The chances, therefore, are that only

one particular segment of peoples or culture may be capable of land-
ing on the moon at any one time. And I might add, at the risk of
sounding complacent or overweening, that even the prospect of a
perfect link-up in space as between the products of two cultures, our
own and the U.S.S.R.’s, may be more difficult because of the back-
ground and training of the participants than our global strategists
and politicians would wish.

This is one example of a truism in contemplating the history of the
family of man. No one group or segment of man, through the biolog-
ical and physical phenomena of geographical isolation, is exactly like
any other at points in time, as well as through the panorama of his-
tory, thus horizontally as well as vertically in a diagrammatic sense.
No museums have ever entirely encompassed all of the philosophical
and moral and physical implications which have resulted in our com-
plex world. It is a new way of looking at a subject that goes back to
ideas expressed in the last century, vested in the creation of the
Musée de l’Homme in Paris in 1877. Unfortunately the Musée de
l’‘Homme was an anthropology museum, and as I have said else-
where,” until very recently it had been thought, rather uncomfort-
ably, that anthropology, being a kind of biological discipline, should
concentrate on early man and the present so-called primitive races
of man, leaving Western civilization to the classicists and the stu-
dents of folk history and the decorative arts. This situation has now
begun to change. In Washington we are thinking of drawing from
everything that our museums, whether of natural history, history of
science, culture and technology, or art museums, are exhibiting, each
in its own way. We are concerned here with a new concept, a syn-
thesis of the whole family of man and how it got that way.

Interestingly enough we are not alone in this idea. We claim no
hegemony, of course. At the 1974 meeting of the International Coun-
cil of Museums held in Copenhagen, Mme. Nelly Motrocilova of the
Academy in Moscow, speaking on June 3rd, announced that the
U.S.S.R. too was thinking of the creation of a Museum of Man.
Suffice it to say that we shall be threshing out this concept over the
next year or two with ourselves, our committees such as the Smith-
sonian Council, and individual colleagues, with the hope that eventu-

Statement by the Secretary / 11
ally we can present a plan to the Congress for a new kind of museum
which could somehow embody the dreams of their constituencies
across this land, the realization by people of the United States that
their strength lies in the strength of their origins, their diversity and
the pride, courage, and hope that this can and must give them. Let
there be no despair then but a reasoned pride, measured with cour-
age and tempered with the sobering responsibilities that such self-
knowledge brings. The soothsayers and necromancers of today
adjure the young to think of themselves first, to cultivate their id, to
think first of “happiness” in a subjective sense. They have forgotten,
and the young with them, that they are not alone, but that within
themselves rests all the history of man.

The Institution’s “increase,” its research progress in history, the
arts, and the sciences, is listed in Smithsonian Year 1974. Suffice it
to say that both in astronomy and astrophysics, work under Director
George Field is taking form in programs of great promise, particu-
larly in regard to new observations of the Sun made during the flight
of the Orbiting Space Laboratory in the past year. Additionally, suc-
cessful research and construction proceeds in concert with the Uni-
versity of Arizona on the multiple-mirror telescope. In the National
Museum of Natural History a vigorous new array of exhibits is in
the planning stage under the direction of Dr. Porter Kier. Temperate
and tropical environmental studies are being vigorously pursued at
our stations in the United States as well as in Panama.

In the latter, significant efforts to enhance the staff as well as the
inventory-taking capability of the stations should begin to narrow
the gap between what we know about the New World tropics and
what limits to tolerance they possess in the face of man’s destructive
abilities. For in the vast New World tropics where, contrary to con-
ventional wisdom, perhaps only ten percent of the land is susceptible
to agriculture, there is precious little time to measure the norms of
the tropical environment. Human population pressure is seeing to
that, be it for better or worse. Few biologists could argue that any-
thing that is happening in the tropics today is for the better, but their
voices will not be heard in the tendentious political clamour of the
developing world. At the very least we hope that the data we gather
will serve as a guide to the essential diversity of the tropical environ-
ment and as an indicator for the future of the riches we seem about
to forsake so willfully. The recent remarks on May 29th by the new

12 / Smithsonian Year 1974

President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez, concerning that coun-

try’s proposed national policy on conservation of natural resources

are splendid, however. If Latin America, with some of the poorest
soils in the world, could heed President Perez’ speech then biologists
could breathe easier.

Finally in the realm of science, a great step forward this past year
has been the beginning of the National Zoo’s breeding project and
reserve at Front Royal, Virginia. Here is a conservation project in a
superb setting, which we hope will become a model of its kind, with
room for cooperation with zoological societies all over the country.

In history our staff has collected the Institution’s first Pulitzer
prize in the person of Professor Daniel Boorstin and his third volume
on The Americans: The Democratic Experience. All of us can take
pride in the outstanding historicoliterate achievements of this fa-
mous historian, who has resumed work as a Senior Historian after
four busy years as Director of the National Museum of History and
Technology. In this latter capacity he has been succeeded by another
eminent historian, Professor Brooke Hindle, sometime Dean, Arts
and Sciences, University College, at New York University, and head
of that university’s Department of History for many years. Mr.

_ Hindle is particularly an historian of science, and his coming is a
matter of great joy to all of us.

In the Museum of History and Technology this year we have also
celebrated the creation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for
Historical Research—a center for studies in the origins of war and
peace, headed by Professor Forrest C. Pogue, one of the preeminent
military historians of our time. This is a splendid augury for the Na-
tional Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board and may well be its
most salient contribution to the preservation of military history.

In the past year the Freer Gallery has celebrated its semicentennial
with thr splendid exhibitions accompanied by internationally at-
tended symposia, as well as the publication of lucid and beautifully
_ illustrated catalogues, and with the awarding of three Freer medals.
No one could fail to be heartened by the renewed interest in Chinese,
Japanese, and Islamic art which these exhibitions underscored. Over
200 scholars and students attended the colloquia, which were in-
_ tensely interesting and of high scholarly caliber. A symptom of the
_ universal importance placed on art in Japan was a special visit during
his stay in Washington by Prime Minister K. Tanaka.

Statement by the Secretary / 13
The National Portrait Gallery continued its striking series of his-
torical exhibits with a splendid exhibition and accompanying histori-
cal resource document, a catalogue on the Black Presence in the
American Revolution. Once again the Portrait Gallery has charted a
new and authoritative course in untraveled seas. I believe it is ob-
vious by now to most historians that this technique of exhibition and
wholly definitive catalogues is a new and unsuspected teaching tool
to remind us, as I have said earlier, that within us all resides the
history of man.

The National Collection of Fine Arts has continued its imaginative
program of exhibits, including a revealing one on the history of the
plastic arts in recent time in the Pacific Northwest. I personally was
_much moved by the evidence from the paintings of the expression
via palette tonalities of the difference between living in Oregon and
in Washington. Even in abstracts or in interiors the painters were

reflecting ‘a subtle neo-tradition not only of style but of color, evi-

dence of the mood and atmosphere, the light and color of the two
States. What reflections cannot be drawn on the origins of ethnicity,
of phenotypic differences, of cultural subspeciation in such
happenings?

A delightful footnote to the history of American art was the ex-
| hibition of the work of “Lilly Martin Spencer: The Joys of Senti-
ment,” the catalogue of which contains a brilliant introduction by
Director Joshua Taylor. The ncra’s collection of American portrait
miniatures, one of the best in this country, was placed on permanent
exhibition through the generosity of the Trustees of the Merrill
Trust. A special gallery designated the “Doris M. Magowan Gallery
of Portrait Miniatures” will exhibit these portrait miniatures for the
first time.

The substantial completion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden in this past year has signaled the arrival of the mam-
moth collections of art in Washington and their incipient debut in
their new public setting, an event long awaited. We anticipate for-
mally opening the museum on October 1, 1974. This museum should
help to illuminate Joseph Henry’s theme that the Mall is indeed a
people’s park, a place of delight for citizens. The gloomy myths
about the sacred sward and the hallowed ground were no more a
part of the original concept of the Republic than any other Victorian

Statement by the Secretary / 15
conceits. The Mall is for all of the citizens of the United States and
by no means a cemetery.

In this past year an additional West Coast branch of the Archives
of American Art has been opened by our energetic director, William
Woolfenden, and the Presidency has been assumed by Dr. Irving
Burton after three years of devoted work by Howard Lipman, who
now becomes President of the Board of the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York. We are deeply grateful to all these able
workers in the collation of the history of American art.

The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in
New York continues with its reconstruction plans for the Carnegie
Mansion, for which over $1 million has already been raised. Under
the energetic chairmanship of Lewis A. Lapham, who has succeeded
Thomas J. Watson, Jr., as Chairman of the National Associates
Board, a subcommittee has been formed to enlist the support of New
York members, residents, and their wives to complete the reconstruc-
tion of the site for our National Museum of Design.

Nearer at home our management enterprises and our reexamina-
tion of our structure proceed apace. In any sensible organization
there must come periodic assessments of where one is and where one
is going. In the process of keeping track of our “fragmented parts
which make a whole,” as Joshua Taylor has described us, we periodi-
cally check the pace of our development. Are we running ourselves
ragged with too many activities? Can we achieve the discipline to
confine ourselves to our stated goals before natural accumulations
run away with us? For in the sense of our museums and collections,
the Smithsonian is a growth industry. Perhaps museums are one of
the only legitimate growth industries left? I think we can manage +o
stay the course by perceiving common themes that unite us intellec-
tually, and not simply approach efficient controls as an administra-
tive function. For in our hope to “increase and diffuse knowledge
among men” lies an ideal as well as a responsible charge. We monitor
the processes continually, firm in our determination to illuminate
that ideal.

In the realm of “diffusion,’”’ this past year has seen the Smithson-
ian undertake a new series of television programs under the direction
of David Wolper, with sponsorship by the du Pont Company. The
first program on matters of Smithsonian interest is expected to be re-

16 / Smithsonian Year 1974

;
leased in November, 1974. In all of these enterprises with new at-
tempts to increase and diffuse knowledge an enormous amount of
credit is due to the staff of this Institution, which in its many ramifi-
cations continues its devotion and effective assistance to our cause at
all levels.

As part of the Smithsonian Product Development program, re-
ports indicate that in addition to previously approved craft items,
there will be authentic reproductions of pewter, silver, and textiles,
all based on existing Smithsonian documentation.

During the past year I have lost two of my friends. For the ten
years of my tenure I have had the perfect conviction of longevity, se-
cure in the belief that my three predecessors would be continually
available as counsellors and reminders of the continuity of our hopes
for the Institution. As I have noted in Smithsonian (November, 1973,
and February, 1974), Dr. Wetmore and I have lost our two col-
leagues, Dr. Leonard Carmichael, my predecessor as Secretary, on
September 16,1973, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, his immediate prede-
cessor as Secretary, on December 17, 1973. Together we had seemed
a continuous chain, reaching back in time to when the Republic itself
was less than a century old. They had helped and encouraged me to
celebrate our own Smithson bicentennial in 1965, the 200th Anniver-
sary of our Founder’s birth, a noble occasion reminding us all of the
academic and intellectual links of institutions like our own around
the world. We mourn their passing and the loss of contact with the
past which always helps to prepare us for the premonitions of the
future.

Board of Regents

THE BOARD OF REGENTS held three meetings in fiscal year 1974. The
autumn meeting, convened on September 21, 1973, was designated
The Leonard Carmichael Memorial Meeting in honor of Dr. Car-
michael, the seventh Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. As an
appropriate tribute to his memory, the Regents unanimously de-
clared that the auditorium of the National Museum of History and
_ Technology, constructed during his tenure, hereafter be known as
_ the Leonard Carmichael Auditorium. A ceremony dedicating the Au-
_ ditorium was held on January 21, 1974, presided over by the Chan-
cellor, accompanied by music and with tributes from Dr. John Har-
_ per, Rector of St. John’s Church, Dr. Melvin Payne, President of the
- National Geographic Society, and the Secretary.

The new Chairman of the National Board of the Smithsonian As-
sociates, Mr. Lewis A. Lapham succeeding Mr. Thomas J. Watson,
_ Jr., was assured of enthusiastic support by the Regents, who en-
dorsed the concept that the Institutional Development Committee of
_the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates undertake the
Cooper-Hewitt capital fund raising as its first effort.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory from 1955 to 1973, retired in July, 1973, and is to con-
tinue his work as Senior Research Scientist. The Regents voted to
award him the Henry Medal in recognition of his important contri-
_ butions to the Institution.

Mr. Gordon N. Ray, Chairman of the Smithsonian Council, who
was present, briefly reviewed the activities of the Council since its
_ inception, citing its membership, its considerations, and conclusions.
The Board of Regents thanked Mr. Ray for his efforts and conveyed
appreciation to the Council members for their interest and work in
_ behalf of the Institution.

The appointment of James H. Billington as Director of the Wood-
_ row Wilson International Center for Scholars was announced.

The death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, a great benefactor

of the Smithsonian Institution, occurred on September 12, 1973. A

Statement by the Secretary / 19
Smithsonian Committee was organized to work with the representa-
tives of Mrs. Post’s estate and foundation to facilitate an orderly
transfer of the property and collections bequeathed to the Smith-
sonian.

Subsequently the Board of Regents, their wives, members of the
National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, and the Chairman
of the Smithsonian Council gathered for the presentation of the
James Smithson Benefactor Medallion to Thomas J. Watson, Jr.,
for his important contributions to the Smithsonian Institution.

The January 25, 1974, meeting of the Board of Regents was desig-
nated The Charles Greeley Abbot Memorial Meeting in tribute to
the Smithsonian Institution’s fifth Secretary, whose death occurred
in December at the age of 101. Appropriately, the Radiation Biology
Laboratory will bear Dr. Abbot’s name henceforward, since this as-
pect of the Institution’s research owes its genesis, in 1929, to Dr.
Abbot.

The meeting took place at the Fort Pierce Bureau of the Smith-
sonian Institution located at Fort Pierce, Florida, including the
Harbor Branch Laboratory, as well as the research barge and the RV
Johnson. Secretary Ripley explained the history of the Fort Pierce
Bureau, its programs, and its plans for the future. A tour of the facili-
ties included brief talks by staff members, a tour of the model shop,
inspection of the submersible, and a demonstration of the launch and
recovery of the submarine.

It was with great reluctance that the Executive Committee ac-
cepted the decision of Crawford Greenewalt not to stand for reap-
pointment after serving for eighteen years as an outstanding and
distinguished Regent.

The Regents accepted the Acee Blue Eagle collection of paintings
and artifacts in order to foster interest in and understanding of
American Indian art and culture. It will be housed in the Anthropo-
logical Archives of the Department of Anthropology of the National
Museum of Man.

The Smithsonian was granted a permit by the General Services
Administration for use of the former Beef Cattle Experiment Station
at Front Royal, Virginia; the National Zoological Park plans initially
to utilize this reserve for a breeding project.

The spring meeting of the Board was held in the Regents’ Room of
the Smithsonian Building on May 14, 1974. A Nominating Commit-

20 / Smithsonian Year 1974

tee appointed by the Chancellor submitted its recommendation for a
new Citizen Regent and for reappointment of two other Citizen Re-
gents whose terms were to expire. Joint resolutions were recom-
mended to be introduced in the Congress for these appointments.

The Board authorized acceptance of a Zeiss planetarium instru-
ment, a Bicentennial gift from the Federal Republic of Germany.
This will be installed in the National Air and Space Museum to simu-
late the wonders of space and is expected to be operating when the
Museum opens in July, 1976. The instrument is to be named in
honor of the late Albert Einstein.

The Regents received the report of the second Smithsonian Priori-
ties Conference convened at the Belmont Conference Center on Feb-
ruary 19-21, 1974, which pointed out in detail the progress of Smith-
sonian programs in the past year, and recommended additional steps
to be taken in administration and management within the Institu-
tion. Coupled with this were copies of a new survey of buildings and
facilities owned or occupied by the Institution.

FINANCIAL REPORT

T. AMES WHEELER, TREASURER

CONTINUED SOUND PROGRESS was shown in Smithsonian finances in
fiscal year 1974. Thanks to increased federal support and further im-
provement in results of the Institution’s own educational and reve-
nue-generating efforts, we were able to cope satisfactorily with the
large inflation-bred rise in costs of salaries, supplies, and services,
and, at the same time, to strengthen our current operating funds
position.

Added federal appropriations enabled us to increase needed
museum protection and other support services and to step up prepa-
rations for our important 1976 Bicentennial commitments. These in-
cluded steady progress on construction and future exhibits for the
new National Air and Space Museum and a beginning on a major
long-term reconstruction of National Zoological Park facilities. An
additional $1-million gift from the donor of the collections permitted
completion of the construction of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden. Other gifts and grants for specific purposes funded a
wide variety of research and exhibit activities.

There remains an urgent need for major outside contributions in
support of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and De-
sign and a large number of other specific projects. Also, the Institu-
tion’s endowment funds — always far from adequate for an Institu-
tion of this size — experienced during the year a worrisome drop in
value. In other respects, however, Smithsonian finances can be said
to have improved substantially in fiscal year 1974. Full detail of these
results is provided below.

23
Overall Sources and Application of Financial Support

The total financial support available to the Institution from all}
sources is shown in Table 1. These figures do not include the finances:
of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for}
Scholars, which are all related legislatively to the Smithsonian but!
whose financial and administrative affairs are for the most part sepa- |
rately managed under independent Boards of Trustees.

Total funds for operating purposes rose to $82,681,000 in fiscal |)
year 1974, an increase of $10,607,000 over the preceding year. Fed- +
eral appropriations of $65,063,000 accounted for 78.7 percent of they
total, research grants and contracts 12.1 percent, and nonfederal in- :
come 9.2 percent; this ratio of support was roughly the same in fiscal |)
year 1973. In addition, Congress provided $21,860,000 in construc- |
tion funds for continuing work on the National Air and Space Mu- |
seum, for repairs to other Smithsonian buildings, and for the Na- |
tional Zoological Park, principally for “Lion Hill,” a major beginning |
on the long-term renovation plan of Zoo facilities. :

In Table 2, these revenues from all sources (excluding construction ||
funds and the Special Foreign Currency Program) and their applica-'
tion to individual Smithsonian bureaus and activities are shown in|
considerable detail, demonstrating the complexity of funding result-
ing from the variety of resources and the large number of diversified ’
services provided.

FEDERAL OPERATING FUNDS

Federal appropriations for operating purposes totaled $65,063,000),
including $1,695,000 for the Smithsonian Science Information Ex- +
change, a separately incorporated organization, and $4,500,000 for’
the Special Foreign Currency Program (in the blocked currency of’
certain foreign countries). The Special Foreign Currency Program |
administers grants to United States universities and similar organi- »
zations for research studies in Egypt, India, Pakistan, Poland, Tu- |
nisia, and Yugoslavia (see Table 3). This program included a special |
$1,000,000 amount (to be renewed for three additional years) to al- |
low United States participation in UNESCO’s international campaign.
to preserve archeological monuments on the Island of Philae in |

Egypt.

Excluding these special-purpose appropriations for the Science In-
formation Exchange and the Foreign Currency Program, federal op-
erating funds amounted to $58,868,000. This is $7,235,000 more
than fiscal year 1973, but $4,180,000 (58 percent) of this substantial
increase is attributable solely to meeting the costs of federal pay
raises of various categories beyond the Institution’s control. The bal-
ance of the increase, $3,055,000, went primarily to three high-
priority program objectives. These were (1) preparation of exhibits
and related work of the National Air and Space Museum scheduled
to open in its new building on the Mall on July 4, 1976; (2) develop-
ment of special Washington, D. C., and national Bicentennial activi-
ties; and (3) phased strengthening of supporting services such as
museum object conservation; reference and research libraries; auto-
matic data processing applications to research, collections, and
administrative activities; and buildings and facilities care and protec-
tion. Allocation of the appropriations for operating purposes (ex-
cluding the Foreign Currency Program) by broad activity areas ove
the past several years is shown in Table 4.

It may be of interest to note that in performance terms about $12.5
million of the fiscal year 1974 appropriation was spent on basic re-

search in art, history, and science; $4.2 million on the acquisition |

and management of collections (only a few hundred thousand dollars

of this were available for the purchase of objects); $7.1 million for |

FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS

(Construction funding in fiscal year 1974 amounted to $4,860,000,
plus $17,000,000 to meet progress payments under the contract au-
ithority provided in the fiscal year 1973 Appropriation Act for the
cconstruction of the National Air and Space Museum. The new ap-
opropriatiom provided primarily for the construction of the exciting
mew lion and tiger exhibit at the National Zoological Park and fur-
ther planning efforts aimed at implementing the approved master
»plan for the complete renovation of the Zoo. This funding also pro-
wided relatively minor amounts for repairs and improvements to

jother Smithsonian facilities such as safety and access improvements
to the Mount Hopkins Observatory road in Arizona.

GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

Grants and contracts from federal agencies once again contributed in
a major way to the Institution’s research programs, predominantly
in scientific disciplines. $9,996,000 of these funds was expended in
fiscal year 1974, up from $8,996,000 in fiscal year 1973. The major
recipient, accounting for over half of the total expenditures, con-
tinued to be the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, with grants from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for such projects as the monitoring of
Comet Kahoutek, meteor studies, and design of hydrogen maser
systems. Other projects ranged from ecological studies in South
America and Asia to research on American folklore. Table 5 shows

the major granting agencies to the Smithsonian over a four-year |
period, representing several hundred different grants and contracts |

each year.

PRIVATE TRUST FUNDS

Originally established entirely with funds from Mr. Smithson’s be- |
quest, the Institution has, over a long period of years, derived an in- |
creasing proportion of its support from federal appropriations as it |
was entrusted with more national collections and expanded its re- |

search and public exhibitions.

It is now an important goal of Smithsonian administration to bol- |
ster the Institution’s private resources in line with or exceeding the |
growth of its federal support, in order to restore a better balance be- |

tween the two, thereby helping to preserve its uniquely flexible and
independent character among national establishments. Despite the

many serious economic uncertainties of this past 12-month period, |
fiscal year 1974 results were in line with this goal. Receipts (includ- |
ing those for operating purposes, land acquisition, and building con- |
struction) from gifts, investment income, revenue-producing activi- |
ties, fees, and other revenues all increased to record levels, with the |

total equaling $8,954,000 (not including $105,000 gifts to endow-

ment funds). Of this total $5,598,000 was designated for specific |
restricted purposes; this latter amount was fractionally higher than |
in fiscal year 1973, while income for unrestricted purposes rose from |

$1,013,000 to $3,356,000 (see Table 6).

UNRESTRICTED PRIVATE FUNDS

The substantial increase in unrestricted general purpose private
funds in fiscal year 1974 was extremely welcome and enabled the
Institution for the first time to reserve private monies for plant im-
provements not believed to be obtainable from federal appropria-
tions but which will enhance our ability to serve the public and
which may, at the same time, lead to increased private support in the
years ahead. The build-up of the general unrestricted fund balance
to a more adequate level of $3,067,000 also means that portions of
any similar gains in future years may also be used for this purpose
or to strengthen our present low endowment reserves.

As may be seen in Table 7, the increase in income before transfers
to other funds, equaling $2,336,000 in fiscal year 1974 compared to
$688,000 in fiscal year 1973, arose in part from a jump in investment
income but, more importantly, from successful results of our educa-
tional and revenue-producing activities. There was, at the same time,
a somewhat offsetting rise in administrative costs, partly from salary
and other administrative cost increases (including an initial charge
of $198,000 to establish a reserve for employees’ accrued annual
leave), but also reflecting greater assistance to a number of bureaus
for special needs and urgent research projects.

The increase in investment income this year resulted primarily
from the build-up in working capital and advance Smithsonian mag-
azine subscription monies which made more funds available for in-
vestment in high quality short-term issues at prevailing high interest
rates. As may be noted on the Balance Sheet, page 48, current fund
investments equaled $8,298,000 as of June 30, 1974, compared to
$6,223,000 a year earlier; of the former amount, $6,600,000 was
invested in very high grade, short-term securities and bank certifi-
cates of deposit.

The Smithsonian magazine was responsible for the largest share
of the net gain from revenue-producing activities. As shown in Table
8, its income for the year rose to $1,327,000, from $330,000 in the
previous year. At June 30, 1974, there were 622,000 National Asso-
ciate members and subscribers to the magazine, making it one of the
fastest growing publications in the Nation. The Associates program
also contributed heavily to this year’s gains, with net income of
$263,000, versus a slight loss in fiscal year 1973. The Resident Asso-

** Includes Traveling Exhibitions, Belmont Conference Center, Photo Sales, ‘“Commons” Restaurant,

*** This includes allocations to the Press and other Smithsonian bureaus participating in this pro-
gram.

The profitability of the Museum Shops also increased dramati-
cally, from $47,000 in fiscal 1973 to $226,000 in fiscal 1974, due in
large measure to improved management practices and increased em-
phasis on higher quality merchandise relevant to the collections ex-
hibited in the various Smithsonian museums. As with the Product
Development Program, which transferred $33,000 of royalities to in-
dividual bureaus, income from the Museum Shops will in the future
be shared with the museums for their use in public education pro-
grams and purchases for the collections.

The Performing Arts Division produced an extremely successful
record album, the History of Jazz, which enabled them to show a
gain of $104,000 in this fiscal year, as opposed to a deficit of $65,000

34 / Smithsonian Y ear 1974

in fiscal year 1973. Another “bestseller” was the guidebook, Seeing

the Smithsonian, developed by the Smithsonian Press and Product

Development Offices in cooperation with the css Publishing Com-

pany; its sales added substantially to the profitability of the Museum

Shops.

As any surplus funds accrue from project receipts of the shops or
the Associates program an appropriate effort is made to return this
in kind to the public in the form of improved public facilities, im-
proved public reference books or publications, and improved public
exhibits. As an example, the unusually large net gain in unrestricted
private funds in fiscal year 1974 coincided with urgent requirements
for construction funds, necessitating transfers of $1,134,000 to the
Institution’s plant funds, with other transfers to Special Purpose
funds, Restricted Funds, and Endowment Funds bringing total trans-
fers to $1,561,000 (see Table 7). Of the transfers to plant funds,
$365,000 was set aside to redesign and reconstruct the museum shop
in the National Museum of History and Technology. Another $500,-
000 was reserved for a part of the costs of the proposed construction
of additional public service facilities in the West Court of the Na-

tional Museum of Natural History. Finally, $150,000 was transferred
to cover a part of the cost of a visitor’s study center at the Chesa-
peake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, and $119,000 was
transferred for computer and equipment purchases. Other transfers
from unrestricted funds include allocations toward operations of the

Cooper-Hewitt Museum ($178,000), special research grants to

Smithsonian scientists ($49,000), and transfers to Endowment

($121,000) which includes a bequest of $100,000 from the estate of
_ Paula Lambert.

A new category of unrestricted private funds (‘Special Purpose’)
is set out separately this year, namely, those which are legally un-
restricted but which have been designated by management to be re-
served for specific uses (see Table 6). These accounts, previously
treated as a part of Restricted Funds, include, for example, receipts
from parking at the Zoo (reserved to aid future construction of addi-
tional parking facilities for visitors), and revenues from various
minor enterprises in individual museums (e.g., charges for tour-
guide audiophone equipment, etc.) and related expenditures of these
monies, chiefly for improvement of exhibits. As of June 30, 1974,
' balances of these funds totaled $460,000, an increase of $259,000 in
| the year.

RESTRICTED PRIVATE FUNDS

The Restricted Private Funds of the Institution, which support a
wide variety of activities even beyond the major ones highlighted in
Table 9, received $4,266,000 for operating purposes in fiscal year
1974. The Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau depend
primarily on income from their endowment funds, while the Cooper-
Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design and the Archives of
American Art, although receiving some federal support, must look
to gifts, grants, memberships, and various money-raising efforts for
their principal operating funds. In addition, it was necessary to
transfer $178,000 of private unrestricted funds to Cooper-Hewitt in
fiscal year 1974 to eliminate operating deficits accumulated over this
and previous years.

In September 1973, at the death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather
Post, the responsibility for her “Hillwood” estate and the extraordi-
nary collections it contains passed to the Smithsonian. A trust fund

36 / Smithsonian Year 1974
was provided by her will for the maintenance and operation of Hill-
wood, but the estate had not yet been settled at year-end; part-year
income and expenditures for this new project are reflected in the Re-
stricted Private Funds table.

The National Museum of History and Technology is conducting a
fund-raising campaign, with strong support from industry, to enable
creation of a new exhibit “Hall of American Maritime Enterprise”
devoted to national marine history. As of June 30, 1974, $166,000
had been raised with additional pledges received of over $100,000.

A gift of $1 million was received from Joseph H. Hirshhorn in
fiscal year 1974 to be used to complete construction of the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden, due to open to the public in October
1974. This gift is reflected in the restricted gifts total in Table 6 in
the category of Plant Funds along with other gifts and miscellaneous
revenues for the new Chesapeake Bay Center building ($70,000) and
renovation of the Carnegie Mansion for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
($262,000).

ENDOWMENT FUNDS

The Smithsonian endowment includes three separate investment
funds: the Freer Fund, whose income is used solely by the Freer Gal-

_lery of Art; Endowment Fund No. 3, which supports oceanographic
_ research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida; and the Consolidated
_ Fund, which is an investment pool of all other Smithsonian restricted
: and unrestricted endowment funds, although distinct administration
and accounting is maintained on each individual fund. Changes in
| market values of these funds since 1970, reflecting additions from

donations and reinvestment of income, limited withdrawals, and

_ changes in securities valuations are shown in Table 10.

As detailed in previous Smithsonian Annual Reports, the invest-
ment of these three endowments is managed by three professional
advisory firms, under the close supervision of the Investment Policy
Committee and the Treasurer, and subject to policy guidelines set by
the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents. Under the Total Return policy,
adopted for all funds by the Board of Regents in 1972, the income
to be paid each fund in the subsequent fiscal year is determined each
March 31 by computing 41/2 percent of the running five-year average
of market values. By selecting a fixed rate of return, regardless of
what the actual yield may be, the investment advisors are free to
choose the most attractive securities without being limited by the
need to achieve a specified dividend and interest income level and
at the same time Smithsonian budgeting procedures are simplified.

As shown in Table 11, the market values of the endowment funds

suffered badly in fiscal year 1974, sharing fully in the general stock
market decline. This fall in market values will have the effect in fiscal
year 1975 of reducing the Total Return income to the Freer and Con-
solidated Funds to somewhat below the level of fiscal year 1974, al-
though still higher than prior years.

38 / Smithsonian Year 1974
Gifts, bequests, and reinvestment of income in certain restricted
funds added $297,000 to the Consolidated Fund, and a transfer of
$300,000 was made from Endowment Fund No. 3 to permit comple-
tion of the RV Johnson submarine tender as well as to cover costs
relating to the entrapment of the submersible Johnson-Sea-Link in
June 1973. Income totaling $1,948,000, net of managers’ fees, was
paid out under the Total Return policy described above; this was
$355,000 in excess of dividend and interest yield on these Endow-
ment Funds in the year. Market valuations and income of the indi-
vidual restricted funds participating in the Consolidated pool are
shown in Table 12, and detail on the funds by types of securities held
is given in Table 13. A listing of the individual investments held in
the various endowment funds at June 30, 1974, may be obtained
upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution.

Accounting and Auditing

The Private Trust Funds of the Institution, as well as the accounts of
Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., the Smithsonian
Research Foundation, and Reading-Is-Fundamental, Inc., are audited
annually by independent public accountants. Their report for fiscal
year 1974 on the Smithsonian is contained in the following pages,
including a comparative balance sheet and a statement of changes in
the various fund balances. Extensive changes in accounting treat-
ment of a number of items in accordance with new guidelines estab-
lished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
have been referred to at length in the Notes to these statements and
are reflected in the tables in this report dealing with Unrestricted and
Restricted Private Funds.

The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit
on granfand contract monies received from federal agencies. In addi-
tion, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are subject
to audit by the General Accounting Office. The internal audit staff
continues to conduct audits throughout the wide range of Smith-
sonian activities and contributes greatly to smooth administrative
and financial management.

The Board of Regents

- Smithsonian Institution:

We have examined the balance sheet of the Private Funds of Smith-
sonian Institution as of June 30, 1974 and the related statement of
changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements
do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments,
bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under Fed-
eral appropriations as detailed in note 3 to the financial statements.
Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the ac-
counting records and such other auditing procedures as we consid-
ered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present
fairly the financial position of the Private Funds of Smithsonian
Institution at June 30, 1974 and the changes in its fund balances for
the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted account-
ing principles which, except for the changes referred to in note la
to the financial statements, with which we concur, have been applied
on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION — PRIVATE FUNDS
Notes to Financial Statements

June 30, 1974

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a. Accrual Basis — The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution have

been prepared on the accrual basis, except for depreciation accounting as
explained in note 1g below, and are in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles included in the recently issued American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Audit Guide “Audits of Colleges and Univer-
sities”. In accordance with the requirements of the Guide, annual leave
and interest income on endowment and similar fund investments have
been accrued at June 30, 1974 and, in addition, certain changes in financial
statement classification have been adopted. The effect of such changes in

classifications on beginning fund balances is as follows:

Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for pro-
visions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers
to the plant fund. .

b. Fund Accounting —In order to ensure observance of limitations and re-
strictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution,
the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the prin-

52 / Smithsonian Year 1974
ciples of “fund accounting”. This is the procedure by which resources for
various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into
funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified. Separate
accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying
financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been com-
bined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been
recorded and reported by fund group.

Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so
indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to spe-
cific purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds
may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the
source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which
the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its
institutional purposes.

Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requir-
ing in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be
utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the
expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.

Unrestricted quasi-endowment funds have been established by the govern-
ing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such
funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts
for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be
maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board
has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the pur-
pose stipulated by the donor.

All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition
of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund
which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, re-
ceivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets,
except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar
funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted
or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.

All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current
fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted re-
sources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.

. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition
when acquired by gift.

. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.

. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution’s magazine and associates’
activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the appli-
cable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current
unrestricted funds.

. Endowment and Similar Fund Investments — The Institution utilizes the
“total return’ approach to investment management of endowment funds
and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment
return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in
addition to interest and dividends. In applying this approach, it is the Insti-
tution’s policy to provide 442% of the five year average of the market value
of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being
available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of
the assets of any fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value
of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest
and dividends received.

Financial Report / 53
g. Plant Fund Assets — Plant fund assets are recorded as follows:

Museum shop and computer equipment purchased with Private Funds is
capitalized in the plant fund at cost, and is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over an estimated useful life of five years.

Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost,
to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor,
or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in
Chesapeake Bay, Carnegie Mansion, and Hillwood Estate which have
been recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not re-

corded.

All the other land and buildings (principally acquired with Federal funds),
fixtures, equipment, works of art, living or other specimens are not re-
flected in the accompanying financial statements.

Funds, previously recorded in the current funds group, whose purpose is
for construction and acquisition of plant assets, have been reclassified to

plant funds.

h. Agency Funds — The agency funds group consists of funds held by the
Institution as custodian or fiscal agent for others.

i. Pension Costs — All pension costs are funded as accrued.

2. Investments

Quoted market values and carrying values of investments (all marketable
securities) of the funds indicated were as follows:

Assets of the endowment and similar funds having a carrying value of
$11,845,384 are pooled on“a market value basis (consolidated fund) with
each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of

54 / Smithsonian Year 1974
the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the calendar quarter
within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units each having a
market value of $84.60 ($105.22 in 1973), 67,856 units were owned by en-
dowment, and 52,665 units by quasi-endowment at June 30, 1974.

. Related Activities

Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying finan-
cial statements, provide major support for the operations and administration
of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s many mu-
seums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and
construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings
and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not reflected in the accom-
panying financial statements.

The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1974:

Smithsonian Year - 1974

SGIENGE

THE PAST YEAR in Science was characterized by a steady progress
toward the goals outlined at the first institutional priorities confer-
ence at Belmont in 1973. In addition, efforts were directed to re-
appraising and redefining certain management structures in order to
find new and better methods to build on to traditional strengths.
This effort is in line with the discussions resulting from the Institu-
tion’s second priorities conference last February.

The Museum of Natural History focused attention this past year
on its educational role, exploring new avenues to enrich the visitors’
experience. The formation of an in-house exhibits committee was a
first step in the Museum’s desire to seek new directions in exhibitry.
The opening of the Touch Exhibit focused the public’s attention on
alternate methods to the traditional museum experience.

The National Zoological Park obtained a permit to the former
Army Remount Station at Front Royal, Virginia, for use as a breed-
ing farm, especially for endangered species. The new facility, it is
hoped, will allow for increased propagation of rare animals, away
from the limited space of Rock Creek Park.

Early in the fiscal year, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory joined with the Harvard College Observatory to form the Cen-
ter for Astrophysics. The new arrangement has led to more flexibility
in personnel and programs, increasing joint resources for maximum
use.

The Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies continued
to progress toward a goal of increased educational opportunities for
neighboring schools and disadvantaged urban youth. A new build-
ing, which will house the educational and visitor orientation activi-
ties, was planned and bids were received for the work. The new

57
building will release office and lab space now jointly used for re-
search and educational activities. Another program undertaken was
the Information Transfer Program which translates scientific results
into forms that can be useful to planners and government officials.
Money for this program was made available from the Edward John
Noble Foundation.

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (str1) underwent
a change of directorship this past year with the return of Dr. Martin
Moynihan to his research as Senior Scientist at str1. He was suc-
ceeded by Dr. Ira Rubinoff, who previously served as Assistant
Director at the facility. The research undertaken at stRI continued
to be primarily concerned with basic scientific questions of the evo-
lutionary and ecological adaptations of tropical organisms. An in-
creased education program was undertaken with grants received
from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty and Edward John Noble
foundations.

The National Air and Space Museum’s new building continued on
schedule and within the budget began to rise and take form on the
Mall this past year with much of the staff’s time being spent on the
preparation of exhibits that will be displayed in the new quarters.
The formation of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in the
Museum provides the basis for a scientific research arm in lunar
studies.

The Office of International and Environmental Programs was es-
tablished this past year combining the Offices of International
Activities and Environmental Sciences. The new Office is designed
to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to conduct re-
search abroad in its traditional strengths in collection-based natural
history to the comparatively new area of environmental studies.
Wymberley Coerr, a career foreign service officer who served as
Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay, was appointed to head the
Office.

In the past year, Smithsonian support of conservation in the Gala-
pagos Islands has increased substantially in response to a significant
rise in the number of contributions earmarked for Galapagos work.
Aided by the Research Station’s new director, Craig MacFarland,
administration and equipment have been markedly strengthened,
and research expanded to include a marine biological survey, to help
determine the limits of the National Park. In addition, two Smith-

58 / Smithsonian Year 1974
sonian research teams have recently visited the islands, one to con-
tinue studies of volcanic activity of Isla Fernandina and the other to
begin a study of finches and orb-weaving arachnids. Educational
programs in the islands were augmented by the Smithsonian helping
to fund a volunteer from the Catholic Institute for International Re-
lations, who is teaching biology, natural history, and conservation
as well as aiding in the marine survey. Additionally, a SI-Peace
Corps volunteer is working on the design of exhibits to the new
Van-Straelen musuem/lecture hall, which will provide natural his-
tory instruction for both tourists and Galapaguefios.

The Smithsonian once again played a significant role in national
and international affairs. Smithsonian scientists and administrators
provided representatives and advisory services to the Council on
Environmental Quality, the Department of the Interior, the Institute
of Ecology, the First International Congress of Systematic and Evo-
lutionary Biology, the Asia Society, the Bahamas National Trust, and
the World Wildlife Fund. The staff has traveled to diverse places in
the United States and abroad including the Bahamas, the United
Kingdom, Switzerland, India, and Nepal. Smithsonian scientists con-
tinued their fruitful collaboration with foreign institutions on every
continent and provided technical assistance on environmental
programs.

Details of these concerns and scientific accomplishments in other
areas of research by the individual bureaus, in fiscal year 1974,
follow.

Center for the Study of Man

Over the past year the Center for the Study of Man has expanded
and sharpened its research activities in the human sciences. From
August 26 to September 2, 1973, three conferences organized by the
Center were held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Two more conferences
were held during the same period at Chicago, Illinois. Immediately
following these meetings each of the conferences reported its find-
ings to the assembled attendees at the IXth International Congress
of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences meeting in Chicago,
Illinois, from September 3 to 10. The 5 sessions organized by the

Science / 59
Center for the Study of Man were: (1) cross-cultural uses of can- |
nibus; (2) cross-cultural uses of alcohol; (3) examination of a gen- |
eral theory of cultural transmission; (4) cultural consequences of |
population change; and (5) economic development in seven selected |
American Indian groups. Each of these research projects was an out- |
come of the Center’s program to relate anthropology and the human |
sciences to modern worldwide problems. All reports are now in one |
or another stage of preparation for publication. |

Specifically, the cannibus report is in press, and it constitutes the |
first well-documented report of cannibus usage on a worldwide |
basis. The coverage is not complete, but it constitutes a beginning |
and lays the groundwork for an accelerated growth of knowledge |
in the immediate future. The papers in the alcohol volume, also in }
press, testify to the increasing worldwide sophistication of human }
scientists about alcohol usage and its perception in cultures around |
the world. The general theory of cultural transmission considers |
education as a special case. Because Western-style formal education
is so pervasive, it is especially important to learn more about other |
perspectives on cultural transmission. The results of the conference
on population are in press, but the project is not yet complete. A |
number of participants from developing countries met in Bucharest,
Rumania, in August to go over papers that have come out of the |
Oshkosh and Chicago meetings. The American Indian economic de- |
velopment study is in press and should appear within a year.

Manuscripts for the forthcoming encyclopedic Handbook of
North American Indians continue to arrive daily. The editorial office,
with the assistance of volume editors in various parts of the country,
is editing these works for publication in 1976.

The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies, under
the direction of Dr. Roy Bryce-Laporte, has been supervising re-
search in Costa Rica and Panama. In particular, it has focused on the |
West Indian adaptation and experience in both of these countries.
It has also been reviewing policy implications of migration and |
some contemporary perspectives on alienation. |

In June 1974, a National Anthropological Film Center was estab- |
lished within the Center for the Study of Man. It is charged with the |
preservation and study of visual information on vanishing and |
changing ways of life. )

60 / Smithsonian Y ear 1974

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies

The three programs of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environ-
mental Studies — scientific research, information transfer, and en-
vironmental education — were marked by expansion and innovation
during 1974.

At the 2500-acre Center near Annapolis, a long-term study of the
Rhode River watershed continues with NsF-RANN (National Science
Foundation-Research Applied to National Needs) as the major
source of funding. The current grant extends through September
1974 and was made through the Chesapeake Research Consortium,
composed of the Smithsonian Institution, the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, the University of Maryland, and the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science.

Thirteen nsE-funded projects are underway at the Center. They
are part of the Consortium’s effort to determine the environmental
impact of alternate levels of sewage effluent loading in specified parts
of the Bay.

The Center’s contribution is to provide understanding of the bio-
logical functioning of an ecosystem and from this to devise methods
for determining the impact of sewage effluent. Projects include in-
vestigations of the amount of groundwater and runoff in the Rhode
River watershed, the circulation patterns of the estuary, and the
water exchange with the Bay. Water samples collected at stations in
the estuary are analyzed for chemical content.

Stream gauging wiers were constructed during the year to record
the volume of water flowing from five subwatersheds and to take
volume-integrated water samples. Scientists at the Center analyze
these samples for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic carbon,
and suspended sediment.

With the aid of computer printouts of aerial photographs, scien-
tists are developing a key for identifying salt-marsh vegetation.
Funding is provided through the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as part of a remote sensing project underway at the
Center since 1970. This year the Center began preparing land-use
maps of the Rhode River watershed based on these photographs. The
maps will be a valuable tool for a number of investigators and for
agencies concerned with the environment.

Since the beginning of the fiscal year, college students, under the
supervision of the Assistant Director, have conducted a survey of
the recreational use of the Rhode River.

Two staff members are studying the mammals of Poplar, Coaches,
and Jefferson Islands. Owned by the Smithsonian and administered
by the Center, these islands off Talbot County on Maryland’s East-
ern Shore are eroding at different rates and offer an unusual oppor-
tunity to study the effect on mammal populations of rapidly dimin-
ishing habitats in a closed system.

Among the Center’s continuing studies is “Population Dynamics
in Breeding Birds,” begun in 1968 and projected for a 20-year period.
Objectives include the determination of species succession resulting
from successful changes in vegetation.

INFORMATION TRANSFER

Funded with a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the
Information Transfer Program has as its goal the translation of sci-
entific results into forms which can be used by planners, government
officials, and resource managers who make decisions that affect the
Bay. In addition, the program makes environmental information
available to organizations and individuals.

Projects undertaken this year include a survey of environmental
organizations in the Chesapeake Bay area. An environmental infor-
mation specialist sought to determine the issues that most concern
these organizations and the extent of their contacts with State offi-
cials and legislators. She also evaluated the effectiveness of the orga-
nizations and interviewed scientists to find out what lines of com-
munication exist between them and the general public.

The Center co-sponsored with the Anne Arundel County Chapter
of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation preliminary meetings which re-
sulted in the formation of the South County Citizens League,
composed of representatives of citizens associations. The purpose is
to unite organizations and individuals in the intelligent examination
of probable future issues in order to influence public policies and
action.

An all-day workshop on environmental problems was arranged
for the Maryland League of Women Voters and attended by repre-
sentatives of a number of organizations and agencies.

The Rhode Worker, added to the Chesapeake Bay Center’s fleet during the
year, is used for projects related to the NSF-funded Rhode River Research
Program. One of these projects is “Nutrient Studies on the Rhode River
Ecosystem,” in which samples from 13 stations in a freshwater creek and the
estuary are tested for 16 qualities, either at the collection site or in the
laboratory below.

EDUCATION

A description of the Center’s tours and programs was distributed in
the area, facilitating scheduling and resulting in an increased num-
ber of requests for this service.

The Center chartered a bus through a nonprofit line sponsored by
the Community Action Agency and arranged to bring a different
group of sixth graders from five local schools to the Center each
week for “The Living Community,” a project that stresses the inter-
relationship of living things. Before each visit, a staff member made
a preparatory presentation in the classroom.

The Rhode River Environmental Education Project, one of the
Center’s most ambitious educational efforts, got underway in the
fall of 1973 after a successful pilot program. With the cooperation
of the ymca of Metropolitan Washington, a different group of tenth
graders from 16 District of Columbia schools resided for four days
at a YMCA camp adjoining the Center. The students used the Center
for field work, and college students served as counsellors. The cur-
riculum, designed by the Assistant Director and an Education Spe-
cialist, focused on man’s relationship to his environment.

The Summer Ecology Program, an intensive course for school
children from the elementary grades through high school, was initi-
ated in the summer of 1973 and will continue in 1974. College stu-
dents who plan to teach the natural sciences instruct the children.
The program provides the instructors with teaching experience and
the children with an enriching supplement to their school work.

The Center arranged an all-day workshop for science teachers
from all over the country who were enrolled in a summer institute
sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Similar workshops
are planned for the summer of 1974.

Continuing education activities include opportunities for college
students to work with staff scientists on specific projects and pro-
viding speakers for schools, colleges, and organizations.

STAFF

The Center’s full-time staff numbered approximately 40 at the close
of the fiscal year. Among the additions were Dr. Barbara Rice,
Research Specialist with the Remote Sensing Project; Dr. Maria
Faust, Biologist; Dr. Tung Lin Wu, Chemist; Dr. John Falk, Educa-

64 / Smithsonian Year 1974

tion Coordinator; Marjorie Beane, Environmental Information Spe-
cialist; and Lynne Mormann, Education Specialist.

Some 40 additional researchers are actively engaged in projects
at the Chesapeake Bay Center, including principal investigators for
the Rhode River Research Program from the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity and the University of Maryland.

FACILITIES
Ground was broken in the spring for a combined Visitor Center
and Education Building scheduled for completion in the fall. This
will be the first new structure to be built at the Center since its
establishment in 1965.

The Center procured seven house trailers to alleviate a shortage
of space for offices, laboratories, and dormitory facilities.

A 28-foot fiberglass cabin cruiser, the Rhode Worker was added
to the Center’s fleet. Purchased with funds from the NsF-RANN grant,
this boat is used for projects included in the Rhode River Research
Program. Five other boats, including the 46-foot Java, are docked at
the Center’s pier.

Fort Pierce Bureau

The primary research emphasis by the Fort Pierce Bureau this year
is the Indian River Study, a consortium effort initiated in Septem-
ber of 1973, with a grant from the Atlantic Foundation. The Smith-
sonian’s 130-foot-floating-laboratory barge is the focal point for the
Study, the chief aims of which are to obtain baseline information on
the diversity of organisms and quality of their environment, sources
of pollution and their effects on organisms, and a predictive capa-
bility of both short- and long-term effects on man-induced changes.
To date, over 500 sampling stations have been occupied on 22 off-
shore cruises by the RV Gosnold, 10 cruises have been made in the
Indian River lagoon on a specially modified houseboat research ves-
sel to make in situ environmental measurements, and fish and ben-
thic samples have been repetitively collected at 36 stations and 4
transects within the Indian River.

Life-history studies of marine animals have continued through
the second year with stress on reproductive biology, developmental
patterns, and larval development of unsegmented marine worms of

Science / 65
the phylum Sipuncula. More than 20 larval sipunculans of unknown
species have been collected from the Gulf Stream off Fort Pierce,
Florida; these have been raised in the laboratory and studies made of
their morphology by use of scanning electron microscopy and histo-
logical procedures. Developmental patterns emerging from this work
promise to have important implications for and understanding of the
interphyletic and intraphyletic relationships of these organisms.

The former Coast Guard cutter, Hopley Yeaton, was christened
officially the RV Johnson on Saturday, January 26, 1974, by Mrs.
J. Seward Johnson during an open-house celebration at Link Port,
Florida. An estimated 1500 visitors attended the ceremony to view
the Bureau’s 125-foot vessel, a tender to the research submarine
Johnson-Sea-Link, which can be launched and recovered rapidly by
a hydraulic crane located at the aft end of the ship. The “mother
ship’-submersible-lockout diver system will be used on missions
this coming year to explore, photograph, and sample the continental
shelf adjacent to the Indian River.

Since the unfortunate entrapment of the Johnson-Sea-Link off the
Florida Keys in June 1973, considerable effort has been devoted at
Link Port to developing rescue systems for small research sub-
marines and to modifying several safety and life-support systems on
the Johnson-Sea-Link. A surface rescue craft, under construction,

will support a cable-controlled unmanned submersible equipped —

with television and manipulator that can free an entrapped object
from a depth in excess of 1000 feet. A second submarine, Johnson-
Sea-Link II, should be finished by the end of 1974 —a sister sub-
mersible with lockout capability can be viewed as an excellent rescue
mechanism. Already implemented on the Johnson-Sea-Link are an
improved high-capacity and high-volume carbon-dioxide scrubber,
remote read-out gauges in the pilot’s sphere for carbon dioxide and
oxygen sensing and monitoring instruments employed in the diving
compartment, and redesigned attachment points for handling lines,
which employ the break-away concept and eliminate hooks.
During the past several months, two successful cruises have been
completed to the Bahamas to train the respective crews of the sup-
port ship RV Johnson and submarine Johnson-Sea-Link as a total
system, to launch and recover the submersible from anchor or
underway and in a sea state of Beaufort Force 5, to complete training
of two qualified submarine pilots, and to perform shallow submarine

scientious training program, incorporating all aspects of submersible
operations, diving and support-equipment handling under the able
management of an Operations Director, is the most effective pro-
cedure of reducing the accepted level of risk involved in submarine
work.

National Air and Space Museum

The progress made in building construction, exhibits, staffing, and
research in 1974 leaves little doubt that the National Air and Space
Museum is fast becoming one of the most important and exciting
bureaus of the Institution.

The construction of the new museum building, which is on sched-
ule, is almost 50 percent complete. The contracts for structural steel
and metal decks have been closed out. The marble contract is 65
percent complete. Glass curtain walls and skylights are being
installed. By the end of summer, the building will be completely
enclosed, which will permit interior work without regard to the
elements. As originally forecast, the staff will move into the building
in the summer of 1975 and the building will open in July 1976.

The building will contain 25 major exhibition halls and 2 presen-
tation centers; the development of exhibits for these halls has been —
the major thrust of the museum during 1974 and will continue to
be through 1976. The goal for the opening of the building is to have
“core” quality exhibits in approximately 50 percent of the available |
space with well-displayed objects in the remainder of the halls.

During 1974 the following major exhibits were completed:

“Air Traffic Control’ — an exhibit which explains the complex |
equipment and competent personnel who perform behind the scenes |
in our air traffic network.

“Exhibition Flight’ — this exhibit tells the story with artifacts,
film, and photos of how exhibition flight caught the imagination of
the American public and popularized flying.

“Life in the Universe” — this exhibit examines the birth and death
of stars and galaxies; the nature of life and its chemical building
blocks; the tools being used to find life; how this life may have
evolved, what forms it may have taken, and how we might commu-
nicate with it.

Construction moves apace on the new National Air and Space Museum scheduled
to open July 4, 1976.
In addition to the major exhibits, the following special exhibits
were mounted in 1974:

“Copernicus” — prototype telescope of nasa’s Orbiting Astro-
nomical Observatory during the 500th anniversary of Copernicus,
the father of modern astronomy.

“Skylab” — America’s first experimental space station.

“Aerobatics” — featuring the U.S. World Championship Aero-
batics team and one of their aircraft, the Pitts Special.

“Santos-Dumont”’ — observing the centenary of the birth of this
pioneer aircraft designer, aeronaut, aviator, and astronomer.

“Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel’ — exhibiting on the 70th anni-
versary of powered heavier-than-air flight a replica of the wind
tunnel with daily demonstrations of its use as a precursor to the first
powered flight.

“Space and Artists’” — continuing displays of paintings of space
and aviation art.

“First World Flight’ — traces the first round-the-world flight
through photographs and drawings superimposed over a map of the
route taken by the pilots in 1924. During the 6-month circumnavi-
gation of the world, the crews endured hardships of extreme cold
and heat, accidents, and mechanical failures. The flagplane, Chicago,
was completely restored by the NAsM and is the centerpiece of the
exhibit, in the rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building.

Fiscal year 1974 brought the beginning of a formal program of
research to the museum. A Department of Science and Technology
was created and staffed with two senior personnel. The implementa-
tion of the nas Science and Technology research program has begun
with an analysis of the history and validity of design criteria in use
in the air and space industry. A Center for Earth and Planetary
Studies was established under the leadership of one of the foremost
lunar geologists in the world. At the same time, Nasa’s comprehen-
sive lunar scientific photograph collection and records were trans-
ferred to the museum. The Center has already published several
scientific articles. In cooperation with Nasa, a lunar mapping pro-
gram is ongoing. Moreover, the Center Director occupies one of
seven seats on the International Astronautical Union (1av) Task
Group on Lunar Nomenclature.

Exhibits-related research is-a major NASM activity with the various
curatorial departments performing artifact documentary research,

Exhibits Division is developing several research programs concerned
with the reliability of exhibits components, new exhibits techniques,
novel film transport systems, etc.

The large size of today’s flying machines, coupled with an ever
accelerating pace of aerospace technology, results in tremendous
pressure on curators to increase the size of their collections. At the
same time, however, the available storage space is not increasing at
the same pace. Therefore, in January 1974, an Acquisition Policy
Statement was issued for use by the curatorial staff of the NAsM.
Briefly, the policy indicates that each major addition to the collection
should be balanced, wherever possible, by an equivalent deletion or
loan. It also places the responsibility for the final approval of the
acquisitions of major new artifacts with the Director of the museum.
Prior to 1974, the curatorial staff approved acquisitions and the
Director approved loans. This policy has now been reversed.

At the time the acquisition policy was enacted, the museum began
an all-out effort to review and, where possible, dispose of surplus
artifacts, particularly engines, archival material, aircraft models,
aircraft, and space material. To date:

1. Fifty engines have been transferred or loaned.

2. Approximately 12,000 cubic feet of miscellaneous material,
including books, periodicals, photographs, records, and other docu-
ments have been declared surplus or duplicate material and trans-
ferred to other institutions. This included over 3,500 periodicals.

3. A complete inventory of the model aircraft collection (num-
bering over 1,000 models) is under way. The information will be
computerized so that the collection can be studied from various
criteria such as scale, aircraft type, condition, etc.

4. Twenty-eight astronautic artifacts have been deaccessioned
and disposed of.

During fiscal 1974, the Presentations and Education Division was
organized with responsibility for developing and implementing three
programs: the education program of the museum, Spacearium pro-
grams, and programs for the nasM Theater.

The education program includes lectures, tours, and other activi-
ties to assist individuals and groups in using the museum, its re-
sources, and publications for effective learning about air and space
and related subject matter. In fiscal 1974, 168 tours were conducted
by 13 docents and volunteers for over 5000 students.

———————————E—————  .
During fiscal 1974, a small planetarium began an ongoing opera-
tion in the Air and Space Building as an experimental laboratory to
prepare for the larger Spacearium. Programs were given to general
visitors and to a few visiting school classes, and special classes were
conducted in this facility for the Smithsonian Associates.

Two pilot programs were initiated in fiscal 1974 at the Silver
Hill facility. The first was an adult night class for those who might
build and fly their own airplanes, and emphasized safe and rational
design, engineering, and maintenance. The second program was
designed to teach inner-city children the basic skills required to build
and maintain aircraft, including welding, sheet metal and fabric
work, engine overhaul, etc. Both programs were well received and
will be expanded in the future.

For the second year the museum, in conjunction with the Smith-
sonian Astrophysical Observatory, hosted an astronomy lecture
series. While the first series in 1972 attempted to assess man’s cur-
rent knowledge of the solar system as seen from the planet Earth,
the second series, “Beyond the Planets,” surveyed our Galaxy and
the Universe from the vantage point of the Sun. The series, consist-
ing of eight lectures by some of America’s outstanding astronomers,
was received with enthusiasm by standing-room-only crowds.

As a special event, the museum sponsored a poetry reading and
discussion by Apollo 15 Astronaut Alfred Worden. Astronaut
Worden was warmly received as he read selections from his book
of poems, Hello Earth, Greetings From Endeavor, and discussed his
feelings and emotions that prompted him to compose each of the
poems. The readings were illustrated by color panoramas made
during Apollo 15’s epic journey to the Moon.

National Museum of Natural History

There was a bustle of activity on the Museum’s first floor in early
1974 as carpenters, scientists, designers, and other Museum crafts-
men worked to complete “Ice Age Mammals and the Emergence of
Man,” the first of a series of new exhibits that will enrich consider-
ably the Museum’s educational impact. Long-range plans call for the
overhaul and rejuvenation of one permanent exhibit hall every year
through 1979. All of these new halls will be thematically structured
to convey clearly to the public concepts of evolution that are funda-
mental to an understanding of the natural world.

To accomplish this change the Museum has departed from its
traditional practice of building an exhibit hall around a single depart-
mental discipline. The Ice Age Hall formerly housed a paleontological
exhibit devoted to Pleistocene mammals. Its replacement is multi-
disciplinary, blending objects from the paleontology, mineral science,
and anthropology collections, into a thematic context that describes
the great physical and biological events of the Ice Age, including the
development of the continental glaciers, the evolution of large
mammals, the extinction of many of them, and the arrival of man.

The new multidisciplinary thematic exhibits that are in the process
of design and production are the result of an entirely new approach
to exhibits at the Museum. An advisory committee of Museum scien-
tists, headed by Dr. Leo J. Hickey, has been set up as a liaison
between the Museum’s professional staff and its exhibits office,
directed by Harry T. Hart. A close working relationship has been
established that is responsible for the excellence of the new Ice Age
Hall and the promise of the Museum’s Bicentennial exhibit, “Our
Changing Land.”

“Our Changing Land,” now under development, will chronicle
environmental change in the Washington, D.C., area since the arrival
of man, stressing what has happened since the founding of the
Nation, and explaining the main ecological processes related to the
change and what options there may be for the future. The ground
floor of the north wing is being prepared for this exhibit.

In addition to renewal of permanent halls and the development of
the Bicentennial exhibit, a variety of other exhibit events made 1974
at the Museum an extraordinarily active and vigorous year.

Curious children and adults were crowding into the Museum’s
recently opened Discovery Room where they were urged to keep
their hands on and not off the exhibits. Elephant tusks, coral, petri-
fied wood, wooly mammoth teeth, and hundreds of other natural
history specimens, ordinarily out of reach behind glass or railings
in museums, could be grasped, turned over in the hand at one’s
leisure, and studied with a magnifying glass. If requested, one of the
room’s docents would make available books and film loops to help
take a person farther down the path of discovery. The room added
a permanent new dimension to the Museum’s offerings.

In another area of the Museum, visitors were experiencing the
wonder of setting foot in the interior of a tropical rain forest, one of
nature’s most complex environments. Modeled of papier-maché and

plastic, after sketches and photographs taken in the Panama and
South American jungles, the exhibit’s trees, foliage, and vines were
enclosed in a mirrored ceiling-high silo. Walking into this dimly lit
enclosure, visitors had the illusion that they were in the center of a
vast tropical forest — with trees rising 80-100 feet above their heads.
This simulated forest was the heart of a larger ecological exhibit,
“Tt All Depends,” which made the point that all elements in the
environment are dependent upon each other for survival.

Looking alertly out from an “arctic ice floe” in the west end of the
Life in the Sea Hall was an imposing new Museum presence, a
mounted specimen of that largest of the fin-footed aquatic animals —
the sea walrus. Beneath its icy perch a visitor could see an informative
film about it and other pinnipeds, a family of mammals that besides
the walrus includes the seal and the sea lion. In a narration inspired
by the Lewis Carroll verse, ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter,” actor
Cyril Ritchard could be heard addressing a pinniped, “I would like
to talk to you, about how you live, where you live and the things
you like to do.”

The Museum once again made clear its opposition to the un-
limited killing of members of that other great family of sea mammals,

the cetaceans, to which belong the porpoises, dolphins, and whales.
In May and June it was host to an exhibition organized by Project
Jonah’s International Children’s Campaign to Save the Whales.
Drawings by elementary school children from the District of Co-
lumbia and its suburbs protesting the killing of whales were hung
side-by-side with works by young artists from other cities in Amer-
ica and foreign countries.

Two other colorful and notable exhibits in the Museum’s foyer
area were the offshoot of the field research trips of two of the
Museum’s scientists. One was a display of large, dye-transfer color
prints of tropical blossoms photographed in Africa and South Amer-
ica by Dr. Edward S. Ayensu, Chairman of the Museum’s Depart-
ment of Botany (supplemented with pictures by the Museum’s
scientific photographer, Kjell B. Sandved), the other placed on view
ethnological materials from the eastern Himalayan country of Bhu-
tan, collected by Dr. Eugene I. Knez, the Museum’s Curator of
Asian Anthropology. This exhibit was planned to coincide with the
June coronation of Bhutan’s 19-year-old king, and included the
display of photographs, paintings, textiles, costumes, copper, gold
and silver vessels, religious objects, basketry, and pottery. Among

Science / 79
the lenders to the exhibit was Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon
Ripley, who has made several expeditions to Bhutan.

Two Museum physical anthropologists, Drs. J. Lawrence Angel
and Douglas H. Ubelaker, in separate paleodemographic studies in
the Old and New Worlds, are amassing evidence of how environ-
mental conditions influenced the health, longevity, and evolution
of prehistoric man.

Working closely with archeologists who have unearthed grave
sites, the two scientists make measurements of ancient skeletal
material. From this they can assemble a body of statistics about an
ancient community that includes the size of its population, the age
composition, birth rate, sex ratio, number of children born, family
size, and critical effects of diseases such as arthritis and malaria —
all of which are determined by diet, climate, living habits, and
heredity.

Dr. Angel’s work over the last decade has been concentrated on
Eastern Mediterranean burial sites such as Catal Hiiyiik, Turkey,
where a population of early neolithic hunting farmers and traders,
living in a compact pueblo-like community, had conquered the peril
of a high child mortality rate — probably caused by malaria — by
evolving a culture that venerated and protected women. This had
lengthened the lives and childbearing years of the women. The
population of the community had increased as a result, and it had
become possible for the women to make a rich contribution to the
community’s art, crafts, and religious activities, while the men were
hunting and trading.

The People of Lerna: An Analysis of a Prehistoric Aegean Popu-
lation, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press, is Dr. Angel’s
study of a site situated on the Bay of Argos, Greece, where archeolo-
gists found 235 Bronze Age graves, covering a span of 25 generations
(2000-1600 B.c.).

The demographic profile Dr. Angel constructed showed that adults
in Lerna (which he estimated had about 800 persons living in it
during the Middle Bronze Age) had an average life expectancy of
34 years — 37 for men, 31 for women. The average woman bore
about five children — 2.2 of which grew to adulthood (15 years of
age). On the basis of that birth rate the population was increasing,
doubling every 7 to 10 generations. This was a remarkably successful
adaptation to the handicapping diseases afflicting the community.

Malaria, in particular, had a crippling impact, just as it had had
at Catal Hiiyiik. The changeover from a hunting to a farming culture,
which had begun in the Mediterranean between 9000 to 6500 B.c.
with the disappearance of the big game herds, had drawn early
farming populations to sites like Lerna where the soil was soft and
the forests not established. But these well-watered marshy areas that
favored farming also favored the Anopheles mosquito and the result
was that malaria, especially the type known as falciparum malaria,
was rampant. The physical debilitation caused by this disease

Science / 81
plagued and weakened Lerna for most of its prehistoric period (the
average stature of the Lerna men was only 5’ 542” and women,
5’ 14”). It was not until later when Greek communities learned how
to drain their marshes to gain better control of irrigation and water
supply that the numbers of malaria-carrying mosquitos were re-
duced, a development reflected in the stature and longevity of the
people.

Dr. Angel’s colleague, Douglas Ubelaker, has been analyzing
skeletal material from a large pre-Columbian cemetery in the
Hacienda Ayalan, Guayas Province, on the south coast of Ecuador,
dating to A.D. 1300, where 50 large ceramic urns, each containing
up to 20 skeletons, were uncovered.

With the approval of the Ecuadorian Government all of this
material was shipped back to the Museum, where now, highly
accurate microscopic methods of determining age by osteon counts
were conducted. The results were startling. The population had an
average adult age at death of about 67 years, with many individuals
living into the eighth and ninth decade, a much higher figure than
one would expect for a prehistoric population.

It can be explained by the fact the site provided excellent nutrition.
The people took crops from the land and exploited fresh- and salt-
water food resources. Many of the diseases that historically lower
life expectancy (syphilis, malaria, measles, mumps, smallpox) either
were nonexistent or were not severe problems until the Spanish
arrived. Furthermore, there is some evidence of remarkable con-
temporary longevity along that part of the coast that may have
extended back into prehistory.

Stands of Japanese Ma-dake timber bamboo (Phyllostachys
bambusoides) are flowering throughout America, a cyclical phenom-
enon that takes place only at intervals of 120 years and is as rare to
botanists as Halley’s comet is to astronomers. Drs. Thomas R.
Soderstrom and C. E. Calderén, Museum scientists, have been
monitoring this dramatic botanical event. Last year they asked for
help from readers of Smithsonian magazine and the Smithsonian’s
Environmental Alert Network, which alerted high school science
classes all over the country. Hundreds of persons, young and old,
responded by mailing in dried specimens of flowering branches of
the bamboo plant and along with it information about precisely
where it was collected and photographs and short histories of the

stands from which it came. With these data, Drs. Soderstrom and
Calderon were able to draw up a map that pinpoints Ma-dake stands
in at least 22 states, showing its heaviest concentrations on the West
Coast, from Washington to California, and in the southeastern Gulf
states.

Science / 83
The flowering of Ma-dake is always followed by the death of the
plant’s culms (stems), and this was verified by the volunteer observ-
ers. In cases where the flowering and death cycle had taken place in
the late 1960s, they noticed that the old rhizomes (underground
stem masses) were regenerating themselves and producing many
new but weak, contorted shoots. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderon
point out that it may take 6 or more years before large, normal
shoots are again grown, and perhaps 15 years before the bamboo
clump is in the same condition prior to flowering. In Japan Ma-dake
is used as a raw material for the construction of homes, furniture,
farm implements, baskets, and even food, and it is easy to under-
stand why the cyclical flowering there is considered nothing less
than a disaster.

All of the Ma-dake stands do not flower simultaneously because
there are a number of time-oriented, hereditary lines, consisting of
segregated progeny, distributed throughout the world. Each of these
hereditary lines is on a 120-year cycle. These cycles began to come
to completion in the late 1950s, but most of them in America have
done so in the late 1960s. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderén predict
that the present flowering will end shortly, but will begin again in
the 2070s, continue through the 2080s, and terminate in the 2090s.

The covered jars in Dr. Donald R. Davis’s laboratory are full of
blotched and discolored leaves on which one can see curious lines.
Some of the lines are crooked, some are coiled in a serpentine man-
ner, and others strike out in every direction from a central patch,
creating a star-shaped pattern. The leaves were collected by Dr.
Davis from the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, but they could
just as well be from almost any garden, park, or forest in America.
The marks on the leaves are the work of leaf miners, insect larvae
of minute size that can infest every leaf of a plant or tree and do
enough aggregate damage to kill their host. In Canada, the miners
have been so destructive to spruce and fir trees in the Western
Provinces in the last few years that the Government has initiated
a biological study of these insects in hopes of finding a means of
control.

Last year, Dr. Davis, Curator at the Museum’s Department of
Entomology, began work on a biosystematic study directed
specifically at four important families of leaf-mining Microlepidop-
tera (Eriocraniidae, Nepticulidae, Heliozelidae, and Gracillariidea).

84 / Smithsonian Year 1974
Dr. Donald R. Davis, Curator of Lepidoptera, Department of Entomology,
examining leaves with tell-tale markings left by leaf miners.
Mining behavior of almost every description, ranging from the most
highly specialized to some of the most primitive forms, is practiced
within these four groups.

One of the things Dr. Davis wants to do through his study of
these families is to trace the evolutionary history of mining. Re-
cently, Dr. Leo J. Hickey, a Museum paleobotanist, found a Nepticu-
lid leaf mine on a lower Cretaceous Angiosperm leaf, a discovery
that extends this basic ecological association between plants and
insects back nearly 110 million years. Dr. Davis is now examining
the Smithsonian-U.S. Geological Survey collection of Cretaceous
and early Tertiary Angiosperms for further evidence of early Lepi-
doptera leaf-mining injury.

The mined leaves that Dr. Davis collects on trips to habitats like
the Great Dismal Swamp and the Great Smoky Mountains are
brought back to his Museum laboratory so that the miner larvae
can be reared, identified, and closely observed. Dr. Davis plans
studies of all phases of their life cycle, including oviposition, larval
development, mine morphology, pupation, and adult behavior. He is
also interested in correlating the systematics and behavior of the
moths with that of their plant hosts. Why does a particular species
of miner often only feed on a particular species of plant?

But before such intriguing biological questions can be seriously
studied, basic taxonomic revisions must be prepared. Much of the
classification of the four families was done in the nineteenth century,
an age when moth investigators described the color and venation
of wings — but little else. The skeleton, which is now recognized
as the best part of the insect on which to base a taxonomic diagnosis,
was often ignored. Dr. Davis has had to start out by eliminating
the confusion this has created. He is now assembling comprehensive
illustrated texts to facilitate rapid, accurate identification for the
approximately 365 presently recognized North American species and
the more than 100 new species that have come to light in his studies.

What will happen if the sea-level canal the U.S. Government has
proposed constructing sometime in the future across the Isthmus of
Panama mixes the animal and plant groups of the Atlantic and
Pacific sides? Scientists say that serious ecological disruptions could
follow. Dr. Meredith L. Jones, Curator of Worms in the Museum’s
Department of Invertebrate Zoology, saw several years ago that the
lack of fundamental knowledge about the communities of marine

86 / Smithsonian Year 1974
animals that live in the shallow waters on both sides of the isthmus
would make it extremely difficult to assess the nature of these dis-
ruptions after they occur. Well-documented collections were needed
to provide a benchmark for future investigations. To assemble these,
Dr. Jones organized the Museum’s Panama Biota Program.

The original qualitative collecting method involved hand-picking
the organisms from the surface of a sieve that had been used to
process an undetermined amount of sediment. Dr. Jones and his
colleagues devised a quantitative method that they are now using
to get true samples of the density and diversity of invertebrate
organisms living in Panama’s coastal waters. Collections are made
while the tide is still high. Standing in water that is anywhere from
ankle to waist deep, the scientists drive a cubical stainless steel
jacket, that has an area of 1/20 of a square meter, 8 inches down
into the mud. Then they slide a shovel under the jacket, draw it out
of the bottom, sieve the sample, and bottle all of the residue. In
typical samples taken the new way, the yields comprised an average
of about 1800 specimens per square meter on a clean sand beach on
the Atlantic coast, about 6400 specimens per square meter on a
muddy sand beach on the Pacific, and about 46,000 specimens per
square meter in an Atlantic turtle-grass bed.

Five samples are usually taken at each collection station in order
to insure that contrasting microenvironments within a habitat are
represented. An effort has also been made to take samples at each
station at every season of the year.

At the Museum, a technician-student has been making quantita-
tive counts of invertebrate life forms in each sample, classifying the
animals by families. There is such an abundance of life in each
sample that processing it takes the technician six full days of work.
When Dr. Jones examines the worms in a sample to identify them
at a species level, six more days of work are involved. He estimates
that it will take him three to four years to get through all of the
samples that have been collected.

If a sea-level canal should be constructed, Dr. Jones is satisfied
that now scientists will be able to go back to the same site, make new
collections, and then make comparisons that will show them what is
happening, and enable them to predict what will happen next and
if it will be beneficial or harmful. If the sea-level canal is never
constructed, Dr. Jones believes the Program is still well worthwhile.

Science / 87
It is accumulating collections of unique value in an area of tremen-
dous biological interest.

The present Panama Canal with freshwater lakes situated mid-
way along its length has proved a highly effective barrier to the
passage of marine life from one side of Central America to the other.
So a scientist’s curiosity is aroused when a marine fish native to the
Pacific shows up in the Caribbean. Dr. Victor G. Springer, Curator
of Fishes in the Museum’s Department of Vertebrate Zoology, re-
cently looked into the matter of a tropical Indo-West Pacific blenniid
fish population living off Trinidad and the Atlantic entrance to the
Canal. Was it a relic population that was once distributed through-
out the world’s tropic waters or had it been artificially introduced,
conceivably through the Canal?

The facts argued against its being a relic population. Members of
the blenniid family speciate rapidly and no blenniid species is found
in both the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans, which were
last connected 2 to 4 million years ago. If the fish had once been
widely distributed in the tropics, its Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean
populations would have evolved into different species since the rise
of the isthmus. Dr. Springer concluded that it must have been arti-
ficially introduced into the western Atlantic, probably by the dis-
charge of ballast or bilge waters of ships. The fish is small and
found in abundance around docks where it can easily be sucked
into a ship’s ballast tanks. Other small marine fish have been picked
up in this way, taken thousands of miles, released when the ship
discharged its bilge waters, and established breeding populations.
But this is the only instance of a fish being introduced in this way
into the Caribbean.

Did the ships that brought the fish to the Caribbean enter through
the Canal? Dr. Springer thinks not. Ships coming across the Pacific
discharge their bilge-ballast water before they enter the Canal; that
being the case, the fish should be established on the Pacific side of
the Canal. But it has never been found there or anywhere else in the
eastern Pacific, but it does occur at the Atlantic entrance to the
Canal. Trinidad is where the fish has its principal Caribbean popula-
tion and where it was first collected in the Atlantic in 1930. Dr.
Springer believes that instead of coming across the Pacific, the fish
arrived in Trinidad from the Indo-West Pacific via the Atlantic
before the Canal was first opened in 1914.

The trail led Dr. Springer to the East Indian coolie trade that flour-
ished between Calcutta and Madras, on the east coast of India, and
the West Indies islands in the years from 1838 to 1914 and 1917. In
that period, thousands of coolies arrived on ships that traveled from
India to the Caribbean around southern Africa. It is Dr. Springer’s
view that the coolie trade vessels were the vehicles that introduced
Omobranchus punctatus into the western Atlantic.

Garnet can be yellow, orange, red, lilac or purple, depending on
its chemical composition and upon the temperature and pressure
conditions under which it formed in the earth. It has long been
known by scientists that this colorful mineral occurs in varying
quantities in kimberlite pipes, the bodies of igneous rock that are the
primary source of diamonds. But the fact that there was a high or
low concentration of garnet in a pipe did not seem to indicate one
way or the other if there was an abundance or dearth of diamonds
present. Last year, however, Dr. George S. Switzer, Curator of Min-
eralogy in the Museum’s Department of Mineral Science, discovered
that certain lilac-colored garnets have special compositional charac-
teristics that make it possible to say that if they are present in a
pipe, it is a diagnostic indication that diamonds are likely to be found
there in economic quantities.

These garnets are formed — as diamonds are — in the earth’s
upper mantle at a depth of 100-150 miles. When molten kimberlite
forces its way to the surface at velocities estimated to be on the order
of 300-400 feet per second, it sometimes brings both of these min-
erals up with it from the earth’s interior. The garnet is found in the
pipes in rocks called xenoliths (eclogites and periodites) and some-
times in diamonds as minute inclusions. Because of its occurrence in
diamonds, all of the garnet was thought by some scientists to have
crystallized (reached equilibrium) at the same time, place, and tem-
perature as the diamonds. Another school of thought, however,
held that the garnets in kimberlite xenoliths crystallized at lower
temperatures than garnet inside the diamond.

These two opposing views were tested by Dr. Switzer in a detailed
study of the garnet in the Finsch kimberlite pipe, one of the richest
diamond mines in South Africa. Finsch is also rich in garnet. It
makes up 90 percent of the mineral concentrate recovered there dur-
ing the diamond extraction process.

Dr. Switzer brought back to the Museum a handful of garnet

grains of all colors that had been recovered at Finsch in the extraction
process. He sorted 300 of these on the basis of color into eight cate-
gories and analyzed them on the Department’s electron microprobe,
which can identify and quantify the elements within each grain.

The results showed that some of the grains of lilac-colored gar-
nets — magnesum rich and calcium poor — had a chromium con-
tent that placed them within the compositional field of the garnets
previously only reported as inclusions in diamonds. Dr. Switzer, who
is now testing garnets from other kimberlite pipes, believes that the
presence of lilac-colored diamond of this special composition is diag-
nostic of the presence of diamond in a pipe, but it is not known yet
_ if there is any quantitative relationship.

Dr. Daniel J. Stanley, Geological Oceanographer and Curator in

a detailed knowledge of the physical processes that shape the Medi-
terranean region, a project that often finds him out on an oceano-
graphic vessel taking sediment cores from the Mediterranean Sea

it apparent that the configuration of the Mediterranean Sea, as we
know it today, is a geologically recent phenomenon. |

This emerging picture of geologic change includes Dr. Stanley’s!
discovery of sedimentological evidence for the existence of a large
emerged land mass present in the area now occupied by the Ligurian |
Sea (between the Riviera and Corsica, in the western Mediterranean)
until early Tertiary time. Seismic studies of the present Ligurian Sea
floor, and examination of exposed sediments found in the French
Maritime Alps, Corsica, and the northwestern Apennines of Italy, |
confirm that this land mass foundered and became submerged after
the Oligocene.

Finding specimens of exposed ancient sedimentary deposits —
now uplifted to 10,000 feet above sea level in the mountain chains
that surround the Mediterranean —is one part of Dr. Stanley’s |
work that does not require advanced technology. For this, Dr. Stan-
ley depends upon his keen geologist’s eye and his skill as a mountain
climber.

The publication in 1973 of the 765-page bilingual volume The
Mediterranean Sea: A Natural Sedimentation Laboratory, edited by
Dr. Stanley and Drs. Gilbert Kelling and Yehezkiel Weiler, was the
result of Dr. Stanley’s determination to achieve a needed multi- |
disciplinary and multinational synthesis of current research in sedi- |
mentation and related fields in the Mediterranean and circum-
Mediterranean. The book has contributions by 85 specialists from
15 countries, all of whom participated in a symposium organized by
Dr. Stanley in 1971 at the VIII International Sedimentological Con- —
gress in Heidelberg. |

The book includes an outline of criteria for a needed international |
effort to find out what happens to pollutants when they are intro- |
duced into the Mediterranean, where they go, and what their conse-
quences are. It calls for the construction of monitoring stations to
detect and map sediment and pollutant dispersal and depositation;
aerial flights and space-satellite photography to monitor the dis-
charge of sediments from river mouths, and rates of serious erosion
along selected coastlines (such as the Nile Delta area affected by the
Aswan Dam); and, finally, more deep-sea drilling to resolve addi-
tional questions of the Mediterranean’s geological and stratigraphic
background.

ee

The National Zoological Park is accelerating its change from cages
for containment of species to open arenas for awareness of the rela-
tionship of all living things; from a consumer of animals out of the
wild into a conservator and producer of animals and into a major
zoological resource of animal knowledge that can be disseminated
around the world.

In fiscal year 1974, the Zoo advanced efforts to establish new
standards of excellence and responsibility in all areas of zoological
park programs with concurrent courses of action:

Rebuilding yesterday’s zoo for tomorrow’s purpose.

Marshalling the most creative contributions of all staff members.

Launching necessary programs in off-site breeding and research.

Studying the relationships of animals to one another, to place and
to time — and in time for survival.

Coordinating resources in forms that will reach people of all ages
and walks of life.

RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION CENTER

Perhaps the Zoo’s most notable achievement since its founding in
1890 was receiving, in January 1974, a permit for 3200 acres of
land in Front Royal, Virginia, that formerly served successively as a
United States Army Remount Depot for horse breeding, and the
United States Department of Agriculture as a Beef Cattle Experi-
ment Station.

The acquisition of this propagation and research facility — to be
known as the National Zoological Park’s Research and Conservation
Center — will mark the end of the long search for a country facility
which could be used to breed and maintain animal herds in sufficient
numbers to insure their continuation as a viable, social, and genetic
group. The educational mission of the National Zoological Park
located in the valley of Rock Creek in Washington precludes the use
of vast amounts of land for a single species so that it is not able to
maintain ongoing herds of animals with proper age-pyramid and
genetic mixture. Considering the worldwide shrinking of land areas
available to wild animals, the increased hazards of disease, poach-
ing, and land degradation by humans, the plight of many animals is
indeed precarious. It is hoped that by establishing herds of threat-
ened and endangered species at the Research and Conservation Cen-
ter, insome cases through collaboration with other zoos in the United
States, the Zoo will have a steady and reliable source of animals as
well as a source for continuing zoological research on behalf of these
species.

The development of the Research and Conservation Center will
be deliberately paced, and future reports will carry information con-
cerning its advancement. This year the Zoo was able to enclose 80
acres of rolling pasture for the first two resident groups of animals
— Scimitar-horned Oryx and Pere David’s Deer.

The Front Royal Center will be an extension of the Rock Creek
Park facility with major input in the first few years from the Offices
of Animal Management, Animal Health, Zoological Research, Con-
struction Management, and Facilities Management. Public informa-
tion efforts at the Center focus now on the animal’s needs for isola-
tion and space. Low-key programs in conservation, education, and
natural viewing will be planned for coexistence with the principal
mission in future years. When we speak of the National Zoological

one purpose, one management, and one organization.

ANIMAL AFFAIRS

The most interesting and exciting animal event was the birth of an
Indian Rhinoceros in January, marking the first successful breeding
of this endangered species in the Western Hemisphere. This achieve-
ment was the result of almost two years of concerted and integrated
efforts by the scientific research staff, curators, keepers, and even
volunteers who remained in the Zoo after hours to monitor the male’s
and female’s activities during mating and later at birth. Therefore,
the Zoo not only gained a 127-pound male (named Patrick in honor

on January 30, 1974. Patrick is the first live Indian rhinoceros born in captivity
in the United States.

of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, our United States Ambassador to In-
dia), but also a wealth of valuable data on courtship, mating, and
parturition behavior. At six months of age, we estimate Patrick’s
weight to be about 350 pounds; however, he is too rambunctious to
get onto the scales.

Among the antelope, the most outstanding birth was that of a
lovely female calf to Kanitia, the imported Bongo; and the hope of

a second-generation birth on her mother’s side to Nyandarua, Kan-

itia’s offspring of two years ago. Nyandarua was the first Bongo
bred and born in captivity in the world.

The lesser pandas gave birth to their second pair of kits on the
next to last day of the fiscal year so were not mentioned in last year’s
report, and as if to catch us again, their pair from the year before
provided the Zoo with young on the night of June 30, 1974.

The white-cheeked gibbon family produced a fine offspring to the
delight of the staff and the visitors; and for the first time at the

National Zoological Park, the binturongs produced young, which

are being closely studied both for their growth and development as
well as their behavioral relationship with the mother. The golden
marmoset program continues to go well in terms of understanding
the tie-in of behavior and reproduction. The Zoo now has 20 ani-
mals with birth this year of a first set of second-generation offspring
as well as a set of twins from a wild-caught pair.

Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, the giant pandas, continue to thrive
and hold the interest of the visiting public, behaving in their new
yards rather like children released from school because of snow —
rolling, somersaulting, playfully demolishing snowmen made for the
occasion by the keepers. They are still unquestionably the most
popular animals at the Zoo. Ling-Ling, the female, now weighs 250
pounds and Hsing-Hsing, the male, weighs 264 pounds. Studies on
their behavior, vocalization, social relationships, and general habits
are continuing with the assistance of volunteers from the Friends of
the National Zoo to the scientific research staff and to the keeper
and curatorial personnel. This April, Ling-Ling came into estrus,
and we all had high hopes that there would be a breeding, particu-
larly with the promising experiences of last year. However, although
the animals got along well with the normal amount of premating,
roughhouse play, vocalizations, and general juvenile nonsense, there
was no actual breeding. No doubt this has been a further learning

Science / 99
experience for the male, but it appeared to be a frustrating experi-§
ence for the female. There are hopes for a breeding in the fall season,
but if not then perhaps next spring when they are both older and
wiser from their two encounters.

Despite the move of the white tigers (Mohini and Rewati) to Chi-
cago’s Brookfield Zoo and the white-gene carrying Ramana and
Kesari to the Cincinnati Zoo to allow replacement of the old Lion’
House, the latter pair added a new chapter to the breeding program!
by producing four cubs, three of which are white. A normal-colored
male, along with a white male were taken from the mother for hand-
rearing and are doing well under the expert care of the Cincinnati
staff, and the same can be said for the two, unsexed animals who
remain with their mother, Kesari. Unfortunately, the sire Ramana
passed away the week before with a chronic kidney condition, which
is so often seen in the big cats between 10 or 12 years of age. These
four new cubs give great hope for continuing the line of white tigers
and should be a stellar attraction when the “Dr. William M. Mann
Lion and Tiger Exhibit” is completed, hopefully in early 1976.

Among the outstanding bird hatchings can be counted the con-
tinuation of the Bornean Great Argus Pheasant breeding program
with the successful raising of 12 of these young birds. Rivaling the
success of this program was the raising of three Nene Geese for the :
first time in the history of the Zoo. Other outstanding hatchings
include three Stanley’s Cranes, ten Rheas, and three American >
Mergansers. |

Among the reptiles, the most notable breeding was of the Bur-
mese pythons in which three clutches were laid and 45 young snakes
were hatched. This program was of great scientific interest as incu- —
bation of the eggs was carried out both artificially and naturally. In -
the latter case the females coiled around the egg masses, maintaining _
the proper body heat by rhythmic muscle twitchings. This process
was of great interest to the visitors and particularly so since electrical ©
sensors were connected to recording thermometers to trace tempera- |
ture fluctuations.

The breeding program at the National Zoological Park is pro-
gressing quite well, space permitting, and the efforts of the scientific
research department's behavioral studies, the contributions from the
animal health department on nutrition, preventive medicine, as well
as the diligent endeavors of the animal management department are

beginning to pay off. At the present time, 66 percent of all mammals |

exhibited at the Zoo are captive born either here or at other zoos.
Approximately 30 percent of the mammals species, 14 percent of
the bird species, 8 percent of the reptile and amphibian species in
the collection are breeding. This is a slight but significant increase
over previous years.

While it is pleasant to report on significant births, note must also
be taken of deaths, and four famous old-timers at the Zoo have
passed on. Pokodiak, a female hybrid bear (Alaskan Brown X Polar
Bear), born in 1936, died in April at the age of 38 years. She is the
last of the National Zoological Park’s famous hybrid bears which
had such an eminently popular appeal due to their great size and
unusual family background. Biggy, the 14-foot saltwater crocodile,
one of the largest crocodilians in captivity, died this March after
42 years on exhibition. He was a spectacular animal and well beloved

by his visitors. The Silver-crested Cockatoo, Richard, originally —

known as Jacob, died in February. This bird was brought back from
Sumatra as a mature bird by Dr. Mann with the 1937 National
Geographic/Smithsonian Institution Expedition. He had been for
many years in the home of a Dutch plantation owner and spoke a
smattering of Dutch and Indonesian. He was a great delight to the
visitors, being an excellent talker. He soon learned English, and one

of his favorite phrases, ‘open the door, Richard,” gradually brought ©

about his change in name by which in later years he was known.
This bird was thoroughly imprinted on human beings and would
have nothing to do with his feathered kin, preferring the company
of humans; for this reason since 1965 he was exhibited in the Ele-
phant House to the delight of thousands of children if not to the
delight of the hippopotamuses, his nearest neighbors. His maniacal
laughter, joyous whistling, and general rowdiness will be missed. He
has been replaced by an Amazon parrot, who was given to the Zoo
as a pet similarly imprinted.
ANIMAL HEALTH AND PATHOLOGY

The animal health programs have continued with ongoing investi-
gative research. With the addition of an assistant veterinarian, the
program has been greatly accelerated, including initiation of a train-
ing course for Animal Keepers to expand their ability to recognize
deviation from healthful behavior and habits which may signify the

existence of potential health problems. The death rate has lessened
slightly and significant improvements are anticipated in the future.

Investigations into collection-based health problems were multi-
plied to include:

1. A study of avian orthopedics because existing fracture repair
techniques fall short of preventing shattering in weakened bones.
The techniques currently being tested consist of multiple pins and
external fracture fixation.

2. A study of avian hematology to increase knowledge of the
sources of avian diseases, a field heretofore not well studied even
though species of birds represent the largest proportion of our col-
lection. Diagnostic techniques involving use of blood serum constitu-
ents have been virtually unknown in birds. The study thus far indi-
cates that white blood cell level might be an effective indicator of
infectious diseases which respond to antibiotic treatment. A paper
has been prepared and submitted for publication.

Science / 103
3. A Tiger Virus Disease study has been started to isolate the viral
agent believed, as a result of tissue alterations identified through
light microscopy, to be the possible cause of white tiger cubs’ deaths
earlier in the year.

Studies continued into avian tuberculosis, selenium-vitamin E de-
ficiency, chromosome studies for taxonomic designation, sable blood,
reindeer metabolism, and the important area of establishing normal
blood values for exotic species. The office has cooperated in the de-
velopment of capture equipment and participated in field trials of
newly developed immobilizing agents.

This unit has established a series of seminars for veterinarians on
the East Coast that are involved in exotic-animal medicine, and this
long-felt need for the improvement of exotic-animal medicine has
been well received by the participants.

ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH

The Office of Zoological Research, under Dr. John Eisenberg,
achieved notable progress on 24 projects in field mammalian ecology,
reproduction, behavioral analysis, and nutritional ‘analysis. As one
arbitrary measure of success, 28 original contributions were pub-
lished in the department’s six years of history to 1972, and 43 titles,
with 9 more now in press, since then. Nine graduate students and
two postdoctoral students from six universities were guided and
supported in 1974.

Field efforts in the neotropics by Dr. G. C. Montgomery illumi-
nated the importance of the significant biomass contributions of the
three-toed sloth and of the lesser anteater, as well as to improving
chances for their eventual captive acclimatization. Other studies inte-
grated with the National Museum of Natural History and the Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute advanced with respect to a host
of rodent and primate species.

Methods for scoring the behavior of female mammals as they pass
through estrus were developed by Dr. Devra Kleiman. Behavioral
changes associated with estrus in the tigress were published for the
first time. The role of olfaction as a mediator of reproductive behav-
ior in the binturong was published. The propagation of the golden
marmoset in the second generation was accomplished by Dr. Klei-
man and associated staff. The analysis of reproductive behavior of
the lesser panda and factors contributing to reproductive success in

the giant panda were described. The reproductive behavior and cy-
cling in the Indian rhinoceros was worked out by Dr. H. K. Buechner
and associates. Dr. Buechner also initiated a long-term study on the
determination of estrus and sexual behavior in the sable antelope.

Studies on reproduction in caviomorph rodents have proceeded
in the Zoo collection resulting in the first establishment of captive
colonies of two — Octodontomys gliroides and Pediolagus salini-
cola — and the Zoo being in position to rear successfully two more.
The breeding of Carollia perspicillata, a species of fruit bat, was a
milestone study in the effective management of Chiropterans.

Recognizing the importance of olfaction and the role of olfactory
signals in the priming and triggering of sexual behavior, several
rodent species have been explored by Dr. Michael Murphy, includ-
ing wild stocks of the golden hamster and three genera of cavio-
morph rodents.

Aspects of animal communication, the genesis of social bonds,
and the structure of mammalian societies have been under intensive
investigation with self-evident applications to animal management.
For example, efforts in 1974 show that the success of second-genera-
tion breeding in the golden marmoset hinges upon an understanding
of the formation of social bonds and the role of early experience in
the participation of rearing young. Through analysis, such as are
currently being carried on in the Zoo and in parallel in the field, an
understanding and interpretation of communication in, for example,
the spider monkey now becomes possible.

Dr. Eisenberg and his associates were deeply involved guiding the
success of the Thirteenth International Congress of Ethology held
in August with George Washington University and the Smith-
sonian Institution being the co-hosts. Scientists from many differ-
ent nations attended, resulting in an exciting exchange of stimulating
scientific information.

CONSTRUCTION

As mentioned previously the old Lion House has been demolished
and the new exhibit will begin construction early in July. The char-
acter of “lion house hill” is changing and for the definite advantage
of the big cats and their visiting public. The old Monkey House is
being renovated at this time and should be completed early in the
next calendar year. This house, built in 1904, will be modernized

Science / 105
to have 12 glass-fronted, larger inside exhibit cages and the corre-
sponding number of outside cages. The selection of monkeys will
be fewer than were exhibited before, but they will be in larger family
groups. The old, small-cat house generally referred to as the “puma
house” has been removed and plans are being prepared for its re-
placement by a series of free standing corn-crib-type cages to house
the lesser cats, such as pumas, lynx, and servals. The dog line below
the sea lion pool has also been removed with anticipated replacement
next year by fewer but larger compounds.

Plans are proceeding for the renovation of the outside Elephant
House yards as well as of the outside cages around the Bird House.
New cheetah facilities are being presently constructed just north of
the sea lion pool. This will consist of spacious double enclosures
that will give the cheetahs a much larger area in which to run. This
will also allow separation of the males and females and it is hoped
will enable the establishment of a breeding program for these lovely
cats. In this vein the Zoo has secured, on breeding loan, a pair of
cheetahs from the Baltimore Zoo and a second pair from the Chey-
enne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. Based on recent success of
cheetah breedings at the San Diego Zoo and Lion Country Safari, it
is hoped that a rotating encounter program can be established be-
tween the males and the females which will result in successful
breedings.

VISITOR SERVICES

In 1974, an effort was launched to bring progress in graphics, ex-
hibits, education, and information up to the pace now being set by
the Zoo’s sound and progressive programs in animal management,
animal health, and zoological research. The Visitor Services Group,
led by an assistant director, assembled the Office of Graphics and
Exhibits, Education and Information, and the Protective Services
with the mission of providing the Zoo visitor good guidance and
opportunities for quality educational experiences, and a high degree
of public service and accommodation. This effort coordinates with
the Friends of the National Zoo as they continue to carry the Zoo’s
educational programs to the visitors, to the local school systems,
and surrounding community.

The information and education staffs are being increased, and
exhibits came under the control of an experienced and creative de-

106 / Smithsonian Year 1974

signer in order to bring the interpretive program up to highest stand-
ards. This person will also work closely with the designers, Wyman
and Cannon, Inc., contracted with under a matching grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts to develop a Master Graphics
Plan and Design Manual for the Zoo.

Another important new service for both the employees and visi-
tors was the appointment of a Health and Safety Officer, with in-
creased emphasis on providing this vital area of visitor services.

Management efforts in general in fiscal 1974 focused on building
up understanding and administrative capability at the level of the
operating offices assembled into the Animal Programs Group, Visi-
tor Services Group, and Central Services Group. Central manage-
ment was reduced to a handful of people working to help guide the
growth and progress of the ambitious and spirited Zoo staff.

Office of International and Environmental Programs

The new Office was established on October 15, 1973, combining the
Offices of International Activities and Environmental Sciences. It is
designed to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to
conduct research abroad through the application of its traditional
strengths in collection-based natural history to ecosystem-oriented
studies in the tropics. A new International Environmental Science
Program, incorporating the former programs in Oceanography, Lim-
nology, and Ecology, was initiated at the end of the fiscal year. The
previous program categories are used below to describe studies
conducted during 1973.

The Office also continues to provide support to United States re-
search institutions, including the Smithsonian, through Foreign
Currency Program grants, and service to other Smithsonian units
through the Liaison Section of the International Activities Program.

The Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, an independent unit of
the Office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides for the rapid com-
munication of technical data on natural and environmental phe-
nomena of short duration through a global network of scientific
correspondents.

Wymberley Coerr, formerly Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay,
was appointed to head the new Office.

Science / 107
A series of ecological assessment studies in foreign countries, ad-
ministered by the Office and supported by the Agency for Inter-
national Development, was completed during the year. The studies
included an analysis of the effect of oil pollution on marine orga-
nisms in Indonesia, a review of the environmental consequences of
rapid urbanization in a developing country (Seoul, Korea), and the
ecological impact of Lake Volta in Ghana, the world’s largest man-
made lake. A 4-year study for the purpose of predicting the spread
of waterborne diseases, particularly schistosomiasis, with the im-
poundment of the Mekong River and its tributaries, was completed.

OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY PROGRAM

During their combined 15 years of operations the Smithsonian’s two
oceanographic sorting centers have processed bulk marine samples,
monitored and assessed marine pollution, and conducted baseline
and environmental prediction studies. In the past year, the centers
have processed more than 8 million specimens for specialists and
reference collections. Much of the material processed by the Oceano-
graphic Sorting Center in Washington involved Arctic and Antarctic
biological samples in cooperation with the nsF Office of Polar Pro-
grams. The biological and environmental data accompanying these
samples have been computerized.

Over 3000 specimens at the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Cen-
ter have become a part of the Reference Collections of Mediterra-
nean Marine Biota. Sorted specimens are divided equally and
deposited in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History
and the Institut National Scientifique et Technique d’Oceanographie
et de Peche.

The Existing Conditions of the Biota of the Chesapeake Bay
Project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing informa-
tion on the most important species of Chesapeake Bay, descriptions
of community structure, and analyses of water quality criteria. An
interim report was submitted in October, and the final report will
be submitted during the fiscal year 1975. Coordination responsibili-
ties of the report on the effects of Tropical Storm Agnes were also
performed for the Corps.

The second year of a United States-Yugoslav aquatic study, en-
titled “Limnological Investigations of Lake Skadar,”” was success-
fully completed in cooperation with the Limnology Laboratory of

108 / Smithsonian Year 1974
the Biological Institut of Titograd. Extensive progress was made in
adequately equipping the laboratory and in sampling and analyzing
the preliminary research results. Manuscripts are in progress and
in press.

Development of comprehensive biological studies of marine and
freshwater ecosystems in Egypt and Pakistan is proceeding. A post-
impoundment ecological assessment of the Nam Ngum Reservoir
in Laos was initiated in May 1974.

Liaison with other Smithsonian Institution aquatic sciences was
continued, as was representation on various committees and coun-
cils concerned with oceanography and limnology.

ECOLOGY PROGRAM

An evaluation of environmental resources was undertaken in a study
for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in connection with the Corps’
responsibility for preserving natural, historical, and cultural aspects
of America’s natural heritage. The project involved a comprehensive
review of current environmental inventories and literature on re-
quirements for such inventories, a critique of pilot environmental
reconnaissance inventories, and preparation of guidelines for agen-
cies conducting statewide inventories of critical environmental areas.
The guidebook deals with key issues and decisions that must be
resolved in conducting the inventories and suggests methodology
for delineating areas of critical environmental concern.

The Smithsonian Center for Natural Areas assists, through eco-
logical studies, in planning and establishing priorities for the selec-
tion and preservation of ecologically significant areas. Natural areas
include habitats of threatened species of plants, animals, and com-
munities; important breeding and overwintering areas; sites of
unique interest for research or education interests; and archeological
and related locations that should be preserved. The Center has de-
veloped a quantitive evaluation technique of ecological indicators
as a scientifically valid basis of assigning priorities for acquisition of
permanent nature reserves by procuring agencies.

The Center published a 2-year, natural-areas study of the Chesa-
peake Bay region. The Nature Conservancy, co-sponsor of the study,
intends to use the findings as one basis for procurement and desig-
nation as protected areas sites in the Chesapeake Bay watershed
regarded as ecologically significant.

Science / 109
The Center prepared an inventory of ecologically representative
sites within the Atlantic Coastal Region, together with descriptions
and recommendations to assist the National Park Service in desig-
nating sites for its Registry of Natural Landmarks.

The Center is helping to assess the ecological consequences of
activities at U.S. Air Force Bases in the continental United States in
order to offer a scientific basis for suggesting improvements in con-
servation practices. A comprehensive survey was made for the Air
Force of the existing data on the flora and fauna of Johnston Atoll
in the Pacific, including both terrestrial and marine organisms. The
baseline information was compiled for an evaluation required for
an environmental impact statement for the islands.

The Center for Natural Areas, with approval of the Smithsonian,
was incorporated as an independent organization during fiscal 1974.
The Center’s studies henceforth will be supported by grants and
contracts from foundations, charitable trusts, federal, and state
agencies.

The Smithsonian-Peace Corps Environmental Program provides
assistance in two general areas. It develops Peace Corps projects
and assignments dealing with environmental and natural resource
problems in the developing countries and recruits and places appli-
cants skilled in the environmental biological sciences. Over 700
applications were received in fiscal 1974, and 207 volunteers with
environmental skills were assigned to 28 countries. The volunteers
were requested directly by the host governments for assignment to
scientific and natural conservation programs.

INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES PROGRAM

As a part of the new Office of International and Environmental Pro-
grams, the International Activities Program has undergone no sub-
stantive changes in its functions.

As its major responsibility, the International Activities Program
administers the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. This Pro-
gram awards grants to support the research interests of American
institutions, including the Smithsonian, in those countries where the
United States holds “excess” amounts of local currencies, derived
largely from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public
Law 480. Qualifying countries, where the Treasury Department
deems United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of

110 / Smithsonian Year 1974

normal federal requirements, are presently India, Pakistan, Burma,
Egypt, Tunisia, Guinea, and Poland. The Smithsonian received a
fiscal 1974 appropriation of $4.5 million in “excess” currencies for
the support of grants in the disciplines of archeology and the anthro-
pological sciences, systematics and environmental biology, astro-
physics and the earth sciences, and museum-related fields. During
its first decade of operation, the Foreign Currency Program has
awarded more than $24 million in foreign currency grants to more
than 70 institutions in 32 states and the District of Columbia, in-
volving some 220 museums, universities, and research institutions.
Within the framework of the Program, the Smithsonian made ar-
rangements in fiscal 1974 for the United States to contribute $1
million in support of unEsco efforts to save the submerged temples
at Philae, Egypt. The Program participated in interagency negotia-
tions leading to the establishment of a United States-Yugoslav Joint
Board of Scientific and Technical Cooperation. This Board makes it
possible to extend the period for which support will be available for
already approved United States-Yugoslav cooperative research proj-
ects, including Smithsonian research in limnology and Smithsonian
Foreign Currency-supported archeological research.

The International Liaison Section continues to provide other
Smithsonian units with assistance in international matters involving
travel and projects abroad. It coordinated the travel and research
arrangements of the many foreign scholars visiting the Smithsonian,
and it makes arrangements for other foreign visitors. A growing
area of liaison responsibility is in special programs for foreign re-
search cooperation. These include promoting Smithsonian scientific
and scholarly cooperation with the People’s Republic of China and
under binational arrangements with Israel and Germany.

CENTER FOR SHORT-LIVED PHENOMENA

The Center operates a worldwide electronic alert system for rapid
communication of scientific data on natural and environmental phe-
nomena of short duration. During the year the Center reported 155
short-lived events that occurred in 44 countries, islands, and ocean
areas. Scientific field teams investigated 120 of the events. The re-
porting network consists of about 2000 scientists, scientific research
institutions, and field stations located in 138 countries throughout
the globe.

Science / 111
Scientists and other subscribers to the Center’s service receive in-
formation on significant changes in biological, ecological, and geo-
physical systems, including rare or unusual animal migrations,
population increases, and mortalities, major floods, forest fires, and
pollution events, such as oil and chemical spills, gas and radioactive
substance leaks, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, and
occasional astrophysical events, such as meteorite falls and fireballs.

The Center has enlarged its International Environmental Alert
Network to include more than 60,000 secondary school and univer-
sity students in over 800 schools throughout the United States and
Canada, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Rumania, Jor-
dan, Lebanon, Ghana, Korea, Singapore, Tanzania, Sudan, Sri
Lanka, South West Africa, England, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus,
Zambia, France, The Netherlands, and Kenya.

Services under contract were provided to the United Nations En-
vironment Program; the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization; the United States National Aeronautic and
Space Administration; and the United States Environmental Protec-
tion Agency.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

The importance and significance of energy as the driving force of
our technological society became abundantly clear in 1974 as politi-
cal and economic forces displaced familiar use patterns. Thus, the
laboratory’s charter ‘to study the role of sunlight in maintaining
life on the earth” anticipated current concerns by almost a half cen-
tury. In fact, the purposes and objectives of the laboratory become
increasingly important as the world’s population grows, and its food
needs and requirements for diminishing fossil-fuel resources expand.

During fiscal 1974 the laboratory emphasized several major areas
of research on aspects of solar radiation that influence biological
systems: (1) measuring the solar energy received at the earth’s sur-
face, its quantity, quality, and duration, since these parameters
establish the starting point for all aspects of photobiology; (2) the
biochemistry and biophysics of energy storage (photosynthesis) and
the structures (pigments and membrane systems) involved in cap-

112 / Smithsonian Year 1974
turing the sun’s energy; (3) the regulation of the use of this stored
energy by living organisms in response to complex signals of light,
temperature, or gases in the environment; and (4) the use of the
photosynthetic products to date the time when objects of biological
origin were last alive and in equilibrium with the environment
(carbon dating).

SOLAR ENERGY

Measurements of solar energy were recorded from a monitoring
network including four locations: Barrow, Alaska; Flamenco Island,
Panama; the National Physical Laboratory in Jerusalem, Israel; and
at Rockville, Maryland. This network covers the Northern Hemi-
sphere reasonably well and records at three-minute intervals the
energy received in six color bands, as well as the total energy from
the ultraviolet short wavelength limit to the infrared (2.8 microns),
where the energy per photon is no longer capable of driving photo-
chemical reactions.

From this enormous volume of data have been extracted many
useful pieces of information. For example, the area required for
suitable collectors to provide the necessary energy to heat or to air
condition buildings may be ‘calculated or estimates of the upper
limits for plant growth in an area may be computed.

In addition, some data implicate solar ultraviolet with skin cancer
incidence. Particularly, as more and more supersonic transport air-
craft are flown, it is postulated that the fuel exhausts will catalyze
the breakdown of the protective ozone screen in the atmosphere,
which limits the amount of ultraviolet penetrating to the earth’s
surface. In cooperation with the Air Resources Laboratories of
NOAA, a scanning radiometer was stationed at Tallahassee, Florida.
This instrument measures narrow bandwidths of ultraviolet in the
erythemal (region of sunlight that causes skin reddening) band and
these data are being tested to see if a correlation exists between
quality and quantity received and the incidence of skin cancer (as
measured by the National Cancer Institute) in Tallahassee.

Another important factor in solar irradiance measurements is the
primary standard to which all measurements are referred. The
Smithsonian has a long history of developing standards, and this
year a symposium was held for international authorities on solar
instruments and measurements to discuss and evaluate the initiation

and worldwide use of a uniform and precisely defined measuring
scale. While there is, as yet, no consensus as to the best scale system,
at least intercomparison may now be made in a more rational man-
ner. The papers presented at this symposium will be published as a
Smithsonian publication.

In order to pursue the importance of light on plant growth, four
large growth chambers were installed in which the major parameters
regulating plant growth can be controlled. These include the nutrient
and root media, the atmospheric media and the light environment.
Plants are grown on soil or artificial substrate systems (nutriculture).

REGULATORY BIOLOGY

Light in the environment also may regulate the rate of synthesis
of cell components or the rate of metabolism and growth of plant
parts. Such light signals must be absorbed by pigment molecules to
be effective. During the past year the laboratory has been isolating
and purifying the pigment phytochrome. By hydrolyzing it in vari-
ous ways and determining the amino-acid composition of the various

Instruments used for measuring solar radiation. The instrument in the rear is
the Smithsonian standard water-flow. The other instruments, from left to
right, are a Smithsonian modified 1905 Angstrom normal incidence pyrhelio-
meter, an Abbot pyranometer, a modified Abbot pyranometer and an Abbot
silver disk pyrheliometer. The pyranometers are used to measure radiation
from the sun and sky while the pyrheliometers and the water-flow measure
only radiation from the sun (direct solar beam).

peptides produced, information has been obtained about the mole-
cular weight and the chemical structure of this protein pigment.

The phytochrome pigment was isolated from dark-grown rye seed-
lings. After purification, electrophoresis, and gel permeation chroma-
tography of the undenatured protein indicated a molecular weight
of about 400,000 daltons. Disc gel electrophoresis in detergents
indicated a principal product was formed with a molecular weight
of about 120,000 daltons. Cleavage of the protein was performed
with cyanogen bromide, which reacts with methionine residues.
This produced five peptides: one of 15,000 daltons, a chromopeptide
containing the light-absorbing portion (11,000 daltons), one about
8000 daltons, and two smaller ones. These data are consistent with
the 13S phytochrome being composed of one species of protomer
having a molecular weight of 42,000 and 4 methionine residues
per protomer.

Another approach to the molecular function of phytochrome is
the determination of the dependence of physiological responses upon
the dose of light given. For a number of flowering plants, such as
peas and mustard, dose-response curves were determined, as well
as changes in the dose-response curves following sequential expo-
sures to light. In addition, the capacity for rapid chlorphyll accumu-
lation was measured. Data indicate that the physiologically active
form of phytochrome produced by the first red exposure migrates
to a membrane surface, which results in more light being required
for a given response. But once light is absorbed, it is more effective
because the active molecule is already attached to a membrane in-
volved in the response.

For photosynthesis to occur efficiently, the incident sunlight must
be absorbed in all wavelength regions. Algae have solved this prob-
lem by forming special pigment protein complexes known as phyco-
bilisomes. These complexes trap the light energy and transfer it to
a “reaction center,” where it is used to produce energy-rich com-
pounds. Phycobilisomes can be isolated and then dissociated into
their component parts. A model has been developed this year that
describes at the molecular level the spatial arrangement of at least
four pigments involved and their attachment to the photosynthetic
membranes.

The chloroplasts of higher plants also trap light energy and
convert it to chemical energy. Formation of chloroplasts and the

116 / Smithsonian Year 1974

maintenance of chloroplast structure is a fascinating problem that is
attracting considerable attention. Making the proteins for a func-
tional chloroplast requires cooperation between nuclear and chloro-
plast genetic systems. That is, the genetic material for and the
synthesis of certain chloroplast proteins are located in the nucleus
and cytoplasm respectively, while the genetic material for and the
synthesis of other chloroplast proteins are located in the chloroplast.
Part of the chloroplast protein synthesis occurs on chloroplast
photosynthetic membranes.

During the past year, a system was developed in which biosyn-
thesis of chloroplast photosynthetic membranes could be studied in
vitro. In actively growing cells of the alga Chlamydomonas, a large
portion of chloroplast ribosomes exists attached to the photosyn-
thetic membranes. Electron micrographs of isolated membranes show
that some of the ribosomes are bound as polyribosomes. When the
membranes are dissolved by detergent, these polyribosomes can be
recovered and account for more than half of the ribosomes bound to
the membranes. These results suggest that the membrane-ribosome
association functions in protein synthesis, because polysomes occur
when active protein synthesis takes place. This assumption was
confirmed by the finding that the isolated membrane-ribosome
association will carry out protein synthesis. This protein synthesis
reaction depends on the presence of the ribosomes attached to the
membranes. It is inhibited by chloramphenicol, not by cyclohexi-
mide, as is expected for protein synthesis by chloroplast ribosomes.
The protein synthesis reaction requires an energy generation system
and a soluble cell extract. The reaction is inhibited by ribonuclease.
These properties indicate that the protein synthesis reaction is car-
ried out by the isolated membranes.

Blue light regulates the biosynthesis of yellow pigments, such as
the vitamin A precursor, 8-carotene. At least eight different caro-
tenoids are synthesized after light exposure of dark-grown mycelial
pads of the bread mold Neurospora crassa. The photoinduction of
these pigments can be divided into at least three phases: (a) a rapid
light reaction, (b) a period of protein synthesis, and (c) accumulation
of the carotenoid pigment.

The effect of temperature on these processes has been studied
this year. The light reaction, of course, is temperature-independent,
but synthesis immediately following light exposure has an optimum

Science / 117
near 6°C. These data, as well as studies with inhibitors of protein
synthesis, indicate that the light reaction produces an inducer that
activates a gene. The genetic code in the activated gene specifies the
amino-acid sequence of an enzyme required for carotenoid biosyn-
thesis. This enzyme is apparently absent in dark-grown cultures.
Furthermore, physiological evidence indicates that the inducer is
lost from the carotenoid-synthesizing system in a temperature-
dependent competitive reaction.

In addition, four different types of mutant strains of Neurospora
were produced from wild type by vv light: albinos, which do not
make pigment even in the presence of light; yellow-orange mutants,
which synthesize a different distribution of pigments; mutants in
which the sensitivity of carotenoid synthesis to temperatures above
6°C has been reduced; and mutants which can make pigment in the
dark.

The activities of many enzymes in organisms from bacteria to
man appear to be under the control of cyclic-amp (adenosine mono-
phosphate). For example, in man the hormones epinephrine or glu-
cagon stimulate the synthesis of cyclic-amp, which in turn activates
a series of enzymes required for starch breakdown. Evidence has
been obtained that animal cells that have been transformed by a
virus to cancerous cells have lower than normal cyclic-amp levels.
There is evidence in frogs and rats that light controls the level of
cyclic-amp. We have obtained evidence that such a control system
exists in Neurospora and may be part of the mechanism for photo-
induction of carotenoid synthesis. Since cyclic-amp probably regu-
lates the activities of many different enzymes in Neurospora, then
control of the level of cyclic-amp by light should regulate a number
of biochemical pathways besides carotenoid synthesis. Such a control
mechanism can be conveniently studied in Neurospora and the
results used to predict the type of control system that operates in
higher organisms.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

Light acts not only as a carrier of information for regulating metabo-
lism but is also absorbed and stored as chemical energy, along with
the production of oxygen as a byproduct (photosynthesis). If leaves
of plants are exposed to low temperatures (chilling), there is an
inhibition in the rate of fixation of carbon dioxide. In addition, the

118 / Smithsonian Year 1974
oxygen-evolving power of leaves after cold storage is regulated by
mangano-protein in the chloroplast thylakoids. Since a great deal of
the world’s agriculture and the distribution of wild plant populations
are limited by temperature, it is important to determine the portion
of the photosynthetic mechanism directly affected by chilling.
Plants that were grown under very warm conditions (30°C) were
exposed to a succession of days and nights of cool (10°C day, 5°C
night) temperatures, and the ability of whole leaves to take up
carbon dioxide was measured. Within 24 hours after exposure to
low temperature, the plants’ capacity to take up carbon dioxide at
warm temperatures was reduced by about 25 percent. Longer expo-
sure to low temperature brings with it further reduction in carbon
assimilation.

The process of photosynthesis involves considerably more than
carbon dioxide assimilation, and in order to determine which of the
many steps is affected by changes in temperature, a partitioning of
the process was attempted. Photosynthetic cells from the leaf were
separated from the remaining nonphotosynthetic tissue. Active
whole cells were obtained which retain the capacity to evolve oxygen
using light. Exposure of plants to chilling temperatures, however,
does not consistently affect the capacity of cells extracted from these
plants to evolve oxygen. Sometimes there is a substantial reduction
in oxygen evolution and sometimes only minor change. The reason
for this variability is as yet unknown.

Measurements have been made of the total productive capacity
for communities of plants in a salt marsh in the Chesapeake Bay.
It has been assumed that salt marshes contribute substantially to
their neighboring estuaries and are consequently essential to the
maintenance of life in the estuaries. Assimilated carbon in the marsh
is exported to the estuary; however, most data for this assumption
are based upon an incomplete examination of the capacity of the
marsh to take up and metabolize carbon! A plastic chamber to
enclose a section of the marsh community has been constructed in
conjunction with a continuous flow, infrared, gas-analysis system
to monitor the net carbon dioxide exchange over the marsh com-
munity.

In addition to net carbon dioxide exchange, a method has been
evaluated for determining the amount of green matter in a marsh
without the necessity of destroying any of the community being

tion is determined in air as it enters and leaves the chamber. Below: Radio-

studied. The method depends upon the fact that green plants reflect
red light less than they reflect far-red radiation (light that is at and
just beyond the sensitivity of the human eye). The seasonal change
in reflectance of these two bands of light was found to change as
the total amount of green matter in the stand of plants changed.
This method was originally developed to study productivity of
prairie communities, but the method appears to work in marshes.
A correlation was found between the reflectance measurements and
direct measurements of biomass obtained by cutting and weighing
samples. Thus, a rapid, nondestructive assay of growth in marshes
can be obtained. The method also has the advantage that the equip-
ment is portable and, thus, usable in remote locations.

The growth of plants in an estuarine environment is sometimes
limited by phosphorus cycling in the tidal environment. Phosphorus
flux rates and phosphorus cycling in situ in the tidal marsh, mud
flat periphyton, and plankton communities of the Rhode River sub-
estuary of Chesapeake Bay were measured. Techniques employed
included phosphorus-32-orthophosphate uptake and chase kinetics,

Current concept of the pathways of estuarine plankton phosphorus cycling.
Processes stopped by enclosing a sample in a bottle are indicated as dashed
arrows. Heavy lines indicate major processes. Phosphate uptake by phyto-
plankton requires light energy and the presence of iodoacetic acid (IAA)

inhibits direct biological uptake of orthophosphate.

analysis of specific and total activity in various metabolically mean-
ingful phosphorus fractions, detailed chromatographic fractionation,
continuous-flow pulse-labeling of plankton, direct microscopic
examination of microbial communities, and phosphorus-33 micro-
autoradiography. From these data the major pathways of phosphorus }
cycling in estuarine plankton were constructed. The heavy arrows |
are believed to be main pathways. Microbiological data, as well as:
the size classing and inhibitor data, support this picture. Thus, |
orthophosphate is taken up mostly by bacteria that are mainly on)
the surfaces of suspended sediments and detritus, but phytoplankton }
also take up some orthophosphate in the light. The bacteria and}
phytoplankton are then eaten by filter feeders, especially ciliate»
protozoans. These in turn release most of the phosphorus as dis- |
solved orthophosphate and organic phosphorus.

In addition, the phosphorus cycling in a deciduous forest when)
subjected to various levels of mineral nutrient loading was measured.
Phosphorus loading of the leaf-litter zone beneath beech trees in)
Maryland was varied from the “natural” level (3 to 12 mg P.m~** |
day~") to 430 mg P.m~**day—? above the natural level. Phosphorus-
32 was used to measure rates and to determine pathways of phos-
phorus cycling. Upon increased loading, the phosphorus content of '
the litter increased fourfold and then stabilized. When this loading
was discontinued, the phosphorus content of the litter declined to
the original level. Phosphorus not assimilated by the leaf litter
moved rapidly through the soil both vertically and horizontally.
Forest trees obtained most of their phosphorus from the litter zone.

Sometimes the effects of a sudden dramatic changes in energy —
flow in the environment can be assayed. Such a dynamic stress
occurred in tropical storm Agnes. Although the storm center cir-_
cumnavigated the Rhode River estuary, the salinity reached a
minimum about two weeks later because of flooding by the Susque- |
hanna River. This event was coincident with the year’s highest water |
temperature (30-31°C) and resulted in severe mortalities in the i
biota. Periphyton (attached microbial communities) experienced a _
nearly complete die-off. High levels of sediments and of nutrients, —
especially nitrate and total- phosphorus, were delivered to Rhode -
River by the bay proper and from local runoff. These nutrients
were deposited in Rhode River bottom sediments. This reservoir
released nutrients a year later, especially at a time of low dissolved

122 / Smithsonian Year 1974 |
‘oxygen in the bottom water and of intensive dinoflagellate blooms.

In a 13-day period it is estimated that over 900 Kg phosphorus was
released from the bottom sediments. Thus, even though the effects
were indirect from tropical storm Agnes, they were large.

CARBON DATING

Because all living things are in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere, and this equilibrium is fixed at the time of death,
with the radioactive carbon"! gradually decaying away as the sample
ages, it is possible to determine the age of biological specimens back
to about 40,000 years by measuring their radioactive carbon! con-
tent. From data taken from the remains and artifacts of archaic
populations, it is possible to explore the relationships between
changing environments and changing cultures.

From such artifacts a chronological framework is being con-
structed for populations in North America. In cooperation with
anthropologists, geologists, and palynologists the time period 6000
'B.c to 2000 B.c. has been examined for northeastern North America.

Of particular interest is the date of entry of man into the New
World. In cooperation with the University of Alaska, dating of
selected archeological and geological sites discovered during con-
struction of the Alaska pipeline have been accomplished. Recent
findings published by the Scripps Institution, using the determina-
tion of racemic mixtures of aspartic acid, indicate that man was
present in North America at least 50,000 years before the present.
However, dates from the North Slope in our laboratory confirm
occupation of more than 10,000 years ago.

Thus, the requirement for more energy to drive our technology
that resulted in the need for the Alaska pipeline has yielded as a
secondary scientific benefit an indication of man’s early history in

the New World.

PUBLIC SERVICE

Lectures and invited symposium talks were presented by the staff
to more than 30 research institutions and universities, both nation-
ally and internationally. Hundreds of reprints of published data
were distributed to interested professional colleagues, and several
| staff members taught seminars and courses in their professional
specialties.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

On July 1, 1973, the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University
established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, a Center for Astrophysics

to coordinate the related research activities of the Smithsonian |

Astrophysical Observatory (sao) and the Harvard College Observa-
tory (Hco) under a single director.

At that time, George B. Field, Professor of Astronomy at Harvard |

University, became the director of the joint facility and of both

|

observatories, succeeding Fred L. Whipple of sao and Alexander

Dalgarno of Hco.

The creation of this new consolidated science program, drawing
on the resources of the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard Univer-
sity to achieve scientific excellence, is both a response to the new
research goals and opportunities of the present and a reflection of
traditional ties of the past.

During the past decade, astrophysics has experienced an explosion
of ideas. New windows on the universe have been opened by the
discovery of radiation in unexpected bands of the electromagnetic
spectrum. And the expanded use of rocket, balloon, and satellite
experiments has allowed observation of this radiation from above

the earth’s obscuring atmosphere. Gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet

light, and infrared radiation are all now observed almost as routinely
as radio and visible waves. Each new spectrum window has revealed
a vast and varied universe filled with objects defying the imagina-
tion: quasars, pulsars, X-ray and gamma-ray stars, black holes, and
neutron stars, as well as massive interstellar clouds of dust particles
and complex molecules.

When it was founded by Samuel Pierpont Langley in 1890, the
goal of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was the increase
and diffusion of knowledge about the earth and its immediate as-
tronomical environment. This goal remains unchanged today; how-
ever, the technological developments in observational techniques
and data analysis, coupled with unusual advances in theoretical
astronomy, now allow Smithsonian scientists to expand their
astronomical horizons to the very edge of the universe.

Two major scientific problems are at the core of this expanded
astronomical research program. The first is the evolution of matter,
starting with the explosive beginning of the universe some 20 billion

124 / Smithsonian Year 1974
years ago. After the formation of galaxies and stars, some matter
collapsed into those exotic and unusual objects known as quasars,
neutron stars, and black holes.

The extreme physical conditions existing in these objects severely
test all the fundamental principles of modern physics. Obviously,
the evolutionary processes forming stars and galaxies hold clues
to how the universe began — and how it may end!

| The second problem concerns the cosmic matter that has cooled
sufficiently for molecules and solid particles to form. The conden-
sation of materials accompanying the formation of stars like our
own sun apparently results in the formation of planets and the
eventual emergence of life. Through continued studies of this matter
in space, as well as of the sun, planets, and earth, sao scientists
seek to understand the processes that led to the origin of life in the
universe.

The solution of these two problems in modern astronomy can be
achieved only through the concerted efforts of a variety of investi-
gators using a diversity of approaches. For example, the study of
matter under extreme conditions can be approached through high-
energy astrophysics, solar and stellar physics, or optical astronomy;
while the study of solid particles can be approached through infra-
red and radio astronomy, planetary sciences or geoastronomy.
Theoretical and laboratory studies underlie each approach. Each
approach also requires quite different research tools, ranging from
rocket, balloon, and satellite detectors for gamma-ray and X-ray
astronomy, to shock-tube and radiation laboratories and computers
for molecular and atomic physics.

The complexity of modern astronomical research thus demands
the consolidation of efforts whenever possible. The Center for
Astrophysics is designed for this purpose — to draw on the differ-
ent strengths of the Smithsonian and Harvard observatories. The
once loose groupings of scientists and projects are now concentrated
in eight divisions representing the major approaches to the dual
problems of cosmic evolution and life in the universe.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS

The laboratory and theoretical program of this division are closely
related to other experimental and observational programs at the
Center. Specifically, this group is concerned with the chemical re-

Science / 125
in theoretical atomic physics, the calculation of atomic transition)|
probabilities, and the application of laser techniques to atomic and‘

of data returned from other Center space programs.

GEOASTRONOMY

This division continues sao’s long-term program to study earth |
dynamics, the upper atmosphere, and earth’s gravitational field.

In cooperation with scores of other organizations around the}
world, the earth dynamics program is building the large data base |
necessary to define the kinematics, bulk dynamics, and mass distri- |
bution of the earth. The program depends heavily on sao’s sophisti- |
cated laser and camera satellite-tracking network, supported by the |
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The upper atmospheric research program uses computer analysis |
of the anomalies in satellite orbits to develop accurate models of |
the earth’s gravity field and to define the forces exerted by both
sunshine and earthshine.

A gravitational redshift project will utilize an extremely accurate,
rocket-borne, maser clock, paired with a similar ground-based
instrument, to test the equivalence principle of Einstein’s Theory —
of Relativity in the gravitational field of the earth.

HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS

The Center is emerging as a national leader in the field of high-
energy astronomy, and particularly X-ray research, through its
participation in the nasa-sponsored series of high-energy astronomi-
cal observatories (HEAO). Major efforts are directed toward con-
struction and planning of experiments aboard the HEAO-B, now
scheduled for launch in 1975 as the first true space observatory
capable of high angular resolution X-ray observations. This satellite
will permit the first studies of the X-ray structure of extended objects
and complex sources. In the meantime, the division continues its
analysis of data obtained by- uHuRU satellite, the pioneering experi-
ment in this field. This effort has led to the first identification of a
probable “black hole” in the constellation Cygnus.

126 / Smithsonian Year 1974
Ground-based observations at Mt. Hopkins have led to the detec-
tion of gamma-ray emissions from the Crab Nebula.
OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY

This division’s activities fall in four related areas: studies of infrared
emissions from galaxies and H II regions; studies of the spectra of
stars and circumstellar materials; analysis of the spectra of inter-
stellar materials and planetary atmospheres; and optical studies of
‘emission from X-ray sources and pulsars. Observations are made
‘with Center instruments at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona; Agassiz Station,
Massachusetts; and Boyden Station, South Africa; as well as with
instruments at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, and
_ Hale Observatories, California, and their respective Southern
| Hemisphere installations at Cerro Tololo and Las Campanas, Chile.
The Harvard component of these observing programs is supported
by the National Science Foundation (NsF).

This division’s observational capabilities will be greatly enhanced
by the addition of a large telescope of revolutionary design. This
-multiple-mirror telescope (MMT) combines six 72-inch mirrors in a
hexagonal array around a central core to produce an instrument with
the light-gathering capacity of a conventional 176-inch telescope.
The mnt is now under construction jointly by sao and the University
of Arizona.

PLANETARY SCIENCES

Traditionally, sao has been a recognized leader in the study of the
smaller bodies of the solar system. Vigorous programs involving
geochemical and petrological analyses of lunar and meteoritical
samples continue, as does the remote sensing of planets, satellites,
and asteroids, largely supported by Nasa.

Observations of comets, combined with computer analyses of
their orbits and laboratory studies of their physical properties, also
continue. During the past year, the Center served as a major clearing-
house for information related to the international program to observe
and study Comet Kohoutek. Theoretical work in this field is being
supported through Harvard by nsr.

RADIO ASTRONOMY

The Center’s radio astronomy program results from the strong

Science / 127
efforts begun at the Harvard College Observatory with NsF support. |

It includes capability in both the centimeter and the millimeter
wavelength bands of the radio spectrum. Laboratory facilities sup-
port the observational program by measuring properties of spectral
lines in these wavelengths. This combined effort has identified sev-
eral new interstellar molecules.

A cooperative program continues with the University of Texas
to conduct observations in the 2- and 3-millimeter wavelength

bands.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS

The Center’s unusually strong program in this field is founded on
the observational data provided by the Harvard solar satellite pro-
gram and the theoretical work done by sao scientists in the develop-
ment of model stellar atmospheres. The extensive data produced
by the Harvard experiment aboard nasa’s Skylab satellite should
provide the basis for several years of analysis and interpretation
leading to a new understanding of the energy-generation processes
in the outer layers of the sun. The broad range of sao-developed
computer programs and theoretical techniques is being applied to
the interpretation of ultraviolet solar and stellar observations, both
from Skylab and other satellites such as Copernicus. In addition,
the successful flight of a balloon-mounted 40-inch infrared telescope
in early 1974 demonstrated the feasibility of further large-aperture
flights for broadband photometry and mapping, multiband and
galactic sources. This project was a joint venture of sao, Hco, and
the University of Arizona.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS

If the Center is distinguished by its broad spectrum of astrophysical
problems under investigation, then it is the theoretical effort that
serves as the catalyst encouraging active and fruitful interrelation-
ships among different approaches to similar problems. Thus, the
objectives of this division are to establish and maintain expertise
in those areas of physics underlying the applications to astrophysics,
to create active research areas along a broad front, and to alert the
Center staff of new directions in astrophysics. Most important,
perhaps, this division plays a major role in the Center’s commitment
to astronomy education: identifying, encouraging, and training new

128 / Smithsonian Year 1974

jastronomers, as well as bringing talented students and younger pro-
fessionals into its research program. Much of this division’s effort
is also supported by nsr.

| The pooling of Smithsonian and Harvard scientific resources in
a Center for Astrophysics seems an appropriately modern and
rational adaptation to the times. Oddly enough, it is more the natural
evolution of the long relationship between the two organizations.
Since 1955, when the headquarters of sao moved to the grounds of
the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, the two observa-
tories have pursued astronomical research in close collaboration,
with many members of the Smithsonian staff holding joint appoint-
ments at Harvard and using University-owned facilities.

The ties between Harvard and Smithsonian, however, reach back
into the nineteenth century, when Harvard alumnus and United
‘States President John Quincy Adams urged both his alma mater
and his Congress to establish jointly an astronomical observatory
to serve the nation, preferably under the aegis of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Echoing this call for joint academic-government action, Joseph
Henry, first Secretary of the Institution, later urged that any observ-
atory established by the Smithsonian should be “closely connected
with some well-endowed and well-established college or university.”

Nearly a century and a half have passed, but the dreams of both
Joseph Henry and John Quincy Adams are finally realized in the
Center for Astrophysics. This cooperative venture has great impli-
cations for the future, not only because it may serve as a guide for
other similar pairings of private and public institutions, but also
because the basic goals it pursues must surely affect all aspects of
human life — from genetics to energy production.

Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc.

This year has been an important one for the Smithsonian Science
Information Exchange (ssi) as it actively began its efforts to move
from a national center for information about ongoing research to one
more international in terms of coverage and use of its services. The
Exchange, which has provided services to foreign users over the

Science / 129
years, has now begun to seek and include input on research in |
progress overseas in a more concerted way, while at the same time |
it has also increased its coverage at the national level. |

Many of the problems now confronting our own government are
of equal concern to other countries, and these new national priorities |
require a knowledge of ongoing research in other countries as well.
Such information will ultimately be available through the Exchange |
as present plans to increase its coverage develop over the next few |
years. Efforts to increase coverage in such major areas as agricultural |
research, cancer, energy and environmental research are already
underway, supported by both federal and nonfederal organizations |
as well as through the help of both national and international
organizations.

The Exchange is presently exploring all feasible ways for collect-
ing or developing access to a comprehensive record of worldwide
scientific and technical research and development work in progress |
and to exercise vigorous United States leadership in creating a sys- |
tem for storing and exchanging such information with initial efforts !
directed toward those programs of primary national interest. These
are at least seven data bases of ongoing research currently in exist- |
ence in other countries and many others are being developed. Input |
or exchange from these as well as selected input in specialized areas
of interest from other countries will enhance the value of the
Exchange’s data base to both scientists and research managers in |
the United States. Many of the systems currently in existence are
based on systems that were developed along the lines of the
Exchange’s system following visits to the sste. Compatibility between
systems will be encouraged wherever possible to facilitate exchange
of information.

As a consequence of its efforts in the fiscal year 1974, the Ex- |
change has increased foreign input and established methods for
increased use of the Exchange by foreign scientists. To illustrate
the latter, an agreement has been reached with the Institute for
Documentation in the Federal Republic of Germany which will |
provide support for the use of ssrE services by a large number of
German scientists over an initial one-year period. The project will
provide an opportunity for,a large number of German research ©
investigators to observe firsthand the value of learning before publi- |
cation what their colleagues in the United States are doing in areas —

130 / Smithsonian Year 1974
of research closely paralleling their own efforts. It may also expedite
development of similar systems such as ssiE in Germany as well as
lead to more cooperative efforts on problems of similar interest and
an exchange of ongoing research information.

The Exchange has continued to explore and implement techniques
for increased utilization of its information by coupling it with biblio-
graphic information including both scientific journal literature and
technical reports. These efforts include the use of publications con-
taining the combined information as well as coupling of information
obtained directly from the ssie data base with that from other
information systems, thus providing users of such material with the
latest in both published and ongoing research information. Discus-
sions have taken place with several Federal data-base systems to
expand this approach and offer remote on-line searches of selected
portions of the Exchange’s data base.

Considerable progress has been made in the development and
testing of a new machine-aided indexing system. This system, which
was designed to help the Exchange’s staff of professional scientists
and engineers cope with the increasing volume of information com-
ing into the Exchange, will also be of interest and value to other
information systems of a similar nature. The system is not intended
to replace the scientific expertise necessary for maintaining a high
quality of indexing but rather complements it by picking up routine
terms that are readily identifiable, freeing the scientists to concen-
trate on the more important aspect of conceptual indexing. Publica-
tion of the technique will be made following more extensive testing
of the system in the coming year. This project is another example
of the Exchange’s continuing effort in research and development
designed not only to improve the ssir’s system but make such
developments available by publication for use throughout the infor-
mation community.

The Exchange as a result of offering new services and expanding
previously available ones has shown an increase in use in fiscal 1974
primarily as a result of making more scientists aware of the Ex-
change’s services. The response by many users to the Exchange’s
Newsletter has been excellent in terms of increased subscriptions
and products ordered through this organ. The Exchange’s continu-
ing user-evaluation program indicates that it is providing a highly
useful and important service. The Exchange has also developed

Science / 131
closer liaison with Federal agencies to increase their utilization of
SSIE services in the management of their own research programs
particularly in areas of high national interest.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

This year marked a change in the administration of the Smithsonian |
Tropical Research Institute. Dr. Martin H. Moynihan, in order to |

devote his full time to research, resigned to become a senior scientist

at the Institute after directing this bureau for 16 years. During this —

|
|
|
|
|
|
:

period he guided stri’s growth from a biological preserve and small

field camp on Barro Colorado Island to a research institute with a
worldwide reputation. During Dr. Moynihan’s tenure the permanent
professional staff increased from 1 to 15, and the geographic scope
of their investigations extended from Barro Colorado Island and
the surrounding forests to adjacent areas of Central and South
America, and then to intertropical comparisons in Gabon, Ceylon,
India, Madagascar, Malaya, and New Guinea. Moynihan supported
a program of student fellowship at both the pre- and post-doctoral
level and encouraged a steadily increasing number of scientific
visitors from around the world.

The research of the institute’s staff closely reflects the depth and
diversity of Dr. Moynihan’s own scientific interests, which in the
last 15 years have ranged from the behavior, evolution, and ecology
of such diverse groups as birds, primates, and cephalopods. Research
on the latter group was facilitated by the development of a marine
research program and stri marine laboratories on both the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts of Panama.

Ira Rubinoff was appointed the new Director, and A. Stanley
Rand has assumed the responsibilities of Assistant Director of sTRI.

The development of str1 research program was paralleled by an
increase in facilities and support staff. These include, new animal-
keeping facilities, air-conditioned laboratories, sea-water systems,
research vessels, and an excellent tropical biology library, which
now includes over 14,000 volumes and served approximately 4000
patrons in fiscal 1974.

Research at strI continues to be primarily concerned with basic

132 / Smithsonian Year 1974
| scientific questions of the evolutionary and ecological adaptations
_of tropical organisms.

Two new scientists joined our staff in the fiscal year 1974. Olga F.
Linares is an anthropologist studying human paleoecological proc-
esses and contemporary subsistence adaptations to the American
and African tropics. Alan P. Smith, a plant ecologist, has accepted a
joint appointment with str1 and the University of Pennsylvania. He
will examine the physiological adaptations to seasonality of plants
on Barro Colorado Island.

Scientists at stRI continued their studies concerning a variety of
organisms.

R. L. Dressler spent several weeks in field work in Mexico study-
ing orchids and their pollinators. He published two books: Orqui-
deas de las Américas (with Mariano Ospina H.), the first general
reference book on American orchids in Spanish, and The Genus
Encyclia in Mexico (with Glenn E. Pollard), the first detailed treat-
ment of that group. A Spanish edition of the latter volume will be
published shortly.

Pollination of Polycynis barbata by Eulaema speciosa. When the male bee
lands on the lip to gather the perfume, its weight pulls the flower down and
the curved column touches the dorsal surface of the bee, depositing pollen.
Pollination results if the bee already carried pollen from another flower.

Science / 133
The history of coral reefs off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
of Panama are being investigated by Peter Glynn and his associates.
They are taking core samples through the reefs in order to determine
the age of the reefs and their species composition at different levels.
Reefs in Panama have been found to be about 6000 years old. Over |
the past 1000 years significant changes in coral populations have
occurred on a Caribbean fringe reef, but the causes of these changes
are not presently known.

J. Graham studied the diving capability of the sea snake Pelamis
platurus, which is common along the Pacific Coast of Panama, and
found that while the snake has some of the typical adaptations found
among vertebrate divers, it can also respire aquatically. J. H. Gee
of the University of Manitoba spent a sabbatical year at str1 and
collaborated with Graham and F. S. Robison in a study of buoyancy
adjustment during diving of sea snakes.

E. Leigh took a field trip to the Amazon region of Peru to con-
tinue his comparative studies of the structure of tropical forests.

M. Moynihan and A. Rodaniche have continued their studies on
the social behavior of the Caribbean squid Sepioteuthis sepioidea
and have begun observations on a number of Pacific Ocean cephalo-
pods. M. Moynihan has completed his book The New World Pri-
mates, which should be published shortly.

A. S. Rand continues his analysis of the displays of species of
Anolis. He began to develop the first animated lizard display film,
which will provide a tool for dissecting displays into their compo-
nents and analyzing the functional aspects of these components.

Michael and Barbara Robinson continued studies of the ecology
and behavior of tropical spiders. They investigated the ontogeny of
predatory behavior in orb-web spiders, demonstrated by deprivation
experiments that the spiders’ ability to discriminate between certain
types of prey is not dependent on previous experience and is, there-
fore, not learned. In New Guinea, the Robinsons resumed studies of
the defensive behavior of the rich orthopteroid fauna of the island.
The latter studies suggest that the evolution of defensive behavior in
these insects has been strongly influenced by the presence of a
unique assemblage of predatory nocturnal marsupials.

R. Rubinoff continues her studies of the behavior of the sea
urchin Diadema antillarum and has succeeded in demonstrating a
social component to their “clumping” behavior.

Virtually all of the Swainson’s Hawks in the United States pass
through Panama during migration, as do large numbers of other ~
North American hawks and vultures. By photographing the sky
along the migration routes, Neal Smith has begun to evaluate the
abundance and population characteristics of these hawks. These data
should provide a useful index of the environmental quality of the
North American nesting areas of these birds.

N. Smythe, in addition to his work with the Environmental Sci-
ences Program, continues his studies of mammalian behavioral
ecology.

H. Wolda continued his studies of fluctuation in abundance of
insect species. The moth Zunacetha annulata, which had a major
outbreak in 1971, had a somewhat smaller outbreak in 1973. Species
of the homopteran genus Empoasca had major peaks in abundance
in March-April in the last three years and were virtually absent in
the same period in 1974. The cicada Fidicina mannifera was much
less abundant in 1973 than in 1972, as evidenced by monitoring the
sound, number of pupal cases, and by light-trap data. Among the
important factors influencing these fluctuations are the strategies of
the species in dealing with unpredictable patterns of rainfall and
dry season.

C. Birkeland is comparing the community structure and dynamics
of benthic marine populations on the coasts of Panama.

D. Meyer continues his studies of crinoid populations in collabo-
ration with B. Macurda of the University of Michigan.

P. Campanella has examined territorial behavior of four species
of dragonflies. Males of some species show a high degree of mating
site specificity, which appears to be related to population density and
availability of suitable ovipositing sites. Territory sizes are reduced
and spatial overlap is avoided by using the ponds at different times
of the day.

M. May has continued studies on the effects of heat exchange,
heat production, and thermal tolerance in dragonflies of such factors
as body size, temporal and spatial distribution patterns, and various
energy-using activities.

R. Warner began an investigation of the adaptive significance of
intersexuality commonly found in coral-reef fishes. He is correlating
population structure and behavior with the dynamics of sex change
in these fishes.

Censuses of Polistine wasps were carried out for a second year in
Costa Rica by D. Windsor. He has shown that in response to the
poorer foraging conditions and higher predator pressures of the dry
season there is an increase in the number of females per nesting
attempt. These and other observations indicate that sociality has
evolved to aid reproduction during periods of poorer environmental
conditions.

The carnivores of the New World tropics are poorly known, par-
ticularly when compared with those of Africa and Asia, where recent
studies on mongoose, lion, hyena, and tiger have been published.
R. F. Ewer has been at stri for the past year as a visiting senior
scholar. She has been studying the ethology of two neotropical cats
(ocelots and jaguarundis) and two mustelids (tayras and grisons).
Particular attention has been devoted to studying social and prey-
capturing behavior.

D. Robertson, supported by a Commonwealth Science and Indus-
trial Research Organization (cstro) fellowship, is studying the
patterns of spawning activities in Thallasoma bifasciatum and its
relationships to hermaphroditism in this species.

Y. Lubin completed her study of the nonadhesive orb-webs of
Cyrtophora moluccensis and is now collaborating with G. Mont-
gomery on a radio-tracking study of tamandua.

In fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Institution’s Environmental Sci-
ences Program continued ecological monitoring at the three sTRI
sites in Panama. This interbureau effort in the tropics currently in-
volves the cooperation of about 10 principal investigators from
four bureaus. Spectral quality of solar radiation is being measured
at Flamenco Island. On Barro Colorado Island the emphasis is on
the tropical forests. We are beginning to understand the way in
which year-to-year fluctuations in climate, particularly in the
amount and distribution of rainfall, affect the plants and their re-
sponses, in turn, affect the animals. At Galeta, studies are proceed-
ing on the reef flat. Interest focuses on the causes of unpredictable
periods of reef exposure and the impact these have on the intertidal
community and its recovery patterns.

STRI sponsored a workshop on the problems and strategies of
seedlings in tropical forests. Eight scientists from four countries par-
ticipated in a three-day meeting on Barro Colorado Island (Bc1).

This year grants were obtained from the Henry L. and Grace

138 / Smithsonian Year 1974
Doherty and the Edward John Noble foundations for the purpose
of providing short-term fellowships to assist students in tropical re-
search. A number of students from United States and Panamanian
universities have already begun research supported by these funds.

A number of our staff engaged in formal teaching this year.
O. Linares taught Anthropology at the University of Texas. J. Gra-
ham taught in the Fundamental Ecology course of the Organization
for Tropical Studies. P. Campanella gave a course in Ecology at the
Canal Zone College, and M. Robinson taught Invertebrate Behavior
at the University of Papua and New Guinea.

Use of stri facilities continues to increase. stRI was host to 722
scientific visitors from 111 universities and other organizations.
These visitors represented 28 states and Puerto Rico as well as 21
countries from the Old and New Worlds. Twenty of these visitors
spent a full year at str1. The appointment of M. Quinley in February
as part-time docent has enabled us to initiate tours of str1 by pri-
mary and secondary school and university groups.

During 1974 major redevelopment of the scr waterfront area was
begun. The old boathouse was demolished, dredging has been com-
pleted, and the driving of new piles is scheduled. A new boathouse
and bulwark are planned. A small dormitory has been provided for
the Pacific Coast marine facilities.

Renovation of the new Tivoli laboratory has been initiated. The
building has been reroofed, the exterior painted, and work has be-
gun to install the first seven laboratories.

HISTORY AND ART

IN SINGLING ouT a few particularly noteworthy events of the past
year one runs the risk of paying too little attention to the continu-
ing, quiet achievements that in the long run are perhaps more im-
portant. The temptation to stress dramatic change at the expense of
often undramatic continuity is familiar to every historian, and to
every writer of annual reports.

Before succumbing to the temptation, then, we should at least
begin by saying that the past year was marked by steady growth
and consolidation within each of the Institution’s history and art
bureaus, and by encouraging signs of continuing cooperation among
them. Without exception, collections were improved both by acqui-
sition and by conservation; control over collections was strength-
ened by better cataloguing and storage techniques; new exhibitions
were mounted with satisfying regularity; research and publication
continued in the best Smithsonian tradition; and programs of public
education made our collections and our research more accessible to
thousands of children and adults.

The gradual growth of cooperation among our history and art
bureaus is another very welcome aspect of continuity rather than of
dramatic change. The joint appointment of a Curator of American
Art by the Freer Gallery of Art and the National Collection of Fine
Arts will strengthen both museums and will bring the Freer’s im-
portant collection of American paintings into the mainstream of
scholarly activity. The Renwick Gallery of the National Collection
of Fine Arts, our museum-without-a-collection, continued to make
imaginative use of objects from the collections of the Museum of
Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology in illu-
minating exhibitions on the subject of design. The establishment in
the Museum of History and Technology of the Dwight D. Eisen-

141
hower Institute for Historical Research, and the appointment of Dr.
Forrest Pogue, the distinguished biographer of General George C.
Marshall, as its first director is the result of happy and fruitful col-
laboration between that museum and our National Armed Forces
Museum Advisory Board. With the cooperation of the National Por-
trait Gallery, the Archives of American Art will soon be able to open
an exhibition gallery in the Old Patent Office building, allowing the
public to see for the first time some of the treasures in its vast docu-
mentary collections. These developments, none of which is likely to
earn headlines, are evidence that the varied entities that compose the
Smithsonian Institution have the will and the means to work to-
gether toward a common purpose.

We must now duly note, on the other hand, that the past year did
not lack its share — indeed, perhaps more than its share — of dra-
matic events.

After what seemed to be years of delay and frustration, the Gen-
eral Services Administration declared that the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden was “substantially complete.” The difference
between this somewhat mysterious technical determination and the
existence of a museum ready for the public is considerable; the first
three months of the next year will be a time of unceasing activity for
the museum’s staff and the Institution’s support facilities.

The closing months of the past year also saw the accomplishment
of a major part of what must surely be the largest shipment of art in
the history of this country. With remarkable smoothness, at least
from the point of view of one observing with admiration from some
distance, the great Hirshhorn collections of sculpture and painting
were moved from various sites in New York City and Connecticut
to their home in and about the museum and sculpture garden on the
Mall.

This was also the year in which the Museum of History and Tech-
nology gained a new director, and the Institution shared in the re-
flected glory of its first Pulitzer Prize. The prize winner was Daniel
Boorstin, for The Democratic Experience, the concluding volume of
his trilogy The Americans. Upon becoming a Senior Historian, Dr.
Boorstin was succeeded in the directorship of the Museum of History
and Technology by Dr. Brooke Hindle, a distinguished historian of
early American science and technology. An outstanding scholar who
has long been associated with museums, and whose university ex-
perience includes service as a departmental chairman and a dean, Dr.

for his book The Democratic Experience, concluding volume of his trilogy The
Americans.

Hindle brings to his new position the experience, the talents, and the —
enthusiasm required for the directorship of the world’s most visited
museum.

The geographical scope of the Smithsonian was expanded during
the past year by the opening of the West Coast regional center of
the Archives of American Art. These centers, which now exist in
Detroit, New York, Boston, and San Francisco serve both as regional
research centers in which scholars may have access on microfilm to
the entire holdings of the Archives, and as the foci of the Archives
national collecting program. Often housed in contributed space —
we are indebted to the DeYoung Museum for the new center — and
staffed by only two or three people, these centers have an extraordi-
narily positive effect on the study of the history of American art
in their regions.

After many years of activity behind the scenes, carried forward
with the generous support of the Congress, the Smithsonian’s pro-
gram of activities for the Bicentennial of the American Revolution
produced its first public manifestation in 1974: the exhibition at the
National Portrait Gallery entitled “In the Minds and Hearts of the
People — Prologue to the American Revolution: 1760-1774.” En-
thusiastically reviewed by the press, and editorially commended by
The Washington Post, this exhibit is the first in a series of exhibits,
publications, and festivals with which the Institution will mark our
Nation’s two-hundredth birthday. It is also pleasant to be able to
report here that the National Collection of Fine Arts, which had suf-
fered patiently the inconveniences of subway construction outside
its walls for several years, now enjoys once again the use of all its
galleries and of its front door. With the reinstallation of the Lincoln
Gallery, and the completion of galleries for miniatures and non-
American works, the NcFa is now able to show its collections and to
mount temporary exhibitions more appropriately and handsomely
than ever before.

In short, then, the past year has been one of steady growth punc-
tuated by occasional, dramatic leaps forward. Between milestones —
such as the fiftieth anniversary of the Freer Gallery last year, the
opening of the Hirshhorn Museum next year, and the expected open-
ing of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum the year after — the real progress
takes place.

Finally, we must sorrowfully record the death during the past year

- contributions to our collections and museums.

Archives of American Art

With five regional offices in full operation for the first time, the
Archives experienced an unusually active year in both acquisitions
and use of its resources. Among the larger and more significant col-
_lections of papers received were those of the New York sculptor
| Paul Burlin, the painters Frank Duveneck, Barry Faulkner, and
Henry Varnam Poor, the painter and designer Gyorgy Kepes, and
| the Detroit collector Hawkins Ferry. Records of three major art
galleries — Doll and Richards in Boston and the Rose Fried and
| Maynard Walker Galleries in New York — were also accessioned.
| The work of Walter Heil, Douglas MacAgy, and Alan Solomon, all
nationally prominent administrators and exhibition organizers, is
' reflected in large groups of personal and professional papers. Insti-
| tutional records made available for microfilming by the Archives
| included those of the Cranbrook Academy and the Allen Memorial
| Museum in Oberlin, Ohio.

Three particularly interesting smaller groups of papers are a long
series of letters from Alfred Stieglitz to Arthur Dove, written in the
| 1920s and 1930s; 15 Maurice Prendergast letters to a friend and
| collector, Mrs. Oliver Williams, and a diary kept by the New York
_ dealer William Macbeth in the 1870s and 1880s. ’
Thirteen hundred calls for documentation offered by the Archives
| were made by visiting researchers at all regional offices, an increase
of one hundred over fiscal 1973 in spite of several weeks of interrup-
_ tion in service in the New York office. Over a thousand letters of
_ inquiry were answered and 520 rolls of microfilm were lent out
| through interlibrary loan. The latter figure represents a 25-percent
_ increase over the previous year.

_ The Archives’ New York office underwent a major renovation in
the fall and held an opening reception, with a display of documents,
in its new quarters on the ground floor at 41 East 65th Street, in late
- November 1973. Another display of documents was arranged in

History and Art / 145
March 1974 in connection with a reception held to explain the —

Archives to New York art dealers. An exhibition of letters from
Fitzwilliam Sargent containing passages on the growth and educa-
tion of his son John Singer Sargent was displayed at the Washington
office.

The Archives Oral History Program continued its activities dur-
ing the year. Twenty-one interviews with artists were taped and
33 tapes were transcribed. A grant from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, received in December, will enable the Archives to work
off a backlog of 165 untranscribed tapes. As an aid to researchers,
the Archives published a descriptive guide to 306 transcripts of
interviews conducted between 1958 and 1971.

The Archives was the subject of three articles, one written by
Russell Lynes and published in American Heritage; one by David
Sokol published in Art in America, November-December 1973; and
a third by Garnett McCoy published in Manuscripts, Summer 1974.
In addition, 32 books, articles, and exhibition catalogues published
during the year acknowledged assistance from Archives resources.
Among these were James R. Mellow, Charmed Circle; June L. Ness,
Lyonel Feininger; Richard G. Coker, Portrait of an American Painter:
Edward Gay; Marguerite Zorach, The Early Years, 1908-1920 (Na-
tional Collection of Fine Arts); Robert Loftin Newman (National
Collection of Fine Arts); Vorticism and Its Allies (Arts Council of
Great Britain); and Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of Ameri-
can Art).

Cooper-Hewitt Museum
of Decorative Arts and Design

Renovation activity has begun at the Carnegie Mansion and the first

_ phase should be completed by July of 1975. The collections and exhi-

bitions will be installed and the Museum will reopen to the public in
the winter of 1975-1976.

During the past year the Museum organized a major exhibition of
over 300 drawings, textiles, and wallpapers entitled “The Art of
Decoration: Drawings and Objects from the Cooper-Hewitt Mu-
seum” at the Brooklyn Museum. A lecture series was given by the
staff in conjunction with this exhibition. A second exhibition, of
Winslow Homer drawings, was shown at the Columbia Museum of
Art and the Telfair Academy in Savannah. In addition, objects from
the collection were included in exhibitions at 23 institutions includ-
ing the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery of Art, Balti-
more Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy,
Princeton University, Harvard University, Amherst College, Rice
University, Finch College, and Pratt Institute. Exhibitions of nine-
teenth-century American drawings and new acquisitions in textiles
were shown briefly in the Carnegie Mansion.

The collections were enriched by 671 items. The most outstanding
gifts were the “Martin Scrapbook” containing samples of eighteenth-
century French block-printed fabrics and Indian chintzes, a gouache

drawing by Gino Severini, 8 nineteenth-century colored engravings
of political cartoons, a nineteenth-century American cast-iron man-
tel, 2 cast-iron baluster panels designed by George G. Elmslie, a
fashion drawing by Erté, 2 wallpapered folding screens, a collection
of turn-of-the-century embroideries and embroidered samplers from
the Eva Johnston Coe Collection. A total of 1562 objects were cata-
logued and 280 costumes were sent to the Smithsonian in Washing-
ton on long-term loan.

The William H. Goodyear collection of architectural photographs
was transferred to the Cooper-Hewitt Library from the National
Museum of History and Technology. John Maximus gave another
portion (1919 items) of his classified pictorial reference library. The
Color and Light Archive was enlarged with a gift of 1293 items on
color by Mrs. I. H. Godlove.

A beginning was made toward the formulation of an Environmen-
tal Design collection dealing with the processes of design — how
design has been influenced by natural, technological, and cultural
forces, how it affects the human being physically and psychologi-
cally, and how it shapes landscapes and lifestyles. A meeting of 40
leading architects, designers, planners, and educators was held to
advise on the development of this collection.

The Museum is presently conducting a study to determine the
kinds of information designers need, the format of such an informa-
tion system, and its use by professionals and the public. In order to
facilitate research and to save wear and tear on fragile objects, a
color slide catalogue of the collections was begun. This project has
been generously supported by the National Endowment for the Arts,
New York State Council, and the Mary Duke Biddle Trust. Slides
of over 6500 items have been made to date, as well as a slide kit
of embroideries. An anonymous gift was received to make a proto-
type film on traditional crafts in danger of disappearing.

A series of lectures entitled, ‘“The Fin de Siecle Medici: Carnegie
and the Designer” was held in the Carnegie Mansion. Billy Baldwin,
the famous New York interior designer, gave 4 lectures on ‘’Decorat-
ing Today.” Five lectures and a colloquium were given for the mem-
bership and 19 additional lectures were given by curators at other
museums. The children’s workshops continued, and a tour was orga-
nized to see the furnishings and windows for Louis Comfort Tif-
fany’s famous chapel in the workshop where they are being restored.

mantel was given to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design by
Mrs. Whitney Atwood.
Three members of the curatorial staff, Elaine Evans Dee, Milton —
Sonday, and Catherine Lynn Frangiamore, received foundation
grants for research outside of the Museum. Mrs. Frangiamore’s book
on wallpapers used in America will be published by Praeger next
spring. The staff was enlarged by two: Dorothy Twining Globus,
who joined the Museum’s permanent exhibition staff, and Arete
Swartz, from the Victoria and Albert Museum, who worked in the
education department on a one-year grant. Twenty scholars studied
the collections, and 7 student interns received training. Special lec-
tures were given for visiting classes from New York University, City
University of New York, the Art Students League, Pratt Institute,
and Yale University.

The Museum held an extremely successful benefit auction under
the chairmanship of Mrs. H. J. Heinz II. All of the items were do-
nated expressly for the sale by collectors, dealers, and other friends
of the Museum. A total of $125,000 was raised for the building fund.
Grants were received from the Charles Hayden Foundation, Janet
Neff Charitable Trust, Maya Corporation, Elsie de Wolfe Founda-
tion, and New York Community Trust, and an additional $72,000
was raised, largely from corporations and individual designers for a
Study Center in memory of Doris and Henry Dreyfuss.

Freer Gallery of Art

During fiscal year 1974 the Freer Gallery of Art celebrated its fiftieth
anniversary. To mark that occasion, the Gallery presented three
special exhibitions: “Japanese Ukiyoe Painting,” ““Chinese Figure
Painting,” and “Ceramics from the World of Islam.” The Gallery
published illustrated catalogues for each exhibition and organized
international symposia devoted to analysis of the three different
themes. Approximately 200 scholars and students participated in
each of the three programs. These anniversary activities and publi-
cations, which focused on the arts of the Far and Near East, sum-
marized a half century of acquisitions and research.

On May 2, 1973, the Freer Medal was presented to the Japanese
specialist, Professor Tanaka Ichimatsu; on September 17, 1973, the
recipient was the noted museologist and historian of Chinese art,

Medal for their “distinguished contribution to the knowledge and
understanding of Oriental civilizations as reflected in their arts.”

Construction of a specially designed X-ray room and installation
of initial X-ray equipment will enable the Freer Conservation Labora-
tory to keep pace with its steadily increasing activities. This essential
equipment will considerably facilitate the examination of objects in
the Collection and those being considered for study or purchase. In
addition, two X-ray diffraction cameras and tracks will be used to
identify pigments and corrosion products.

In the course of fiscal 1974, the Collection has expanded by the
accession of 36 objects. Of those, several fine items were acquired
by gift from the estates of Mrs. Agnes E. Meyer and Mr. Myron
Bement Smith. Other objects of importance were presented by Mrs.
Anna Chennault and Mr. Yoichi Nakajima.

Harold P. Stern, Director, participated in the seventh meeting of
the United States-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational
Interchange in Tokyo on June 17-20. Thomas Lawton, Assistant
Director, and W. Thomas Chase III, Head Conservator, were among

the 12 members of the American Art and Archaeology Delegation
who visited the People’s Republic of China from November 10
! through December 9, 1973.

_ Special exhibitions at the Freer Gallery were “Turkish Art of the
Ottoman Period” (August 1, 1973, through December 19, 1973),
“Chinese Figure Painting” (September 11, 1973, through November
30, 1973), and “Ceramics from the World of Islam” (January 17,
1974, through June 30, 1974).

Rutherford J. Gettens joined the staff of the Freer Gallery of Art
on October 1, 1951.During the more than 20 years of his association
with the Gallery, he was instrumental in establishing the Technical
Laboratory and in maintaining its high level of research. His publi-
cations on problems relating to pigment analysis and on the fabrica-
tion of Chinese bronze vessels achieved an international reputation
for him and the Laboratory. After his retirement in 1968, Mr. Get-
tens remained active in the position of Research Consultant. His
unexpected death on June 17, 1974, at the age of 74, is an irreplace-
able loss.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

The public opening of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

is scheduled for October 1, 1974.

Final plans were developed for the inaugural exhibition, utilizing
scale models, photographic aids, and full-scale mock-ups in styro-
foam of monumental pieces of sculpture, to help determine place-
ment of works in the outdoor sculpture garden and plaza.

Production was completed on postcards, reproductions, and color
slides illustrating outstanding works from the Collection which will
be available to the public in the Museum shop.

It was a year marked by the transfer of the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden (HMsc) offices and personnel from New York
to temporary quarters in the Arts and Industries Building in July
1973; and then to the new building on December 27, 1973. Beneficial
occupancy of the new Museum was accepted by the Smithsonian on
March 29, 1974.

On April 17, 1974, title to the extensive collections included in
the Agreement of May 17, 1966, passed from Mr. Joseph H. Hirsh-
horn to the Smithsonian Institution. This action was immediately

followed by implementation of previously established plans for

moving the Collection.

The substantial task of moving the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden collections to Washington, D.C., from various points
including New York City, Greenwich, Connecticut, and Toronto,
Canada, was commenced on April 14, 1974. The move was accom-
plished on schedule, with pieces in the opening exhibition being in

the vanguard in order to permit the Exhibits and Design staff to |

begin the installation.

In 1974 the inaugural book/catalogue went to press. This 750- |

page volume includes 1001 paintings and sculptures which are docu-

mented and reproduced — 296 in color. The foreword is by S. Dillon |
Ripley, Secretary of the Smithsonian, with an introduction by |

Abram Lerner, Director of the Hirshhorn Museum, and essays by |
six Outstanding art scholars. These complement the selected com-—
mentaries and historical data, and make up a scholarly and stimulat- |

ing volume. A souvenir booklet, An Introduction to the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden, is also in production.

Looking beyond the Museum’s opening, research was begun on _

the program of future exhibitions. A series of research exhibitions
were planned, as well as a program for research fellows. In fiscal year
1974, too, documentation and cataloguing of the permanent collec-
tion progressed.

During this period the staff paused to mourn the passing of two
dedicated individuals who contributed greatly to the planning and
development of the Museum’s programs: On March 2, 1974, the
staff was saddened to hear of the death of Miss Elisabeth Houghton,
a member of the Museum’s Board of Trustees and a lifelong cham-
pion of civic causes. She was one of the original members of the
Board, having been appointed by President Nixon in 1971. On Sep-
tember 6, 1973, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden lost
the invaluable collaboration of Mr. Douglas MacAgy, who super-
vised the preliminary design of our inaugural exhibition. Mr. Mac-
Agy’s contribution was outstanding and his previous experience
with the National Endowment for the Arts was of great help in our
initial planning.

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has been most suc-
cessful in recruiting qualified and outstanding personnel in the pro-
fessional field to fill new positions, and to replace those who have
left our ranks: The Board of Trustees, at their April 4, 1974, meeting,
voted to appoint Miss Anne d’Harnoncourt to the Board for a term
expiring in 1980. At this meeting the Honorable Daniel P. Moynihan
was reelected Chairman, and Dr. George Heard Hamilton was re-
elected Vice Chairman.

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden staff was aug-
mented by the following appointments: Stephen E. Weil, Deputy
Director; Charles W. Millard, Chief Curator; Charles Froom, In-
stallation Designer; Edward Lawson, Chief, Education Program;
Mary Ann Tighe, Education Specialist; and Douglas Robinson,
Registrar.

“Inside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,” a special
series of lectures on the Museum and its collections began on January
21, 1974, with a talk by the Director on “Joseph H. Hirshhorn, Col-
lector.” This series, begun at the request of the Resident Associates
program, had an enrollment of thirty-eight subscribers. Its nine lec-
tures included a talk on the installation of the Inaugural Exhibition
by Charles Froom, Installation Designer, and Cynthia McCabe dis-
cussing the content of the opening exhibition. Other talks included

The Museum continued to respond to requests and inquiries from
scholars and researchers and maintained its policy of lending out-
standing works of art to national and international exhibitions. More
than 235 requests for research information were answered by the
Department of Painting and Sculpture. Fifty paintings and sculp-
tures were loaned to 25 museums, galleries, and institutions.

The Alberto Giacometti Retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggen-
heim Museum, New York, from April 5 to June 23, 1974, included
the sculpture “Seated Women” from the Hirshhorn Museum Col-
lections. Other artists whose works have been borrowed for exhibi-
tions in Spring 1974 are: Karl Knaths (International Exhibitions
Foundation, Washington, D.C., tour); Zoltan Kemeny (Foundation
Maeght, Paris); Horace Pippin (Delaware Art Museum, Wilming-
ton); Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of American Art, New
York, and tour); and Mark Tobey (National Collection of Fine Arts,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

Among recent volumes which reproduced paintings and sculpture
from the Collections are: American Masters: The Voice and the
Myth by Brian O’Doherty (New York, Random House), Elie Nadel-
man by Lincoln Kirstein (New York, Eakins Press), Grandma Moses
by Otto Kallir (New York, Harry N. Abrams), and Henry Moore in
America by Henry J. Seldis (New York, Praeger).

Formal training sessions for 75 volunteer docents were begun by
the Hmsc Education Department on January 15, 1974, to continue
thru May 28, to be followed by an intensive training period in the
Museum galleries. The training course is made up of slide lectures
and demonstratioins, and will involve extensive work in the galleries
with the paintings and sculpture.

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s Board of Trust-
ees is made up of the following members:

Daniel P. Moynihan, Chairman Theodore E. Cummings
George Heard Hamilton, Vice Chairman Anne d’Harnoncourt

Joseph Henry Papers

The research and editing for the second volume of The Papers of
Joseph Henry are now very close to completion. The volume, docu-
menting Henry’s career from the end of 1832 through 1835, will
introduce Henry to his new environment at Princeton, follow his
activities as Professor of Natural Philosophy at the College of New
Jersey, and detail the resumption of his electrical research, mainly
on self-induction. One of the highlights of the volume will be an
extensive run of documents from the first of three laboratory note-
books kept by Henry at Princeton and the Smithsonian, and now
preserved in the Smithsonian Archives. The notebooks reflect the
pace and style of Henry’s daily research as well as the evolution of
his scientific ideas over several decades. The documents in the second
volume also portray the dramatic expansion of Henry’s scientific
role and associations during his early Princeton years, while shed-
ding new light on scientific centers like Philadelphia.

While the regular collecting and research activities of the project
go on, preparations are now being made for seeing the second vol-
ume through the Smithsonian Press and for the editing of volume
three of our series, documenting, among other events in Henry’s
life, his 1837 trip to Europe. His diary from that journey, marking
Henry’s formal introduction to the international science scene, pro-
vides an extraordinary record of transatlantic communication in sci-
ence. Plans are also underway for the editing of a special volume of
lectures and essays by Joseph Henry, based upon manuscripts from
throughout his career. It is hoped that this special volume, treating
topics such as Henry’s philosophy of science, will appeal to a wide
audience, both scholarly and popular, and will perhaps be found
suitable for classroom use at the college and graduate levels.

Significant progress was also made in organizing and cataloguing
the Joseph Henry Library, Henry’s personal reference collection. A
wide-ranging collection with numerous rare volumes, the Library is
an invaluable resource for appreciating Henry’s scientific develop-
ment and scientific literature of the day. Plans are now going for-
ward to publish an annotated catalogue of the collection for the
general use of historians.

The project continues to sponsor and participate in various Smith-

162 / Smithsonian Year 1974

the Henry Papers’ collections and resources. Nathan Reingold’s
seminar on the nineteenth century had another successful year.

National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board

With the approval of the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory
Board, the Smithsonian Institution entered into a cooperative agree-
ment with the Department of the Interior. The agreement provides
a basis upon which the Smithsonian may fulfill its responsibilities
under the Act of August 30, 1961 (75 Stat. 414, 20 USC 80-80d).
Under the agreement the two agencies may work jointly in advanc-
ing outdoor museum programs, short term and long term, to illumi-
nate historical American attitudes toward matters of national defense
and past contributions by the Armed Forces to American society
and culture.

Representatives of the National Park Service and the staff of the
National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board pursued planning
for a special Bicentennial program to dramatize the spirit of the
American people in the struggle for independence. The program is
to be presented to the public at Washington, D. C., during the
summer of 1976. It will portray the life of the citizen-soldier of the
American Revolution through the medium of living history. The
program will take place out of doors.

The National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board at the close
of fiscal year 1974 consisted of the following members.

The Honorable John Nicholas Brown, Chairman
The Honorable Earl Warren

Secretary of Army

Secretary of Navy

Secretary of Air Force

Lieutenant General Milton G. Baker, Retired
Robert C. Baker

The Honorable Alexander P. Butterfield
William H. Perkins, Jr.

National Collection of Fine Arts

All of the activity of the National Collection of Fine Arts (NcFA) is
directed toward educational goals — if enjoyment and appreciation
can be included with the pursuit and refinement of knowledge as
part of artistic education. Although some 1556 paintings, sculptures,
and graphic works were added to the Collection this year (the Col-
lection now numbers about 17,000), and study continues to refine
the computerized listings and to improve accessibility, collecting is
only one aspect of a complex program. Since the museum believes
that the circumstances under which a work of art is encountered
has much to do with an awareness of its qualities, great effort has
been made to present each of the over 900 works from the collection
now on display to its best advantage for the modern viewer. This
has required, in addition to a continuing conservation and reframing
program, the careful design of each area to create not a synthetic
historical past but a convincing artistic present. This year the totally
reorganized Lincoln Gallery was reopened, the Doris M. Magowan
Gallery of Portrait Miniatures was completed, and a new gallery
was established for some of the museum’s other-than-American
works, including a fine Rubens and a recently identified Guercino.

Including the Renwick Gallery, about 78,000 square feet of gallery
space is now open to the public. Part of that space is reserved for
temporary exhibitions which carry out the ncra’s concern for the
reexamination of little-known aspects of American art as well as
occasional tribute to acknowledged masters. Of the 21 exhibitions
planned and produced by the staff this year (in all, 25 were pre-
sented) some were studies of individual artists ranging from the less
well known including Margarite Zorach and Herman Webster to the
distinguished ceramists Gertrude and Otto Natzler and the eminent
painter Mark Tobey. Especially popular was an exhibition of draw-
ings on Smithsonian letterhead made by Saul Steinberg while in
residence at the Smithsonian in 1967. Investigating special themes
were such exhibitions as “A Measure of Beauty,” “Shaker,” and
“Art of the Pacific Northwest from the 1930s to the Present.” As
one in a series calling attention to artistic quality in works from other
Smithsonian Collections, ‘Boxes and Bowls” was mounted at the
Renwick Gallery, affording “a new look at historical works from
several Northwest Coast Indian groups. Publications, either major

monographs or smaller catalogues, were issued in association with
almost all exhibitions.

Exhibitions from abroad shown at the Renwick Gallery included
paintings from Pakistan and a retrospective of two hundred years
of Royal Copenhagen porcelain. Ten exhibitions provided by the
National Collection were in circulation to other countries during the
year, among them “Made in Chicago” (works by Chicago artists) |
which traveled through South America and “Fabric Vibrations,” an
exhibition originating at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts,
which circulated in Southeast Asia, carrying the modern craft of tie
dye to its ancient home.

The many established activities for making the museum accessible
to a wide public continued with an expanded Department of Educa-
tion. Young visitors expressed pleasure with the new children’s
gallery, “Explore.” Students continued with the Discover Graphics
program and a group of high-school-age “junior interns” enlivened
many activities of the museum. Education of a different kind was
carried on by six doctoral fellows and two senior fellows engaged
in research on American art. To such scholars, NcFa’s rapidly ex-
panding Bicentennial Inventory of American Painting before 1914
will be of great help when ready for use in 1976. The National Col-]
lection of Fine Arts joined with the University of Delaware in th
spring to organize a symposium on late nineteenth-century Amer-
ican art. Throughout the museum during the year were university]
students learning the various processes of museum operation as]
interns, helping to keep the entire staff aware that learning and}
teaching go hand in hand.

National Museum of History and Technology

On January 23, 1974, the National Museum of History and Tech-
nology entered its second decade. Marking its tenth anniversary,
Chief Justice and Smithsonian Chancellor Warren Burger with
Secretary Ripley named the Museum’s auditorium in memory of
Leonard Carmichael, the Secretary whose vision and determination
had brought about the planning, approval, and construction of this
Museum. At the Museum’s dedication 10 years earlier, President
Lyndon Johnson had expressed his belief that “this Museum will do
that which causes us all to celebrate; it will excite a thirst for knowl-
edge among all people.” Since its founding, the National Museum
of History and Technology has welcomed nearly 55 million visitors.
Yearly attendance has grown steadily, now reaching 7 million per
year. Last April, visitor attendance topped the million mark, making —
the highest monthly attendance ever registered in a Smithsonian
building. Attendance is expected to be vastly increased during our —
second decade as the Nation carries out its Bicentennial celebrations. —

On the first of October 1973, Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin moved from
the directorship of the Museum to the post of Senior Historian in
the National Museum of History and Technology, a position which
allows him to devote more of his energies to research and writing. ©
In May 1974, Dr. Boorstin received the Pulitzer Prize for History |
for The Americans: The Democratic Experience, the final volume in
his trilogy on the American people. The writing of this volume had
been completed during the four years of his directorship.

Dr. Boorstin’s successor, Professor Brooke Hindle, was appointed
after nomination by museum curators and began his tenure in Feb-
ruary. A faculty member of the New York University since 1950,
his two most recent posts have been as Dean of the University
College of Arts and Science and Head of the University Department
of History. Known for his distinctive works, The Pursuit of Science
in Revolutionary America 1735-1785; David Rittenhouse: A Biog-
raphy; and Technology in America: Needs and Opportunities, Dr.
Hindle is presently editing a volume which summarizes the confer-
ence he planned for Sleepy Hollow Restorations on ‘America’s ©
Wooden Age.” His present research assesses the role of industrial ©
fairs in advancing the technology of their time. His particular focus .
has been the Centennial Exposition of 1876 — from which the |

Oiling and cleaning of the machinery in the Power and Tool Halls is an important
phase of the daily routine before volunteers operate equipment for their lectures and
demonstrations. Marjorie Miller, a National Museum of History and Technology
Docent volunteer is one of several skilled in this challenging task, which always
brings an interested audience.

Smithsonian Institution drew its first significant holdings of!
machinery and technological artifacts, now housed in this Museum.

Several series of public lectures were continued from last year
with considerable success as an important form of contact with the:
visiting public and outreach to the Washington community. The:
National Museum of History and Technology in its second series of |
Frank Nelson Doubleday Lectures considered “Creativity and Col-:
laboration,” looking at the special opportunities and pressures of |
our age to collaborate, and asking how particular collaborations —
in industry, scientific research, the media, city planning, and govern-.
ment — had affected creativity and brought about growth and!
change. Speakers were Japanese industrialist Akio Morita, President :
and co-founder of Sony Corporation; Nobel Prize-winning biologist |
James Dewey Watson, whose collaboration with Francis Crick |
resulting in an understanding of DNA was heralded as one of the
most dramatic research breakthroughs of modern times; British
Broadcasting Corporation’s Managing Director of Television Huw
Wheldon; Israeli-born Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, designer
of Habitat; and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar.
W. Weinberger. Each lecturer also took part in a luncheon seminar,
allowing for an open exchange of ideas among curators, the lecturer,
and special guests. Doubleday and Company has renewed its grant
for a third year of lectures in “The Frontiers of Knowledge” series. |

The Museum also continued a series of lectures with the U.S.
Postal Service relating to new postage stamp issues. Extremely |
popular lectures included “The Continental Congresses” and ‘Rise
of the Spirit of Independence.” First Day ceremonies were held for
the block of eight 10-cent stamps commemorating the Universal
Postal Union Centennial.

In addition to these evening lectures, the Museum has provided,
since last January, weekly daytime Museum Talks by curators and
qualified museum aides, technicians, and specialists. When moved

from Saturdays to Tuesdays at lunchtime, these slide talks have
drawn large audiences both of Museum visitors, neighboring gov-
ernment employees, and Museum staff. The lectures reflect both the
Museum’s varied collections and current staff research projects.
Some of the most exciting presentations have included demonstra-
tions of historic objects front our collections, from the early sound-
amplifying devices of inventor Elisha Gray, a contemporary of

172 / Smithsonian Year 1974
Alexander Graham Bell, to the operation of the common printing
press.

The primary efforts of all staff during the past year have been

spent in readying the National Museum of History and Technology’s
five major exhibitions for the Bicentennial period. The first, opening
this coming September 20th on the lower level, is an exhibition on
the two-hundred-year history of American clothing. “Suiting Every-
one,” the story of America’s transition from homespun or tailor-
made garments to ready-to-wear, is an interdisciplinary exhibit,
bringing together the Division of Costume and Furnishings, whose
costume collection was greatly enriched by a massive clothing appeal
this year; the Division of Textiles, which offers the machines and
textiles of manufacture; and the Division of Military History, which
has supplied examples of early mass-produced clothing — soldiers’
uniforms. A major new installment of the National Museum of
History and Technology’s political history wing is scheduled for
opening the middle of next year. The theme of “A Nation of Na-
tions,” pluralism in American life, is particularly suited to this
‘Museum, which has become the repository for many thousands of
artifacts which were family heirlooms, treasured possessions, and
creations of American people of every ethnic, racial, and religious
origin.
- Considerable staff attention was directed to restoration work on
the exhibition “1876 — A Centennial,” an exciting project which
will transform a portion of the Arts and Industries Building into a
microcosm of the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 capturing the
festive and optimistic spirit of America on its one-hundredth birth-
day. This exhibit will manifest the exuberance of a Victorian extrav-
aganza, an atmosphere of organized chaos, with all spaces dominated
by an enormous variety of material objects. Finally, Vladimir and
Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, Curators of the Division of Numismatics, are
preparing a special exhibition on the history of American banks and
banking, supported by the American Bankers Association, to open
in September of 1975.

This year the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical
Research, a study and conference center which will make important
contributions to national study and evaluation of the Armed Forces,
their importance in war and in maintaining peace, was brought to
full realization with the appointment of Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, Direc-

History and Art / 173

tor of the George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington,
Virginia, and widely known biographer of George Marshall, to the
directorship of the new Institute.

As part of the Institution’s overall decentralization program, the
National Museum of History and Technology assumed the admin-
istration of its own Office of Exhibits and Building Management
Division. From the Smithsonian’s decentralization of the Office of
Primary and Secondary Education has come a new approach to the
Museum’s education responsibilities, which have been formalized
in a new Division of Public Information and Education. In addition
to conducting tours and developing visitor programs, the Office will
establish a visitor center on the Museum’s first floor to orient the
visitor and answer public inquiries. This past year a staff associate
was hired to adapt museum exhibits and activities to the needs of
the handicapped. The staff associate, being herself handicapped,
concentrated her efforts on developing tours for the blind and deaf
with great success. Experiments were conducted with Braille labels
and subtitled films, and the results will be incorporated into future
exhibit planning. Alice Reno joined the staff in late spring as Super-
visor of the Division.

And on a playful note, the National Museum of History and
Technology displayed in each public restroom an exhibit panel
tracing with graphics the history of “Bathrooms in America.” It
leaves visitors contemplating the chamber pot and closestool of
earlier days, with a sense of the full impact of technology on the
American way of life.

Locating and collecting objects and memorabilia for Bicentennial
exhibitions was by far the dominating activity of the Museum’s staff
this past year as progress continues simultaneously on four major
subject exhibitions.

The Division of Costume and Furnishings initiated an unusual
collecting effort for the exhibit, “Suiting Everyone,” utilizing a news
release and list of items needed for display. The response was over-
whelming, resulting in the acquisition of a large number of items of
clothing from 1920 to 1970 that ranged from representative clothing
worn by the majority of Americans to examples produced by the
industry’s greatest designers.

The preparation of the exhibition has benefited enormously. from
the valuable assistance provided by a panel of advisors from the

Rearrangement of the reference collections of the Division of Textiles has resulted
in more adequate storage of the Division’s extensive collections of quilts, sam-
plers, and rugs, making them more accessible to the staff and visiting students
and scholars.

fashion community. Given the incredible breadth of the Smithsonian |
collections and the interdisciplinary perspective gained from the ©
participating Museum staff, the exhibit promises to have a profound ©

impact on the future study of American clothing and its industry.

The full staff of the Division of Political History devoted its |

major effort to the forthcoming exhibition hall to be entitled “We,

the People.” They have been engrossed in the challenging task of }
selecting and acquiring objects illustrating the role of American }

government in the lives of the American people. Objects have been

collected from resources within the Museum as well as from other |
Smithsonian and Federal agencies. Conservation of the First Ladies’ }

Gowns also continued, bringing the total number of First Lady
patterns now completed to twenty. In cooperation with the Division
of Textiles, the skirt of the dress of Martha Washington was

restored as the first project in a long-term program for the conserva-

tion and restoration of the First Ladies’ Gowns. As part of this
program, Barbara Coffee, Museum Specialist in this Division, re-
ceived a grant from the Secretary’s fund to explore costume preser-
vation and restoration being done in museums in England, The
Netherlands, and in Sweden.

The new Henry R. Luce Hall of News Reporting continued to
draw enthusiastic crowds, and plans are now underway by the
Smithsonian to produce a film and a traveling exhibit based on the
Hall. Two exhibitions have been shown in the Hall’s Print Gallery:
“Prang’s American Chromos,” showing the step-by-step production
of a twenty-six color lithograph; and “Anatomy of a Gallop,” a
comparison between the lithographs by Currier and Ives of racing
horses and the contemporary photographs by Muybridge of the
same subject.

The Division of Medical Sciences devoted considerable effort to
the preparation of the exhibit “Triumph Over Disability” in the
Hall of Health. The exhibit was made possible by a grant from the
American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Each Friday, films
and lectures on the subject are offered in the Leonard Carmichael
Auditorium.

Several major exhibits were closed and dismantled this past year
in preparation for Bicentennial activities. This necessitated the re-
moval and temporary storage of thousands of valuable objects, a
project that required the involvement of more than half the Mu-

seum’s divisions and staff. The ““Growth of the United States,” “Art
and Spirit of a People,” “American Costume,” and “Historic Ameri-
cans” were among the halls closed, as well as the special exhibits
“Music Machines” and “A Children’s World.”

Several large objects were removed to other more visible areas,
including the relocation of the John Bull locomotive. Granite blocks,
especially cut for the purpose, support pieces of the original rail
used in 1831 under the engine.

The main focus of attention for “1876: A Centennial Exhibit” is
upon the restoration of objects and cases of the period that will be
utilized within the displays. The restoration and refurbishing of
those objects that were displayed nearly one hundred years ago, for
which a unique restoration task force has been organized within the
Museum, are proceeding on a scale unprecedented in the history of
the Institution.

Since that facet of the Centennial which had the largest public
impact was the overwhelming array of machinery and power equip-
ment, the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering has a pri-
mary involvement in it. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Heavy Ma-
chinery and Civil Engineering, is co-curator in charge, and Edwin A.
Battison, Curator of Light Machinery, has responsibility for the
machine-tool exhibits.

The practicality of the exhibition was founded primarily upon the
vast collection of Centennial memorabilia carefully preserved and
housed in many parts of the Institution. The machinery and models
will form the nucleus of the exhibition, supplemented by other fine
examples of the types exhibited at the Philadelphia Exposition.

For many months, members of the staff have traveled to record
centers, archives, and libraries, conducting research, recording and
photographing available documentary evidence in support of the
present restoration. Factories and industrial firms on the verge of
demolition have been contacted in an effort to locate furnishings and
fittings so very vital to achieving the atmosphere of 1876.

Restoration of this equipment is being performed in three separate
shops created for this purpose under the general supervision of
William K. Henson, Supervisor of the Science and Technology De-
partment’s Technical Laboratory.

The main facility, headed by Museum Specialist Charles E. Den-
nison, is responsible for the restoration of machinery such as ma-

disassembled, marked, chemically cleaned, and restored to original
condition with close adherence to all available published references
and illustrations. All broken parts are repaired, and missing parts
are duplicated to permit each object to not only look but perform
as new.

under the supervision of Museum Technician William T. Tearman.

A shop on the fifth floor of the National Museum of History and
Technology serves as the third restoration facility for relatively
small objects, at present principally a selection of the hundreds of
patent models exhibited at the Philadelphia Fair, and the cutting and
sewing of small intricate sails for many of the ship models.

One of the most interesting phases of the work that has spread
excitement throughout the entire staff has been that concerned with
the stripping of layers of decorative paint and the detective work
necessary to repaint and decorate the finished items. An example is
the Linde-Wolk steam engine recently acquired by the Institution
from the American Brewery in Baltimore, Maryland. When the Tech-
nical Laboratory personnel commenced their routine documentation

of the colors and designs applied to the engine over the years — |

stripping away each successive coat of paint, taking record photo-
graphs, and tracing the decorative patterns—they discovered among
its dozen discrete layers of paint an intricate panorama of delicately
shaded flowers and exquisite filigrees. While the notion of such
painstaking art work on a huge industrial engine may now seem
anomalous, in an earlier era it clearly was considered a proper ad-
junct. When completed, the engine will be repainted and decorated
as it was many years ago.

To assist with the unprecedented workload imposed by the res-
toration program for “1876,” six additions were made to the crew;
each new man boasts some specialized aptitude or skill essential to
the successful consummation of the program. Among other individ-
ual projects are the refurbishment of a 42-foot span from a Howe
truss bridge and a group of components salvaged from the Girard
Avenue Bridge in Philadelphia — a bridge built at the time of the
Centennial and dismantled a few years ago.

Research and work on furnishings and other phases of the exhibi-
tion are proceeding under the direction of Cultural History Curator
Rodris Roth and Museum Technician Susan Myers. William Miner
of the Office of Exhibits is overall coordinator of the project.

Highlighting the activities of the Division of Musical Instruments
was a program produced for the Renwick Gallery entitled “Ameri-
can Music and Ballroom Dance, 1840-1860,” utilizing wind instru-
ments and a Chickering piano of the period. Cynthia Hoover, James
Weaver, and Robert Sheldon edited the music. Restoration projects
completed included the production of measured drawings for the
1760 Stehlin harpsichord, preparation of wind instruments for the
“American Music” performance, and work on a 1794 Broadwood
grand piano. Thomas Wolf, keyboard instrument maker, joined the
staff as the first participant in a two-year program for training of con-
servators of musical instruments, a service offered for the first time
by the Institution and the only program of its kind in the country.

The Division of Numismatics was joint host, with the American
Numismatic Society, of the 1973 International Numismatic Con-
gress which met for the first time in the United States in September
1973. Opening in New York City, the Congress moved to Washing-
ton, where numerous papers were presented in the Museum to an
attendance of 329 numismatists and guests representing 32 coun-

‘tries. A special exhibition of medals commemorating the battles of
the American Revolution was produced by the Division with an

interpretative publication. A derivative of the Congress was a three-
volume Survey of Numismatic Research, of which Mrs. Elvira Clain-
Stefanelli was the editor of the section on medals.

In November, the Division of Naval History co-sponsored the
American Meeting of the Society for the History of Discoveries in
concert with the Library of Congress and the U.S. National Archives.
Featured were sessions on the exploration of the Americas and on
cartographic resources from the era of the American Revolution.

On May 30, the Secretary presented to Dr. Vladimir Clain-
Stefanelli and to Mrs. Elvira Clain-Stefanelli the Exceptional Service
Gold Medal Award “in recognition of the successful acquisition and
display of the Josiah K. Lilly Collection of gold coins and their many
other achievements and accomplishments in the numismatic world

and for their tireless devotion to the development of one of the

History and Art / 181
world’s finest numismatic collections.” In September, Dr. and Mrs.
Clain-Stefanelli were awarded the 1973 Leonard Forrer Medal by
the International Association of Professional Numismatists ‘for
their work for the increase and diffusion of knowledge in the field
of numismatics.”

Peter C. Marzio, Associate Curator of the Division of Graphic
Arts, received a Fulbright Research Grant which enabled him to
study nineteenth-century American artists in Rome during most of
the past year. Bernard S. Finn, Curator of Electricity, spent a sab-
batical leave in London where he helped prepare a special exhibition —
and booklet on submarine telegraphy at The Science Museum, en-
titled “Leave It to the Mermaids,” in which technical developments
were placed in their social context. The exhibit included objects from >
a number of museums, the Smithsonian Institution, corporations
and individuals in the United States as well as in Great Britain. Jon
B. Eklund, Curator of Chemistry, was on a year’s leave of absence,
during which he was Visiting Professor of Chemistry at the New
York Historical Association at Cooperstown.

Another recipient of an award was Harold D. Langley, Curator of
Naval History, who received a research grant for work in the col- |
lections of the American Antiquarian Society on early American
flags and newspaper sources for American reaction to the Peace of
Ghent in 1815. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Mechanical and Civil :
Engineering, conducted a week-long seminar at Cooperstown deal-
ing with the techniques of field recording, photography, map inter- |
pretation, and site analysis relating to historic and industrial arche-
ology. He also assisted in organizing a symposium celebrating the
250th Anniversary of the Carpenters’ Company of Philadelphia,
“Building Early America,” presenting a paper on materials handling ©
and steam excavation. Senior Scientific Scholar Robert P. Multhauf |
also participated in the conference as well as in a colloquium at the
Burndy Library in Connecticut on the relationship between science |
and technology. :

In December 1973, William Seale joined the staff as Curator in —
the Division of Ethnic and Western Cultural History. His fields of |
activity include the history of American architecture and the mate-
rial culture of the south-central and southeastern United States dur-
ing the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He was co-author of a _
survey of the state capitol buildings of the United States. During the |
year, three new chairmen were appointed to the Museum’s depart- —

1974, he visited Jordan and participated in a conference at the Uni-
versity of Jordan. Later, he visited Cairo, where he completed re-
search on his book, The Physician, Therapist and Surgeon Ibn al-
Quff, which has since been published in Cairo.

Cooperation with organizations concerned with preservation and
history continued this year, with the Division of Mechanical and
Civil Engineering as corporate and editorial headquarters of the
Society for Industrial Archeology. Curator Robert M. Vogel serves ~
as editor of the Newsletter, the only international publication in the
field. John H. White, Jr., Curator of Transportation, is editor of the
semiannual Railroad History; and John T. Schlebecker, Jr., Curator
of Agriculture, and G. Terry Sharrer, Curator of Manufacturing,
jointly edit the quarterly Living Historical Farms Bulletin. Robert P.
Multhauf continues as editor of [SIS and as advisory editor for the
Dictionary of Scientific Biography and the Dictionary of American
History. He was recently appointed a member of the Historical
Advisory Committee of NASA.

The collections were enriched with a variety of objects ranging
in size from a 1926 Huber steam traction engine to an extremely
rare case bottle dated 1788 made at the Amelung Glass Factory of
Frederick, Maryland. An interesting collection of over 200 mill-
stones dating from 1748 to 1920 was acquired, including stones for
grinding materials ranging from grain to paint pigments. Collec-
tively, they represent an industry that no longer exists except as a
historical curiosity.

The robe worn by Chief Justice John Jay and the Senate chair
used by Henry Clay became part of the collections of the Division

objects presented by Ralph E. Becker. A large and important collec- |
tion of early photographic materials relating to the scientific investi-
gations of Professor John W. Draper, one of the first American re-
searchers to use photography as an investigative tool in scientific
investigations, was also acquired.

A particularly valuable document, the original payroll of the Con-
tinental gondola Philadelphia, was received through the generosity
of the Trustees of the Fort Concho Museum at San Angelo, Texas.
This provides a new and human dimension to the history of this’
national treasure. Also received was a specialized group of East |
Asian paper currencies containing several thousand Chinese notes.

Combined with the Oriental coins already owned by the Division of

Numismatics, these materials form one of the most important refer-_
ence collections for the student of Oriental monetary history.
Among other significant items received were a rare eighteenth- |
century indigo blue glazed wool counterpane and a number of horse- |
drawn vehicles required to complete portions of the tranportation ©
collection, including a 1900 truck, an 1890 laundry wagon, a 1929
Cunningham touring car, and two horse-drawn cotton pickers. A_
fine collection of scales and balances was received from the City of ©
Baltimore, together with instruments from the National Weather
Service. |
Baseball and archery collections, which were acquired this past
year, have developed a relatively new area of collection activity.

National Portrait Gallery

The year began with the opening on the Fourth of July of a major
exhibition entitled ‘The Black Presence in the Era of the American
Revolution, 1770-1800,” which consisted of more than 250 items:
paintings, prints, broadsides and books, documents and letters,
and three-dimensional objects. Professor Sidney Kaplan of the
University of Massachusetts prepared both the exhibition and its
catalogue, a 270-page volume containing 100 black and white
illustrations and 8 in color, published for the National Portrait
Gallery (nrc) by the New York Graphic Society in association
with the Smithsonian Institution Press. Professor Kaplan, who
took a year’s leave of absence from his post at Amherst College
to come to Washington, was the first of many scholars, experts
in their fields, whom we hope to call upon in connection with
special exhibitions and publications. ‘The Black Presence,” like
all the Gallery’s major exhibitions, also was accompanied by an
illustrated booklet and a teacher’s guide, prepared especially for
the secondary-school level. This publication, 72 pages in length
and illustrated with 50 reproductions, was written by the Associate
Curator of Education, Mrs. Lisa W. Strick.

A two-gallery exhibition, mounted to commemorate the 150th
anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine on December 3, was orga-
nized by a member of the staff of the Catalog of American Por-
traits, Gerald Z. Levin, who also prepared its 128-page catalogue.
The installations of this and “The Black Presence” exhibition were
designed by Joseph Michael Carrigan, Chief of Exhibit Design and
Production.

A small exhibition dealing with the presidential portraiture of
Abraham Lincoln, centering on a full-length portrait of Lincoln
by William F. Cogswell, lent by the White House, was prepared
by two npc interns, Richard Beard and Kenneth Yellis, who spent
a year with us under a grant from the National Endowment for
the Humanities. Beard and Yellis, who received their Master’s
Degrees in History from Emory University and the University of
Rochester, respectively, were selected from nearly 100 candidates
who applied for these internships designed to acquaint the recipi-
ents with various phases of work encountered in a history museum.

Several special portrait presentations also took place during the

year. The most notable of these was of a bust of President Lyndon
B. Johnson by Jimilu Mason, an event at which Mrs. Johnson and
Senator Hubert Humphrey spoke.

In the past twelve months, more than 33,000 adults and young
people were served in the Gallery and in schoolrooms by our Edu-
cation Department—an increase of 300 percent over last year.

The Historian’s Office and the Curatorial Department were
mainly involved in the preparation of the first two in a series of
the Gallery’s three Bicentennial exhibitions, “In the Minds and
Hearts of the People: Prologue to the American Revolution, 1760-
1774,” and “The Dye is Now Cast, 1774-1776.” The former, which
opened on June 14, will be discussed in greater detail in next year’s
report.

That this was a banner year for the Gallery in terms of acquisi-

tions to the permanent collection is evidenced by the addition of |

817 portraits, 761 of which were engravings by Charles Balthazar
Julien Fevret de Saint-Mémin. Presented by Paul Mellon, this col-
lection represents the most munificent benefaction received by the
National Portrait Gallery since its inception. Originally owned by
Saint-Mémin himself, these portraits, executed between 1796 and
1814, constitute a remarkably diverse representation of major
figures of the early Federal Republic, including Presidents Wash-
ington, Jefferson, and Madison; Paul Revere; Aaron Burr; Ben-

jamin Rush; John Marshall; Charles Willson Peale; Stephen De--

catur; Mother Seton; Meriwether Lewis; and William Clark. An-
other important gift was a portrait of Richard Henry Lee by
Charles Willson Peale, presented by Duncan C. Lee and his son
Gavin Dunbar Lee. Most notable among the year’s acquisitions by
purchase were the only known life portrait of the first Speaker
of the House of Representatives Frederick Muhlenberg by Joseph
Wright, Dolley Madison (at the age of 83) by William S. Elwell,
a bust of Ralph Waldo Emerson by Daniel Chester French, a bronze
relief of President Theodore Roosevelt executed from life in 1906
by Sally James Farnham, and a group of drawings by Soss Melik
including likenesses of Sherwood Anderson, Cole Porter, and
Thomas Wolfe.

Office of Academic Studies
The Office of Academic Studies, under the direction of the Board
of Academic Studies, conducts Smithsonian programs in higher
education and research training. The foremost objective of the
programs is to provide the framework within which each visiting
oF ident and investigator can confront individually the opportunities
for the pursuit of knowledge represented in the Smithsonian’s
collections and its research and technical staff. In the arts, humani-
ties, and sciences, students at all postsecondary levels study under
the guidance of the Smithsonian’s professional research faculty.

Predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows undertake research train-
ing in their specialties, bringing in their inquiries great intellectual
stimulation and adding immeasurably to the vitality of the research
climate. Predoctoral fellows generally consult Smithsonian re-
sources necessary to their dissertations but not available at their
universities. Postdoctoral fellows, usually recent recipients of the
doctorate, seek advanced research training and the opportunity to
expand studies begun at the university. During the academic year
1973-1974, 21 predoctoral and 24 postdoctoral fellowships were
awarded to support these activities in most of the museums, labora-
tories, and field stations of the Institution.

Five students, in an earlier stage of graduate study than the
predoctoral fellows, have received fellowships supported jointly
by their home universities and the Smithsonian’s National Air
and Space Museum to study aspects of the social and technological
impact of space exploration. Although pursuing degrees in different
disciplines at different Washington-area universities, the students
worked with each other as well as their Smithsonian advisor in
the development of their individual projects.

Fellowship appointments for directed research are provided for
two to three months to graduate and undergraduate students, to
offer them new perspectives on the purposes of research and to
provide them access to sources and materials not encountered by
them in their university-based studies. Some students pursue in-
terests previously developed, but many explore areas of knowledge
wholly new. For example, a summer spent at the Smithsonian
might allow a first-year graduate student to reflect on the full
range of alternatives in his chosen field of knowledge, and to de-

History and Art / 191
fine his future graduate course of study based on a better under-
standing of what he finds both practical and interesting. During)
1973-1974 such awards were made to 21 graduate and under-
graduate students; 4 of the undergraduates were supported under
a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Other students, often undergraduates, by preference undertake
studies at the Smithsonian which provide broader exposure than)
research training. They are participants in a program for museum)
study, a program offering them a chance to learn in the working:
museum or laboratory or field environment rather than the tradi- |
tional classroom atmosphere, to take part in the ongoing work.
of the Institution while pursuing a project that interests and!
challenges them. Most students in the program are awarded aca--
demic credit by their home universities, where the student’s per-
formance meets the educational standards set by the Smithsonian |
and the standards and requirements imposed by the university.
During the past year, 13 participated in museum-study projects
under the close supervision of Smithsonian staff members.

In other undergraduate programs, two members of the Smith- |
sonian staff taught regular courses in their specialties in the Uni-
versity of Maryland’s program in the history of science and tech- |
nology.

Seeking other ways to encourage the interchange of ideas and.
the exchange of information, Academic Studies supports visitors
to the Institution for very brief periods of study, research, and.
consultation with the staff. The range of purposes and levels of ©
accomplishment of these visitors reflect the diversity of the Smith-
sonian itself, for they may be graduate students or distinguished
senior scholars and scientists, from the United States or abroad, ©
and their interests lead them to all areas of the Smithsonian. They |
come here for their individual purposes, as short-term visitors, or
as participants in specialized seminars. This year support was pro- |
vided for 32 short-term visitors, and for one seminar, conducted ~
by Dr. William Fitzhugh of the Smithsonian’s Department of |
Anthropology, on the topic of the Maritime and Moorehead }:
Archaic cultures of northeastern North America.

Office of American Studies

‘The Office of American Studies conducts a formal graduate pro-
gram in material culture of the United States which is directed to
the original Smithsonian purpose: “the increase and diffusion of
| knowledge.” Graduate students from area universities participated
a the program, gaining academic credit toward advanced degrees
at those universities.

The course in “Material Aspects of American Civilization” was
taught by Dr. Washburn (with the assistance of curators and others
inside and outside the Smithsonian). A seminar in Museum Visitor
Behavior was conducted by Robert A. Lakota and the staff of the
Psychological and Sociological Studies Program of the Office of
Museum Programs. A seminar in the decorative arts was conducted
by Patrick Butler III, Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate.
Arthur C. Townsend, Executive Secretary, Maryland Historical
Trust and Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate, repeated his
seminar in Great Plains history. A Work-Study Program in His-
torical Archeology, offered by the St. Mary’s City Commission
in cooperation with the American Studies Program of the Smith-
sonian, George Washington University, and St. Mary’s College
of Maryland, was held from June 17 to August 23, 1974, with
participation by graduate students and Smithsonian staff members.
In addition to these formal seminars, supervision of individual
reading and research projects, thesis direction, and preparation of
comprehensive examinations were undertaken by the director and
cooperating Smithsonian staff members.

Staff publications for 1973-1974 are listed in Appendix 8.

MUSEUM PROGRAMS

PRESERVATION, STUDY, AND INTERPRETATION are key functions in any
museum or museum system. The care with which objects are
registered, examined, and treated; the thoroughness with which
they are studied and the clarity with which they are presented and
interpreted to the public are gauges to a museum’s ultimate ex-
cellence. Yet, many of these functions take place away from public
view, with the attendant consequence that they are often funded
with inadequate resources or carried out in inadequate spaces. This
has intermittently occurred at the Smithsonian. The enormous
growth of activities which has developed in the last decade, the
acquisition of new collections, the founding and construction of
new museums as well as new fields of research which have opened
could well have justified, in the eyes of some, a slackening of efforts
and a shifting of resources to some immediately more glamorous
result. It is a measure of the historical commitment of the Institu-
tion to the search of excellence that this has not been the case.

The last few years have seen increased emphasis given to de-
veloping the infrastructure in the fields of conservation, libraries,
archives, and more recently in registration. In these key areas major
progress was made in fiscal year 1974.

The Smithsonian Library, which is as old as the Institution
itself, has undergone careful in-house examination and assessment
of its program and activities, aimed at refining its processes, maxi-
mizing its resources and responding more promptly to the needs
of the Institution and of the scholarly fraternity. Cooperation with
other libraries — federal, state, and private — has led to a pilot
program in computerized cataloguing which will vastly improve
the rate of processing as well as its quality. The needs of the rare
book collections, the ferreting out of uncatalogued rare materials,

195
and developing procedures for their conservation and restoration

have all made major strides. Greater attention has been paid to

the needs of Bureau libraries and to assisting them in responding
more promptly and fully to the requirements of their constituency.
Steps were taken which will lead to the complete cataloguing of
the important library of the National Air and Space Museum by
the dedication of its new building in July 1976.

The Archives of the Institution, concerned primarily with its
history and the history of scholarship within it, have been brought
to virtually full intellectual control. Inventorying of archival re-
sources has progressed and computer systems have been developed
for their cataloguing in close cooperation with curatorial depart-
ments and the central and bureau libraries.

Conservation, an ever present, indeed a growing concern to all
museums, has been further strengthened by enlarging the amount
of space allotted to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, by
the purchase of more sensitive and highly specialized equipment,
and by the active recruitment of additional staff members. In spite
of the progress made, far more needs to be done. The present
capacity is hardly able to keep up with immediate, emergency
needs, let alone allow for the constant review required by such
varied collections as those possessed by the Institution. To maxi-
mize resources, avoid the possibilities of duplication, and to focus
more clearly on the needs, a Conservation Council was created
which regularly will assemble key conservators of all Smithsonian
museums. In addition, the staff of the Conservation Analytical
Laboratory has been active in assisting training organizations in
developing, as rapidly as possible, the additional professionals
which are urgently needed not only by the Institution but by
museums throughout the country. Conservation is more than the
monitoring of conditions and finding palliative methods to remedy
the desecrations of time or of man. It is also basic research in the
properties of materials and in the manners in which these materials
have been assembled by nature or by man. The Conservation
Analytical Laboratory has been under increasingly steady pressure
to provide technical data to bolster the hypotheses of historical re-
search or stylistic development.

The processing of objects either belonging to the Institution or
sent to the Institution for study or exhibition has been thoroughly

196 / Smithsonian Year 1974
’
reorganized. A registration capability is being developed in each

of the Smithsonian museums that did not have it so that each can
achieve more expeditious and accurate control on the whereabouts
of their holdings and, perhaps more important, monitor their con-
ditions in more efficient ways. A Registrarial Council has been
created to develop the required parameters.

The foundations have been laid for the development of a Cen-
tral Registrar's Office that will help coordinate the growth of the
registrarial department in each of the museums, avoid duplications,
attain coherence in methods, and help develop basic retrieval sys-
tems which, eventually, may be coordinated with regional, national,
or, indeed, international data networks. The collections of the
Institution represent a data bank unequaled anywhere. The poten-
tial of mastering a substantial portion of this wealth by the means
of computers has already been demonstrated in discrete areas.

Museums which are essential for the transmittal to the future
of the heritage of the past must, however, be of service to the
present. There is no contradiction in these terms as long as there
is a clear understanding of goals and integrity in their pursuit.

Exhibition is a key function for a museum. In this area, also a
major reorganization has brought to each museum intellectual and
physical control over the resources with which it can interpret
its holdings. Certain museums and bureaus, either too small to have
an exhibition resource of their own or that have too infrequent
need for such specialized capabilities, are served by the recently
developed Office of Exhibits Central. Some of its specialized shops,
virtually unmatched for their abilities, particularly in the area
of modeling and plastics, serve the entire family of Smithsonian
museums. This office also has more general workshops which pro-
vide design and construction capabilities to those units that do not
have exhibit departments. The reorganization of the Office of
Exhibits has led to closer cooperation between design and cura-
torial staffs.

The Office of Exhibits Central and the exhibit offices in various
museums are contributing and participating in the psychological
studies conducted by the Office of Museum Programs. These stud-
ies are specifically designed to acquire more information about
museums as a learning environment and to developing more re-
sponsive methods for orientation of the museum visitor. These

Museum Programs / 197
studies, which are now coming to fruition, will undoubtedly result |
in new exhibit concepts and forms of presentation. Their timeliness —
is evident since the Institution is gearing toward an unprecedented
efflorescence of exhibition activities which will culminate in the
Bicentennial Year.

For the past decade, the Institution has recognized that it had a
duty to assist those less wealthy institutions around the country
in presenting to their public a richer fare. This concern took on —
concrete and permanent form with the development of the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. This has made
available hundreds of exhibitions of high quality, at modest cost,
to museums, historical societies, colleges, universities, and cultural
centers. The efficacy of sites had, in the last few years, been
increasingly jeopardized as costs increased and borrowing organi-
zations were unable to assume the rental fees which were neces-
sary for a break-even program. Federal funding of sites, for the —
first time in fiscal year 1974, has helped to maintain a balance.
Between now and the end of the Bicentennial Year, approximately
250 new exhibitions will be developed on various subjects con-
cerned with history, art, and science. Major emphasis has and will
be given to incorporating into traveling exhibitions Smithsonian
concepts and, where appropriate, objects so that the Institution’s
resources on the Mall can be shared more broadly with the Nation
at large. Many of these new exhibitions will be built by the Office
of Exhibits Central, to concepts and specifications provided by
sITES. To increase the educational usefulness of these exhibitions,
kits of educational materials, designed for schools, will be pre-
pared and an increasingly large number of sites exhibitions will
be accompanied by didactic materials which will be geared to vari-
ous levels so that the broadest benefit can be derived by their
presence.

Assisting museums in developing the expertise of their staff
or in solving special problems has been another historic service of
the Institution. In the last few years, it has been rationalized by
the Office of Museum Programs through the presentation of work-
shops, available free of charge to museum personnel from across
the country. This program, increased in effectiveness in 1974, will
be broadened in the years ahead. Disseminating knowledge on
conservation through expertly prepared series of slide lectures is

198 / Smithsonian Year 1974
another service recently developed. This will be supplemented by
upward of 40 video-taped programs on the basic principles of con-
servation and conservation practice. These programs will be avail-
able to museums, historical societies, and other interested groups.

The study of the museum as a learning environment, referred to
above, has led to staff participation in several seminars, and a
series of short articles were published in Museum News. A major
monograph by Dr. Chandler Screven, The Measurement and Facili-
tation of Learning in the Museum Environment: An Experimental
Analysis, is under preparation for publication by the Office of Mu-
seum Programs.

The National Museum Act, first funded in fiscal year 1972,
continued to be administered by the Office of Museum Programs
and chaired by the Assistant Secretary. The contribution of the
Act to professional enhancement has been universally recognized
and has been most visible in the number of workshops, funded
under the Act, that have been held around the country under the
auspices of the American Association of Museums, the American
Association for State and Local History, or other organizations.
Developing new training programs and attracting talented new
minds to the profession are challenges which museums must meet.
The Act has provided a mechanism to assist in these developments
and in carrying out special research on museum problems and
opportunities.

Renovation and restoration of the Arts and Industries Building,
in preparation for the Bicentennial Year, is another major respon-
sibility of the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs. This
building, the second structure on the Mall built for the Smith-
sonian Institution, was opened to the public in 1881. It was erected
to house the vast collections which were acquired after the closing
of the centennial exhibit of 1876 at Philadelphia.

Appropriately, the first major exhibition to be shown in the
renovated Arts and Industries Building will be devoted to the
recreation, in capsule form, of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibit.
That summary of the Industrial Revolution’s accomplishments
and the Western Hemisphere’s no doubt will be the cause of much
nostalgia and pride.

The Assistant Secretary has continued to represent the Secre-
tary on the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation and on its
