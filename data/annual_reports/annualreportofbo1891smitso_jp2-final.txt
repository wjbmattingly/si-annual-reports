UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.

BY

G. BROWN GOODE,
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U, S. National Museum.

A.—_GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Before entering upon a detailed statement of the operations of the
Museum during the period covered by this Report, it is perhaps not
undesirable to brietly outline its history, organization, and aims, in order
that the true relationships of the work now to be reported upon, as the
outgrowth of the activities of other years, may be comprehended.

The Smithsonian Institution was established by act of Congress in
1846. One of the provisions of the act was that ‘all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens” belonging to the
United States should be placed in the custody of the Institution, to be ar-
ranged and classified so as to be available for students. It was also pro-
vided that a miscellaneous collection of objects known as *‘ the National
Cabinet of Curiosities,” which had accumulated in the Patent Office,
should be transferred to the Institution.* A beginning was thus made
for the National Museum, which, however, was not recognized ofticially
under that designation until a later date. The various steps which
resulted in the formation of the National Museum are pointed out at
some length in a paper printed in Section 11 of this Report, and en-
titled “The Genesis of the National Museum.”

The Institution from its foundation fostered explorations, and its
Museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological and natural history
objects brought home by the explorers. Many gifts were received from
private sources, and objects of various kinds were deposited in the
Museum for safe-keeping.

At the time of the establishment of the Institution numerous impor-
tant naval expeditions and surveys of the public domain had recently
been, or were being, organized by the Government, and during their

_ * This collection was not accepted by and transferred tothe Institution until 1858,

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

progress very extensive collections of natural history and other objects
were made. Important collections from foreign countries were made
by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, Perry’s Japan Expedition, and nu-
merous other naval expeditions, while the naturalists attached to the
Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Survey, and other sur-
veys under the Engineer Corps of the Army, brought together great
collections of objects Ulustrating the natural resources and ethnology
of the United States.

At a somewhat later period, when the geological surveys of the Terri-
tories were organized, large additional collections were formed.

A new source of increment was opened by the investigation of the
Fish Commission into the aquatic fauna of the continent.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 the exhibits of the
United States Government, as well as those of numerous foreign gov-
ernments and of private exhibitors, came into the possession of the Na-
tional Museum.

Since 1876, though the growth of the Museum has been much more
rapid, no single source of increment has predominated. The complexity
of the collections, however, has been greatly increased. The collections
are now more than sixteen times as large as in 1882, which was the
first year of systematic work in the new Museum building.

Among the principal sources of miscellaneous increase since the Cen-
tennial Exhibition may be mentioned the Fisheries Exhibitions of Ber-
lin and London, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884
and 1885, and the Cincinnati Exposition in 1887. A large amount of
material has also been derived through exchange with museums and
individuals at home and abroad.

With the acquisitions from the Centennial Exhibition a new epoch
began in the history of the Museum. The storage rooms and exhibition
halls of the Smithsonian building were overflowing with the accumula-
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in ear-
ing for them were overburdened and unable to keep abreast with the
necessary work. Furthermore, as already stated, the complexity of the
collections had very largely increased, necessitating a new and broader
classification. The growth of the country in wealth and culture led to
the establishment of many local museums, and the educational influences
flowing from these and from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand
for better systems of installation and explanation of the collections.

On account of these circumstances an appeal was made to Congress
for a new building for the National Museum and for increased appro-
priations for its maintenance. A new building was provided for in
1879 and a complete reor -anization of the Museum was undertaken
two years later.

By law theSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution is ex officio director
of the Museum, He is empowered to employ suitable assistants for

carrying on the work of the Museum, for whose action he is responsible
to the Regents of the Institution. For many years the work was car-
ried on by Prof. Baird with no more than two or three assistants. The
Museum was not formally divided into departments. When the reor-
ganization was made, the diversity of the collections made it necessary
to institute numerous departments, each of which was placed in charge
of a curator. The number of curators changes with the changing ne-
cessities of the Museum. At present the scientific staff is composed of
the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the
National Museum, and thirty-two curators and acting curators, twenty-
two of whom receive no salary from the Museum. ‘There are also eleven
administrative departments. (A list of the scientific departments and
of the officers in charge of them is given on page 21.)

Three factors at least are necessary for the proper administration of
a large museum, <A philosophical classification must be adopted, sutti-
ciently comprehensive and elastic to facilitate the distribution of the
objects in the collections. A staff of assistants must be employed, com-
petent to make the proper classification of the objects placed in their
care, and to prevent their deterioration. A system of installation and
arrangement must be devised, which will permit a satisfactory examina-
tion of the collections by students and others.

The matter of classification has engaged the thought of the officers
of the Museum for many years. The chief difficulties are encountered
in the classification of those collections which illustrate the history of
human culture, on account of the intricacy of the subject and its
manifold aspects and relationships. Some remarks on this branch of
classification, which can not be repeated in this outline, will be found
in the report for the year 1884. In the zodlogical, botanical, and geo-
logical departinents, which form a considerable portion of the Museum,
a satisfactory classification is more easily determined upon on account of
the labors of systematic naturalists, running back for two centuries.

In the arrangement and installation of the collections the interests of
three classes of persons have to be kept in view—those engaged in
independent researches, students in colleges and schools, and casual
visitors. So far as the investigator is concerned, it is only necessary
that the objects in a Museum should be preserved in good condition
and so arranged as to be available for study. The college student
demands something more. To be of the highest service to him, objects
must be arranged in series, without duplication, each showing the va-
rious phases of some one subject or the development of an idea or the
modifications of a type of structure; and must, furthermore, be labeled
in such a manner that the reason for their exhibition is unmistakable.
He must, in other words, have presented to him a variety of object-
lessons. The casual visitors, who in point of numbers exceed the
other classes, make quite different demands. They do not come to a
Museum to study in detail any single group of objects, but from intelli-
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

gent curiosity to see the wonders of nature, the masterpieces of art,
and those things which illustrate in the most striking manner the his-
tory and progress of civilization. They demand that the collections
shall be conveniently and attractively arranged and provided with
brief and legible labels. An attempt is made in the National Museum
to meet the demands of all these classes. Large numbers of specimens,
in addition to those in the exhibition cases, are preserved for use in
researches, and these are frequently loaned for study, or (in the zodlogi-
val departments) are given freely to investigators for dissection and
other similar purposes. As far as possible, educational series of objects
similar to those in the Museum are made up from the duplicate speci-
mens 2nd distributed to educational institutions throughout the coun-
try. In this way the advantages of the Museum are extended to many
who have never been within its walls. (A statement of the distribu

tions during the year will be found on page 35.)

In the matter of cases and appliances the Museum maxes use of
those forms which experience at home and the study of the museums
of Europe have demonstrated to be the best. Many forms of cases
which have been designed or perfected by the officers of the National
Museum are in use in other museums both in the United States and
elsewhere.

The importance of labels is fully understood by the officers of the
Museum, and much time is spent every year if their preparation. The
Museum enjoys the advantage of having printed labels in place of writ-
ten ones. Their legibility and attractiveness is thus greatly increased.

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con-
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity under existing
laws of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution
nothing but good can be said. It should be borne in mind that it is in
part a Smithsonian Museum, since, especially in its earlier history, the
Justitution expended considerable sums of money in aiding explorations
with the distinct purpose of increasing the collections in certain diree-
tions. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the use of the
larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and what is of paramount
importance, the guidance and influence of the officers of the Institution,
and the very valuable assistance of its numerous correspondents.

The necessity of depending on appropriations made annually, while
unavoidable under our system of government, is not without serious
drawbacks. It renders difficult or impossible the carrying out of many
far-reaching plans for the symmetrical growth of the Museum, and places
it at a disadvantage with endowed museums under private auspices,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. H

The necessity of caring for Government collections of many kinds
gives, as already stated, a very wide scope to the Museum, and im-
presses upon it characteristics scarcely to be found in any other similar
organization. What is here brought together in two buildings has its
counterpart in England, Germany, France, and other European coun-
tries in groups of museums, each with a limited and well-defined scope.

It is unnecessary to enter a plea for the right of a national museum
to exist. Its establishment is not forced upon the country. It grows
up unsolicited as a consequence of the activities of an enlightened Goy-
ernment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of
a museum come into the possession of the Government. It can not be
questioned that it is in every way most desirable that these should be
brought together in one place, where they can be classified and ar-

ranged for examination and study. A museum formed in this manner,

however, suffers sooner or later from the immense accumulation of
objects of the same kind in certain directions and from deficiencies in
others. It has been so in the case of the National Museum. At the
outset no addition was unwelcome, and the expectation that all impor-
tant deficiencies would be supplied might properly be indulged in. As
the years have passed, however, it has become more and more appar-
ent that many of these deficiencies would only be made good by the
purchase of the necessary objects, and the importance of increased ap-
propriations for the purchase of collections and single objects to com-
plete the various series in the Museum is very strongly felt.

In its present condition the Museum may be likened to a book from
which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narrative is
disjointed and incomplete. There are instances in this country in
which more money is expended for the improvement of private muse-
ums than is expended for the National Museum. In certain museums
of Europe more money is expended annually in purchases than is rep-
sented by the entire appropriations for the National Museum. The
officers of the Museum have repeatedly suffered the chagrin of being
compelled to refuse the offer of specimens necessary to complete the
collections, and to see them pass into the hands of private institutions
in this country or the government museums in Europe,

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the direction of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, which is governed by an establishment consisting of the
President of the United States and his Cabinet, the Commissioner of
Patents, and the Board of Regents, which latter is composed of the
Vice-President, Chief Justice of the United States, three members of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six
other citizens not members of Congress, two of whom are residents of
the city of Washington,
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to whom is intrusted
the actual management of its affairs, is by law the ‘¢keeper of the col-
> The seientifie staff at the present time, as already stated, is
composed of the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Lnstitution in
charge of the National Museum and thirty-two curators and acting

fections.’

curators, twenty-two of whom receive no salary from the Museum
appropriation. ‘Phere are also eleven administrative departments.

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The collections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the fol-
lowing materials:

(1) The natural history and anthropological collections, accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the
Smithsonian Institution.

(2) The collection of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry ex-
pedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

(3) The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacifie Railroad
survey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on
by the Engineer Corps of the Army.

(4) The collections of the United States geological surveys under the
direction of the United States geologists, Hayden, King, and Powell.

(5) The collections of the U.S. Fish Commission.

(6) The gifts by foreign governments to the Museum, or to the Presi-

dent or other publie officers of the United States who are forbidden by
law to retain such gifts in their private possession.
(7) The collections made by the United States to illustrate the ani-
mal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the na-
tive races of the country on the occasion of the International Exhibi-
tion at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed by the
United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in
1880 and at London in 1885, and the collections obtained from various
local expositions; as, for instance, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition, in 1884 and 1885, and the Cincinnati Exposition, in 1887.

(8) The collections given by the governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876.

(9) The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Kurope and America at the time of the Phila-
delphia exhibition and subsequently.

(10) The material received, in exchange for duplicate specimens, from
the museums in Europe and America at the tune of the Philadelphia
exhibition and subsequently.

(11) Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange, from in-
dividuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.

C.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.
INCREASE IN THE COLLECTIONS DURING THE DECADE 1881-1891.

At the close of 1881 a census of the collections was taken, resulting
in the preparation of a table, published in subsequent reports, which
eave 193,362 as the approximate total number of specimens of all kinds
at that time entered in the catalogue books of the several departments
of the Museum. The census for the year ending June 30, 1891, places
the total number of specimeus of all kinds at 5,028,714, showing an in-
crease of about nineteen-fold during the decade. It must, however,
he stated that a large proportion of the material catalogued in 1884
and in later years, had been in the custody of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion for several years, but had remained in storage on account of there
being no opportunity to have it classified and entered in the catalogue
hooks. In this way the immense increase in the totals for 1584 as com-
pared with those for 1882 may be partly accounted for,

There still remains in the basement of the Smithsonian building and
in the old Armory building a considerable amount of material, consist-
ing largely of gifts from foreign governments and contributions from
expositions, which has not yet been brought under control, owing to
lack of space and other necessary facilities.

INCREASE IN THE MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The number of publications added to the Museum Library during the
year was 12,854, including 922 books of more than 100 pages, 2,492
pamphlets, 9,280 parts of serials, and 160 charts.

INCREASED EDITION OF MUSEUM REPORTS.

In place of 16,000 extra copies, the Fifty-first Congress has ordered
that 19,000 copies of reports of the Museum be printed. This will
allow 3,000 copies to be set apart for distribution by the Museum to its
contributors and correspondents.

VISITORS.

The number of visitors to the Museum building during the year end-
ing June 30, 1891, was 286,426, and during the same period 111,669 per-
sons visited the Smithsonian Institution. The total number of visitors
since 1881 (during the last decade) to the Museum building is 2,398,575,
and to the Smithsonian Institution 1,081,681.

10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.
PROPOSED ADDITIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.

On January 9, 1891, the bill providing for a new Museum building
was favorably reported from the House Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds, but failed of passage.

CAST OF STATUE OF LIBERTY.

Through the coéperation of the Architect of the Capitol, Hon. Ed-
ward Clark, the original full-size plaster model of Thomas Crawtord’s
statue of liberty was transferred from the crypt in the Capitol to the
Museum. The bronze was cast by Clark Mills, at his foundry, near
Bladensburg, Md., in 1860, and is 19 feet 5 inches in height. This
model had been stored in a cellar room of the Capitol, and had unfor-
tunately been broken into fragments, when the work of transferring it
to the Museum was undertaken by Theodore A. Mills, an employé of
the Museumn.*

THE DAGUERRE MEMORIAL.

On August 15, 1890, a bronze statute of Daguerre was unveiled in
the rotunda of the National Museum building, by the Secretary of the
Interior. This monument, in honor of Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre,
was presented by the Photographers’ Association of America, which
was holding its annual meeting in Washington at that time. Daguerre,
in cobperation with Joseph Nicéphore Niepce, invented and perfected
the daguerreotype, the announcement of which was made at the session
of the French Academy of Sciences, in 1839. The monument is 11
feet in height, and is made of bronze and granite. It represents Fame
fastening a garland around the head of Daguerre. The garland also
encircles the globe, thus typifying the universal benefit of his inven-
tion. The monument is the work of Jonathan Scott Hartley.

THE CAPRON COLLECTION.

This colleetion, consisting of gold lacquers, bronzes, porcelains, cary-
ine’s in ivory and wood, and many other works of art, was obtained by
the late Gen. Horace Capron while United States minister to Japan. A
bill for its purchase was introduced into the Senate on March 1, 1888 (Iif-
tieth Congress, first session), by Senator Daniel W. Voorhees, and passed
the Senate on March 31. On August 8 of the same year Mr. O'Neill, of

*The following order, issued by Hon. John B. Floyd, Secretary of War, May 24,
1860, may be of interest in this connection:

“The proposed statue of Freedom, modeled by Crawford, for the dome of the
Capitol, will be cast by Clark Mills at his foundry near Bladensburg under the di-
rection of Capt. William B. Franklin of the Topographical Engineers in charge of
the Capitol Extension. Mr. Mills will be paid for his services and for the rent of his
foundry at the rate of $400 per month from the commencement to the termination of
the work. The materiais, fuel, labor, and everything necessary for the casting of
the figure will be supplied by the Government.”
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Le

Pennsylvania, from the Committee on the Library, submitted a report
stating that, in the opinion of the committee, the collection should be
purchased by the Government and placed in the National Museum.
This bill did not pass the House. It was again introduced into the
Senate on December 4, 1889, by Senator Voorhees, and passed the Sen-
ate on March 29, 1890. It was also reported a second time from the
House Committee on the Library, on May 19, 1890, but failed to pass.
In the sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1892, an appropri-
ation of $10,000 was made for the purchase of this collection.

The lacquered objects are the most valuable in the collection, par-
ticularly the four specimens which bear the crest of one of the families
of the Shoguns. The bronzes are forty-six in number, and in addition
there are two objects in silver bronze and one in gold bronze, represent-
ing birds and flowers. The ivory carvings are thirty-seven in number.
There is also included a collection of sixty-three Japanese coins. thirtv-
five of which are of gold.

When Gen. Capron returned to the United States, he generously
placed these treasures in the custody of the Smithsonian Institution,
where they were exhibited. After his death, in 1885, Mrs. Capron
signified her desire to allow the collection to remain in the Institution.
It has always attracted a great deal of attention from visitors of all
classes, and its acquisition by the Government of the United States is
a source of congratulation.

TYPES OF THE OWEN COLLECTION OF FOSSILS.

The Owen type specimens of fossils, mentioned on page 759 of the
reportot the National Musem for 1888 as having been “ presented ” tothe
Museum by the Indiana State University through the courtesy of the
university, will be retained in the National Museum as a “deposit”
subject to the order of the board of trustees of the university. These
specimens have been described and illustrated in Government publica-
tions.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTCN DURING THE YEAR,

Washington has during recent years been selected as the place for
holding meetings of a large number of national and international socie-
ties of all kinds. Each year has seen an increase in this respect, and
the matter has now become of such importance (not so much, how-
ever, on account of the number as of the character of the societies)
that it seems proper to make mention of it in a report which is intended
to contain in a general way a reference to all efforts to develop and
encourage research, both from a scientific, economic, and a literary
point of view. There is probably no place in the country better suited
for such meetings. The seat of government and center of political
activity has become accustomed to receiving and entertaining organi-
zations.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

During the last fiscal year numerous learned bodies met in various
halls in this city. The many attractions of the capital, the opportunity
of easy access to public record offices and the Congressional Library,
the general interest of the Government buildings, combine to make
Washington a favored city for such purpose. During the last fiseal
year the tollowing organizations, among others, held their meetings
here:

PARTICIPATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD'S
COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.

Mention was made in the last report of the provision by Congress for
holding an Exposition in the city of Chicago in 1893 for the purpose of
celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America
by Christopher Columbus. Dr. G. Brown Goode, assistant secretary,
in charge of the National Museum, was appointed by the President the
representative of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum
upon the Government Board of Managers and Control. Dr. Goode was
invited by the Government Commission to prepare for its use a prelimi-
nary plan of classification for the Exhibition. This was done, and in
September, 1890, a “draft of a system of classification” was presented
to the Committee on Classification. It formed the basis of the classifi-
cation subsequently adopted, although modified of course by the neces-
sities of the case and the peculiar views of the executive heads of the
various departments of the Exhibition. This classification has never
been published, although a small edition was printed for the use ot the
committees. It was, however, never made accessible for general use.
It was published under the following title: “First Draft of a System
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

of Classification for the World’s Columbian Exposition.” In the prep-
aration of this classification an exhaustive study was made of all classi-
fications which had been published in connection with previous exhibi-
tions. Since up to the present time no attempt has been made to pre-
pare a scheme so generally comprehensive, it is reproduced in the Ap-
pendix (Section 11) to this report, in the hope that it may be useful to
persons who are engaged in exhibition or museum administration.

During the latter part of the year the Treasury Department decided
that the sum of between $30,000 and $40,000 was available for expeudi-
ture in connection with the preparation of the Government exhibits.
This sum was divided among the executive departments, ineluding
the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, and the Fish Com-
mission; the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum
and the Bureau of Ethnology, receiving about $6,000, As soon as this
money became available, several of the curators in the National
Museum commenced work upon the special exhibits of their depart-
ments, and a force of taxidermists and mechanics was engaged. Mr.
Rh. Edward Earll was appointed chief special agent in April, and
will act as the executive officer under the direction of the representa-
tive of the Smithsonian Institution.

PATENT CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.

The celebration of the beginning of the second century of the American
patent system by a Congress of American Inventors and Manufacturers
was held on April 8,9, and 10, 1891. A committee of citizens of Wash-
ington was appointed to carry out the details. Mr. J. E. Watkins,
curator of the section of transportation, was appointed secretary. The
ceremonies consisted of a series of meetings at which addresses relating
to the history and influence of invention were delivered by prominent
statesmen, inventors, political economists, and engineers, During the
meetings a loan collection was installed in the lecture hall of the Na-
tional Museum, where machines of antique design, models, and early
patents were inspected and studied. In this collection were patents
signed by Washington, Madison, and Monroe, the first two talking-
machines, an antique electrical railway constructed in 1837, the original
Morse telegraph instruments, the first photographic camera made in
the United States, the original typewriting machine from which the
perfected Remington typewriter was constructed, early forms of sew-
ing machines, besides other curious and useful devices, many of which
have been donated to the Museum, and are now on exhibition. Prof.
Otis T. Mason, curator of ethnology, read a paper before the congress,
entitled ‘* The Birth of Invention.”

BOARD ON GEOGRAPHIC NAMES.

Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator of ethnology in the National Museum,
Was appointed by the President of the United States a member of the
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

Board of Geographic Names. The decisions of this Board in regard to
the spelling and pronunciation of geographical names will be accepted
as final.

NECROLOGY.

Mention should be made of the death of Mr. William Wesley, of
London, on April 17, 1891. For nearly thirty years he was identified
with the Smithsonian Institution as its agent in the transmission of
books and other material, through the Bureau of International Ex-
changes.

D.—THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.

It is evident, from a perusal of the reports of the curators, that
special effort has been been made during the year to bring the collec-
tions into as satisfactory a condition as possible. The lack of space for
the installation of additional specimens in most of the departments
renders further development, so far as the exhibition series are con-
cerned, impracticable.

A large proportion of the accessions is reserved for the duplicate
and study series, and the increase during the year, including the spec-
imens intended for exhibition, is indicated in the following table:

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

The growth of the exhibition series in the various departments of the
Museum has been greatly retarded on account of the crowded condition
of the Museum building.

In the Section of Graphic Arts the labeling of specimens on exhibi
tion has been continued and the cataloguing of the Osborne collection
completed. In theSection of Transportation and Engineering an attempt
has been made to secure a series of objects Ulustrating the birth and
development of the mechanical arts, with special reference to the evo-
lution of the epoch-making inventions. The labeling and cataloguing
of specimens in the exhibition series has been completed. The study
and exhibition series have been increased by a collection of engravings,
prints, photographs, and drawings of locomotives, cars, bridges, and
other railroad apparatus and appliances. In order to provide room for
the display of valuable objects acquired during the year, it was found
necessary to rearrange the entire exhibition series, and many objects
were installed on the tops of cases, or on brackets, with a view to
greater economy of space. Considerable progress was made in the
Department of Ethnology in connection with the installation of the
series of bows, arrows, and shields. An exhibition series of time-
keeping apparatus has been commenced, and a card-catalogue of the
ethnological series was begun. <A series of type portraits of man-
kind, 33 in number, was prepared by Mr. A. Zeno Shindler. A series
of fire-making implements was arranged by Mr. Walter Hough. Prepa-
rations were commenced at the close of the fiscal year for an ethnologi-
val exhibit at the World’s Fair. In the Department of Prehistoric
Anthropology the collections have been rearranged according to local-
ity, necessitating a change in the location of the cases and a rearrange-
ment of the material in the trays. Six months were required for the
completion of this work. The preparations for an exhibition of mam-
mals at the World’s Fair have somewhat retarded progress in the in-
stallation and arrangement of the exhibition series. In the Department
of Birds five exhibition cases were filled with specimens, properly ar-
ranged and labeled, and a large portion of the study collection of
American Passeres and Picariv was entirely rearranged. The installa-
tion of the collection of reptiles and batrachians in jars was continued
during the year, and the reserve series of North American batrachians
was arranged in systematic order. The space assigned to the Depart-
ment of Vertebrate Fossils is greatly overcrowded, thus preventing a
complete arrangement of the study and exhibition series, a large
amount of unclassified material being in storage. The Department of
Mollusks has shown considerable activity in the development of its
exhibition series during the year. The Lea collections have been
placed in permanent shape. The Naiades have been placed on exhibi-
tion in new cases, The reserve collection in the Department of Insects
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

has steadily increased, and the exhibition series is now arranged in
permanent shape. Additional accommodations have been provided for
the Department of Marine Invertebrates, whereby space is provided for
seven additional unit cases. The development of the exhibition series
will be deferred until the west hall is again ready for occupation. In
the Department of Comparative Anatomy the work of labeling the
series has been commenced and a tentative plan for a synoptic exhibi-
tion series has been arranged. The honorary curator of Paleozoic
fossils, Mr. C. D. Walcott, finds it very difficult to handle the large
amount of material received, owing to the limited laboratory room, and
over 50 boxes of material have been placed in storage in order to ob-
tain room for the collections desired for immediate study. The collec-
tion of mesozoic fossils, under the charge of Dr. C. A. White, have
been rearranged in cases, and are now in much better condition for
examination and study than before. The collection of fossil plants,
under the supervision of Prof. Lester F. Ward, honorary curator, has
been rearranged geographically during the year, and the series of cre-
taceous and tertiary specimens have been catalogued. In the Mineral
Department a nearly complete rearrangement of the systematic series
was carried out during the year by Mr. Wm.5S. Yeates, under the direc-
tion of Prof. F. W. Clarke, honorary curator. A new case was built
across the east end of the west-south range, affording to the Depart-
ment of Geology accommodations for the collection of structural color
and the specific gravity series, as well as for the larger collections in
historical geology.

K.—THE MUSEUM STAFF.
THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

The personnel of the scientific departments of the Museum has un-
dergone but little change during the last fiscal year.

Capt. J. W. Collins, who has been in charge of the section of naval
architecture for several years, has recently been appointed honorary
curator of the section of fisheries.

Mr. J. B. Hatcher was temporarily appointed in December as an as-
sistant to Prof. O. C. Marsh, honorary curator of the department of
vertebrate fossils, for the purpose of arranging and classifying the
collection which has now been transferred to the Museum.

Mr. Frederick C. Test, a graduate of Indiana State University, was
appointed an aid in November, 1890, to assist Dr. Stejneger, in the de-
partment of reptiles and batrachians.

There are now thirty-three organized departments and sections in the
Museum under the care of curators, including honorary and acting
Curators, and assistant cuyators,

f.— REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.

DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY:
ETHNOLOGY.

Progress in this department during the year nas been very satisfae-
tory, under the guidance of Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator. Lieut. T.
Dix Bolles, U.S. Navy, was detailed for duty at the museum for five
months, and rendered material aid in arranging and cataloguing speci-
mens from Oceanica. Valuable additions to the collection from Ocean-
ica were sent by Admiral Kimberly and Lieut. Safford, U. S. Navy.
A card-catalogue of the large collections of religious objects, secured
iniong the pueblos of the southwest by the Bureau of Ethnology, was
completed during the year. These collections were labeled by Mrs.
Tilly E. Stevenson, and are probably the largest and most complete of
any relating to the subject of Pueblo religion. The “artillery” of the
American aborigines has been worked up during the year, the linguis-
tie stocks of the aborigines have been fully studied out, and the loca-
tion of each tribe marked upon a map. An exhibition series of time-
keeping apparatus has been commenced, and a complete card-catalogue
of the ethnological series was continued during the year. Monographic
catalogues, based on the plan of those published by the South Kensing-
ton Museum, have also been commenced.

The curator has devoted considerable time to preliminary work in
connection with an ethnological exhibit at the World’s Columbian Ex-
position. It is proposed to illustrate in an effective manner the aborig-
inal lite of North America at the time the natives were first visited by
the white people, and before they were influenced by contact with our
civilization. The number of specimens added to the collection during
the year is 1,800. In the catalogue of the department 1,504 entries
have been made.

PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

The most important work of the year reported by the curator, Dr,
Thomas Wilson, has been the reclassification and rearrangement of the
entire collection according to locality. Special researches in many di-
rections have been prosecuted, including the following subjects: Cop-
per implements, jade implements, arrow-heads, casts and models of the
Aztee and Maya antiquities. Several important accessions have been
received during the year, and are referred to elsewhere in this report.
The number of specimens received during the year was 5,504. In the
catalogue 954 entries have been made.

GRAPHIC ARTS,

In the section of graphic arts the accessions, while not as numerous
as in previous years, have been quite as important. Among the most
valuable gifts is a series of specimens fully illustrating the photographic
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

processes invented by Mr. J. W. Osborne; a collection of Japanese
color-prints and illustrated books, received from Mr. T. Tokuno, Tokio,
Japan; and an impression from a heliogravure plate made by Nice-
phon Niepee in 1824. Among the gifts to the collection were also
artists’ tools and material from FP. W. Devoe & Co., New York, and Mr.
J. M. Falconer, Brooklyn, N. Y. During the year the cataloguing of
the Osborne collection was completed.

The number of catalogue entries made during the year was 1,326, the
total number of specimens received being about 1,500, embracing 952
specimens in the Osborne collection received several years ago. The
entries representing entirely new material are 374 in number. The
Bibliography (Section Tv) contains notices of the papers, published by
Mr. Koehler during the year.

FORESTRY.

Dr. B. E. Fernow, honorary curator, reports that the forestry collee-
tions are being gradually increased by gifts. A systematic display of
the more important lumber trees by means of maps, showing their dis-
tribution, photographs of typical trees, and photomicrographs of the
structure of the wood, has been begun. ‘The most valuable accession
during the year was a very complete collection of the woods of the Ar-
gentine Republic, donated by the Museo de Productos Argentinos at
Buenos Ayres.

AMERICAN PREHISTORIC POTTERY.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, of the U.S. Geological Survey, is in charge of
this department. The most important accession during the year was a
collection of pottery fragments transmitted by the Bureau of Ethnology.
The. researches conducted by the curator relate mainly to collections
made by the Bureau of Ethnology during the past few years in the
Mississippi Valley and along the Alantic Coast. They will be embodied
in a forthcoming volume of ‘“ Contributions.” References are made in
the Bibliography (Section tv) to papers published by the curator dur-
ing the year, relating to excavations in an ancient soapstone quarry
in the District of Columbia and to the Thruston Tablet. The catalogue
entries for the year were 820 in number.

PHYSICAL APPARATUS.

The nucleus of the collection of physical apparatus consists chiefly
of pieces procured by Prof. Henry for researches in electricity and
sound. This collection is in charge of Mr. W. C. Winlock, honorary
curator. The principal accession is a collection of ancient watch-
movements obtained by Mr. S. P. Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, during a visit to London and Parisin the summer of 1890,
A collection of old surveying instruments was received from the sur-
veyor-general of Florida through the General Land Office of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Dial

Department of the Interior. These instruments are supposed to haye
been used in laying the boundary line between Florida and Georgia in
1795,

HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS.

Mr. A. Howard Clark is in charge of these collections. The most
important accessions during the year are the original plaster model of
the Statue of Liberty from which was cast the bronze statue surmount-
ing the doine of the Capitol, and a large collection of personal papers
and relics of George Washington, including the original will of John
Washington. Several historical objects have been submitted for an
expression of opinion as to their historical and intrinsic value.

COLLECTION OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

The work of mounting typical specimens of domestic animals has .
been continued by Mr. Nelson R. Wood, 69 specimens being mounted
during the year. Nearly all the specimens were difficult subjects, re-
quiring a great deal of time for their preparation. At the close of the
year covered by this report, 44 specimens of thoroughbred domestic
pigeons and fowls had been collected.

TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING.

These collections, under the custody of Mr. J. EK. Watkins, curator,
have been materially increased during the year, many valuable acces-
sions having been received. The collection of electrical apparatus has
been enriched by the receipt from Miss Mary Henry of the original
electro-magnetic engine designed by Prof. Joseph Henry. This machine
is one of the earliest applications of magneto-electricity to the produe-
tion of power. Prof. Henry described its action as “reciprocating motion
produced by magnetic attraction and repulsion.” Several drawings
and lithographs of the original telegraph instrument invented by Mr.
Alfred Vail were deposited by his widow, together with two letters,
describing Mr. Vail’s relations with Prof. Morse and the operations of
the first practical electro-magnetic telegraph machine. The Hinds
Ketcham Company of Brooklyn, N. Y., deposited a collection of in-
candescent lamps, switches, and other electric-light apparatus. One of
the original cylinders of the ‘‘Stourbridge Lion” has been deposited
in the Museum, by Lindsay and Early, of Carbondale, Pa.

The ceremonies attending the celebration of the beginning of the
second century of the American patent system were held in Washing-
ton, on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of April, 1891. Mr. Watkins was ap-
pointed secretary of the organization and devoted considerable time to
the work of the Congress. During the Patent Centennial a loan col-
lection was installed in the Museum embracing machines of antique
design, models, and early patents. Many of the objects forming this
collection have found a permanent place in the Museum collections,
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

The study and exhibition series have also been increased by a large
collection of engravings, prints, photographs, and drawings of locomo-
tives, cars, and track-standards, bridges, and many original rail-sec-
tions, deposited by Mr, Watkins,

MATERIA MEDICA,

Dr. James N. Flint, U.S. Navy, honorary curator, reports that the
work of arranging, installing and providing the specimens with de-
scriptive labels, has been systematically continued. With the exception
of the collection of medicines of the North American Indians and Chi-
nese and Japanese drugs, every specimen now has a printed descriptive
label. There were 168 specimens received during the year, principally
donations from Messrs Powers & Weightman, Philadelphia, and Parke,
Davis & Co., of Detroit. Novel and interesting additions were made
to the botanical illustrations, consisting of herbarium specimens of in-
digenous medical plants, not otherwise illustrated. These were pre-
pared by Mr. Theodore Holm, of the Museum staff.

DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.
MAMMALS,

Mr. Frederick W. True, curator, reports a gratifying inerease in the
number of valuable mammals from foreign countries. New storage-
eases for the reserve series of alcoholics and small skins have been con-
structed. Dr. W. L. Abbott presented 76 mammals, collected by him in
Africa. Among American mammals the most interesting accession of
the year was a male walrus from Walrus Island, Bering Sea, obtained
by Capt. W. ©. Coulson, of the U. S. Revenue Marine Service. <A large
sea-lion and numerous specimens of fur-seals, marmots, shrews, and
Arctic foxes were obtained during the expeditions of Messrs. H. W.
Elliott and William Palmer (of the Museum staff) from the Pribyloyv
Islands. Thirty-two specimens were transferred to the Museum from
the Zodlogical Park during the year, including «a Rocky Mountain sheep,
a bison, black bear and ocelot.

Mr. P.L. Jouy, of the Museum staff, made collections of small mam-
mals in the Roan Mountain region of North Carolina and in southern
Arizona. Several groups of mammals have been placed in the exhibi-
tion hall during the year, the most conspicuous being a group of Kast
African Guereza monkeys, constructed from skins collected by Dr. W.
L. Abbott in the region of Kilima-Njaro, Africa; a group of Borneo
gibbons has been prepared, and is now awaiting the construction of a
suitable exhibition case. The reconstruction of the south entrance of
the Museum building as a storage room and laboratory was completed
in September, 1890. Preparations for an exhibit of mammals at the

-World’s Columbian Exposition were begun in March. The force of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a0

taxidermists was increased and a special workshop was fitted up for

their use. Mr. William Palmer has been appointed chief taxidermist.
The mammal collections are, on the whole, in a good state of preserva-

tion. The number of specimens received during the year was 465,

BIRDS.

The increase in the collections in this departnent during the year
has been most gratifying. The Eighth Congress of the American Orni-
thologists’ Union was held in Washington in November, 1890. The
office of the curator of birds—Mr. Robert Ridgway—was used as the
headquarters for the members and the meeting-place of several com-
inittees, especially that on species and subspecies. Plans and esti-
mates for an exhibit of birds at the World’s Columbian Exposition were
prepared and subinitted by the curator.

The total number of specimens added to the collection during the
year was 2,478, and of catalogue entries, 2,383,

Mr. H. Nehrling, of Wisconsin, has published the first part of his
work on ** North American Birds,” many of the illustrations being taken
from plates in the reports of the National Museum.

BIRDS’ EGGS.

The collection of bids’ eggs and nests remains in the custody of
Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, honorary curator. Among the
more important accessions during the year is an interesting collection
of eggs and nests, the gift of Mr. R. MacFarlane, of the Hudson Bay
Company. The number of eggs of North American birds in the col-
lection is now 45,031, and of foreign birds, 4,561. The number of nests
in the reserve and exhibition series is 2,574, making a total of 52,166
specimens of eggs and nests in the collection.

REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The year covered by this report is reported by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
curator, aS one of unusual activity. The principal accessions received
were a collection of reptiles made by Mr. P. L. Jouy, the study of which
will probably result in greatly increasing and correcting existing knowl-
edge of the herpetology of the southwestern border; a valuable collec-
tion of reptiles from Idaho contributed by Dr. ©. Hart Merriam, of the
Department of Agriculture. Of the exotic collections none exceed in
importance those received trom Dr. W. L. Abbott, and collected by him
in the Seychelles, Madagascar, and Kilima-Njaro region, Mast Africa.
In addition to his other duties, the curator has assumed the editorship
of the supplement to the ‘“Nomenclator Zodlogicus.” The titles of
papers published during the year by Dr. Stejneger will be found in the

sibhiography (Section rv, of the report).

During the year 908 specimens have been added to the collection,
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.
FISHES.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean is still the honorary curator of this department,
with Mr. Barton A. Bean as assistant. The number of specimens re-
ceived during the year is 4,737, Prominent among them is a collection
of deep-sea fishes from the Mediterranean Sea, received from the Mu-
seum of Natural History in Paris, France. The U.S. Fish Commission
has transmitted a collection of fresh-water fishes from Arkansas, Ala-
bama, Georgia, Colorado, and Utah, made by Profs. David 8S. Jordan,
S. E. Meek, C. H. Bollman, and Bert Fessler; a collection containing
16 new species obtained by the steamer Albatross from the Pacific
coast; a collection made by the Albatross in 1887-1888 at Bahia, Pata-
gonia, and the Straits of Magellan, and a collection from Chesapeake
Bay made by Messrs. Barton A. Bean and P. Seal.

VERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

This department is in charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh, honorary curator,
and Mr. Frederic A. Lucas, assistant curator. Few accessions were
received during the year. Twenty-seven specimens were mounted for
exhibition. The large and valuable series of western fossils received
from Prof. O. ©. Marshis being arranged and classified. The collection
now embraces 1,080 specimens, many of them being of great value. A
large amount of unclassified material is still in storage.

MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING TERTIARY FOSSILS).

Mr. William H. Dall, of the U. 8S. Geological Survey, is still in charge
of this department, and is assisted in the scientific work by Dr. R. E.
C. Stearns, as adjunct curator, and by Mr. Gilbert D. Harris and Mr.
Frank Burns, of the U.S. Geological Survey. The general operations
of this department have been confined to the determining, labeling,
assorting, and registration of specimens, and to the preparation of
special reports on collections received from the U.S. Fish Commission,
the Navy Department, the Revenue Marine Service, the Department of
Agriculture, and from special expeditions. The collection of mollusks
in the National Maseum now ranks among the most important in the
world, especially by reason of the scientific data associated with the
material and the thorough system of registration and identification
which has been applied to the specimens. Mr. Dall has been largely
engaged in preparing a general report on the Neocene formations of the
United States. Dr. Stearns has devoted much of his time to an investi-
gation of the mollusks of the Galapagos Islands, and the manuscriptis
nearly ready for publication.

The amount of material received during the year is considerably
greater and more valuable than during last year. An interesting col-
lection of marine shells from Caracas, was presented by Mr. R. L. Bartle-
man, of the United States legation in Venezuela, The Department of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

Agriculture sent land and fresh-water shells gathered by its agents in
Arizona. The U.S, Fish Commission contributed several collections
from the Pacific coast and from the coast of Labrador.

During the year the entire Lea collection has been registered. The
bibliographical notices under the names Dall, Simpson, and Stearns
(see Section Iv) will indicate the extent and character of the researches
made in this department during the year.

About 5,000 specimens were received during the year, making a total
of about 465,500 specimens now in the collection. The catalogue entries
for the year were 5,764 in number.

INSECTS.

Twelve thousand specimens have been added to the collection during
the year. The routine work has been confined to the making up of
collections for exchange, the naming of specimens for collections, and
the arranging of all the collections in permanent shape. The North
American Myriapoda have been rearranged. This collection includes
the Bollman collection, which was purchased by the Museum last
year, and which ranks as the largest in existence. It contains 160
named species, arranged in 325 alcoholic vials. Among the important
accessions of the year are: A collection representing about 63 species
of insects of various orders, collected in Angola and St. Thomas, Africa,
and presented by Mr. Heli Chatelain, of Washington, D. C.; a large
collection of African insects, collected and presented by Dr. W. L.
Abbott, Philadelphia, Pa.; 425 specimens of Lepidoptera and 2,400
specimens of Coleoptera collected in California and Washington by Mr.
A. Koebele, and received from the Department of Agriculture; 1,100
specimens, representing 240 species of North American Microlepidop-
tera, also transmitted by the Department of Agriculture. The number
of catalogue entries for the year was 174. The collections are in a
very satisfactory condition.

MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

Favorable progress is reported in the work of this department by the
honorary curator, Mr. Richard Rathbun. The construction of a new
roof over the west hall of the Smithsonian Institution has necessitated
the temporary removal of the greater part of the collection stored there.
The number of specimens has been considerably increased by additions
from various sources, The work of the department has been actively
carried on by Mr. James E. Benedict, assistant curator, and Miss M.
J. Rathbun. Mr. Benedict accompanied the U. S. Fish Commission
steamer Fish Hawk for three months, while making surveys of oyster-
beds in Long Island Sound and on the coast of North Carolina. The
number of accessions recorded was 32, embracing 6,750 specimens.
The contributions made by the Fish Commission included 56 species
of Brachyurans and Anomourans, dredged by the Fish Commission
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

steamer Albatross, chiefly in the Pacific Ocean; a collection of Brachy-
urans, obtained by the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus, from
the Gulf of Mexico; a large series of specimens of the genus Panopeus.
Large and valuable collections were also received from the British
Museum, London; the Imperial Museum of Natural History, Berlin;
the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Copenhagen; Dr. EH. A. Andrews, of
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.; and Prof. H. A. Ward,
Rochester, N. Y. Several sets of duplicate specimens for exchange
and for distribution to educational establishments were prepared and
sent out. Mr. Benedict, assisted by Miss Rathbun, has continued his
studies upon the Brachyurans and Anomourans, This collection is one
of the largest and mostimportant of the kind that has ever been brought
together. It represents all parts of the world, and is especially rich in
forms from the coasts of the United States.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The curatorship of this department has been transferred to Dr. Frank
Baker, who, owing to the duties of his position as acting manager
of the National Zodlogical Park, is at present unable to devote any
time to its work. The management of the affairs of the department
has therefore devolved upon Mr. Frederic A. Lucas, assistant cura-
tor. A considerable portion of his time has been devoted to the
preparation of a plan for a synoptic exhibition series of invertebrates.
The mounting and installation of specimens has also been pushed for-
ward. He has made a study of the osteology of the family Paride and
some of its allies. Mr. Lucas has also studied the osteological and other
anatomical characters of the Trochilida, and the results are incorporated
with the paper on Humming birds, prepared by Mr. Ridgway, curator
of birds, and published in the Museum report for 1890.*

The most important accessions during the year were a small collec-
tion of North Bornean birds, and a collection of birds from the Pribylov
Islands.

During the year 655 specimens were added to the collection.

FOSSILS (PALEOZOIC).

From the report of Mr. C. D. Walcott, honorary curator, the year’s
work shows much progress, both in the development of the collection
and the installation and labeling of specimens. A large amount of ma-
terial has been received from the U. S. Geological Survey. Two im-
portant accessions were obtained during the year from the Geological
Survey of Sweden, and from Mr. Thomas Ruddy, of Wales. The latter
collection is from the Bala series of rocks. The number of entries dur-
ing the year was 215, comprising 615 specimens. Notices of the papers
published during the year by the curator and others attached to this
department, and based upon Museum material, will be found in the Bib-
lography (Section ry).

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39
INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (MESOZOIC).

Dr. C. A. White, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, is still in charge of
this department as honorary curator. His connection with the Survey
renders it impossible for him to devote much of his time to Museum
work. The collection of this department is steadily increasing, and
is now in better condition for examination and study than hitherto.
It has not yet been found practicable to separate the specimens into
reserve, duplicate, and exhibition series.

During the year, 1488 entries, embracing 8,449 specimens, have been
made in the catalogue.

DIVISION OF BOTANY.
FOSSIL PLANTS.

Prof. Lester F. Ward, of the U.S. Geological Survey, continues to
act as honorary curator of this department. He states that the work
of the year has been chiefly confined to the imstallation and care of
specimens, the collection being now in excellent condition for study.
The most important accessions are a collection of Dakota plants, sent
by Prof. F. H. Snow, of the University of Kansas, and the collection
given by Capt. Charles E. Bendire, comprising 700 specimens. Mr,
David White, assistant, has been engaged in work on the carbonifer-
ous plant collections and in preparing a_ bibliography of paleo-
botany. Myr. Charles 8. Prosser has devoted his time largely to the
preparation of a paleo-botanical species index. Mr. F. H. Knowlton,
assistant curator, made collections of fossil wood and plant-remains in
the Gallatin Valley, Montana. He has also continued his studies on
fossil wood, and has in preparation a paper on paleozoic woods.. Prof.
William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia, has completed his
studies of the Potomac flora.

RECENT PLANTS.

There has been considerable growth in this department during the
year, the number of mounted sheets added to the National Herbarium
being 50 per cent more than during last year. Dr. George Vasey,
Botanist of the Department of Agriculture, continues his valuable
services as honorary curator of the National Herbarium. Dr. Vasey has
been assisted by Mr. Fred. Coville, who has made many valuable col-
lections in the field, and has also materially aided in the work of arrang-
ing and classifying specimens. The accessions received during the year
number 622, including a most valuable collection of 10,000 specimens
gathered by Edward Palmer in western Mexico, from the States of
Sonora and Colima; a collection of 1,740 specimens from the Death
Valley region of California, from Arizona, and Nevada, obtained by
Mr. Coville and Mr. Frank Funston; a large collection of mosses and

hepatic, numbering over 2,000 specimens, from Dr. L. M. Under-
wood, and a collection of 2,318 plants from Minnesota, transmitted by
Dr. G. H. Sandberg. The total number of plants received during the
year from all sources was 40,963. This number, added to 39,654, which
represents the total number of specimens received in the Museum up
to June 50, 1890, gives the total number of plants now in the National
Museum. The number of specimens mounted and added to the collec-
tions during the year is 8,945, and the number of specimens distributed
8,059. A list of the botanical papers published by the curator and by
other collaborators will be found in Section Tv of this report.

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.
MINERALS.

The growth of this department, under the honorary curatorship of
Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist of the U.S. Geological Survey, has
been satisfactory, although no very large additions were made to the
collections. The routine work of cataloguing and labeling specimens
occupied much of the time of the assistant curator, Mr. W. 8. Yeates.
A nearly complete rearrangement of the systematic exhibition series was
carried out. Only three accessions of great importance have been re-
ceived, namely, 171 Russian minerals presented by Mrs. Mary I. Stroud;
53 Freiberg minerals received in exchange from the Royal Saxon Mining
School; and a superb series of specimens from the Broken Hill mines,
in Australia, given by Mr. Walter J. Koehler, and embracing speci-
mens of native copper, native silver, cerussite, cerargyrite, dyscrasite,
and chrysocolla. The gem collection of the late Prof. Joseph Leidy,
containing about 400 cut stones, was purchased for use in connection
with the proposed exhibit of the Museum at the World’s Columbian
Exposition. The number of entries made during the year was 1,132,
including 7,515 specimens.

GEOLOGY.

Work in the department of geology has been largely confined to the
economic section, and a rearrangement and classification of the material.
The contributions of Mr. J. H. Huntington, Hyde Park, Mass.; Mr. F. W.
Crosby, Washington, and Mr. J. P. Iddings, U. S. Geological Survey, were
among the most important of those received during the year. A large lot
of onyx inarble from the newly discovered deposit near Prescott, Ariz.,
was received from Mr. William O’Neil.

A special feature of the work of this department consists in the
identification of specimens sent for examination and report, no less than
132 lots of specimens having been assigned to this department for this
purpose during the year.

A change in the method of installation was effected during the year
by the introduction of bent-wire brackets, the specimens being inclined
at an angle of 60 or 80 degrees,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

Owing to the pressure of routine work no special researches have
been undertaken by the curator. References to the papers published
during the year relating to this department will be found in Section
Iv of this report. The collections have been frequently consulted by
students, and in certain instances material was lent for study.

G.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.
REGISTRATION AND STORAGE.

The registrar, Mr. S. C. Brown, has submitted a carefully prepared
report of the work accomplished in this department. The total number
of incoming packages of all kinds during the year is 33,686, constitut-
ing 2,841 entries on the transportation record of incoming packages.
Of this number 572 contained specimens for the National Museum, the
remainder being intended for the Institution, the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges, the National Zodlogical Park, and the National Mu-
seum. Therecord of outgoing packages for the year bas taken up 1,025
entries, embracing 1,967 packages of various kinds. The accession
record for the year shows 1,187 entries, in addition to 452 lots of speci-
mens transmitted forexamination and report. The index to the lists of
Specimens sent for ‘examination and report,” and the ‘+ department”
index to the accession list in Section V of this report, show the dispo-
sition of the accessions among the departments of the Museum.

The distribution of ethnological, geological, zodlogical, and other edu-
cational institutions has been continued as far as practicable, and 130
educational establishments at home and abroad have been supplied
with duplicates from the collections. Numerous exchanges of speci-
mens have been completed. Many applications for mineral and geo-
logical specimens still remain unfilled. Duplicate collections of birds’
skins, fishes, and rocks are now being prepared for distribution.

The following statement indicates by geographical arrangement the
recipients of the duplicate specimens and the character of the material
distributed.

The registrar has completed an alphabetical index of the distribu-
tions since 1874, which includes more than 6,700 shipments. A card
catalogue, arranged by names of recipients, has also been prepared,
showing the distributions of specimens made to each museum, college
or individual. This catalogue is very useful, showing at a glance the
relations of this kind which have existed between the National Museum
and the establishments referred to on the cards. The file containing
the papers relating to the distribution of specimens has been amplified
and improved, and is now in excellent condition for reference.

It may be interesting to compare the total amount of distributions
made during the decade ending in 1880 with the total for the decade
completed last year. These figures are given in the following table,
showing an inerease of about 60 per cent in favor of the more recent
decade:

42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.
LIBRARY.

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, furnishes the following information re-
garding the operations of the library during the year:

The total number of publications added to the library during the year
was 12,854 (922 volumes of more than 100 pages, 2,492 pamphlets, 9,280
parts of regular serials, and 160 charts). Of these, 424 volumes, 883
pamphlets, and 6,413 parts of serials were retained for the use of the
Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution. The re-
mainder were obtained by gift, exchange, and purchase.

The largest gift to the library during the year was from the Rey. John
Croumbie Brown, of Haddington, Scotland, and consisted of the pro-
fessional library of his late brother, Dr. Samuel Brown. Dr. Brown,
who has been called “ the last of the alchemists,” was born in Scotland
in 1817. He devoted himself at an early age to the study of chemistry.
His attention was especially attracted to the ultimate problems of the
science, and he became persuaded that the elements usually regarded
as chemically simple and primary were transmutable into each other.
He was a poet and essayist as well as a chemist, but his time was chiefly
spent in his laboratory, and at the time of his death, in 1856, he believed
that he was very near to the point of demonstrating the great funda-
mental theory, in which his own faith had never wavered. His library,
consisting of 150 volumes and 8 pamphlets, contains many rare and

valuable old works on chemistry aud physics, and will be kept by itself
in the hbrary under the name of the “ Samuel Brown Collection.”

An important donation was received from Dr. Charles A. White,
U.S. Geological Survey, honorary curator of the section of mesozoic
fossils, consisting of 106 volumes, 82 parts, 50 pamphlets, and 5 maps.

The work of entering and cataloguing the Rau Memorial Library has
at last been completed. This collection, as finally catalogued, com-
prises 1,609 titles.

An excellent beginning has been made on the much-needed subject
catalogue. This now consists of 1,858 cards, arranged according to the
decimal classification in general use among libraries.

Three new sectional libraries have been added to the list during the
year, hamely: Aéronautices (authorized by order of the secretary, June
19), in charge of Mr. G. E. Curtis; astronomy, in charge of Mr. W. C.
Winlock; and reptiles and batrachians, in charge of Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger.

The number of books assigned to the sectional libraries is as follows:

Administration.—205 volumes. 6 parts, 58 pamphlets, and 1 chart.

Aéronautics.—(Now being organized. )

Astronomy.—9 volumes, 580 parts, 3 pamphlets.

Birds.—534 volumes, 252 parts, 49 pamphlets, 5 charts.

Editor.—628 volumes, 538 parts, 46 pamphlets.

Hihnology.—o47 volumes, 201 parts, 16 pamphlets, and 1 chart.

Fishes.

Geology.—522 volumes, 547 parts, 365 pamphlets, and 48 charts.

87 volumes, 24 parts, 8 pamphlets.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

Insects.—430 volumes, 907 parts, 217 pamphlets.

Mammatls.—204 volumes, 310 pamphlets.

Marine Invertebrates.—7 volumes, 44 pamphlets, 118 charts.

Materia medica.—223 volumes, 215 parts, 18 pamphlets.

Mesozoic fossils.—31 volumes, 2 pamphlets.

Mineralogy, 4.—183 volumes, 418 parts, 8 pamphlets.

Mineralogy, B.—74 volumes, 69 pamphlets, 1 sheet.

Mollusks and Cenozoic fossils.—105 volumes, 274 parts, 93 pamphlets.

Oriental archwology.—190 volumes, 398 parts, 112 pamphlets.

Plants, recent and fossil.—331 volumes, 1,437 parts, 261 pamphlets.

Prehistoric anthropology.—b62 volumes, 80 parts, and 24 pamphlets, in addition to
the Rau Memorial Library of 1,609 titles.

Reptiles and batrachians.—9 volumes, 51 parts, 1 pamphlet. (Partly organized.)

Transportation and engineering.—s4 volumes, 438 parts, 4 pamphlets.

It was hoped that Congress would provide for binding the accumulated
books belonging to the Museum library, but the appropriation asked
for was not granted. The usual application was therefore made to Mr.
Spofford, Librarian of Congress, for an order to bind some of the books
belonging to the Smithsonian deposit now in use at the Museum, and
Mr. Spofford with his usual kindness at once furnished an order for
binding 300 volumes. By taking advantage of a time of the year when
work at the Government bindery was least pressing, it was possible to
have these books away from the library a comparatively short time only.

Mr. N. P. Scudder has made great improvement in the condition of
the crowded periodical room. The construction of 480 feet of shelving
has enabled him to arrange the books in much more accessible shape,
and also to adopt something in the way of a classification, making the
finding of periodicals much more convenient than formerly. Never-
theless, the rate of growth of the library is so large that the value of
this additional shelf-room is almost neutralized by the greater number
of accessions during the year.

SPECIMENS SENT TO THE MUSEUM FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT*
DURING THE YEAR.

A large number of specimens are received every year for examination
and report. A record is kept of each package, and when the specimens
are considered worthy of addition to the Museum collections, they are so
recorded and given an accession number. About 450 lots (797-1247)
have been received for examination and report during the fiscal year
covered by this report. The specimens are examined by the curator in
charge of the department to which they relate, and he submits a state-
ment regarding them, which is forwarded to the sender, or used in pre-
paring areply. A list is given below:

ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES, Philadelphia, Pa.: Two specimens of snakes.
(Returned.) 1242 (v1).

- * The first number in the items included in this list relates to the record of spec-

imens sent for examination and report. The number in parentheses relates to the ree-

ord of permanent accessions. The third, in roman, and also in parentheses, relates

to the department in the Museum to which the specimen was referred.

PUBLICATIONS.

In the report of the National Museum for 1889 the subject of the
publications ot the National Museum is treated at some length. It is
therefore not considered necessary to review in extenso this branch of
the work in this report.

It is proper to remark that the work of issuing the publications of
the Museum is now being more punctualiy performed than heretofore.
The report for 1889 has been published, and the report for 1890 has
been in type for several months. Volume x1 of Proceedings of the
National Museum (for 1890) is in type, and all the papers of volume
xIv (for 1891) have been issued separately and distributed, although
the volume in bound form has not yet appeared.

In the case of the “ Bulletin,” No. 38 has been published during the
last fiscal year, and some of the parts of Bulletin 39 are now being dis-
tributed. Before long Bulletins 40, 41, and 42 will be published.

During the last session of Congress an appropriation of $15,000 was
made for printing the report and other publications of the Museum,
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

being an increase of $5,000 over the preceding year. This will render
possible a somewhat wider distribution of the ‘“ Proceedings” and
“ Bulletin,” though the increased number of copies is still far from suf-
ficient to meet all legitimate demands.

REPORTS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM,

The Museum report for 1888 was issued during the current year, and
those for 1889 and 1890 are now in type. The delay in issuing the last
two reports has been occasioned by the overcrowded condition of the
Government Printing Office and the increased amount of engray-
ing needed for these reports. The report for 1888 contains xxii + 876
pages. The following special papers, based upon collections in the
Museum, are published in this report:

1. The Coast Indians of Southern Alaska and Northern British Columbia. By Lieut.
Albert P. Niblack, U.S. Navy.

2. A catalogue of the Hippisley collection of Chinese Porcelains, with a sketch of the
history of the ceramic art in China. By Alfred E. Hippisley (of the Imperial
Chinese customs service).

3. The expedition to Funk Island, with observations upon the history and anatomy
of the Great Auk. By Frederic A. Lucas.

4, Fire-making Apparatus in the U.S. National Museum. By Walter Hough.

5. The collection of Korean mortuary pottery in the U. 8. National Museum. By
Pierre Louis Jouy.

6. A study of prehistoric anthropology. By Thomas Wilson. °

7. Ancient Indian matting, from Petit Anse Island, Louisiana. By Thomas Wilson.

8. Results of an inquiry as to the existence of man in North America during the
paleolithic period of the stone age. By Thomas Wilson.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The papers published in the “ Proceedings ” consist chiefly of tech-
nical descriptions of specimens, prepared by the curators of the National
Museum or by other investigators, founded upon the collections in the
National Museum. Vol. x1 of the “ Proceedings” was issued in No-
vember, 1890, although a few unbound copies were printed before the
end of the previous fiscal year. It contains 686 pages (23 plates, 19
text figures) and embraces 32 papers by 26 authors, 10 of whom are
connected with the National Museum. A list of the papers is given
on pp. 54-56 of the last report. The papers relate to the following sub-
jects:

Bulletin 38, which was put in type during the preceding fiscal year,
was received from the Public Printer on July 25, 1891. This bulletin,
consisting of 227 pages, is entitled ‘Contributions towards a monograph
of the Insects of the Lepidopterous family Noctuidee of Temperate North
America—Review of the species of the genus Agrotis,” by John B.
Sinith.

The manuscript of Parts A, B, C, D, and E of Bulletin 39 were sent
to the Public Printer in May and June, 1891, but none of these parts
were issued until after July 1. This bulletin under the general title
“Instructions to Collectors” will be published in parts as fast as
printed, and the parts may finally be combined and issued as one or
more bound volumes. ‘The papers to be included, thus far prepared,
are as follows:

Part A, Directions for collecting specimens of birds. By Robert
Ridgway. Part B, Directions for collecting fossil and recent plants.
By F. H. Knowlton. Part C, The preparation of rough skeletons.
By F. A. Lueas. Part D, Directions for collecting birds’ eggs. By
Capt. Charles Bendire. Part E, Directions for collecting reptiles and
batrachians. By Dr. Leonhard Stejneger.

The manuscript of Bulletin 40, Bibliography of George N. Lawrence,
and of Bulletin 41, Bibliography of Dr. Charles Girard, was sent to the
Public Printer on May 28.

The manuscript of “Special Bulletin No. 1”—the first quarto publica-
tion undertaken by the Musetuin—was sent to the Public Printer early in
May, and 184 printed pages were revised before July 1. This bulletin
is by Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S. Army, and is entitled ‘ Life Histories
of North American Birds, with special reference to their breeding habits
and eggs.” This work will be illustrated with chromo-lithographic
plates.

The first annual report of the American Historical Association (1889)
was printed during the year, and the report for 1890 was transmitted
to the printer. This association was founded in 1884 for the promotion

of historical studies and the collection and preservation of historical
manuscripts. By act of Congress in January, 1839, the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution were authorized to permit the Association to
deposit its collections in the Museum,

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects have been pub-
lished by officers of the Museum and other specialists. These are for
the most part based on collections in the Museum, and are referred to
by title in the Bibliography, constituting Section Iv of this report.
The authors of these papers are seventy-nine in number, thirty-three of
whom are connected with the Smithsonian Institution or the National
Museum. The papers number three hundred and forty-six, and relate

National Dairy and Food Commissioners’ Association, January 14 and 15,
National Geographic Society, March 13, April 10, April 24, May 1, May 29.
National Academy of Sciences, April 21.

The usual course of Saturday lectures was omitted this year. Mr.
Thomas Wilson, curator of prehistoric anthropology, gave a series of
eightlectures. The first four lectures related to art and architecture of
prehistoric times. These were delivered on February 4, 7, 11, 14.
The other four were as follows: May 13, Prehistoric Anthropology at
the French Exposition. May 16, Ancient Industries, Charms and
Amulets (illustrated); May 21, History of Human Habitations (illus-
trated); May 23, Anthropological Congresses and Prehistoric Mu-
seums,

STUDENTS.

It has always been one of the aims of the National Museum to aid
students and others engaged in scientific work by lending them mate-
rial to be used in connection with their scientific researches. The fol-
lowing statement has reference to the more important transactions of
this kind during the year: skins, alcoholics, and skulls of North Ameri-
ean rodents were sent to Dr. Jd. A. Allen, American Museum of Natural
History, New York; a series of bats to Dr. Harrison Allen, Philadel-
phia, Pa.; skulls of otters and badgers to Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S.
Army, Fort Snelling, Minn.; bird-skeletons to Dr. R. W. Shufeldt,
Takoma Park, D. C.; bird-skins to Mr. George N. Lawrence, New York
city, N. ¥.; South American Devonian fossils to Prof. J. M. Clarke,
Albany, N. Y.; turtles to Dr. G. Baur, Clark University, Worcester,
Mass.; fishes to Prof. D. S. Jordan, Bloomington, Ind.; invertebrate
fossils to Dr. W. B. Clark, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.;
mammal-skins to Walter E. Bryant, California Academy of Sciences,
San Francisco, Cal.; geological material to the Geological Survey of
Arkansas; crustaceans to Prof. H. A. Ward, Rochester, N. Y.; stone
implements to the Bureau of Ethnology, W ashington, D.C.; bird-skins
to William Brewster, Cambridge, Mass.; rocks to Prof. H. D. Campbell,
of Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Va.; bird-skins to C.
B. Cory, Boston, Mass.; bird-skins to American Museum of Natural
ee New York; clays and earth to Dr. A. M. Edwards, Newark,
N.J.; lizards to Prof. E. D. Cope, Philadelphia, Pa.

Several students have availed themselves of the privilege of exam-
ining the collections in the Museum. Dr. George K. Cherrie, orni-
thologist of the Costa Rica National Museum, has examined the collec-
tion of Costa Rica birds, and a similar opportunity was also afforded
to Mr. Charles A. Keeler, of Berkeley, Cal., while engaged in a special
investigation of the origin of color in birds. Dr. O. P. Hay, of Irving-
ton, Ind., spent several weeks in the department of reptiles and

batrachians, studying the material bearing upon the herpetology of
Indiana.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES BY CURATORS AND OTHERS.

The curators of the Museum in addition to their regular duties have
made special studies of the collections under their charge, and these
investigations have resulted in the publication of several important and
interesting papers in the publications of the Smithsonian Institution
and the National Museum. During the first three years of the oecu-
paney of the Museum building, or from 1881 to 1884, the Reports of the
Museum were very limited in extent, owing to the fact that the collee-
tions had not been properly arranged for study; but during and since
1884 a large number of special studies of collections have been made
both by the curators and by collaborators of the Museum. These re-
sults have been for the most part published in the Annual Reports and
in the “‘ Proceedings” of the Museum. The following list represents
the papers published in the Museum reports, commencing with 1884;

HEATING AND LIGHTING.

The appropriation for heating and lighting, 1891, is $12,000. Fol-
lowing are the disbursements:

For salaries or compensation, $5,084.91; coal and wood, $2,766.96;
gas, $1,233.84; electric supplies, $905.68; electric work, $7.50; tele-
phones, $604.40; rental of call boxes, $100; heating supplies, $448.95;
traveling expenses, $5.42, making a total of $11,157.66, and leaving on
hand a balance of $842.54 to meet outstanding liabilities.

In addition to the items mentioned in the detailed list, much work
of a general nature has been accomplished, and while the routine has
not differed materially from that of former years, the total amount ex-
pended for services is somewhat less than that of last year.

Frequent repairs in the large flat roof of the Museum building have
been necessary, and pending the anticipated laying of a granolithie
pavement, the floors have been patched in many places; the trenches
beneath the Museum have been thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed
and the electric wires therein put in order, so far as possible; the
north balcony has been painted and the walls calecimined, and in the
rooms adjacent to the eastern entrance, and in the baleony and stair-
way above them, the walls have been calcimined and the woodwork
painted.

The moving of the heavy exhibits, which occasionally becomes neces-
sary in order to place suitably in the series the valuable objects which
from time to time come into possession of the Museum, is an important
feature in the duty of the force. The articles, many of them of great
weight, must be handled with skill in order to prevent injury to them-
selves, to other objects, or to the building. The superintendent has
placed rollers under the large cases, which serve to remove them
from any dampness of the floor, and allow them to be moved with all
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

the facility possible under the circtunstances, and in changing the po-
sition of the engine “ John Bull,” it was found necessary to construct a
railway track for the purpose.

It is worthy of mention that the painters in the superintendent’s
force are frequently called on to trace, color, and letter the large charts
and maps required by the different curators, or used in illustrating the
scientific lectures given in the Museum hall.

3y economy of administration, the Museum has been able to increase
its insufficient electric-light plant, so that now it has a small dynamo,
which supplies twenty-five are lights, of 2,000 candle power each. This
is only about one-half the number required for a satisfactory illumina-
tion, but by screening off the courts it was found possible to light the
halls so that the building could be opened for the admission of the
American Medical Association on the evening of May 7, and for the
National Geographic Society on the evening of May 29, 1891.

With the limited means available, no elaborate form of installation of
the electric-light plant could be adopted, and it was necessary to pass
the wires loosely from burner to burner around the building. It is
hoped that a future appropriation will make it possible to remedy the
defects in the present system, and will permit the purchase of a dynamo
of such power that the whole building can occasionally be thrown open
at night, for the accommodation of those who can not avail themselves
of the regular hours of admission, as well as for the various scientific
associations of Washington and the country, as often earnestly re-
quested.

The changes found necessary in the heating apparatus, such as ad-
justing radiators, making connections with steam pipes, ete., have this
year, as last, been made by the regular force without outside help. Sev-
eral improvements in the boiler room, among which may be mentioned
inclosing the pipes in a wooden casing, removing partitions and fitting
up the vault for dyamo used to run the system of electric lights in the
building, have been completed in the same way.

As stated in the report of last year, the boilers, especially those of the
Smithsonian building, have been for some time in an extremely wnsatis-
factory condition. Proposals have accordingly been invited for the pur-
chase and setting in place of new ones, and an appropriation of $3,000,
which becomes available at the close of the present fiscal year, has been
made by Congress for this purpose.

Mention was also made in my last report of the necessity for remoy-
ing the decayed wooden floors in the Museum and substituting therefor
granolithic or artificial stone pavement. Five thousand dollars having
been appropriated for this object, proposals for the necessary pavement
have been invited.

The appointment by the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of
Mr. J. M. Parkhurst as engineer, dates from December 1, 1890. In
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

deciding this appointment, the Museum was much indebted to the
courtesy of Commodore Melville, U. S. Navy, who, in compliance with
the request of the Secretary, appointed Passed Assistant Engineer
Baird, and Assistant Engineer Norton, of the Navy, as a board to ex-
amine the candidates.

There were twenty-five applicants for the position, eight of whom
completed the examination. The questions, fifty-five in number, were
mostly on practical engineering and practical electric lighting. The
papers of Mr. Parkhurst reached a percentage of 83.81; those of
two other candidates, Mr. F. M. Stromberger and Mr. R. H. Speake
were but slightly less. The examining board pronounced the percent-
age reached by several of the competitors remarkable, considering the
character of the questions submitted.

The complicated nature of the duties connected with this position,
both in the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum, renders apparent
the necessity of having the appointment depend upon a competitive ex-
amination, which is a thorough test of ability.

In the autumn of 1890 permission was given by Mr. Clark, the archi-
tect of the Capitol, to remove from the crypt beneath the building the
original plaster model of the bronze statue by Crawford, which sur-
mounts the dome, and to deposit the same in the Museum.

The work of removing the fragments of this cast was begun in Octo-
ber, 1890. A brick and cement base was prepared in the center of the
rotunda and the erection and restoration of the statue were begun on
the Sth of December. The model, which had remained for nearly
thirty years in the basement of the capitol, was found to be so broken,
many of the more delicate parts being entirely gone, that its complete
restoration from the fragments seemed imposssible. In addition to
difficulties of this sort, in order to move and place safely in position
the immense pieces of the statue which remained intact, it was found
necessary to saw them carefully into smaller parts, which after being
lifted into place were securely reunited. Great interest was manifested
in the restoration, it being observed that many persons came regularly
to watch its progress, and it was a matter for congratulation when the
difficult work was finally satisfactorily completed. The restoring was
done by an employé of the Museum, Mr. Theodore Mills, gon of Clark
Mills, who in 1860 cast from this model, the statue in bronze for the
Capitol.

The preparation for the World’s Columbian Exposition has been begun
under the direction of Dr. Goode, representative of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and National Museum. As the most skillful workmanship is re-
quired in this connection, many of the best employés of the museum have
been transferred to the Exposition roll, and a few others of known efti-
ciency have been appointed.

Mr. R. E. Earll, who took part in the Fisheries Exhibition in London,

a
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

in 1882, in the World’s Cotton Exposition at New Orleans, in 1884, and
who was superintendent of the Museum display during the Centennial
Exposition of the Ohio Valley at Cincinnati, in 1888, has been made
chief special agent of the Smithsonian for the World’s Columbian
ixposition, and will devote his entire energy to the preparation and
installation of the Museum exhibit.

The wording of the bill making the appropriation for the Columbian
Exposition renders the employment of clerical help upon the Exposi-
tion roll virtually impossible, so that the necessary work of this class
must be done by the employés of the Museum. The preparation and
settlement of accounts, in this as in other recent expositions, will
devolve upon the clerks of this office, in addition to their other duties.

Many requests have been received this year, as in the past, from
museums, scientific associations, universities, colleges, etc., in this and
other countries, for information in regard to the Museum standard
cases, of various types, in compliance with which cyanotypes of the cases,
with details as to cost of construction, have frequently been sent out.
Among the institutions asking for information of this sort during the
year may be mentioned the American Museum of Natural History and
the Academy of the Sacred Heart, New York City; the College of Fine
Arts, Syracuse, N. Y,; the College Museum, Bloomington, Ind.; the
State University, lowa; the Academy of Natural Sciences, San Fran-
cisco; the University of Toronto, and the Royal Society of Northern
Antiquaries, Copenhagen.

In this connection I would note the fact that several new designs for
cases, Which prove highly satisfactory, have been made by the engineer
of property, and in some instances, by uniting the most desirable fea-
tures of different cases, others of a new pattern have been constructed
under the direction of Mr. Watkins, which prove admirably suited
to the purposes required.

The work of the Museum, which has been gradually but surely ex-
tending itself in various directions without a commensurate increase of
the force, has been accomplished only by the means of the most faith-
ful and energetic service on part of the employés, many of whom have
been frequently required to work beyond the regular hours. It should
be added that a request for such extra service has always been most
cheerfully complied with.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

The system adopted several years ago for conducting the correspond-
ence still prevails and has been found on the whole satisfactory. ‘This
division of the Museum is under the charge of Mr. R. 1. Geare, assisted
by a corps of stenographers and typewriters. The number of corre-
spondents of the Museum is constantly increasing.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR.
POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings, remains in charge
of this department, the employés of which consist of watchmen, paint-
ers, carpenters, laborers, cleaners, and attendants. Mr. ©, A. Steuart
is assistant superintendent. The force of carpenters number eight or
nine, who are kept continually busy constructing cases and shelves, re-
modeling old cases, making repairs to buildings, ete. Only two paint-
ers are kept constantly on the Museum roll, and their time is completely
occupied in keeping the buildings and fixtures in proper condition.

From the report of the superintendent the following statements are
quoted, in order to convey an idea as to the character of the work
accomplished in this department:

1890.

July.—A dynamo engine was placed in the engine room. <A connection of water
and gas pipe was made for the accommodation of the mammal department. Labor-
ers were engaged in remodeling the south entrance preparatory to making changes
in cases. shelving, and other appointments.

August.—A new gas engine torun the dynamo was placed in the engine room.
The lecture hall and the east balcony were cleared for the meeting and exhibit of
the Photographers’ Association. The marble statue of Daguerre was placed in the
rotunda and unveiled August 15. The collection of oriental antiquities was trans-
ferred from the west hall to the southeast corner of the north hall. The lecture hall
was put in order for the meeting of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists,
August 28.

September.—Numerous miscellaneous items of work were completed by the mechan-
ics. Mahogany table tops were placed in the exhibition hall of the Smithsonian
building. Steam pipes were altered and an extra pipe was placed outside of the
Natural History laboratory building for the department of mammals.

October.—F our large pine screens were placed in the east hall. The stairway of the
northwest pavilion was painted and the wall wainscoted. The original cast of the
Statue of Liberty was placed in the rotunda of the building.

cal Association December 31. The railing formerly around the boat hall was removed
and placed in the lecture hall. Owing to the cold weather two laborers were detailed
for special duty in the engine room. Plumbers were busy repairing leaks in sewer
pipes. A large radiator in the superintendent’s office was removed and a new one
substituted.

1891.

January.—The wires running from the boiler room to the various electric lights in
the Lear ae were inspected and repaired. The National Dairy and I’ood Commis-
sioners’ Association met in the lecture hall December 14. ‘The building was wired
for electric lights.

February.—The transportation exhibit in the eastern hall was rearranged, neces-
sitating the services of the greater part of the laboring force. Changes were made
in the boiler room, whereby considerable more room and space were gained. Two
large pine screens were made and placed at the entrance to the rotunda balcony in
the south hall.

March.—The rooms on the south side of the east entrance were newly painted.
The office rooms on the w est balcony were frescoed and painted. The large paint-
ing, “The March of Time,” by Henry Sandan, deposited by the artist, was placed
in thenorth hall. The basement of the Smithsonian building was thoroughly cleaned
and whitewashed.

April.—A large force of laborers was engaged in preparing an exhibit of patents
in the lecture hall, in connection with the ‘Patent Centennial celebration. Laborers ’
were engaged for several days in arranging lecture hall and office rooms for the meet-
ings of the National Academy of Science. The roof on the building at the west end
of the Smithsonian was removed. e

May.—tThe electric lights were placed in order for the visit of the Medical Con-
gress on May 7. The cases and material in the anthropological hall of the Smith-
sonian were entirely rearranged necessitating the detail of a large laboring force.
A leak m the gas main at the south entrance was repaired by the Museum plumbers
and laborers. A large shed was prepared for the taxidermists’ work.

June.—Twenty d-unit cases were removed from the west balcony to other depart-
ments of the Museum, being replaced by two large wall storage cases. A force of
laborers was engaged for several days in preparing the shed south of the Smithsonian
building for the taxidermists in connection with the World’s Fair. ‘The work of re-
moving the old roof from the chapel in the Smithsonian building is under way, requir-
ing a large force of laborers.

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.
TAXIDERMISTS.

In September, 1890, the force of taxidermists was reorganized. At
that time it consisted of only three regular taxidermists and one volun-
teer, and the number was not increased until the spring, when one
taxidermist was designated to take general charge of the work under
superintendence of the curator of mammals. The skins which had
accumulated in the vats, some 400 in number, were examined and
their exact condition (for mounting or addition to the reserve series)
was ascertained. A card-e¢atalogue of the entire collection of skins

yas prepared, detailed information regarding each skin being obtained.
In March, 1891, preparations were commenced for an exhibit of mam-
mals at the World’s Columbian Exposition. A plan was submitted and
approved, steps being tinmimediately taken to obtain the necessary mate-
rial for exhibition. The force of taxidermists was then increased and
a special workshop was fitted up for their use, Mr. William Palmer
being appointed chief taxidermist. The number of regular taxider-
mists was increased to six, and one special laborer was also added.

Collection of mounted domestic animals.—The work of mounting typi-
cal specimens of domestic birds has been continued by Ma. Nelson R.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. U7

Wood, who completed sixty-nine specimens during the year. The
mounting of most of these skins was a difficult task. A number of
alcoholic specimens were also mounted. The material development of
the collection of thoroughbred domestic fowls and pigeons, which was
increased by the addition of forty-four specimens, is largely due to the
energy and zeal of Mr. Wood, who has endeavored to show prominently
the distinguishing characteristics of the various breeds.

OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR,

Mr. F. A. Lueas, osteologist, states that the preparation of osteological
specimens for the exhibition and study series has made favorable progress.
Theamount of work accomplished is indicated in the following statement:

In addition, a number of specimens of vertebrate fossils were cleaned,
repaired, and mounted, molds and casts of combs made for domestic
birds, 13 rare and valuable eggs repaired, and 150 specimens arranged
for the synoptic series of invertebrates. The specimens of domesticated
animals and the small series contained in the taxidermic collection have
been completely rearranged and installed in new cases. Asin previous
years, Mr. Scollick has assisted in the preparation of vertebrate fossils
and other osteological material.

H.—ACCESSIONS.

Ten years ago the National Museum moved into its new building.
and the present year marks the close of a very important decade in its
history. The increase in the collections during this period has been
unexpectedly large, the accessions from all sources now numbering
3,028,738 specimens. In 1882, when the first census of the collections
was made, the total number of specimens was estimated at less than
200,000. The totally inadequate space provided for this vast aceumu-
lation of material has been so frequently commented upon in previous
reports, that 1t is not necessary to reiterate the recommendations to
Congress for another building.

The total number of accessions to the Museum during the year is
1,187 (Nos. 23,341—24,527), inclusive).

A geographical review of the more important accessions during the
year is here presented. This is preceded by a brief classified state:
ment showing the most valuable contributions of the year.

Marine Invertebrates; Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, as honorary curator of
Fishes, and Capt. J. W. Collins as honorary curator of Fisheries and
Naval Architecture have, through the courtesy of Col. MeDonald,
U.S. Commissioner of Fisheries, been continued.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The following contributions have been received from the bureau and
its officers:

A collection of enthnological and archeological material and speci-
mens of pottery was transferred to the Museum by Maj. J. W. Powell,
director.

From Dr. H. W. Henshaw was received a specimen of Ophibolus
rhombomaculatus, from Falls Church, Va.

Dr. J. W. Hoffman presented a model of Menomonee inedicine-man’s
grave with symbols; a crayon sketch of Oshkosh, and the great lodges
of the Menomonee tribe where funeral services are held over the medicine-
man on the anniversary of his death.

From Mr. James Mooney was received a pair of Cherokee ball sticks.

J.—REVIEW OF THE RESULTS OF THE COOPERATION OF
THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND BUREAUS
DURING THE DECADE ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.

When the enormous increase, during the last decade, in the extent
and importance of the Museum collections, from a scientific as well as
from a popular standpoint, is taken into consideration, if seems proper
to make special mention of the important results derived during that
period from the system of coéperation inaugurated many years ago
118 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

between the Smithsonian Institution and the various departments and
bureaus of the Government. The collections made by the Wilkes ex-
ploring expedition, the Perry expedition to Japan, and other naval
expeditions, and the material gathered by the scientific officers of the
Pacific Railroad survey, the Mexican Boundary survey, and the sur-
veys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the Army, constitute the
very groundwork of the collections, the nucleus upon which has been
built its present structure. Indeed, had it not been for this cobperation
on the part of the Government departments, the successful development
of the collections would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, with
the hmited resources at the command of the Museum. The friendly
interest displayed by officials at home and abroad, at all times and in
every capacity, not only when officially detailed but during the leisure
hours at their disposal, is worthy of the greatest praise and encourage-
ment. Nor has this interest been confined to any one bureau or depart-
ment. The friendly competition which has been engendered has aroused
to action officers in almost every bureau of each of the departments.
This interest has been shown not only in the collection of an enormous
amount of material, but in its proper preservation and careful trans-
portation to Washington, when collected.

The special ways in which this codperation on the part of the depart-
ments and bureaus of the Government has manifested itself, may be
thus enumerated :

(1) By assistance rendered to persons conducting investigations for
the Smithsonian Institution.

(2) By the direct effort of Government officials in making collections
for the National Museum, which is under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

(3) By the willingness of Government officials at distant points to
notify the Institution of the occurrence of remarkable specimens and
phenomena.

(4) By the transfer to the National Museum of collections which had
been deposited in one or another of the departments for safe-keeping.

(5) By assigning persons to the Smithsonian Institution for special
training, with a view to enabling them to observe accurately and to
collect intelligently when afterwards engaged in their regular duties.
(This is applicable chiefly to the Navy Department.)

(6) By transmitting to the Institution the results of observations as
well as collections made by officers, at their post of duty, in behalf of
the Institution.

(7) By assistance rendered in connection with the transportation of
collections to Washington.

(8) By the receipt of collections made by other departments of the
Government service, and studied and identified by officers of those de-
partments before being transferred to the custody of the Museum.

(9) By the detail of officers connected with various departments and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 119

bureaus of the Government, to act as honorary curators of collections
in the National Museum.

A brief résumé of the special manner in which each department has
contributed to the welfare of the National Museum, is here presented.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE.

The ministers, consuls, and other officers of the Department have
always shown a great willingness to further the interests of the National
Museum in foreign countries. Through the courtesy of the Depart-
ment letters of introduction to them have been furnished from time to
time, at the request of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
and they have frequently been requested by the Secretary of State to
aid persons collecting for the Museum. The Department has also
kindly indorsed and forwarded letters from the Institution to its minis-
ters and other officers, asking their coéperation in securing special
desiderata to fill important gaps in the Museum collections.

Valuable assistance has also been rendered by the State Department
in obtaining special facilities in connection with the exportation from
foreign countries of material intended for the Museum. Among the
most important accessions acquired through the codperation of the
Department and its officers may be mentioned the following: Speei-
mens of native handiwork from Western Afriea, sent by Mr. Smyth,
the United States minister at Liberia; a collection of samples of wool
from the Technological Museum at Sydney, New South Wales, through
Hon. G. W. Griffin, United States consul at Sydney; a collection of
antique copper, silver, and gold coins from Ceylon, Europe, the United
States, and South America, from Hon. William 'T. Rice, United States
consul at Horgen, Switzerland; a canoe similar to those in use by the na-
tives of Hawaii, presented by the Queen of Hawaii; specimensof iron ore
coal, and coke from Rio Grande de Sul; a collection of woolen, worsted,
silk, and cotton fabrics, gathered by Hon. W. F. Grinnell, United
States consul at Bradford, England; specimens, of sisal, through
Hon. Thomas J. McLain, United States consul at Nassau, West
Indies, and a piece of rope made of human hair and used in hoisting
building material in the construction of a Buddhist temple at Kyoto,
Japan, transmitted by Hon. John T. Swift, United States consul at
Tokio, Japan.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT.

The Treasury Department has extended its friendly offices in con-
nection with the free entry of material from abroad, and has greatly
aided the work of Museum investigators by allowing the free entry of
scientific outfits. Through the courtesy of the Department a valuable
collection of diamonds, pearls, and gold ornaments, which was presented
in 1840 to the United States Government by the Imaum of Muscat, and
120 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

had been kept in a vault in the Treasury Department witil 1887, when
it was transferred to the Musetim.

The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Reventie Marine Divi-
sion have frequently afforded special facilities to Museum explorers.
Valuable contributions of material and information have been made by
officers of the Light-House Board and the Life-Saving Service. Spe-
cialists sent out by the Museum have, through the courtesy of the
Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, been supplied with’
charts of the regions along the coast to be explored. In April, 1880,
Dr. Tarleton H. Bean was detailed to visit Alaska to collect fishery
statistics, fishes, birds, and other objects of interest. Through the
courtesy of the Coast Survey he was permitted to accompany the expe-
dition on the schooner Yukon, and was given all possible assistance and
facilities in making collections. More than eighty species of fishes and
fifty species of birds were obtained on that occasion. The Coast Survey,
in connection with the Smithsonian Institution, secured important
information as to the relative height of points upon the surface of the
North American continent. Mr. W. J. Fisher, who was stationed at
Kadiak, Alaska, gathered much valuable material relative to the man-
ners and characteristics of the native tribes. On the occasion of the
visit of Mr. Henry Elliott to the seal islands of Alaska, on business of
the United States Government, the Secretary of the Treasury kindly
permitted’ a taxidermist, selected by the Smithsonian Institution, to
accompany him for the purpose of collecting specimens for the Museum,
and extended important aid in facilitating the preservation of the mate-
rial secured.

The interest in the photographic exhibit of the Museum at the Cin-
cinnati Exposition was materially increased by a set of photographs
illustrating the methods of mounting prints, obtained through the
courtesy of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and
a collection of photographs of counterfeiters, illustrating the uses to
which photography has been applied in connection with the require-
ments of the Government service, was secured, through the kind
ottices of Mr. John 8. Bell, Chief of the Secret Service Division. An
interesting series of proofs of the current bonds and currency notes,
and of gold and silver certiticates, coupons, and registered bonds, was
presented by the Chief of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

In 1881, under instruction of the Treasury Department, through Mr.
EK. W. Clarke, Chief of the Bureau of Revenue Marine, Capt. Hooper, in
command of the revenue cutter Corwin, visited the Aretic coast. He
was instructed to take Mr. Nelson, an agent of the National Museum,
to St. Michaels, and give him an opportunity to visit St. Lawrence
Island for the purpose of collecting Eskimo objects. Mr. Nelson
obtained on the island, in addition to a fine collection of implements,
utensils, dresses, ete., a large number of crania, filling an important
deficiency in the Museum collections. In 1884 the Chief of the Bureau
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. gE |

of Revenue Marine, instructed its captains in Alaska to assist Myr.
James G. Swan in his explorations for the Institution, by receiving him
and his collections on board, whenever such action did not interfere
with the regular service of the vessels. The commander of the revenue
steamer Key West was instructed to assist Mr. Hemphill in carrying on
his explorations of the Florida Keys in behalf of the Museum. In
1885 the Corwin again visited the Arctic Ocean, and parties were sent
up the Kowak and other rivers emptying into Kotzebue Sound. Mr.
Charles H. Townsend, an experienced collector, accompanied the ves-
sel, and collected many interesting objects in ethnology and natural
history. During the year 1887 the assistance of the Revenue Marine
Division was asked in procuring for the Museum specimens of ‘ bi-
darkas” or Eskimo kyaks. Capt. Healy was requested to obtain speci-
mens on his next visit to Alaska, and upon his return six of these
objects were placed in the hands of the Alaska Commercial Company
for shipment to Washington.

A most important research into the natural history of the Atlantic
coast of the United States has been carried on by the Institution with
the cobperation of Mr. 8. I. Kimball, Superintendent of the Life-Saving
Service. In the early part of 1883, circulars from the Institution were
distributed by him, asking the keepers of life-saving stations for
telegraphic notification of the occurrence or capture of any remarkable
marine animal. This arrangement has been productive of many inter-
esting and valuable results. The specimens received are often of great
scientific importance, and it is hoped that the system may continue to
be as productive of good results in the future as it has been in the past.

The Light-House Board has extended aid by instructing the keep-
ers of light-houses and light-ships to make observations in regard
to the temperature of the air and water, as well as to notice the
occurrence of phenomena in connection with the migrations of marine
animals. The data accumulated from this source have been of the
utmost importance in connection with the general problems of ocean
physics, and have been used to great advantage in solving many
questions concerning the movements of fishes in relation to their
physical surroundings. The keepers were also instructed to note the
course of birds, especially as evidenced by their falling to the ground
after striking against the light-houses on dark nights. The Light-
House Board also kindly contributed to the Museum exhibit at the Cin-
cinnati Exposition an interesting collection of eyanotype prints, show-
ing the lights and flames used in the light-houses on the American
coast.

WAR DEPARTMENT.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of War and the Adjutant-
General of the Army, instructions were given to the commanders of
the military posts at Fort Keogh and Fort Maginnis, Mont., and Fort
a bey REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

McKinney, Wyo., to render all assistance in their power to Mr. Horna-
day, the chief taxidermist of the Smithsonian Institution, and his party
of assistants, who started in June, 1886, for Montana and Wyoming for
the purpose of securing specimens of buffalo. Mr. H. H. Rusby, a well-
known botanist of New Jersey, was engaged in 1880 in investigating
the botany, natural history, and archeology of New Mexico, and the
War Department furnished some important facilities to aid him in his
researches.

For many years the Secretary of War has permitted the quarter-
masters of the Army to forward from their posts boxes containing speci-
mens intended for the National Museum. The transportation of 4 liv-
ing buffaloes from Rapid City, S. Dak., to Washington, was greatly
facilitated by Lieut. Col. William B. Hughes, chief quartermaster, De-
partment of the Platte, at Omaha, Nebr., and by Capt.C. A. H. McCauley,
now depot quartermaster at Portland, Oregon. A mahogany gun ear-
riage, from the citadel of Santo Domingo City, was transmitted by Lieut.
Col. G. L. Gillespie, of Engineer Corps, U.S. Army. lmnportant assist-
ance in securing collections and information has also been rendered by
officers of the Army stationed at various posts throughout the country.
Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, while detailed as medical officer at Fort Wingate,
N. Mex., forwarded much interesting material and information.

Owing to the close relationship which had always existed between
the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Signal Service, the
codperation of the latter in the prosecution of scientific researches, par-
ticularly in Arctic America, has resulted in most important additions
to our knowledge of the natural history and ethnology of the countries
north of the United States. Especial service has been rendered in this
direction by Mr. Lucien M. Turner, who was detailed to Alaska by the
Signal Service. In addition to the valuable collections made by him,
he devoted much time to the study of the languages and customs of the
people of that country, of whom little had been previously known. He
also made many instructive and interesting observations relating to the
natural history and ethnology of Northern Labrador, where he was at-
tached to one of the Signal Service stations for several years. In 1886
it was found expedient to withdraw these stations from the outposts of
Alaska and other northern countries, and thus the Museum was cut off
from a most valuable field of research. Through the courtesy of Gen.
A.W.Greely, Chief Signal Officer, photographs of meteorological records
were contributed to the Museum exhibit at the Cincinnati Exposition,
and a Seechi meteorograph, two sections of Beck’s pantograph, and
Meyers’s autographic instrument, were added to the collection of scien-
tific apparatus in the Museum. The results of twenty-five years me-
teorological correspondence and research, which had been conducted
by the Smithsonian Institution, were transferred by it to the Signal
Office, in accordance with the time-honored practice of the Institution,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. hb

namely, to discontinue research in any subject which is covered by the
operations of any other branch of the service.

An arrangement has for several years been carried out with the
Surgeon-General of the Army, by which the Smithsonian Institution
transfers all its human crania to the Army Medical Museum, and re-
ceives in exchange skeletons and skulls of North American vertebrates.
An agreement was also entered into between the National Museum and
the Army Medical Museum, by which the latter undertakes to make
post-mortem examinations of animals in the flesh received by the
Smithsonian Institution, with the understanding that the Army Medi-
eal Museum retains the viscera of such animals, and returns the skele-
tons, unless otherwise specified, to the National Museum.

In 1888 several interesting objects were turned over to the Museum
by the War Department. Gen. 8S. V. Benét transmitted from the Ord-
nance Museum a plaster model of the equestrian statue of Gen.
McPherson; a section of an oak tree cut down by musket balls near
Spottsylvania court-house, Va., and presented to the War Depart-
ment by Gen. N. A. Miles, U. S. Army; and a Mexican saddle and
bridle, manufactured in Mexico for Gen. Trevino, commanding the
northern line of Mexico, and presented by him to Gen. Kk, O.C. Ord, U.
S. Army.

Valuable services have been rendered by Capt. Charles E. Bendire
and Dr. Henry ©. Yarrow, of the Army, as honorary members of the
Museum staff.

NAVY DEPARTMENT.

In 1881 the Navy Department expressed a desire to assign six re-
cently appointed midshipmen to the Smithsonian Institution for the
purpose of familiarizing themselves with the routine work of the scien-
tific departments in the National Museum, in order that they might be
able to take advantage of the training in case opportunity for natural
history research should arise in connection with their future service, and
also to enable them to perform the scientific duties for which the Navy
Department had been obliged to employ civilians. This proposition met
with the hearty approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and six young officers in the Navy, who had shown special liking
for scientific matters during their educational course, were detailed to
the Museum. They were instructed in taxidermic work and became
quite proficient in the preparation of skeletons and skins of birds and
mammals. Several of them also familiarized themselves with photog:
raphy. This experiment having proved satisfactory, twelve other
junior officers were assigned tothe Museum. During the last few years
the Department has found it inconvenient to continue the arrangement.
While its discontinuance is to be regretted, there is no doubt that im-
portant results will be gained, both by the Navy Department and the
National Museum, from the scientific training which has been given to
these officers.
124 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891. ‘

Several collections have, indeed, been already obtained as a result of
the arrangement. Messrs. Dresel and Ackerman, the two ensigns as-
signed to the Smithsonian Institution, who were detailed by the Secre-
tary of the Navy to accompany the Yantie on her voyage to Lady
Franklin Bay in search of the Greely party, secured very valuable
representations of the ethnology and natural history of that region.
These have been turned over to the Museum and incorporated in the
collections. Ensign J. B. Bernadou, who was ordered to Corea in 1883
for the purpose of prosecuting explorations under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution, forwarded a large and valuable collection of
ethnological and zodlogical specimens, many of which were entirely
new to the Museum. An interesting series of ethnological and natural
history objects has been received from Lieut. W. EK. Safford. Lieut. A.
P. Niblack, during a cruise upon the Alaskan coast in 1888, secured an
extensive representation of the ethnology and zodlogy of that region,
and obtained material for an elaborate report upon the coast Indians
of Southern Alaska and Northern British Columbia, which was pub-
lished in the Report of the National Museum for 1888.

When Commander I. M. Green was detailed to determine the longi-
tudes of points in the Pacifie Ocean, he invited the codperation of the
Smithsonian Institution in making his work productive in results in
natural history as well as in physical science. Through his efforts a
large amount of valuable material was secured, and the Government
authorities at Tokio and the officers of the Natural History Museum at
Shanghai were induced to contribute collections to the Museum.

In November, 1885, Lieut. T. Dix Bolles was detailed for service in
the National Museum by the Secretary of the Navy, and was assigned
to the department of ethnology. He rendered valuable service in the
classification and arrangement of the Eskimo collections, which he eom-
pleted in 1888, when, to the regret of the Museum, he was recalled by
the Navy Department and assigned to active duty.

The Secretary of the Navy also rendered important service by detail-
ing the U.S. 8. Mohican to bring to the United States a collection of
stone images and archeological objects from Easter Islands. Rear-
Admiral Kimberly, of the Navy, forwarded a number of valuable eth-
nological specimens een Fa to the United States Government by
Malietoa, Mataafa, and other Samoan chiefs.

The scientific work of the United States Naval Observatory has nat-
urally brought about an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution,
and this codperation has been effective in connection with the trans-
mission of astronomical discoveries by telegraph. The Institution is
indebted to the Superintendent of the Observatory for the receipt of
telegraphic time at noon of each day, and a clock has been supplied,
fitted up under the direction of the OUR EMER by which the Observ-
atory corrects aberrations in time.

Dr. James M. Flint and Dr. H. G. Beyer, of the Navy, have rendered
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. : 125

valuable assistance as honorary curators of the section of materia medica
in the Museum.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.

The rapid growth of the museum collections in certain directions is
due in a large degree to the addition of material turned over to it by
the U.S. Geological Survey, after having served the purposes for which
it was collected. This material is gathered by trained collectors sent
out especially for the purpose, and has in most cases been carefully
described and labeled before it reaches the Museum. Large quantities
of rocks, minerals, ores, fossils, ete., have been forwarded annually by
the Survey. The Museum is also indebted to the Survey for the valuable
services rendered by the following gentlemenasmembersof the scientific
statf: Dr. C. A. White, in charge of mesozoic fossils; Mr. Charles D.
Walcott, incharge of paleozoic fossils; Mr. William H. Dall, in charge
of mollusks and tertiary fossils, with Dr. R. E. C. Stearns as adjunct
curator; Prof. O. C. Marsh, in charge of vertebrate fossils; Prof. Lester
F. Ward, in charge of fossil plants, with Mr. F. H. Knowlton as assistant
curator; and Prof. W. I. Clarke, in charge of minerals.

The Director of the Survey having organized a special department
of maps and charts, the Smithsonian Institution offered the use of
material comprising many thousands of sheets which had accumulated
during forty years. This offer was accepted by Major Powell, with the
understanding that the material would be properly classified and ar-
ranged, and remain at all time subject to the order of the Smithsonian
Institution.

A great mass of material, embracing more particularly the building-
stones, ores, combustibles, and forest timber of the United States, re-
sulted from the industrial collections of the census of 1880. These col-
lections represent complete series, as far as practicable, from all parts
of the country, and are rendered especially valuable to the Museum by
reason of the full and accurate descriptions which accompany the spee-
imens. ‘The collection of building and ornamental stones has been fur-
nished in this way with thousands of specimens of marble, granite,
sandstone, etc., and it is fair to assume that no established quarry in
the United States is unrepresented. The collection of ores, which is
also very extensive, contains representations from all the important
mines of the country. The specimens are accompanied by authoritative
reports upon their chemical and metallurgical properties, as well as
upon their economic value.

In 1883 the collection of Washington relics was transferred from the

-atent Office. It includes not only the old collection that had been on
view for so many years, but also a large number of objects purchased
some years ago by Congressional appropriation from Col, Lewis, and
never unpacked after their arrival in the city. This collection is one of
the most attractive to the visitors to the Museum, Through the cour-

tesy of the Commissioner of Patents specifications and patents illustrat-
ing the development of photography and the graphic arts in the United
States and in Germany have been obtained.

Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, the Commissioner of Education, presented a
series of very interesting publications relating to American educa-
tional history.

POST-OFFICH DEPARTMENT.

The Post-Office Department has contributed to the welfare of the
Museum, although in a less degree than the others. In 1887 it pre-
sented to the Museum a collection of United States postage stamps,
newspaper wrappers, stamped envelopes and newspaper stamps, num-
bering one hundred and seventy specimens. Through the courtesy of
the Postmaster-General, the superintendent of the Dead-Letter Office
has been instructed to inform the Museum of the receipt in his office of
objects received which might be of value to the collections.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

By far the largest part of the National Herbarium has been in the
custody of the Department of Agriculture since 1869, when, at the re-
quest of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Commissioner
of Agriculture consented to house the material received either direct
or through the Smithsonian Institution, and to permit the botanist of
the Department to bestow as much time upon the collection as was
necessary in order to keep it in a good state of preservation. The Na-
tional Herbarium has for many years been under the charge of Dr,
George Vasey, botanist of the Department of Agriculture. In later
years the curator of fossil plants in the National Museum found it de-
sirable to have available for his use, in comparing recent with fossil
forms, a limited number of specimens within easy access, and in this
way a second collection of recent plants has sprung up, both, however,
forming parts of the National Herbarium, which will be transferred
wholly to the care of the Museum, as soon as it shall be found practi-
cable to provide proper accommodations for the collection. In 1886,
Prof. C. V. Riley, entomologist of the Department, and honorary cura-
tor of the department of insects in the National Museum, gave his collee-
tion of North American insects, representing the results of hisown labors
for more than twenty-five years. This collection is by far the most im-
portant accession which the department of insects has ever received.
The Museum is indebted to the Department of Agriculture for the vol-
unteer services of the following named gentlemen as honorary members
of the scientific staff: Prof. C. V. Riley, in charge of the department of
insects; Dr. B. I. Fernow, in charge of the section of forestry; Dr.
George Vasey, in charge of the department of botany, and Prof. W. O.
Atwater, in charge of the section of foods.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. E20
U. S. FISH COMMISSION.

Exceedingly important contributions have been received yearly from
the U.S. Fish Commission. Large quantities of material, embracing
fishes, mammals, reptiles, batrachians, insects, birds, birds’ eggs, fos-
sils, plants, and geological and archeological objects, have been trans-
mitted to the Museum by the Commission, as the results of expeditions.
Important contributions to our knowledge of the fauna of the West
Indies have been made by the steamer Albatross. Searches made for
new fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of New-
foundland and the adjoining region, abounded in results of great prac-
tical as well as scientific value. Explorations along the entire Atlantic
coast of North America, from the Grand Bank of Newfoundland to the
southern part of Florida and the Bahamas, produced results of biologic
importance. Dr. Tarleton H. Bean explored the waters adjacent to Long
Island, and succeeded in making some interesting scientific and prac-
tical discoveries. Mr. Charles H. Townsend made extensive explora-
tions on the coast of California, and obtained valuable statistics in
regard to the fisheries of the Pacific coast. He also visited Mount
Shasta and carefully noted the distribution of animal life.

Through the courtesy of the Commissioner of Fisheries two employés
of the Museum were permitted to accompany the schooner Grampus on
its trip to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1887, for the purpose of investi-
gating the natural history of that region, and especially of securing
remains of the Great Auk. Suecess attended their efforts, and a large
amount of material was secured.

The Museum is indebted tothe Commission for the valuable services
rendered by Mr. Richard Rathbun, as honorary curator of marine inver-
tebrates; Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, as honorary curator of fishes, and Capt.
J. W Collins, as honorary curator of fisheries and naval architecture.

K.—HXPLORATIONS.

The material which has been received by the National Museum dur-
ing the year, as a result of the work of the various collectors, who were
either commissioned by the Museum to gather specimens or who
offered their services, has greatly enriched the collections.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Treasury, who com-
missioned Mr. Henry W, Elliott, of the Smithsonian Lustitute, to visit
Alaska in the interest of the seal fisheries, a taxidermist of the Museum
was allowed to accompany Mr. Elliott, Mr. William Palmer being se-—
lected for that duty. The results of this trip were highly gratifying,
and valuable assistance was rendered by Capt. W. C. Coulson, of the
U.S. Revenue Marine steamer Rush. The coliections included a fine
specimen of walrus, the first obtained by the Smithsonian Institution
from Walrus Island since 1857, This was transmitted by Capt. Coul-
128 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

son, Collections of birds, birds’ eggs and skeletons, mammals, plants,
insects, crustaceans, shells, fossils, and fishes were also made.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, whose past services in Thibet have re esulted so
favorably in behalf of the Museum, contemplates another journey to
that region. Mr. Rockhill, in a letter dated June 5, writes as follows:

In compliance with your request that I would outline to you my proposed plan of
exploration in Thibet, I have much pleasure in submitting the following brief outline
of the work I am anxious to undertake.

Returning to the Koko-nor by the route I formerly followed (i. ¢., Peking, Hsi-
an-fu, Lan-chon-fu, Hsining) I would endeavor to go round Lake Koko-nor by the
south and thus complete my study of the eastern Thibetan tribes. After that, the
Ts’aidam Mongols, with whom [spent two months and over in 1889, would require
to be studied more fully as to their social relations and language.

After this preliminary part of the journey I would go to a 'Thibetan tribe three days’
march south of the source of the Yellow River, and claim the services promised to
me to travel towards Lh’ara on my former journey. Should I not be able to thus
reach that city, I have marked on the sketch maps I send herewith, two other routes,
either of which I could follow with great profit to my special studies, and neither
one of which presents insurmountable difficulties. Any one of the routes I propose
following in Thibet will lead me through inhabited regions of special interest to eth-
nography. The degree of culture of the tribes inhabiting them is lower than in any
other region of the country, save perhaps that between India and Thibet, but these
tribes are probably not of the pure Thibetan stock,

Mr. Rockhill has continued his interest in making collections for the
Museum. Among the contributions received from him is a map of
Peking; a specimen of popular Chinese cartography, Chinese Buddhist
book containing the Thibetan gospels, a fine collection of Chinese cloi-
sonnés, enamels, jlacquers, and bronzes, daggers and other weapons
(deposited), and many ethnological objects relating to Chinese modes
of living.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, Pa., has supplemented his pre-
vious collections by contributions of valuable material gathered in dif-
ferent parts of Africa, including a magnificent collection of weapons
and personal ornameuts of the Wa Chaga and Waisi negroes of the
Kilima-Njaro region,* ethnological specimens from the Chagga tribes
in the same locality, mammal skins and skulls, insects, specimens of
woods, plants, fishes, crustaceans, birds, birds’ eggs, birds’ skeletons,
fossils, and reptiles and batrachians, photographs taken in Kast Africa
showing natives, scenery, habitations, and objects belonging to native
jife, from Madagascar, Kilima-Njaro and the Seychelles Islands.

Mr. Héli Chatelain, of Vineland, N. J., has collected, during his
travels in Africa, a great variety of interesting objects. On his return
to the United States last year, he added many valuable objects to the
Museum collection. Among these may be mentioned a Sechuana Bible
(Pentateuch) used by Dr. David Livingstone in his journey from the

Cape of Good Hope to Loanda, West Africa. This book has Dr. Liv-

tions of Mr. Chatelain have been in western Africa, and from that
region the Museum has received from him mammals, ethnological ob-
jects, coins, textiles and foods, rocks, shells, fossils, insects, marine
objects, reptiles, birds’ nests, a specimen of hair taken from the head
of a MeBamba negro, and many articles used in the daily life of the
natives.

Capt. Frank Curling, of the Joseph S. Spinney, in a recent voyage,
found a dugout adrift about 210 miles off the Pelew or Paloa Islands
in the western Pacific Ocean. The boat contained 7 men, who had
started from the Pelew Islands on a fishing cruise. They were over-
taken by a storm and drifted out to sea, and were rescued by Capt.
Curling. The dugout was forwarded to the Museum by Capt. S. A.
Day, U.S. Army, Fort Mason, San Francisco, Cal., and attracts much
attention.

Mr. R. M. Bartleman, of the United States Legation at Caracas,
Venezuela, has continued his interest in the Museum. He has trans-
mitted, as the results of his explorations, through Prof. O. T. Mason,
some very interesting and valuable objects, among which are speci-
mens of pottery from the Island of Gran Roque, stone implements,
insects, shells, specimens of salt from the Salt Lakes of Cumana, a
snake, gourds, and Cicadex, used for medicinal purposes.

Mr. J. P. Iddings, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, collected for the
Museum on the island of Lipari, Mediterranean Sea, a volcanic bomb,
and a specimen of basalt with inclusion of vitrified sandstone, found
after the Etna eruption of 1886.

Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has added to the
collection, as a result of his recent explorations, faulted pebbles from
Pinnacle Pass, Mt. St. Elias, Alaska; specimens of iron ore from
Michigan and Alabama, coal from Vancouver Island, and ethnological
objects from Alaska.

Lieut. Charles F. Pond, U.S. Navy, during his travels in Guatemala,
collected and sent to the Museum specimens of grasshoppers and. fire-
flies.

Mr. P. L. Jouy, of the Museum staff, while on an exploring trip in
Arizona, collected for the Museum many valuable specimens of natural
history. Mr. Jouy is now in Mexico engaged in similar work.

The U.S. Fish Commission contributed to the Museum several new
and valuable collections of fishes gathered by the steamer Albatross on
the Pacific and by the schooner Grampus on the Atlantic coast.

Mr. Barton A. Bean, of the Museum staff, made a brief trip to Cape
St. Charles, Virginia, for the purpose of collecting the fishes of that
locality. He succeeded in obtaining several interesting specimens.

Rey. A. ©. Goode, now traveling in Africa, has signified his intention
to aid the Museum in the collection of ethnological material.

Hon. J. M. Crawford, consul-general at St. Petersburg, Russia, has

continued his work of collecting ethnological objects for the Museun,
Writing under date of January 13, 1891, he says:

“Tam getting on very nicely with the Finnish collection. In June I was all through
Finland, and I even began the Arctic Circle in the Frigid Zone. I gathered consid-
erable material, including curious old musical instruments, sacred Cantela, harp,
weighing implements, hand-mill, bronze instruments, stone axes, copper plates (used
for money), ancient jewelry, and an ancient Karelian costume of a peasant girl.
Next summer I will make my shipment to the Sinithsonian Lostitnution.”

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY
IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By Oris T. Mason, Curator.

The policy adopted in the formation of this department, to make all
its operations contributory to the instruction of the people and to the
advancement of anthropological science, has been steadily pursued. In
addition to the routine work of receiving additions to the collections
and caring for them, some important results have been accomplished,
which will be referred to in detail.

In August, 1890, the curator, in company with Mr. True and Dr.
Stejneger, commenced the preparation of a set of standard maps to be
used in labeling the case and specimens in the National Museum. The
work of this committee is now completed. It will add very much to the
efficiency of our method of installation to have the geographical distri-
bution of specimens indicated. In the Dresden Museum each specimen
or special group is accompanied with a map indicating the area over
which the species to which it belongs is spread.

The curator attended a meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in August, and utilized this opportunity to
interest those connected with museums and institutions in the States
in the methods of the National Museum, and to establish a friendly
relationship between these institutions and our own. The policy of
doing every thing to encourage the formation of local societies for the
purpose of carefully working up the archeology and natural history of
small sections, has been a very efficient means of enlarging the national
collections.

In September, 1890, the President of the United States created a
National Board on Geographical Names. This Board consists of repre-
sentatives from the several map-drawing departments of the Govern-
ment. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was requested to
appoint one from his staff to act in behalf of this Institution, and the
writer was invited by him to accept this position. The Board has held
monthly and special mectings, and many hundreds of names printed in
different spellings on the charts of the Hydrographic Office, the Coast
Survey, the Geological Survey, the Department of State, the Light-

135
136 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

House Board, the Land Office, the Post-Oftice Department, the Census
maps, ete., have been carefully studied and a uniform spelling adopted.
Two bulletins have been published by the Board, and others will be
ready for the printer by the end of the fiscal year.

The curator has been called upon frequently in this geographie work
to settle the spelling of aboriginal names, and this has necessitated a
great deal of research.

In September, 1890, a fresh start was made in the preparation of life-
size lay-figures of aboriginal people. Fortunately, Mr. Héli Chatelain
brought with him from Angola a native, named Jeremiah, of whom Mr.
Mills has made an excellent reproduction for the ethnic series. Ar-
rangements have been made to follow up this work of making lay-
figures to illustrate all the stocks of North American aborigines.

In October the department was fortunate enough to again secure
the services of Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. 8S. Navy, who devoted several
months to the arrangement and cataloguing of specimens in our pos-
session from Oceanica. This he has worked wp with assiduous care,
and too much praise can not be accorded to the Secretary of the Navy
for the continued exhibition of lis interest in our work, in thus assign-
ing Lieut. Bolles and other efficient officers to duty in this Institution.
A great deal of this material which Lieut. Bolles has set up had been
stored away for years, awaiting examination by some one familiar with
Polynesian studies. Valuable additions to the collections from Ocean-
ica were sent by Admiral Kimberly and Lieut. Safford, U.S. Navy,
and the latter showed his continued interest in the Museum by spend-
ing some time in giving information concerning the Samoan collection.

In November the curator delivered an address before the Folk-Lore
Congress in New York upon the scientific treatment of this subject,
taking the ground that we have in the survivals of custom, language,
and belief a species of archeology, in which is contained a record of
human history not to be found in printed page or in material relies,
but in the conduct and behef of the unlettered folk. A systematic
effort will be made to give dignity and effect to this study by more care-
ful collecting and by the comparison of larger bodies of material.

In December the Latin-American department of the World’s Fair,
under Mr. William E. Curtis, secured the codperation of several officers
of the Army and Navy as commissioners to Central and South Amer-
ican Republics, to awaken an interest in, and secure material for, the
World’s Fair at Chicago. These gentlemen spent several weeks in the
Museum taking lessons in photography, taxidermy, making squeezes,
and practising other operations necessary to perfect them in their work.
Before the end of the fiscal year favorable reports were received from
these officers.

In January was completed a card catalogue of the large collections of
religious objects secured among the pueblos of the southwest, by the
Bureau of Ethnology. These specimens have been in the Museum for
z

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. Pan

Six or seven years, but it was impossible to study them or put them on
exhibition for want of information. This was kindly supplied by Mrs.
Matilda Stevenson,who spent several days in the Museum and,with the
help of a stenographer, supplied a legend for each one of the specimens.
With this added information, the collection becomes the largest and
best in the world on the subject of Pueblo religion.

On the 10th of April, 1891, was celebrated the beginning of the sec-
ond century of American patents. The curator was appointed to pre-
pare and read an essay on this occasion, and he was induced to comply
with this request, in the hope that a large number of those who at-
tended the Congress might have their interest aroused in the Museum.
The result was far greater than he anticipated. Col. Dodge’s collection
of breech-loading firearms; Dr. Maynard’s series, showing the unfolding
of a single invention—the Maynard rifle; and Gen. Berdan’s collection,
have all been added to the National Museum, besides others which will
be mentioned in the report of Mr. J. E. Watkins. The permanent
organization of the Patent Association secures to the Museum a body of
new friends.

In May the curator delivered a course of lectures in the Crozier
Theological Seminary, Pennsylvania, on the Natural History of Reli-
gions. The object of these lectures was to show that religion may be
brought within the purview of science as a body of phenomena. From
the point of view of the Museum, religion is what men believe concern-
ing a spirit world, and all that they do in consequence of such belief.
That which they believe is creed, that which they do is eult. The
science of religion is the comparative study of the creeds and the cults
of the world.

Much time has been spent during the past year in working up a
series of bows and arrows and shields and other objects connected with
the art of war, or what the older writers call the “artillery” of the
American aborigines. The material in the Museum to illustrate this
subject is now very rich. The linguistic stocks of our American abori-
gines have been fully studied out, and the locations of each tribe when
first mentioned by travelers and explorers, marked upon a map. By
collecting the weapons of war of each tribe and studying their charac-
teristics minutely, it is possible now to formulate a geography of them.
This study has begun to bear fruit in two directions: Poorly labeled
specimens which have been in the Museum a long time, and therefore
extremely valuable, can be relegated to their proper tribe, and collee-
tions belonging to other bureaus for which no data have been fwwr-
nished can be easily labeled by reference to our large series.

At the suggestion of Prof. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution,and greatly aided by materials which he was able to secure in his
travels abroad, the curator has commenced an exhibition series of time-
keeping .apparatus, beginning with the earliest known process of
mechanically marking divisions of the day or small periods of time, and

~
: \

138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891,

ending with the most delicate chronograph. This is associated with
the unfolding of all primitive engineering devices and of instruments
of precision.

Much time has been spent during the year in forming a card eata-
logue of the ethnological series, a thing which has not been attempted
before. This will enable future curators of the Department of Ethnol-
ogy to put their hands at once upon all that is known concerning each
specimen. It will also give additional value to all objects sent out for
exchange.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has completed a series of type portraits of man-
kind, thirty-three in number. These have been prepared with great
care, each figure painted half the natural size, as given in Topinard’s
tables. The color and costumes also have been carefully scrutinized by
those who are personally familar with each type. As an educational
series, these portraits are very instructive and give correct ideas to
thousands of persons who can never hope to see the originals.

During the year my assistant, Mr. Walter Hough, has followed up
the publication of his pamphlet on fire-making with an exhibition of
all the types of this art, set up in sucha manner as to show the spread
of each type and the method of its elaboration, from the most simple
process known. As a study in comparative technology and the geo-
graphic distribution of an art, this study is of great value.

As an encouragement to those who have given large collections to
the Institution, the curator, assisted by Mr. Hough, has begun the
preparation of monographic catalogues after the manner of the Ken-
sington series. Frequently those who have been among our greatest
benefactors are so much engaged that they have no time to prepare
extended accounts of these donations, so the material slips into the
great mass unnoticed. The effect of such seeming neglect is prejudi-
cial to the best interests of the Museum, hence it is proposed to have
the cataloguing done by the force in the department, especially of such
material as the Bernadou and Allen collection from Korea, the Rock-
hill collections from Thibet, the collections of the Navy Department
from Samoa, the collections of Dr. W. L. Abbott from Kilima-Njaro.

The department has had friendly conneetions with the British
Museum, the Oxford Museum, the Royal Museum at Dresden, Dart-
mouth College Museum, and the Cincinnati Art Museum, through ex-
changes. <A series of continuous small exchanges is found to be pro-
ductive of the best results.

Mr. Héli Chatelain, who was for some years a missionary in Africa,
and who acted as interpreter to the Eclipse Expedition in 1889, has ren-
dered signal service to the Museum, not only by means of his collee-
tions, but in furnishing correct and ample information concerning each
specimen collected and also concerning many hundreds of specimens
already in the Museum from East Africa, of which little was hith-
erto known. On his return to Africa in June, Mr. Chatelain was fur-
nished with an outfit for photographing and collecting.
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 139

During the last few weeks of the fiscal year the curator has given
much time and attention to preparing for the Chicago Exposition. A
plan proposed is as follows:

To show at Chicago, as accurately as possible, the aboriginal life of
North America at the time the natives were first visited by the whites
and before they were changed by contact with our civilization. Such
an exhibit has never been attempted for any continent before, because
the means were not at hand to carry it out. It is true that in all the
great expositions much attention has been paid to primitive arts. The
Paris Exposition of 1889 had a section devoted to the French colonies
in Africa and in southeastern Asia, and there was a most interesting
series of structures illustrative of human habitations in all grades of
culture. In the Palais des Industries Diverses, fourteen groupsof lay-
figures were arranged to illustrate the progress of art, commencing with
the rude cave-dweller and ending with the Chinese cloissonné worker.
In many of the exhibits sent by our Institution to Philadelphia, London,
Berlin, New Orleans, and Cincinnati, single arts or a single people have
been exhaustively treated. At Philadelphia, under the direction of my
distinguished predecessor, Prof. Charles Rau, assisted by Mr. Frank
Cushing, the archeology of America was well set forth with attractive
collections from the northwest coast. All these efforts were successful
in their way, and it is now designed to follow them up with a compre-
hensive display which will enable the spectator to see the continent as
it appeared to the first explorers. At the same time the exposition
will furnish an appropriate culmination of a series of investigations
which have been prosecuted for a century. Not that these investiga-
tions were pursued for the purpose of bringing them together in an en-
eyclopredic work or display, but the World’s Exposition furnishes the
happy occasion of crowning the distinguished scholars who have for a
hundred years been doing their best to make a great historic and eth-

=
i

nographie exhibit possible. J

During the year the material gathered from various parts of the
earth, without reference to the elucidation of any especial art, have
been collected and arranged in a series of courts after the manner of
the European museums. This has been only partially carried out on
account of the great lack of space.

At the close of the year 1890-91 the department became so crowded
for space, that it was deemed necessary to entirely reconstruct the
system of caring tor the material, but this will furnish only temporary
relief. Any one visiting the halls and space allotted to this department
will see how entirely inadequate is the room, either for exhibition, stor-
age, or for the study series. It is now necessary to box up a great
many things, so that the curator can have no aecess to them without
the greatest difficulty.

I beg that this matter be taken into consideration at the earliest
moment, as it will soon be impossible to do anything but receive and

put away. This is not only very discouraging to the curator, but
equally so to those who may wish to enrich our collections.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891,

By WitttIAM H, HotmMes, Honorary Curator.

In this department during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1391, active
operations have been unimportant, as the installment of material is prac-
tically complete. Accessions for the year are humerous, but no collec-
tions of especial importance have been received. The last catalogue
number for June, 1890, is 135363; for June, 1891, 136183.

Such researches as have been conducted by the curator relate mainly
to collections made by the Bureau of Ethnology during the past few
years in the Mississippi Valley and along the Atlantic coast. They
will be embodied in a forthcoming volume of contributions to the
Bureau of Ethnology.

Reference is made in the bibliography (Section Iv) to papers pub-
lished by the curator during the year, relating to excavations in an
ancient soapstone quarry in the District of Columbia, and to the Thrus-
ton tablet.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By Cyrus ADLER, Assistant Curator.

The work of the year proceeded on the lines hitherto marked out—
the assembling of a study collection illustrative of Biblical archeology.
From November 1 until the close of the fiscal year the assistant cur-
ator was absent on leave, having accepted a commission from the
World’s Columbian Exposition to proceed to the East in the interest of
the Exposition. Much of his time previous to that was devoted to a
collection of Jewish ceremonials which, while cognate in a sense to
the work of the section, was separately installed.

ACCESSIONS.

Two casts of ancient Babylonian figures in the Louvre were added
to the collection. These have been placed on exhibition and labels
prepared. The one figure represents Gudea (“ speaker ” or ‘‘ prophet”)
the ancient priest-king (who reigned about 3800 B. C.), as an architect.
The following statement concerning this specimen has been prepared
by Prof. Paul Haupt, the honorary curator.

Gudea is seated on a sort of stoolin a religious attitude. The hands
are clasped in the oriental posture of meditation and devotion. On his
knees he holds a tablet with plan of a fortress. There are six gates
flanked by towers, and the walls are surmounted by battlements. In
front of this tablet there is a graduated rule, 103 inches long (=27
centimeters, ?. ¢., a Babylonian half cubit), and at the side of itis the
style with which the architect engraved his design. The figure is clad
in a sleeveless cloak crossed over the breast and thrown back over the
shoulder. The Arab of this region still drapes himself in the same
fashion in his burnoose—a piece of woolen stuff with a fringe which is
folded in two and wrapped around the body obliquely, so that it covers
one arm and leaves the other bare.

The original is of blackish diorite with a bluish tinge. It was found
with a number of sculptures, inscribed cylinders, fragments of vases,
and remnants of various kinds of Chaldean art, in the ruins of an ancient
temple, at Telloh, during the extensive excavations undertaken from
187781, by the French vice-consul at Bassora, M. Ernest de Sarzee.
His collection was purchased by the French Government, in 1881, for
150,000 franes ($30,000).

147
148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

Telloh, or more accurately Tell-loh (Arabie Tall-lib i. e., “Mound of
Tablets”), seems to represent the site of the ancient Chaldean city
Shirpurla, or Lagash. It is situated in the midst of a morass about 5
miles east of the Shatt-el-Hai, an ancient canal connecting the Euphrates
with the Tigris. Telloh is about 60 miles north of Mugheir (Arabic el
Magha’ir, “The Caverns,” 7%. e., the Biblical Ur of the Chaldees whence
Abraham went forth, Gen. x1, 31) and 45 miles east of Warka (the
Erech of Nimrod, Gen. x, 10) in about the same latitude as Warka, only
a little further south.

The inseriptions Goveving the figure are composed in the so-called
Proto-Chaidean, 72. ¢., the language of Sumer (the Biblical Shinar) and
Acead (Gen. X, 10) representing the non-Semitic idiom of the aborigines
of Mesopotamia. According to some authorities this ancient language
is said to be allied to the Turko-Tartarie family of speech of which the
modern Turkish is the best known representative.

The writing is in the early hieroglyphic forms of the cuneiform script,
and it runs not from left to right in horizontal lines as in the later
Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions, but from above downward, beginning
at the right and thence proceeding toward the left in parallel vertical
columns, the face of the characters being turned towards the right, not
to the left asin Chinese. The same arrangement is met with in the
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The writing always begins in the upper right-hand corner, viz:

We Q L a A

WwW R M G B
X S N H C
Ns T O I D
Z U P K a)

The inscription covering the figure is known as inscription B of
Gudea.

Prof. Haupt has also prepared a translation of the inscriptions, a copy
of which has been placed on the book table.

The casts of the Assyrian seals loaned by Prof. D. G. Lyon, of Har-
vard College, referred to in the last report, were labelled and placed on
exhibition. Labels were also prepared for a miscellaneous collection
from Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, made by Dr. Geo. W. Samson, and
the collection was placed on exhibition.

Labels were also prepared for the British Museum collection of Egyp-
tian photographs, for a series of Egyptian paper impressions, and for a
collection of Egyptian originals, but none of these could be placed on
exhibition owing to lack of space.
REPORT ON THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By A. Howarp CLark, Curator.

Work on the historical collections has been carried on with industry
during the year, and much progress has been made toward a more com-
prehensive classification of the material that hasaccumulated since the
beginning of this department in 1884. Fifty-six new accessions were
received, including about three thousand individual objects. Several
collections of ancient bronze and silver coins, and other historical
objects were received by the curator and were returned to the owners
with descriptive reports, identifying the objects. This branch of the
curator’s duty is becoming greater each year, and has resulted in the
permanent accession of several valuable collections. Many letters of
inquiry have been answered concerning the identity and value of
medals, coins, and other objects.

Among the most important accessions of the year are: (1) The ‘‘ Vail
Papers” deposited by the heirs of Alfred Vail, and consisting of about
thirty volumes of manuscript letters, drawings, and printed matter per-
taining to the invention and history of the telegraph from 1837 to 1852.
These papers are enumerated in detail below in the list of accessions.
(2) Original full-size plaster model of the statue of Liberty, from which
was cast the bronze statue surmounting the dome of the United States
Capitol. This model was made in Rome, Italy, by Thomas Crawford,
American sculptor (born 1814, died 1857), and the bronze was cast by
Clark Mills, in Washington, 1860; height, 19 feet 6 inches. (3) Album
of portraits of the officers and members of the International American
Conference, held at Washington in 1889-90. (4) A silver watch cap-
tured from a British officer at the battle of Lexington in 1775, also the
silver watch carried by Thomas Cheyney, who did valiant service at the
battle of Brandywine during the Revolutionary war. (5) A Bible (Pen-
tateuch) in Sechuana language, carried by Dr. David Livingstone in his
journey in Africa in 1852, with autograph of Livingstone on title page.
(6) Royal account-book of Louis xv and Louis xvt of France, with
autograph of Louis Xvi approving the accounts. (7) Collection of
almanacs from 1730 to 1750. (8) A large collection of personal papers

149
150 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

and relics of George Washington, including also the original will of
John Washington, the founder of the family in America. (9) Silver-
mounted glass flute, presented to President James Madison. (10) Six
medals in silver and bronze struck in Holland in 178283 to commem-
orate the success of the Americans in the Revolutionary war. (11)
Manuscripts, early publications, and objects pertaining to the early his-
tory of Kentucky and of the Shenandoah Valley. (12) Collection of
855 official seals of European governments and institutions. (13) Medals
and diplomas awarded the United States Government by the Paris Ex-
position. (14) Six additional medals of the series struck by order of the
corporation of the city of London, England, to commemorate important
events, including the passage of the reform bill, the opening of London
Bridge, ete.

The routine work on the collections has consisted in the preparation
of labels and arranging the objects for exhibition. Very little could
be done in making a detailed catalogue, for upwards of three thousand
individual objects have been received, and without any assistant the
curator has found it impossible to keep up with the work. Each aec-
cession, however, of which fifty-six have been received during the year,
has been carefully preserved in its identity, so that there will be little
difficulty in cataloguing the specimens hereatter.

The systematic card catalogue of the collection has been carried along,
as also the alphabetical card catalogue of the several accessions, which
number about eight hundred.

In December, 1890, the curator spent four days in Virginia and West
Virginia, for the special purpose of examining some collections of papers
and other personal relies of Gen. Washington in possession of some of
the Washington family residing in Fauquier County, Va., and in
Charlestown, W. Va., and a large number of interesting papers were
secured as a loan to the National Museum. They attracted much
attention while on exhibition, but were withdrawn after several months
by the owners and sold at auction in Philadelphia. Among the inter-
esting places so numerous in the Shenandoah Valley, the curator vis-
ited the old town of Strasburg, a place settled upwards of a hundred
years ago by Germans from Pennsylvania (and still bearing evidence
of its German origin), and also the region about Winchester, Charles-
town, and Harpers Ferry.

The present condition of the several parts of the historical collections
is as follows:

PERSONAL RELICS OF EMINENT MEN.

It is intended to exhibit relics of each President of the United States,
also of eminent soldiers, statesmen, explorers, and inventors, men emi-
nent for scientific attainments, ete.

The large collections of relics of Washington and Grant have acted
as strong magnets to attract other accessions to this department, so

that there are now exhibited relics of Washington, Adams, Jefferson,
Madison,- Van Buren, Gen. Harrison, Jackson, Lincoln, and Grant
among the Presidents; of Elliott, Ripple, Perry, Grant, Hancock, Paul,
Harney, Shields, and other prominent soldiers and sailors; of Benjamin
Franklin, Morse, Vail, Whitney, Fulton, Sir John Franklin, Kane, Liv-
ingstone, and other eminent scientists, inventors, and explorers.

RELICS OF IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE’ HISTORY OF
AMERICA.

This part of the collection is growing steadily. There are already on
exhibition documents and various objects connected with the early
colonial period, the French and Indian wars, the period of the Declara-
tion of Independence, and the Revolutionary war, the formative period
of the Constitution, the war of 1812, the Mexican war, the war of the
rebellion, besides papers and objects to illustrate the history and aboli-
tion of slavery.

MEDALS AND MONUMENTS.

The medallie history of the United States is quite fully shown by the
Museum collection, which now includes all the medals struck by order
of Congress, a large number of medals commemorating national and
local events of greater or less importance, and quite a full series of the
smaller class of medals and tokens exhibiting the medallie history of
the Presidential campaigns, centennials and bicentennials of settle-
ments of towns, etc. The Museum collection of foreign medals is not
very complete, though there are many specimens of much interest.

Monuments are classed next to medals as commemorating events or
as preserving the memory of eminent men. Something has been done
towards making a list of the monuments in the United States commem-
orating events of national importance, and photographs or other illus-
trations of many monuments have been collected. The Memorial Arch,
at Hartford, Conn., erected in memory of the men who fell in the war
of the Rebellion, is, perhaps, the most interesting monument connected
with the rebellion period of our history.

All over the country there are buildings, bridges, etc., such as In-
dependence Hall, in Philadelphia; Faneuil Hall, in Boston; the Old
North Bridge, at Concord, and the bridge at Salem, that stand as
monuments to perpetuate the memory of historic events, and it is proper
that the Museum should exhibit illustrations of them.

PORTRAITS OF EMINENT MEN.

The portrait collection numbers several thousand, and has been en-
larged during the year by the addition of several hundred engravings
of eminent Americans and foreigners. Much work has been done in-
mounting them on standard ecards. A complete catalogue has not yet
152 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

been made. There have been on exhibition several hundred engraved
portraits of some of the eminent scientists of the past four centuries,
also several hundred portraits of medical men, these last forming the
loan collection of Dr. J. M. Toner,

MONEY OF THE WORLD.

About two years ago the curator was directed to begin the formation
of a collection to illustrate the money of the world, and within a few
months the collection was given a good start by the gift of several
hundred copper and silver coins of modern times, and by loans of
nearly two thousand ancient Greek and Roman coins. Part of the col-
lection is labeled and placed on exhibition, but the greater portion
can not be shown for want of exhibition space. The shell money of the
Indians of our country during the early colonial period is interesting
to the public. This collection was arranged by the curator of the de-
partment of mollusks, and shows the shells from which the money was
made, the discs used as coin, and the belts of wampum. Accompany-
ing the exhibit is an instructive pamphlet, giving in detail the history
of the manufacture and uses of this money. The collection of paper
money is steadily growing, and most of the principal countries of the
world are now represented.

The interesting series of issues of Continental paper money of our
country and the State bank series is far from complete, though being
added to by frequent acquisitions.

POSTAGE STAMPS.

There were but few additions to the stamp collection during the year,
and but little time could be given toward arranging the collection for
exhibition. The Museum now has about three thousand stamps exelu-
sive of duplicates, and many of them are of rare issues.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION,

For three successive years the American Historical Association has
held its annual meeting in Washington during the Christmas holidays.
The morning sessions have been held in the lecture hall of the National
Museum and the evening sessions in the Columbian University. This
association has a membership of about six hundred eminent historians,
teachers, and students of history from all parts of the United States.

The curator of historical collections in the Museum is assistant seere-
tary and curator of the association, and has received into his charge
some collections of books and papers deposited for exhibition in the
Museum by permission of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, as
authorized by the act of incorporation of the association. The most im-
portant of these collections are the ‘ Vail papers,” enumerated in detail
in the list of accessions, and pertaining to the early history of the tele-

graph. These were deposited with the association by Messrs. J. Cum-
mings Vail, Stephen R. Vail, and George R. Vail, surviving heirs of the
late Alfred Vail, of New Jersey.

The association is directed by the act of incorporation to report an-
nually to Congress, through the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, concerning the condition of historical study in America.

The first annual report was transmitted to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion on June 15, 1890, by Dr. H. B. Adams, secretary, and was submit-
ted to Congress on June 16. By the Senate it was referred to the

Jommittee on the Library and ordered to be printed as Senate Miscel-
laneous Document, No. 170, Fifty-first Congress, first session. The
document was put in type during the fall of 1890, and forms an octavo
volume of 427 pages, coutaining—

(1) General report of the proceedings at the annual meeting held at
Washington, D. C., December 28-31, 1889.

2) Inaugural address of President Charles Kendall Adams on recent
historical work in the colleges and universities of Europe and America.
(3) The spirit of historical research, by James Schouler, of Boston.

(4) The origin of the National Scientific and Educational Institutions
of the United States, by Dr. G. Brown Goode.

(9) Bibliography of the published works of members of the American
Historical Association.

The regular document edition (1,900) copies of this report is all that
was officially printed and distributed in the usual manner by the Senate
and House of Representatives. The association, however, had aprivate
edition of 500 copies printed in December, 1890, and a second edition of
1,000 copies on special paper was printed during the spring of 1891.
The reports have been distributed to the leading historical associations
and institutions in the United States and foreign countries.

The seventh annual meeting of the association was held December
29-31, when some loan collections of objects pertaining to American
history were brought together in the lecture hall to supplement the reg-
ular exhibibition in the north hall.

The programme of the meeting was as follows:

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891,

By S. R. KOEHLER, Curator.

The work done during this year does not show perceptibly in the ap-
pearance of the collections under my charge, so far as they have been
placed on exhibition. The aim has been to make the several divisions
more complete by filling gaps here and there, and these additions are,
as a matter of course, lost in the mass to the general observer, while
some of them have not yet been placed in position. This is more es-
pecially true of several series of specimens lately acquired, in illustra-
tion of a number of photo-mechanical processes. Special attention has
been given to the development of the division comprising these inter-
esting and inost important processes, and the additions recently made
will compel a rearrangement of the whole division.

The accessions for the year, both by gift and by purchase, although
not as numerous as in previous years, have yet been by no means un-
important. The lists herewith submitted show that many of the friends
of the Museum especially interested in the Section of Graphic Arts
have again remembered it, and that the codperation of others has been
enlisted inaddition. Among the gifts specially to be mentioned is a series
of specimens fully illustrating the photo-lithographic process invented
by Mr, J, W. Osborne, prepared by Mr. Fernald, of New York, under the
supervision of the inventor himself, and given by him to the Museum;
a small collection of Japanese color-prints and illustrated books, received
from Mr. T. Tokuno, chief of Insetsu Kioku, Tokio, Japan, and an im-
pression from a heliogravure plate made by Nicephore Niepce in 1824,
the gift of Mr, Ch. Gindriez, of Chalons-sur-Sadne, France. The his-
torical interest attaching to this specimen will be manifest at once when
it is considered that it is printed from the first measurably successful
plate produced by Niepce, who was the pioneer in this department of
scientific research. The purchases include a silver-point drawing by
Prof. Legros, of London; an aquatint plate, with proofs from it, illus-
trating the wet ground process, and specially made for the Museum by

159
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

Mr. Jas. D. Smillie, N. A.; technical illustrations of several photo-me-
chanical processes, to wit, the photo-aquatint process (prepared for the
Museum by the New York Photogravure Company) the zinc-etching
process for line work, the wash-out gelatine process, and a half-tone
process involving the use of line screens (these three prepared for the
Museum by the New York Engraving and Printing Company), a set of
wood blocks, with the progressive proofs from them, of a chromoxylo-
graph by Gubitz, of Berlin, one of the earliest specimens of this kind
produced in the nineteenth century, and a number of impressions from
plates and blocks engraved by artists of past centuries, illustrating
various processes, but more especially the development of color-print-
ing. A beginning has also been made, thanks to the generosity of
Messrs. F. W. Devoe & Co., of New York, and Mr. M. Falconer, of
Brooklyn, in the formation of a collection of artists’ tools and materials,

The labeling of the specimens on exhibition has been continued, and
the cataloguing of the Osborne collection (see previous reports) has at
last been accomplished. A beginning has also been made with the
cataloguing of the collection of patents. The progress to be recorded,
owing to lack of time and of facilities, is not, however, as satisfactory
as might be desired.

The time has hardly arrived for making special researches upon
material belonging to the Section of Graphic Arts. The acquisi-
tion, however, of a couple of specimens of the so-called “ manicre ertb-
leé” cuts, has made it possible to illustrate this interesting subject intel-
ligently, and to enforce the conclusion arrived at by me some time ago,
that these cuts are really white-line and tint work of a very rude kind,
but in principle identical with the refined work of the most advanced
wood engravers of our own day. These conclusions have been embod-
ied in a paper entitled ‘“‘ White-line Engraving for Relief-printing in
the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,” published, with illustrations,
in the Museum Report for 1890.

The last number entered on the catalogue of the Section of Graphic
Arts for the year ending June 30, 1890, having been 3,471, and the cor-
responding number for the year now under review being 4,797, it follows
that the number of entries during the year has been 1,326. As many
of these entries, however, comprise more than one specimen, it will be
safe to say that the total number of specimens represented by them is
between 1,400 and 1,500. But this number does not give the absolutely
new accessions of the year, as it includes the entries, to the number of
952, of the Osborne collection, which was received and reported among
the accessions several years ago. The entries representing absolutely
new material are, therefore, reduced to 374. The duplicates of the
Osborne collection, consisting of specimens of photo-mechanical process
work, have been laid aside, but not yet catalogued.

The Bibliography (Section rv) contains notices of the papers, ete,
published by me during the year.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator.

During the last fiscal year the collections in the section of trans-
portation and engineering have been materially strengthened. This
is especially so in the branch of mechanical engineering, where it is
hoped eventually to secure a series of objects to illustrate the birth
and development of the mechanic arts, with special reference to the
evolution of the epoch-making inventions.

The United States Patent Office, where thousands of models, draw-
ings, and descriptions of machines are preserved, is the great reposi-
tory from which the history of the development of inventive thought
may be studied, but the student of the history of invention interested
in ascertaining the influence that inventive action has had upon the
occupations, habits, and customs of the human race is desirous to
examine also the products resulting from this inventive development,
especially those that have been put in practical service for the benefit
ofmankind. To this end many of the objects exhibited at the decen-
nial celebration of the establishment of the electric-lighting industry,
held in Providence, R. I., in February, 1891, have found a permanent
place in the collection, together with other specimens from the Loan
Collection temporarily installed in the Museum lecture hall during the
Patent Centennial Celebration held at Washington in April last.

The objects relating to the infancy of electric lighting in America
are of the greatest interest, and a comparison of the crude sewing ma-
chines, typewriters, and other devices recently collected, with the mod-
ern achievements of the mechanic’s handiwork, is also most striking.
Since these relics of invention have proven of great interest to the pub-
lic, the codperation of all persons interested is solicited in the extension
of the section in this direction.

The work of labeling and cataloguing specimens in the exhibition se-
ries was completed during the year.

The electrical collection, of which the Museum formerly possessed only
a valuable nucleus. was enriched by the addition of the original electro-
magnetic engine designed by Joseph Henry, the first Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution in 1831, deposited by his daughter. This little

163
.

164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

machine, which was construced by his own hands, is one of the earliest
applications of magneto-electricity to the production of power. Pro-
fessor Henry calls it “reciprocating motion produced by magnetic at-
traction and repulsion.”

In July, 1831, writing to the editor of Silliman’s Journal, he says:

I have lately succeeded in producing motion in a little machine by a power which,
I believe, has never before been applied in mechanics—by magnetic attraction and
repulsion.

Not much importance, however, is attached to the invention since the article inits
present state can only be considered a philosophical toy, although in the discovery
and invention it is not impossible that the same principle, or some modification of
it on a more extended scale, may hereafter be applied to some useful purpose. But
without reference to its practical utility, and viewed only as a new effect produced
by one of the most mysterious agents ef nature, you will not, periaps, think the fol-
lowing account of it unworthy of a place in the Journal of Science.

It is well known that an attractive or repulsive force is exerted between two mag-
nates, according as poles of different names, or poles of the same name, are pre-
sented to each other.

In order to understand how this principle can be applied to produce a reciprocat-
ing motion, let us suppose a bar magnet to be supported horizontally on an axis
passing through the center of gravity, in precisely the same manner as a dipping
needle is poised; and suppose two other magnets to be placed perpendicularly, one
under each pole of the horizontal magnet, and a little below it, with their north poles
uppermost; then it is evident that the south pole of the horizontal magnet will be
attracted by the north pole of one of the perpendicular magnets, and its north pole
repelled by the north pole of the other; in this state it will remain at rest, but if
by any means we reverse the polarity of the horizontal magnet, its position will be
changed and the extremity, which was before attracted, will now be repelled. If
the polarity be again reversed, the position will again be changed, and so on indefi-
nitely. To produce, therefore, a continued vibration, it is only necessary to intro-
duce into this arrangement some means by which the polarity of the horizontal
magnet can be instantly changed, and that, too, by a cause which shall be put in
operation by the motion of the magnet itself; how this can be effected will not be
difficult to conceive, when I mention that instead of a permanent steel magnet in
the movable part of the apparatus, a soft iron galvanic magnet is used.

The motion here described is entirely distinct from that produced by the electro-
magneti¢e combination of wires and magnets; it results directly from the mechanical
action of ordinary magnetism, galvanism being only introduced for the purpose of
changing the poles.

At the end of sixty years the same principle, that led the great physi-
cist (who is known to the world asa discoverer rather than an inventor)
to make this “little machine,” is used in constructing the electrical
devices which may be properly classed among the mechanical triumphs
of this century of invention.*

A deposit was made of two original letters written to 8S. Vail & Son,
in 1838, by Alfred Vail, while associated with Prof. Morse. They
deseribe Mr. Vail’s relations with Prof. Morse, and the operations of the
first practical electro-magnetic telegraph machine then being tested
before the Committee on Commerce at the United States Capitol. This

original instrument, invented and constructed by Alfred Vail, by which
the historic message, “* What hath God wrought,” was received at the
Baltimore end of the first telegraph line, May 24, 1844, is also preserved
in the collection, where it was deposited by the sons of the great inventor
some years ago.

In addition to these letters are several sheets of drawings and litho-
graphs of the early machines, all deposited by Mrs. Amanda Vail, widow
of Alfred Vail; also a paper ribbon containing a dot-and-dash record of
the first Presidential electiou reported by telegraph in 1844. This relie
was deposited by Stephen Vail, son of the inventor.

Mr. J. EK. Hinds, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has added greatly to the value
of the electrical series by depositing a collection of incandescent lamps, —
switches, and other apparatus used in 1881 in one of the earliest
electric-light plants in America. These relies formed an important part
of the Loan Collection at the Electrical Celebration at Providence, in
February, 1891, previously alluded to.

In my last report the fact that the original boiler of the historic loco-
motive “Stourbridge Lion” had been acquired, was mentioned. It
gives me pleasure now to state that one of the original cylinders of this
locomotive has been deposited by Lindsay & Early, of Carbondale, Pa.,
to whom the Museum is also indebted for.the boiler. As before stated,
‘it is the intention to mount the boiler on the original driving wheels,
collected in 1888.” The accession of the cylinder will make possible a
more complete restoration of this historic locomotive.

The series illustrating the development of the car wheel has been added
to by a gift from Mr. Theodore N, Ely, general superintendent of motive
power Pennsylvania Railroad, of a car wheel of the type in use when
the first locomotives were put on the New Jersey Railroad, in 1831. It
is quite similar to the wheels used under the passenger cars when they
were drawn by horses, prior to the introduction of locomotives, on the
first portion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, opened for traffic in 1854.

Through the courtesy of the master mechanic of the New York Cen-
tral and Hudson River Railroad Company, one of the original driving
wheels of the locomotive “ De Witt Clinton” has found a place in the
collection. The ‘‘De Witt Clinton” was built at the West Point
Foundry, New York, in 1831, and was the first locomotive constructed
in America to do work. It was also the first engine placed in service
on the Albany and Schenectady road, the oldest railway in the
State of New York.

This engine was the subject of the illustration in silhouette, familiar
to all students of the early history of the American railway.

PATENT CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.

Karly in December, the plans which had been under discussion for
several months for celebrating the beginning of the second century of
the American patent system, in a manner commensurate with the vast
importance of the interests involved, crystallized by the appointment of
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

a central committee composed otf citizens of Washington, who were
empowered to proceed with the arrangements for the celebration.
Having at the unanimous request of this committee accepted the gen-
eral secretaryship of the organization, I proceeded to devote as much
time to matters relating to the celebration as my other duties would
permit, feeling that a more intimate acquaintance with the inventors of
the country, and those interested in the manufacture of patented arti-
eles would result in the extension of such of the Museum collections as
relate to the development of the mechanic art.

The ceremonies were held in Washington on the 8th, 9th, and 10th
of April, 1891. They consisted of a series of meetings at which addresses
relating to the history and influence of invention were delivered by
prominent statesmen, political economists, and engineers. The follow-

During the meetings, which were attended by citizens from all
parts of the country, a loan collection was installed in the lecture hall
of the National Museum, where machines of antique design, models, and
early patents were inspected and studied by many visitors drawn to
Washington by their interest in the Patent Centennial Celebration. In
this attractive collection were patents signed by James Madison, Pres-
ident of the United States, and James Monroe, Secretary of State, March
3, 1813, granting to John W. Bronough and Jesse Talbot the sole right
to manufacture a refrigerator. Several patents and assignments of
patents granted by the English Government in 1877 were also in the
collection.

No better description of the character of this loan exhibition can be
furnished than that contained in the Washington Evening Star, April,
1891, which reads as follows:

The first two talking machines ever made are on exhibition in the lecture hall of
the National Museum. There are a great many other curious things gathered in that
apartment just now, put there for the edification and instruction of those who are
interested in the Patent Centennial, which is now in full working order. There is a
case full of talking machines, and subscribers who are continually tangling them-
selves up with ‘‘Central” may be able to discover in the interior of one of the instru-
ments the cause of their trouble.

The first talking machine is a small walnut cone divided. The apex is the receiver,
the truncated portion is the transmitter. Those who ought to know say that it talks
well, but no company could collect $90 per annum upon any such looking thing as it
is. Bell’s liquid transmitter is in the case, and so is the first form of hand telephone.
This must have made even the inventor tired, for it is enormously large, and affords
a striking contrast to the ear trumpet now so common. ‘The first experimental forms
of the Blake transmitter are shown, and alongside of them are the component parts of
the long-distance telephone. How far this latter will work no one knows.

Mr. H. V. Hayes, who is arranging the exhibit, talked this morning with his family
in his home at Cambridge, Mass., a mere matter of 500 miles. Edison’s motophone is
shown in the telephone case.

AN ANTIQUE ELECTRICAL RAILROAD.

An antique electrical railway, dating back to 1837, is one of the interesting
curios of the collection, attracting as much general attention, perhaps, as the origi-
nal telegraph instruments used at the Baltimore end of the line which made 8. F. B.
Morse and Stephen Vail famous.
168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.
THE GROWTIL OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

A good many people clustered this morning about a big case in the center of the
room. The growth of photographic mechanism was there shown. The first camera
ever made in the United States—a plain, clumsy, wooden box, bearing the date
1839—stood alongside two portable tripod cameras of 1890 and looked much more
awkward. In the corner is the contract of partnership between Niepce and Dagu-
erre.

On the upper shelf in the same case a brass cylinder fully 2 feet in height stood
alongside a little scrap of mechanism that could be put in a little boy’s vest pocket,
and unwieldy by contrast. Just below the old camera was the gem of the colleetion—
an original daguerreotype of Daguerre. It is in first-class condition and is a better
picture than many so-called photographers can produceeyennow. The big cylinder,
which is 6 inches in diameter, is a ‘‘rapid lens, made in 1846; the other is also a
rapid lens, but it was made this year, and is only an inch long and an inch in diam-
eter. Both lenses are for the same plate, viz, 10 by 12 inches.

A hand camera in 1884, for a5 by 7 inch plate, was as big as a full-grown valise.
Near the specimen in the case is a hand camera of 1890, and it is comparatively a
baby in point of size.

The instantaneous ‘‘ shutter” that was regarded as perfect in 1858, is nothing but
a brass slide with two holes in it for exposures. If is a crude looking affair when
compared with the beautiful piece of mechanism alongside it—the instantaneous
shutter of to-day, in which the movement of the iris of the eye is imitated pre-
cisely, and by which as short an exposure as the one hundred and fiftieth part of a
second is possible.

The development of the Signal Service weather maps is made plain on a large
board, but there is no evidence to show that the weather has improved with the
maps. A row of mutilated poker chips is immediately below the specimens of
ancient and modern meteorological prophesy.

Side by side are the original Joseph Francis life car and the car now in use by the
U.S. Life-Saving Service.

The Benjamin Franklin hand press is under glass in the center of the room, and so
is a collection of time-indicators, sun dials, clepsydra, hour glasses, and watches.
With these latter is a chronoscope, an instrument that can cut a second into five
hundred parts.

The Steinert collection of musical instruments is another center of attraction, from
the earliest keyed instruments, the clavichord of Mozart and Beethoven’s tunes,
through the intermediary harpsichords and pianos down to the modern upright.

A COLLECTION OF TYPEWRITERS.
.

A collection of typewriters has been assembled this afternoon, not female opera-
tors, but the writing machines. Some of them are very clumsy and have an extremely
antique appearance, although none of them are very old.

Guns, revolvers, and knives are there in choice variety. The history of electric
lighting is made plain, and a good many other lines of endeavor are clearly traced.
The collection is one of the most valuable and interesting ever gotten up by the
Museum authorities. New features are hourly being added, Chief Clerk Cox and
Prof. Otis T. Mason being busily engaged in the work of direction.

Many of the objects that formed a part of this loan collection have
found a place in the permanent Museum collections. Among them may
be mentioned the collection of typewriters made by Messrs. Wyckoff,
Seamans & Benedict, of New York, illustrating the development of
the type-bar writing machine. Included among the number are the
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. 169

model of the Sholes and Glidden typewriter, which was invented at
Milwaukee, Wis., by C. Latham Sholes, Samuel 8. Soule, and Charles
Glidden in 1867. This is the model through which E. Remington &
Sons, of flion, N. Y., first became interested in the manufacture of type-
writers in 1875. Oneof the first machines manufactured from this model
(only three having been made in 1873) is also in the collection. Parts
of this mechanism were altered and modified when the present ‘“ Rem-
ington No. 1” was put upon the market. The collection also contains
a model of the first typewriting machine in which double-type bar
(upper and lower case type) was used, constructed in 1876. Only two
or three machines were constructed before it was found desirable to
make an entire change in the model. A machine somewhat similar to
that now manufactured followed shority afterward. A valuable .col-
lection of early forms of sewing machines made by the Singer Manufac-
turing Company of New York (from 1855 to 1891), as well as early types
of the Grover & Baker, and Elias Howe machines were received from
the Singer Manufacturing Company, through Mr. Henry Calver, who
rendered valuable aid in the preparation of the labels. A duplicate
of the original model of the Sickels lifting, tripping, and regulating
machine, with Patent Office certificate and copy of drawing attached to
the first patent in the world for the trip cut-off for steam engines now
in general use, dated May 20, 1842, was deposited by the inventor,
Mr. F. EK. Sickels, of Kansas City, Mo.

A centrifugal milk separator; the first machine used in separating
cream from milk at the Deerfoot Farm, Southboro, Mass., in 1879, gift
of the Deerfoot Farm Company, through James Cheesman, has been
added to the collection.

These and other relics of the early history of the mechanic art, pre-
viously acquired, form the nucleus of a collection which it is desired to
increase in other directions.

In addition to these relics of invention the silver coffee urn, which
was presented to Capt. Mcses Rogers, of the steamship Savannah, by
Lord Lynedoch, in 1819, as a memento of the first voyage across the
Atlantic by steam, together with a minature likeness of Capt. Rogers
made during his sojourn in Russia, have been deposited by Mrs. F. A.
Seely, granddaughter of Capt. Rogers.

In addition to the accessions already enumerated, the study and
exhibition series have been increased by the collection of engravings,
prints, photographs, and drawings of locomotives, cars, track stand-
ards, bridges, and many original rail sections belonging to and depos-
ited by the curator. This collection is the result of his labors during
the past fifteen years in this country and during a brief visit to Europe
in 1886.

In order to find space for the display of the valuable objects acquired
during the year it became necessary to rearrange the whole of the
exhibition series. Many objects that formerly occupied a position upon
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

the floor of the Museum have been installed upon brackets attached to
the walls or upon the tops of cases. Notwithstanding the fact that this
alternative was resorted to the floor space is overcrowded. This con-
dition of affairs is to be lamented, since the limited space that can be
assigned to this section precludes the acceptance of many objects which
the owners would donate or deposit, provided they could be immedi-
ately placed upon exhibition, but which they prefer not to place in the
custody of the Museum only to be kept in storage for an indefinite
period.
REPORT UPON THE SECTION OF FORESTRY
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891,

By B. E. FERNOw, Honorary Curator.

In view of the fact that but small space can be devoted to the exhi-
bition of forestry collections in the Museum, no systematic effort has
been made to increase the materials for such exhibit, and they are
allowed to accumulate as voluntary unsolicited contributions are made.
Hence the exhibits are still more or less heterogeneous and incomplete
in any one direction; the object of the displays being rather to bring
the existence and the diversified ramifications of the subject before the
beholder than to permit an exhaustive study of any one branch.

Besides the donations received during the year, which are in part
illustrations of physiological abnormities in tree growth, some of the
material used by the forestry division of the Department of Agricul-
ture in the Paris Exposition of 1889-has been installed, consisting of a
display of our most important timber trees by means of maps, showing
their botanical distribution, photographs of typical trees, and photo-
micrographs of the wood structure. This collection is by no means any
more complete than the other parts of the exhibit, but gives a fair indi-
sation of what should be done when space permits expansion.

ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTION.

The accessions during the year are as follows:

No. 23845: Distorted white pine, coiled.

No. 23897: Girdled pine.

No. 24008: Coco de Mer—double cocoanut palm, fruit and wood, Seychelles Islands.

No. 24338: Bent wood—ash bent into the form of an evolute without showing elas-
ticity.

No. 24337: Natural graft—two separate oaks joined by a branch.

No. 24296: Natural graft—pine branch inarched into its mother trunk.

No. 24336: Forest planting machine (model), intended for planting on the prairie
without previous breaking.

No. 24335: View of Japanese cedars; a painting of an avenue of Cryptomeria
Japonica, planted over two hundred and sixty years in Nicko, Shimotsuka, Japan.
No. 5818: Log of ebony—6 feet long, polished.
No, 24382; Argentine woods—sections of trunks.
: 171
172 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

No. 24533: Distribution charts of tree species from Tenth Census.

No. 24532: Photo-micrographs showing cross, tangential, and radial cuts of various
timbers.

No. 24531: Photographs of trees, accompanying distribution charts and photo-
micrographs.

No. 24700: Cypress roots and knees, showing longitudinal and cross sections.

No. 24765: Corrugated apple wood, a small section of unusual beauty.

No. 25040: Vulcanized wood; treated by the Vulcanizing (preservative) process.

Of these, a few of special interest are described on the labels as fol-
lows:

CIRCULATION OF SAP.—NSection of Girdled Pine (Pinus glabra, Walt.).—This tree
was completely girdled in its eighth year, and was injured by fire in its tenth year,
yet lived and continued to deposit wood above the girdle, but none below, until cut,
twenty-two years after the girdling. Gift of I. Gregor. (Jacksonville, Fla., June,
1885. 23897.)

DOUBLE Cocoanut PALM, ‘‘Coco De Mer” (Lodoicea seychellarum, Labil).—Fruit
and wood. Seychelles Islands, Indian Ocean. 24008. Gift of W. L. Abbott.

Occurs only on two small islands of the Seychelles group in the Indian Ocean.

The trees attain a height of 100 feet, having leaves 20 feet long, 12 feet wide; five
to ten nuts grow ina bunch.

Before the discovery of the trees, nuts picked up at sea led to many fabulous tales.
Medicinal qualities were ascribed to the nuts and extravagant prices were paid for
them.

EsBony (probably grown inSiam); from Centennial Exposition, 1876. 5318. Cubic
contents, 3 feet; weight, 272 pounds.

There come into the market a number of different woods called ‘‘ Ebony,” highly
prized for their deep black color; hard, heavy, and closely grained, and susceptible
of a high polish. They are derived from various botanical families, mostly, how-
ever, from the genus Diospyrus, to which our persimmon (Diospyrus Virginiana)
belongs.

The best ebony woods are found in India, especially Ceylon. ‘The supplies of Di-
ospyrus ebenum, which furnishes the best and to which the name was first applied,
is almost exhausted.

The sapwood of the tree is milk-white, changing with age into black heartwood.

Diospyrus melanoxylon now furnishes the main supply.

The ebony from Abyssinia, called ‘‘ Mozzungha,” is derived from a species of For-
nasinia, of the Leguminos family.

The West Indies, French Guiana, and South Africa also supply the market with
ebony woods of various qualities and shades, undetermined as to species.

The most valuable of the accessions during the year is the collection
of woods of the Argentine Republic, one hundred and eleven species,
a gift of the Museo de Productos Argentinos at Buenos Ayres, which
was secured by Mr. J. F. Thompson. These wood-sections were accom-
panied by a catalogue for their identification, which in somewhat altered
form, for readier reference, is given below.

As far as known to us there does not exist any complete fioral work
referring specially to the Argentine Republic, and certainly none on
the arborescent flora. .

Outside of the well-known “ Flora Brasiliensis” of Martius (C. F. P.
von) begun in 1840, still unfinished, which at least in part is applicable

AS soonas time and space permit, it is intended to work up the speci-
mens for display and give on the labels further notes on the distribution

and value of the different timbers.

It has not as yet been either possible or necessary to make much of
an attempt in carrying out such a classification of forestry collections
as I proposed in my first report in 1889, and a detailed report on the
Status of the collections seems, therefore, superfluous.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By JAMES M. Fuint, U. 8S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

Since the last report from this section was written, the work of
arranging, displaying, and providing with descriptive labels the large
number of specimens comprising the exhibit has been systematically
continued. With the exception of the small collection of medicines of
the North American Indians, and the Chinese and Japanese drugs,
every specimen of drug has now its printed descriptive label attached.
In addition to these, of the 862 illustrations of plants and animals in
the exhibit, 350 have their descriptive labels in place, 460 are printed
and ready for display, and the manuscript for the remainder is in the
hands of the printer.

Accessions to the number of 169 have been received during the year,
mostly from Messrs. Powers & Weightman, of Philadelphia, and Parke,
Davis & Co., of Detroit, in answer to requests for specified articles to
fill vacancies. Some novel and interesting additions have been made
to the botanical illustrations, consisting of herbarium specimens of
indigenous medicinal plants, not otherwise illustrated, with the char-
acters of each plant displayed by drawings of the magnified organs.
These were prepared with g’ zat skill by Mr. Theodore Holm, tempo-
rary assistant in this section. As mounted in the swinging frames,
they make an attractive addition to the collection. One hundred and
two photographs of indigenous plants have also been mounted, and
the descriptive labels prepared and printed.

The collection remains without material change in condition, loca-
tion, classification, or arrangement since the last report. The acces-
sions above mentioned were distributed principally among the ‘ chem-
ical products” and the “indigenous vegetable products.”

The following summary shows the number of specimens in each
series:

It is proper to say, in explanation of the fact that the total number
of specimens does not balance with the sum of the accessions for the
year and the total of the previous year’s report, that some of the acces-
sions prove to be triplicates and are absorbed in the duplicate list, that
a small percentage of specimens is every year rejected as worthless,
either originally or by unavoidable deterioration, and that the illustra-
tions are not entered in the catalogue.
REPORT ON THE SECTION OF PHYSICAL APPARATUS
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891,

By W. C. WiIntock, Honorary Curator.

The collection of physical apparatus, consisting chiefly of pieces pro-
cured by Prof. Henry for researches in electricity and sound, was stored,
when first placed in my charge, in the laboratory rooms on the third
story of the east wing of the Smithsonian Institution. In April, 1890,
all of the apparatus was placed, by the direction of the Secretary, though
without much systematic arrangement, in cases in the south entrance
of the building.

The pressure of other official duties has prevented me from devoting
the time necessary to catalogue this apparatus in a thorough manner,
though some progress has been made in laying out the work, and it is
hoped that an opportunity will soon be found to separate the pieces
that are of interest as Museum specimens from those that should be
placed in storage. ;

A careful distinction is made between the apparatus which is intended
for exhibition and that purchased for use in connection with the astro-
physical observatory and for other experimental purposes.

The curator hopes that with a little clerical assistance it will be pos-
sible to draw up a complete inventory of all the apparatus under his
care.

The principal accessions to the Museum apparatus are a collection of
ancient watch movements, made by the Secretary, Mr. 8S. P. Langley,
during a visit to London and Paris in the summer of 1890. These have
been labeled and exhibited, together with several ancient dials and an
interesting astrolabe, under the immediate care of Prof. Mason. Prof.
Mason has added a few watches that have been held in his own depart
ment.

A collection of old surveying instruments has been received from the
surveyor-general of Florida through the Department of the Interior. It
is supposed that these instruments were used by Andrew Ellicott, esq.,
the commissioner, on the part of the United States, in laying the boundary
line between Florida and Georgia in the year 1795 in conjunction with
the Spanish commissioner, Capt. Minot.

A set of bronze weights and the works of an ancient clock, purchased
in Spain at the request of Secretary Langley by Col. F. A. Seely, of the
United States Patent Office, have also been received.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1891.

By THoMaAs WILSON, Curator.

A general review of the work of the department for the year covered
by this report, will compare favorably with that of the year previous.

The last half of the fiscal year was employed in the new classification
and arrangement of the collection. The changing of cases necessary
upon the removal and grouping of the Pueblo models in the west end
of the hall, the establishing of new synoptical cases, the classification
of arrow or spear-heads or knives, and the entire rearrangement of
specimens according to geographic locality are some of the differences
between the work of this and former years.

During the past year we have been engaged in making series of plas-
ter casts of typical specimens of stone implements, sufficient to make one
hundred sets, each containing one hundred casts, for distribution among
educational institutions. About fifty sets have been completed during
the fiscal year.

I completed during the past fiscal year the report of my visit to Paris
and the French Exposition, and of my attendance as a delegate to the
International Congresses of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology,

pipes, implements and ornaments of copper, hematite, and galena, bone and shell
beads, and clay vessels—about five hundred specimens in all. The collection is
of great value from the fact that it is the result of one person’s (Mr. Simonton)
endeavors for over twenty years, is all from one county, and the genuineness of
the objects can not be disputed. (Ace. 23543). Deposited by Warren K. Moore-

STATEMENT OF CHARACTER OF ROUTINE WORK, CLASSIFICATION
AND ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTION, ETC.

The routine work has been of much the same character as in former
years. It consists primarily of the receipt of specimens, their classifi-
cation, naming, numbering, entering in the catalogue with accession
and catalogue numbers, and marking the number of each specimen,
and, on a considerable portion of them, the locality and donor’s name.
The entering of them in the catalogue books requires also the recording
of all information received or obtainable from the senders, and finally
the distribution of the objects in their proper cases.

The collections, as displayed in the cases of the grand hall, have to
be rearranged according as new specimens are received. Monthly re-
ports and reports upon letters and objects sent for examination, the
giving of information, answering of letters, conducting friends and visit-
ors through the Museum, and explaining the objects to them—these are
the other portions of routine work, and they are more than _ sufficient
to occupy office hours. There have been almost a thousand reports
and letters written during the year, consuming: nigh six thousand
pages of type-written matter, the principal portion of which was dic-
tated into the phonograph by the curator at his home out of office
hours.

Some years ago the curator prepared and submitted to the Director
of the National Museum a proposition for a new classification and rear-
rangement of the departmental collection. The previous arrangement
was according to function; that is, all objects, from whatever locality,
were placed together, as grooved axes together, stone hatchets together,
and so of all kinds of arrow and spear-heads, knives, scrapers, ete.

This I proposed to abandon, and to substitute for it an arrangement
according to locality, all objects of whatever nature from a given local-
ity to be displayed together.
