1In the 1944 Report, the article entitled ‘‘Southern Arabia, a Problem for the Future,”
by Carleton S. Coon, pp. 385-402, is only a part of the larger article from which it was
reprinted. The complete paper can be seen in Papers of the Peabody Museum of American
Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, vol. 20, Dixon Memorial Volume, 1943.

In the same Report, in the article on penicillin by Florey and Chain, the reference to
footnote 2 on page 466 was inserted in the wrong place. Instead of following the words
“synthetic processes,” it should appear after the last word on the page, ‘“‘avoided.’”’

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

ALEXANDER WETMORE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1945

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: J have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the
fiscal year ended June 30,1945. The first 14 pages contain a summary
account of the affairs of the Institution; it will be noted that many
activities usually included in this section are missing, wartime con-
ditions again having forced their suspension. Appendixes 1 to 10 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the In-
ternational Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-
physical Observatory, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications
issued under the direction of the Institution. On page 115 is the finan-
cial report of the executive committee of the Board of Regents.

As stated in last year’s report, Dr. Charles G. Abbot, Secretary of
the Institution since 1927, resigned on June 30, 1944, in order to devote
himself to his researches in solar radiation. Having been Assistant
Secretary of the Institution since 1925, by instruction of the Executive
Committee I took over the duties of the position as Acting Secretary
until the next meeting of the Board of Regents on January 12, 1945,
when I was elected Secretary. I am fully mindful of the honor done
me by the Board, as well as of the great responsibility devolving upon
one called upon to direct the multitudinous and varied activities of
such a large organization as the Institution has grown to be.

Next year, the Smithsonian will celebrate its one-hundredth anniver-
sary, so that for 99 years its officials and staff have devoted their best
efforts to making it in very fact what the founder, James Smithson,
desired, namely, an institution for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men. Starting with only the Institution proper housed
in a single building, the organization has developed and expanded its
fields of activity until it now directs six Government bureaus, as weil
as the privately endowed Freer Gallery of Art, and occupies five

7
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

buildings on the Mall, besides the numerous buildings of the National
Zoological Park in northwest Washington. From a single series,
Smithsonian publications have expanded to include nine regular series
and four others issued at infrequent intervals.

In promoting the increase of knowledge, the Institution conducts
and sponsors original researches and scientific explorations, mainly
in the fields of anthropology, biology, geology, and astrophysics; the
diffusion of knowledge is accomplished through the publications just
mentioned, through museum and art gallery exhibits, through the In-
ternational Exchanges (of scientific and governmental publications),
through radio programs and popular science news releases, and
through answering the scientific inquiries of thousands of correspond-
ents each year.

Throughout Smithsonian history the basic principle that has un-
derlain its scientific work is that researches shall be prosecuted for
the new knowledge to be gained alone, without regard to its possible
economic usefulness. This simple principle has enabled the Institu-
tion to accomplish much more in the way of new additions to existing
knowledge than might have been expected with its limited financial
resources, and it is the intention to continue this type of operation.

I assumed the secretaryship in the midst of the trying times of.
World War If. A large proportion of the Institution’s normal ac-
tivities in research, exploration, and publication had been suspended
so that the staff could devote itself to aiding the Army and Navy in
the prosecution of the war. Some of this work is described later in
this report. At the close of the fiscal year, however, victory had been
achieved in Europe, and it was beginning to be apparent that the
Japanese could not resist much longer. My first duty, therefore, will
be to plan the orderly resumption of normal Smithsonian work, at the
same time taking stock of the Institution’s position in the light of
postwar conditions. Two of the major problems facing the Institu-
tion at the close of the war are the inadequacy of the present buildings
for the National Museum, and the need for more personnel in the
scientific, clerical, and custodial categories. Steps to remedy both of
these conditions are under consideration.

One of my first concerns was to review the relationship of the Insti-
tution with the Series Publishers, Inc., who published the Smithsonian
Scientific Series. This set of 12 volumes was written and edited by
members of the Institution’s staff, and published and sold under con-
tract by the above corporation, the Institution receiving author’s
royalties on all sales. Over the past several years numerous com-
plaints had reached the Institution regarding the selling methods of
the publisher’s agents. I held a series of conferences with the officials
of the company, as a result of which it is believed the causes for
complaint have been largely eliminated.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9
SPECIAL WARTIME ACTIVITIES

Technical information to armed forces.—Probably the Institution’s
most useful wartime function has been to furnish technical informa-
tion requested by the Army, Navy, and war agencies. During the first
years of the war information was urgently needed on the geography,
peoples, disease-bearing insects and other animals, and other features
of many little-known war areas, particularly in the Pacific theater.
As many members of the Institution’s scientific staff had visited or
studied these regions, they were called upon with increasing frequency
to furnish such information. Records kept by the Smithsonian War
Committee showed more than 2,000 such requests during the first 2
years of war. As the Pacific war moved westward, however, first-
hand information became available to the Army and Navy, and calls
upon the Institution’s staff during the past year began to diminish, al-
though several staff members continued to be in almost continuous
conference with Army and Navy officials.

Ethnogeographic Board—The same sequence of events occurred in
the case of the Ethnogeographic Board, a nongovernmental agency
created cooperatively by the Smithsonian Institution, the National
Research Council, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the
Social Science Research Council, to act as a clearinghouse for anthropo-
logical and geographic information needed by the Army and Navy.
During the earlier stages of the war the Board was called upon con-
tinually for information, reports, and assistance, and its very ex-
tensive file of American experts in many branches of science was in
constant use. Around July 1, 1944, however, the need for such service
began to taper off, and Dr. William Duncan Strong, the Director, re-
turned to Columbia University to resume his duties as professor of
anthropology. The Board was kept in operation under the direction
of Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
who had assisted Dr. Strong from the beginning. Its services were
in demand, though to a lesser extent, throughout the year.

Improvement of cultural relations with the other American re-
publics—A wartime service which the Institution was unusually well
fitted to take part in was the Government’s program for the improve-
ment and extension of cultural relations with the other American re-
publics. A number of projects in this field were undertaken soon
after the beginning of the war, and these have been carried forward
during the past year. The monumental Handbook of South American
Indians, of which 50 percent of the authors are scientists of the other
American republics, progressed satisfactorily under the continued
guidance of Dr. Julian H. Steward. Volumes 1 and 2 were in proof,
and volumes 3 and 4 went to the printer toward the close of the year.
The manuscript of the fifth and last volume was expected to be com-
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

pleted early in the coming year. The editorial costs of the Handbook,
which will appear as a Bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
have been defrayed by the Department of State.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, set up in 1943 under the
directorship of Dr. Steward to carry out cooperative training in an-
thropological teaching and research with the other American re-
publics, continued its work in Mexico jointly with the Escuela
Nacional de Antropologia of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e
Historia. Two members of the Institute’s staff taught at the Escuela
and, during the last half of the year, directed field research among the
Tarascan Indians. In Perd, staff members studied Moche, an Indian
community on the north coast, and supervised a field survey of the
central Highlands of Pera by representatives of the Museos Histéricos.
In Brazil, teaching and research in Brazilian social anthropology
were planned in cooperation with the Escola Livre de Sociologia e
Politica of Sao Paulo.

The third part of a “Checklist of the Coleopterous Insects of Mexico,
Central America, the West Indies, and South America,” by Dr. R. EK.
Blackwelder, appeared during the year. As stated in previous re-
ports, this published list of one of the largest and most important
groups of insects will be an invaluable aid in future entomological
research in the Americas.

In addition to these major projects several members of the staff
conducted field work in various South and Central American coun-
tries in cooperation with scientists of those countries.

Return of evacuated collections—Karly in the war many of the
priceless and irreplaceable historical and scientific materials in the
national collections were removed to a place of safety in anticipation
of possible bombings of American cities. By November 1944 this
potential danger was considered to be negligible, and all the evacuated
material was brought back to the Institution. The specimens so
handled occupied 21,000 cubic feet of space and weighed some 117,500
pounds. The transfer was made without damage in spite of the fact
that many of the specimens were fragile and difficult to pack and to
handle. Among the materials safely transported both ways were
thousands of type specimens of mammals, birds, fishes, insects, plants,
and other life forms, which are of vital importance to science. Other
priceless specimens to make the trip were the original Star Spangled
Banner, George Washington’s field kit, and many other tangible
evidences of America’s past struggles to win and preserve her freedom.
The scientific and historical collections in American institutions and
museums assume an ever greater importance in view of the destruction
of a great many such collections in Europe.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Et

Smithsonian War Background Studies.—The series of publications
started early in the war to present authentic information on the
peoples, geography, history, and other features of war areas, entitled
“War Background Studies,” was concluded during the year. Details
of the series are given later in this report, and I will say here only
that the demand for the books far exceeded the expectations of the
Institution, and it was found necessary to reprint all of them, some
a number of times, not only for distribution by the Institution, but
also for the official use of the Army and Navy. The total number of
copies printed for both the Institution and the armed services was
632,225.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—All possible efforts of the staff were concen-
trated on projects related to the prosecution of the war, though these
naturally lessened toward the close of the year. Several members of
the staff worked in connection with the Department of State’s pro-
gram for cultural cooperation with the other American republics, in-
volving travel and study in Mexico, Haiti, Chile, and Panama.
During the year, 232,822 specimens were added to the collections,
bringing the total number of catalog entries to 18,151,400. Worthy
of special mention among the new accessions were the following: In
anthropology, 5,677 specimens from Indian village sites in Scott and
Lane Counties, Kans., a large number of specimens from various
islands in the Pacific, and the valuable Arthur Michael collection of
early American silver; in biology, a collection of 600 birds from
Panama, 700 reptiles and amphibians from the Indo-Pacific region,
the Dayton Stoner collection of Scutelleroidea, 25,000 mollusks from
the Perlas Islands, Panama, and two lots of plants from Colombia
totaling 3,720 specimens; in geology, a number of rare and valuable
gems and minerals, including the finest specimen so far recovered of
the new mineral brazilianite, several meteorites, including the 1,164-
pound Drum Mountain, Utah, meteorite, and 10,000 fossil specimens
collected in the Paleozoic of the southern Appalachians by Dr. Charles
Butts; in engineering and industries, the first experimental jet-pro-
pelled plane built in this country, a well-preserved 1902 Oldsmobile,
and the entire equipment and furnishings of an Old World apothecary
shop of the period 1750; in history, a series of 50 bronze statuettes by
Max Kalish of distinguished Americans, known as The Living Hall of
Washington, 1944. The total number of visitors to the Museum
during the year was 1,730,716, an increase over last year of 197,951.
The year’s publications included 1 Bulletin, 1 Contribution from the
National Herbarium, and 18 Proceedings papers. Among the im-
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

portant staff changes were the advancement of John E. Graf from
Associate Director of the Museum to Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution; the appointment of Dr. Raymond M.
Gilmore as associate curator in the division of mammals, William E.
Hoffmann, associate curator in the division of insects, Robert A. Elder,
Jr., as assistant curator in the division of ethnology, and Mrs. Mildred
S. Wilson as assistant curator in the division of marine invertebrates.

National Gallery of Art.—The year’s attendance at the Gallery was
the largest since it was opened in 1941, the total being 2,078,739.
Approximately 35 percent of these were men and women in the armed
services. Sunday night openings with free concerts continued
throughout the year with undiminished popularity. In October 1944
the Gallery published a book, Masterpieces of Painting from the
National Gallery of Art, which contained 85 color reproductions of
paintings in the collections. The public demand was so great that
a second edition was being printed at the close of the year. A
contract was entered into for the completion of six new galleries for
exhibition of recent acquisitions of paintings and sculpture. All
the works of art in protective storage in North Carolina during the
war were brought back to the Gallery without damage in October
1944. Gifts included 80 important Italian, French, and Dutch paint-
ings and 26 pieces of sculpture from Samuel H. Kress and the Samuel
H. Kress Foundation, and a number of other paintings from various
donors, as well as 1,740 prints and drawings from Lessing J. Rosen-
wald, and others from a number of donors. Twelve special exhibitions
were held at the Gallery, including several of war paintings. Travel-
ing exhibitions from the Index of American Design and the Rosenwald
collection of prints were sent to art institutions in various parts of
the country. The Gallery tours attracted more than 15,000 people,
and nearly 27,000 attended the daily 10-minute lectures on the “Picture
of the Week.”

National Collection of Fine Arts—The twenty-second annual meet-
ing of the Smithsonian Art Commission was held on December 5,
1944, the annual meetings scheduled for the 2 previous years having
been canceled on account of transportation conditions. A number
of oil paintings and other art works that had been submitted since
the last meeting in 1941 were accepted. The Commission adopted
resolutions on the death of three former members, John E. Lodge
in 1942, and Charles L. Borie and Dr. Frederick P. Keppel in 1948.
Officers elected for the coming year were: Paul Manship, chairman;
Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman; and Dr. Alexander Wet-
more, secretary. Seven miniatures were acquired through the Cathe-
rine Walden Myer fund. A number of paintings were lent to other
organizations, including two to the White House, one of these—Max
Weyl’s “Indian Summer Day”—to be hung in President Truman’s
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

study. Eight special exhibitions were held, as follows: A selection
of paintings from the William T. Evans collection of American paint-
ings; group of portraits by Enit Kaufman, called “The American
Century”; the Seventh Metropolitan State Art Contest; miniatures by
the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters; water colors of Latin
America by Carl Folke Sahlin; paintings by modern Cuban painters;
paintings and sculpture by members of the Society of Washington
Artists; and drawings presented to the United States by the French
Republic in 1915.

Freer Gallery of Art—Additions to the collections included
Egypto-Arabic bookbinding, Chinese bronze, Arabic and East Per-
sian calligraphy, Chinese and Persian ceramics, Persian manuscript,
Persian and Veneto-Islamte metalwork, Chinese, Indian, and Persian
painting, Chinese sculpture, and Chinese silver. Curatorial work of
the staff was devoted to the study of new acquisitions and to general
research work within the collections, as well as to the preparation
of material for publication. Reports were made on more than 2,000
objects submitted for examination by other institutions and by indi-
viduals. Work connected with the war included assistance given the
Office of War Information by a staff member 4 days a week for 6 months,
and the revision of official Government publications on China and
Japan. The Gallery has heretofore been open to the public every day
except Monday, but beginning January 29, 1945, it was open 7 days
a week. The year’s visitors totaled 72,186. Staff members gave 12
lectures during the year before various organizations. Among the
changes in personnel were the appointment of Richard Ettinghausen
as associate in Near Eastern art, and the detachment from the Gallery
of John A. Pope, associate in research, for active duty as Captain,
United States Marine Corps Reserve.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Dr. M. W. Stirling, Chief of the
Bureau, devoted 5 months to continuing the work of the Smithsonian
Institution—National Geographic Society archeological project in
southern Mexico. Reconnaissance work located a number of archeo-
logical sites, and excavations were conducted on a large earth mound
covering a complex stone-masonry structure in Chiapas near the town
of Ocozocoautla. A new large site of the La Venta culture was dis-
covered on the Rio Chiquito in southern Veracruz. It contained two
large mound groups and a number of carved monuments, including
the two largest La Venta colossal heads yet found. Dr. John P. Har-
rington spent a large part of his time in translating letters and docu-
ments in obscure languages for the Office of Censorship. In addition,
he prepared 12 articles on American Indian linguistic subjects. Dr.
Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., continued his studies of the Folsom material
obtained from the Lindenmeier site in northern Colorado, including
comparisons with artifacts from other early sites in the New World.

14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

Dr. Roberts served as liaison between the Smithsonian Institution
and the Committee for the Recovery of Archaeological Remains, an
organization representing several societies interested in the preserva-
tion of aboriginal materials that are in danger of being lost through
the flooding of river areas by power-dam construction. Dr. Henry
B. Collins, Jr., served as Director of the Ethnogeographic Board after
the resignation of Dr. Strong. He also attended a meeting in Mon-
treal to organize the Arctic Institute of North America, formed to
promote scientific research in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland; later,
as one of the governors of the Institute, he attended other meetings
in Montreal to formulate plans for its operation. Dr. William N.
Fenton continued his work as research associate of the Ethnogeo-
graphic Board, completing six reports on x survey of Army training
programs in American universities. Toward the end of the year Dr.
Fenton resumed his studies on the Iroquois Indians, visiting the Six
Nations Reserve near Brantford, Canada. Dr. H. G. Barnett con-
tinued his studies of the general problem of cultural change, especially
as related to Indian tribes of California, Oregon, and Washington,
and one publication on this subject was nearly completed. Dr. Gordon
R. Willey devoted a large part of the year to editorial work on the
Handbook of South American Indians. He also studied and com-
pleted a report on several large collections of archeological specimens
from southern Florida. The Institute of Social Anthropology, an
autonomous unit of the Bureau under the directorship of Dr. Julian
H. Steward, continued its program of cooperative teaching and field
researches in Mexico and Perti, and an agreement was reached during
the year for similar work in Brazil. Under Dr. Steward’s editorship,
the Handbook of South American Indians progressed materially.
Volumes 1 and 2 were in proof, volumes 3 and 4 were completed and
sent to the printer, and the fifth and last volume was in the final stages
of preparation.

International Exchanges.—The International Exchange Service is
the official agency of the United States for the exchange of govern-
mental and scientific publications between this country and all other
countries. The number of packages passing through the Exchange
Service during the year was 386,758, with a total weight of 211,160
pounds. The franking privilege in transmitting packages through
the mails was discontinued by the Post Office Department during the
year, resulting in an increase in the costs and work involved in han-
dling such packages. Although the war in Europe ended toward the
latter part of the year, it was not possible to resume exchange con-
signments to liberated countries by the close of the year. Accumula-
tions for France, Italy, and Belgium, however, were forwarded through
the Office of War Information, and those for Sweden, Palestine, and
Egypt through the United States Despatch Agent in New York.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

Regular consignments were sent during the year to all countries in the
Western Hemisphere, and in the Eastern Hemisphere to Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Portugal, Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand. Ship-
ments to other countries will be resumed as soon as conditions permit.

National Zoological Park.—The exhibition collection of animals
has been maintained in good condition during the year, but to accom-
plish this with the serious shortage of personnel that prevailed, some
phases of the care of the Park had to be neglected, and no improve-
ments could be made. Increased personnel is the most urgent need of
the Park. Visitors to the Zoo numbered 2,355,514 for the year, a con-
siderable increase over last year. Among the interesting specimens
presented to the Park were a pair of Solomon Islands cockatoos, a
red-sided lory, three wallabies, a pigmy galago and two green fruit
pigeons from the Gold Coast of Africa, a collection of brilliant cage
birds from Costa Rica, and a pair of the rare antelope, Orya beatria,
from Saudi Arabia. A list of the donors of specimens will be found
in the full report on the Zoo, appendix 7. Notable among the births
at the Park were a hybrid gibbon, a giraffe, and four chinchillas. Al-
together, 58 mammals were born, and 21 birds were hatched. At the
close of the year, the collection contained 2,623 individuals represent-
ing 686 species.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Dr. C. G. Abbot, for many years Di-
rector of the Observatory, retired from administrative duties on
June 30, 1944, but will continue his investigations as research associ-
ate. L. B. Aldrich was named Acting Director, and on April 16,
1945, succeeded to the directorship. In the Division of Astrophysical
Research two sets of experiments were carried out at the request of
the Office of the Quartermaster General to determine the surface
temperatures attained by various samples of military clothing under
conditions similar to those of actual field use. Toward the close of
the year another study was undertaken for the Quartermaster Gen-
eral of the radiation from sun and sky at Camp Lee, Va., in connec-
tion with tests being made at the camp. Much time was devoted to a
compilation of all solar-constant values for the period October 1939 to
January 1945, an extension of the table published in volume 6 of the
Observatory’s Annals. A study of these values, which cover a com-
plete double sunspot period, showed a diametrically opposite relation-
ship between solar-constant values and sunspot numbers in the two
halves of the period. Studies were continued of the effects of solar-
radiation changes upon atmospheric circulation and related problems.
Observations of the solar radiation were continued at the three field
stations. In the Division of Radiation and Organisms, war re-
searches on deterioration of cloth, cardboard, and wire insulation by
molds and by ultraviolet light were concluded. The termination of
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

this emergency work permitted the resumption of studies on photo-
synthesis and on the wave-length effects of light on growth. Work
was also taken up on the influence of light on the respiration of the
grass seedling, the course of development of the grass seedling as
influenced by various factors, particularly radiant energy, and the
reducing sugar content of etiolated barley seedlings as influenced by
ught.
THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without au-
thority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the President, the
Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

During the year the following changes occurred in the personnel of
the Board of Regents:

January 20, 1945, Harry S. Truman assumed office as Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, vice Henry A. Wallace, and thus became,
ex officio, a member of the Board of Regents. On April 12, 1945, Mr.
Truman acceded to the Presidency, on the death of President Roose-
velt, the resulting vacancy in the office of Vice President creating a
vacancy on the Board of Regents.

March 1, 1945, Senators Wallace H. White, Jr., of Maine, and
Walter F. George, of Georgia, were appointed regents to succeed the
late Senator Charles L. McNary and former Senator Bennett Champ
Clark, respectively.

January 29, 1945, Representative B. Carroll Reece, of Tennessee,
was appointed a regent to succeed former Representative Foster
Stearns.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1945, was
as follows: Harlan F. Stone, Chief Justice of the United States,
Chancellor; members from the Senate—Alben W. Barkley, Wallace
H. White, Jr., Walter F. George; members from the House of Repre-
sentatives—Clarence Cannon, Edward E. Cox, B. Carroll Reece; citi-
zen members—Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; Roland S.
Morris, Pennsylvania; Harvey N. Davis, New Jersey; Arthur H.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

Compton, Illinois; Vannevar Bush, Washington, D. C.; and Frederic
C. Walcott, Connecticut.

Proceedings—The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 12, 1945, with the following members present: Chief
Justice Harlan F. Stone, Chancellor; Representative Clarence Can-
non; citizen regents Harvey N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton, and Van-
nevar Bush, and the Acting Secretary, Dr. Alexander Wetmore.

The Acting Secretary presented the annual report covering the
activities of the parent institution and of the several Government
branches, including the financial report of the executive committee,
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1944, which was accepted by the
Board. The usual resolution authorizing the expenditure by the Sec-
retary of the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1946, was adopted by the Board.

The annual report of the Smithsonian Art Commission was pre-
sented by the Acting Secretary and accepted by the Board. The
Commission on December 5, 1944, held its first meeting since the com-
mencement of the war, and took action on the acceptance of numerous
works of art which had been offered to the Institution in the interim,
including a number of paintings which had been purchased by the
Council of the National Academy of Design from the fund provided by
the Henry Ward Ranger bequest and were eligible for acquisition by
the National Collection of Fine Arts under the provisions of this
bequest. Vacancies on the Commission were caused by the death of
Charles L. Borie, Jr., John E. Lodge, and Frederick P. Keppel, and
the Commission recommended to the Board the names of George
Hewitt Myers, Archibald G. Wenley, and Robert Woods Bliss to fill
these vacancies, the recommendations being approved by the Board.
Paul Manship was elected chairman of the Commission to succeed
Mr. Borie, and Dr. Alexander Wetmore was elected secretary.

In connection with the proposed centennial celebration of the Insti-
tution during August 1946, the appointment of the following com-
mittees was announced : By the Chancellor, regents Bush, Delano, and
Walcott, with the Chancellor as chairman; by the Acting Secretary,
Messrs. Graf, Clark, True, and Roberts, with the Acting Secretary
as chairman.

A report was received from the special committee of regents ap-
pointed at the last annual meeting of the Board to consider the policy
of the Institution with respect to the tenure of office and retirement
provisions for the office of Secretary, and the several recommendations
made by the special committee were adopted by the Board. In ac-
cordance with this procedure, the resignation of Dr. Charles G. Abbot
as Secretary was accepted, and he was, by resolution, appointed as
research associate of the Institution.
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

The Board then adopted a resolution electing Dr. Alexander Wet-
more as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Resolutions were adopted by the Board regarding a study of the
business management and future policies of the Institution.

In a special statement Dr. Wetmore outlined to the Board recent
_activities carried on by all branches of the Institution.

FINANCES

A statement on finances will be found in the report of the executive
committee of the Board of Regents, page 115.

CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION

August 10, 1946, will be the one-hundredth birthday of the Smith-
sonian Institution. On that same date in 1846 the act was signed that
established the Institution, culminating 8 years of debate in Congress
as to how best to carry out the wishes of James Smithson, the English
scientist who bequeathed his fortune to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” Ina human life the passage of a century brings vener-
able old age and usually the end of useful activity ; for an organization
such as the Smithsonian it merely marks the end of a conventional
period of time and the beginning of a new period which must see the
Institution continue to develop and expand in the furtherance of its
stated objectives.

Such an anniversary clearly calls for a fitting celebration, and for
the past several years plans have been shaping up. About the time
these plans would have crystallized, however, the Nation was forced
to go to war, and all such matters had to be held in abeyance. With
the end of the war definite plans will be announced by the committee
of the Board of Regents appointed to select the final form that the
celebration will take.

THIRTEENTH ARTHUR LECTURE

Under the terms of the will of the late James Arthur, of New York,
the Smithsonian Institution received in 1931 a fund, part of the in-
come from which should be used for an annual lecture on some aspect
of the science of the sun.

The thirteenth Arthur lecture was given by Matthew W. Stirling,
Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, on January 17, 1945,
under the title “Sun Lore of the Indians.” The lecture will be pub-
lished, with illustrations, in the Report of the Smithsonian Institution
for 1945.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

PUBLICATIONS

One of the Smithsonian Institution’s primary functions, the diffu-
sion of knowledge, is carried out chiefly by means of its several series
of publications. ‘These record the results of original researches by
members of the staff or by outside scientists working on the national
collections under direction of the Institution. The Smithsonian An-
nual Report contains each year a selection of original or reprinted
articles presenting new developments in nearly all branches of science;
it continues in wide demand by librarians, teachers, and individuals
interested in the progress of science. ‘The vital importance to a nation
of the vigorous promotion of science was dramatically demonstrated
during World War IJ, and such semipopular reviews of science prog-
ress as the Smithsonian Reports have played a definite part in building
the popular understanding and appreciation of science that is essential
to its healthy growth.

The series of Smithsonian War Background Studies was brought
to a conclusion during the year with the appearance of No. 20 on China,
by A. G. Wenley and John A. Pope, and No. 21 on the Aleutian
Islands, by Henry B. Collins, Jr., Austin H. Clark, and Egbert H.
Walker. ‘The widespread demand for the pamphlets continued, from
Army and Navy organizations and personnel and from civilians. The
largest reprint order so far received, totaling 180,000 books, was from
the Army for use in orientation of officers and men transferred from
Europe to the Pacific theater. The titles and authors of the entire
series, which covered nearly every country and island group in the
Pacific war area as well as other regions and special war topics, will
be found in the report on publications, appendix 10.

Among outstanding publications of the year may be mentioned one
by former Secretary C. G. Abbot on “Weather Predetermined by Solar
Variation,” in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections; “Summary
of the Collections of Amphibians Made in Mexico under the Walter
Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship,” by Edward H. Taylor and
Hobart M. Smith, and “Review of the Spider Monkeys,” by Reming-
ton Kellogg and E. A. Goldman, in the Proceedings of the National
Museum; and “Houses and House Use of the Sierra Tarascans,” by
Ralph L. Beals, Pedro Carrasco, and Thomas McCorkle, the first pub-
lication of the Institute of Social Anthropology.

A total of 56 publications were issued during the year, and 141,635
copies of publications in all series were distributed.

LIBRARY

Demands on the Smithsonian library by the Army and Navy de-
clined as the war drew to a close. On the other hand, receipts of
foreign publications began to increase toward the end of the year,
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

and it became apparent that some European learned societies and
museums had been able to continue publication throughout the war
period. The rare books and manuscripts removed from the Institu-
tion early in the war to Washington and Lee University were safely
returned during the year. Usually, the need for current scientific
books makes it impossible for the library to purchase the older volumes
needed for reference, but this year it was fortunate in being able to
acquire a considerable number of these valuable old works, some of
them dating back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As
usual, the Institution received a large number of gifts of publications
from individuals and organizations. The library’s most urgent need
is relief from the overcrowding of the shelves in all the Institution’s
buildings. The year’s accessions totaled 4,844 items, bringing the
library’s holdings to 918,460. New exchanges were arranged to the
number of 218, and 6,671 “wants” were received. Volumes and pam-
phlets cataloged numbered 6,512, and loans totaled 10,833. More than
2,500 volumes were sent to the bindery.
Respectfully submitted.
A. Wermors, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1945.

Appropriations for the maintenance and operation of the National
Museum for the year totaled $938,994, which was $8,995 more than
for the previous year.

THE MUSEUM IN WARTIME

It was with considerable relief that we were able during the year to
bring back to Washington the thousands of valuable type specimens
and other irreplaceable objects that early in the war had been re-
moved from the Capital for safekeeping in the event of enemy air
raids on the city. Return of this material, which aggregated more
than 60 tons, was completed in November 1944, and by the end of the
year most of the specimens had been reinstalled.

As in previous years since 1941, all possible efforts of the staff were
concentrated on projects related to the prosecution of the war, di-
rectly or indirectly, though naturally these lessened toward the close
of the year, as the end of the war became imminent. Again this year
several members of the staff were called upon for work in connection
with the Department of State’s program for cultural cooperation with
the other American republics. This entailed travel and study in
Mexico and Haiti, respectively, by two Museum anthropologists, and
in Chile by the curator of insects. Strategic geological work was
conducted in Mexico in cooperation with the Geological Survey; and
biological investigations in Panama were made for the War Depart-
ment by two Museum staff members. Others undertook specific re-
search projects directly connected with the war and its attendant
disease, food, and other problems. Still others were granted fur-
loughs for military service or for work with the Office of Strategic
Services and other war agencies. Hundreds of specimens were iden-
tified for the Army and Navy, and special attention was given to ma-
terial sent in by members of the armed services from remote corners
of the earth where few or no collectors had previously been. All
these activities add up to considerable when their far-flung results are

21
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

actually evaluated, and the Museum staff may be justly proud of
its part in the war effort, which now has ended so victoriously.

COLLECTIONS

The Museum collections were increased during the year by 232,822
specimens, which were included in 1,562 separate lots. The five de-
partments registered specimens received as follows: Anthropology,
6,642; biology, 197,462; geology, 23,770; engineering and industries,
3,199; history, 1,749. Most of the accessions were acquired as gifts
from individuals or as transfers of specimens by Government de-
partments. The complete report on the Museum, published as a
separate document, includes a detailed list of the year’s accessions,
but the more important are summarized below. Catalog entries in
all departments now exceed 18,000,000.

Anthropology.—The largest lot of archeological material acces-
sioned during the year consisted of 5,677 specimens excavated from
Indian village sites in Scott and Lane Counties, Kans., in 1939 by
Associate Curator Waldo R. Wedel. Other Kansas material included
343 archeological specimens from the collection of the late Dr. Nor-
man L. Roberts, of Topeka. Specimens of interest from out of the
country included 2 painted Neolithic jars from China and 10 Nasea
and Early Chimt vessels from Pert. In the field of ethnology, the
year’s accessions came especially from the Northwest Pacific coast
and Alaska, Micronesia, Polynesia, Solomon Islands, New Guinea,
Burma, China, Ecuador (Jivaro Indians), and North America (sev-
eral Indian tribes), many of them through the interest and efforts of
men in the armed services. An important contribution to the Micro-
nesian collection was a large model outrigger canoe (baurua) from
Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. Another interesting addition was a
royal Hawaiian cape (ahwula), fully feathered with black and yellow
feathers of the oo bird and red feathers of the z#wi. An Arab costume
presented to Gen. H. H. Arnold by the King of Saudi Arabia was lent
to the Museum by General Arnold. The section of period art and
textiles received through deposit from the Smithsonian Institution
the valuable and well-known Arthur Michael collection of early Amer-
ican silver, representing the work of 121 silversmiths of the Colonial
and Federal periods (1675-1850), among whom are John Coney and
Paul Revere. This outstanding bequest was placed on exhibition in
the lobby of the Natural History Building. Notable gifts to the di-
vision of physical anthropology included 22 skeletons from Amchitka
Island, Aleutians, 35 embryological specimens, and the well-known
skull of Homo novusmundus found near Folsom, N. Mex., in 1935.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

Biology.—Important collections of mammals came from the Indo-
Pacific region, including species heretofore unrepresented in the col-
lections from Australia and the Philippines, and from Panama.

A collection of nearly 600 birds came from Panama, 500 from Ceylon,
and about 100 from Admiralty Islands, the last being a region here-
tofore unrepresented in the Museum’s collections. Other avian mate-
rial received included 45 bird skins from Nissan Island, Solomons; 8
specimens of Venezuelan birds; the type of a new subspecies of black-
bird, Agelaius xanthomus monensis, from Puerto Rico; and 62 bird
skins from extreme eastern Brazil.

Noteworthy additions to the herpetological collections came from
Panama, Haiti, Trinidad, Sierra Leone, Virgin Islands, Ceylon, and
New Guinea. Four accessions, comprising about 700 specimens of
reptiles and amphibians from the Indo-Pacific region, were received
from the Naval Medical School, Bethesda, Md.

A bramble shark received during the year represents, so far as
known, the only specimen of this shark in any North American mu-
seum; it was washed ashore on the California coast. Exchanges
brought many valuable fish specimens to the collections, including 12
paratypes of Venezuelan fishes. Fifty-eight Cuban fishes, including
43 paratypes, were received asa gift. The largest single ichthyological
addition of the year comprised 1,180 specimens collected for the
Museum from the Perlas Islands, Panama.

Most important of the year’s insect accessions was the large amount
of mosquito material received from various units of the Army and
Navy. Aside from this, the outstanding addition of the year was the
Dayton Stoner collection of Scutelleroidea, accompanied by a consid-
erable series of Coleoptera and other insects. In addition, about 3,000
insects of all orders were collected for the Museum from the Perlas
Islands, Panama, and 1,500 from Chile. The Department of Agricul-
ture transferred 72,000 insects to the Museum.

Six of the year’s accessions brought type material of marine inverte-
brates, representing new species of parasitic copepods, crayfish, a para-
sitic isopod, and a turbellarian worm. Besides, a large collection of
marine invertebrates came from the Perlas Islands, Panama,

In mollusks, the year’s largest accession, 25,000 specimens, was col-
lected for the Museum in the Perlas Islands, Panama. Other note-
worthy molluscan additions were 200 specimens of shipworms from
the Canal Zone, about 300 Mexican land, fresh-water, and marine
shells, 885 land shells from Panama, more than 600 shells from the
Pacific region from the Naval Medical School, and nearly 2,900 shells
from various Pacific localities received from 13 members of the armed
services. Helminths added during the year included paratype and
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

cotype material of 10 new forms, 13 specimens from New Guinea, and
101 specimens from the Perlas Islands.

Among the echinoderms received was an example of the starfish
Linckia rosenbergi from the South Pacific, not seen since originally
described in 1866, and 85 other specimens from Biak Island, the first
echinoderms ever received by the Museum from that part of the world.
Thirty-four corals were received from five servicemen in the Pacific
region.

Botanical material came from many parts of the world and in vary-
ing lots and quantities. Perhaps the most important accession in this
field was a set of 8,000 photographs of plant types in European her-
baria (mostly in the Berlin Herbarium), purchased from the Chicago
Natural History Museum. Other important accessions included two
lots of plants from Colombia, totaling 3,720 specimens; about 1,400
plants transferred from the United States Department of Agriculture,
of which 1,360 are from northern Brazil; 111 specimens and nearly 300
photographs of type material of Crepzs and related genera; 622 speci-
mens of Ecuadorian trees; several sizable lots of plants from Vene-
zuela, Mexico, Martinique and Guadeloupe, Cuba, and Texas; and 172
specimens of ferns, mostly from Pacific islands. In addition, about
6,400 plant specimens of many kinds were received in exchange with
other institutions, both North and South American. Diatom material
was received from two remote places: 10 samples from various deposits
at Oamaru, New Zealand, and 2 samples of planktonic species from
near Attu Island in the Aleutians.

Geology.—Income from the Canfield and Roebling funds continued
to supply rare and valuable gems and minerals for the collections.
The finest specimen so far recovered of the new mineral brazilianite,
from Arrasuahy, Brazil, was among the four accessions credited to
the Canfield fund during the year. Through the Roebling fund 10
accessions of minerals and gems were recorded. Among the many
gifts were 16 different-colored jade rings and a synthetic emerald of
90 points, and from the United States Customs Service came a series
of 160 cut stones. The mineral collections also benefited by a number
of very fine gifts, outstanding among which were the James Douglas
collection of copper minerals from Bisbee, Ariz., and the T. Sterry
Hunt mineral collection. Several meteorites were added, including
the 1,164-pound Drum Mountain, Millard County, Utah, meteorite
(through the Roebling fund) and an 81-pound mass of the Odessa
meteorite. A suite of 22 nickel ores came from New Caledonia.

In the field of invertebrate paleontology and paleobotany seven times
as many specimens were received as for the previous year, and several
accessions were noteworthy. Transferred from the United States
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

Geological Survey was the extensive Paleozoic collection made in the
southern Appalachians by the geologist Dr. Charles Butts. This
collection, numbering more than 10,000 specimens and representing
the accumulation of many years of field work, is highly important
for the information it contains bearing on the stratigraphy of the
Appalachians. Another worthy transfer consisted of 3,500 Silurian,
Devonian, and Cretaceous fossils from the Canol Project, Canada,
which came from the Chief of Engineers, United States Army. The
Zimm collection of about 3,000 Devonian (Oriskany) fossils from
Glenerie, N. Y., came to the Museum as a purchase through the Walcott
fund. The collecting work of the curator, Dr. G. Arthur Cooper,
brought in much important invertebrate material from the Ap-
palachians and Mexico and will add a fair number of types to the
collection. In addition, many gifts and exchanges of invertebrate
fossils were received—tco numerous to list here but representing many
type specimens or examples otherwise of interest and value.

The outstanding exhibition specimen received in the field of verte-
brate paleontology was a composite skeleton of the large flightless
pigeon Dodo ineptus from Mauritius, transferred from the division of
birds. Skeletal remains of this extinct creature are exceedingly rare.
A collection of 350 fossil sharks’ teeth and a nearly complete dental
plate of the extinct ray Myliobatis (Miocene of the Chesapeake Bay
region); a molar tooth of the northern elephant, Mammonteus
primigenius; and an avian egg found 714 feet below the surface of
Tinian Island, Marianas, are accessions to the study series deserving
special mention.

Engineering and industries—The year’s outstanding accession in
this department was the first experimental jet-propelled pursuit air-
plane built and successfully flown in the United States. Designed
and constructed by the Bell Aircraft Corp., it holds the unique position
of being the first propellerless airplane in the Museum’s collection, as
well as representing perhaps the greatest development in aeronautical
engineering in the past decade.

To the automotive collections came two unique gifts—a radial 9-
cylinder Diesel engine, of the type designed for and used in the
United States Army M8 light tank, and an original, beautifully pre-
served 1902 Oldsmobile. Two accessions of note to the department’s
radio communications collections were a Marconi coherer, a device
which formed the “heart” of wireless telegraphy before the invention
of the electron tube, and an early (1911) spark transmitter, designed
for wireless communication between an airplane and the ground.
Another interesting communications object added was an original
electric telegraph fire-alarm and street box, such as was installed on
the streets of Boston in 1851.
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

In textiles, an outstanding accession was a historic document com-
prising the original indenture of Samuel Slater, dated January 8,
1783, which he brought with him from England when at the age of 20
he decided to try his fortune in America. Wartime textiles and
those inspired by the war were represented in many gifts. To the
collections of early homecraft textiles there were added by gifts and
loans a number of noteworthy specimens of weaving, needlework, and
supplementary items.

A gift of historic importance to the section of chemical industries
was a series of specimens of lewisite, American mustard gas, or “blister
gas,” and derivatives therefrom, all prepared for exhibition. Impor-
tant additions to the wood collection were 20 samples from the Russell
Islands group of the Solomons, 12 from Brazil, and 63 from the Philip-
pines. In the division of medicine the outstanding accession was the
entire equipment and furnishings of an Old World apothecary shop
of the period of 1750. This large collection, consisting of nearly
1,200 specimens, was gathered in Europe over a period of 40 years
and is unique in completeness of original materials and in its variety.

Chief among the accessions in graphic arts was the unique gift of
Charles W. Dahlgreen of 76 copper plates of his original work in
etching, aquatint, and drypoint. These plates, many of which are
in almost unused condition, were deposited with the division with the
understanding that they are to be used to make prints, to be sold as a
“Smithsonian Edition,” the proceeds to compose the Charles W. Dahl-
green fund, which will be used to enlarge and improve the collections
of graphic arts. The section of photography, among other valuable
gifts, received a collection of rare old lenses of French, English, Ger-
man, and American manufacture, and also the first portable motion-
picture projector designed, patented, and made in 1912 by Dr. H. A.
DeVry, often referred to as “the father of visual education.”

History.—Perhaps the most outstanding addition to the historical
collections was the gift of a series of 48 bronze statuettes of notable
contemporary American public men, made from life by the distin-
guished sculptor Max Kalish. The series is entitled “The Living
Hall of Washington, 1944” and is on exhibition in the costumes hall
in the Arts and Industries Building. Valuable additions to the cos-
tumes collections included two gowns worn by Mrs. Herbert Hoover
in the White House, two inaugural gowns worn by Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, and a cape worn by the Honorable Hamilton Fish in the
early nineteenth century. There was placed on special exhibition
in the Natural History Building a doll dressed in the costume of
Brittany which was presented to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower by the
children of Normandy in gratitude for their liberation from the Nazis.
Accessions to the military collections included an office desk and chair
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27

used by General Eisenhower in the European war zone in 1944. The
usual number of interesting numismatic items were received, includ-
ing samples of recent mintages, and the philatelic collection was in-
creased by 1,306 specimens during the year.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

The principal studies in the field, like those of last year, related
directly or indirectly to the war and have been considerably reduced
below the usual level of times of peace. The results have been valu-
able and have covered a variety of subjects.

In continuation of the program for the promotion of cultural rela-
tions with scientists in the other American republics in cooperation
with the Department of State, Dr. E. A. Chapin, curator of insects,
traveled in Chile for work in connection with entomologists and en-
tomological collections in that country. Upon his arrival in Santiago
arrangements were made by the Chilean Government for him to visit
forested areas, both natural and artificial, the agricultural extension
stations, and the agricultural schools in southern Chile between San-
tiago and the Island of Chiloé. About 5 weeks were spent on this trip,
and many important contacts were made. Although the season was
unfavorable, some very interesting insects were observed and col-
lected. The last 3 weeks of Dr. Chapin’s 2-month sojourn were spent
in Santiago, where considerable work was done on the Chilean na-
tional collection at the museum. Arrangements were also made to
render assistance to the Department of Agriculture in Chile in their
white-grub work; and exchanges were arranged with certain col-
lectors in Santiago.

In connection with this same program of cultural cooperation with
the American republics, Dr. T. Dale Stewart, curator of physical
anthropology, went to Mexico on March 8, returning on June 23. The
primary purpose of this trip was to give training in methods of
osteometry to the graduate students of the Escuela Nacional de Antro-
pologia. Owing to the recent activities of the Instituto de Antro-
pologfa e Historia, of which the Escuela and Museo Nacional are part,
Mexico is now one of the leading anthropological centers in this
hemisphere. The subject of physical anthropology is handled by such
able workers as Dr. D. F. Rubin de la Borbolla, the acting director
of the Escuela, Sr. Javier Romero, curator in the Museo, Dr. Juan
Comas, and Srta. Ada d’Aloja. Under them a number of young stu-
dents are developing who already have had extensive field experience.
In addition, Dr. Stewart was able to study a collection of skeletal re-
mains in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia collected by Dr.
Eduardo Noguera earlier in the year at Xochicalco. This collection,
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

although small, is unusually well preserved, and contains interesting
examples of tooth mutilation and cranial deformity. The teaching
and research supplemented one another as the Xochicalco collection
was used for demonstration purposes, particularly as regards restora-
tion, sexing, aging, and pathological changes. Much interest in this
field of research has developed as a result of this work.

A third project was concerned with work in Haiti for the Museum
by Dr. Alfred Métraux, of the Institute of Social Anthropology, from
September 18 to November 30. His investigations concerned anthro-
pology and were made in cooperation with the Bureau of Ethnology
of Haiti and the Scientific Society of Haiti. For a month Dr. Mé-
traux conducted cooperative archeological investigations on Tortue
Island in the north, and for another month he was in Port-au-Prince
engaged in lectures and anthropological investigations. During the
entire period Dr. Métraux maintained close contact with the Scien-
tific Society for which he organized seminars for the discussion of
anthropology.

In continuation of the ornithological reconnaissance of northeast-
ern Colombia, M. A. Carriker, Jr., of Santa Marta, went into the field
to complete examination of the valley separating the Sierra Nevada
de Santa Marta from the Sierra Perijaé. At the end of the fiscal year
he had moved into the lower elevations of the Sierra Nevada where
this range extends to the east toward the Guajira desert. Excellent
results were reported in additional specimens for our rich collections
from this area. This work is financed by the income of the W. L.
Abbott fund.

A few local collections have been made by Dr. Leonard P. Schultz
and Dr. Robert R. Miller, curator and associate curator of fishes, re-
spectively, who secured fossils at Scientists Cliffs, on Chesapeake Bay,
and fishes from various creeks in the State of Maryland. Several
of the insect specialists have made extensive, largely local, collections
within their own groups, some 3,000 specimens being added to the
national collections through these efforts, a number being forms new
to the collections, especially in the case of coleopterous larvae and
the Aleyrodidae. Most of the aleyrodid material was obtained by
Miss Louise Russell from preserved plant material at the National
Herbarium and in the Herbarium of the New York Botanical Gardens.

Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, curator of invertebrate paleontology, in
company with Dr. Byron N. Cooper, of the Virginia Geological Sur-
vey, carried on further investigations in the complicated geology and
paleontology of the nearby Appalachian Valley, during two brief field
trips. The first, in June 1944, covered parts of this area as far north
as southern Pennsylvania and south to Staunton, Va., to study facies
changes in the Ordovician limestone (Chambersburg formation) from
its type area near Chambersburg, Pa., to a point in the vicinity of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

Staunton. About 2 weeks were spent in the study, which resulted in
interesting information and good collections.

A second trip extended these studies through the Ordovician rocks
of southern Virginia and Tennessee. On this trip the two men were
accompanied by Dr. Raymond S. Edmundson, also of the Virginia
Geological Survey. The party began work about the middle of Oc-
tober near Athens, Tenn., and visited type sections of Ordovician
formations in Virginia and Tennessee to see if the Tennessee forma-
tions could be recognized in southern Virginia. The party worked
from Athens north to Knoxville, then went to Clinton, Tenn., and
worked from there to Cumberland Gap in northern Tennessee. From
here they traveled for a short distance along the Cumberland Front
and on to Natural Bridge, and then to Harrisonburg to tie the studies
into the work of the early part of the summer. The work was com-
pleted in early November.

At the end of January 1944 Dr, Alexander Wetmore, with Dr. J. P.
E. Morrison, assistant curator of mollusks, as assistant, went to Pan-
ama to inaugurate some biological investigations for the War Depart-
ment which continued into the fiscal year 1945. Dr. Wetmore returned
late in March, leaving Dr. Morrison to continue the work until October.
As one result the Museum now has extensive collections of birds, mol-
lusks, and reptiles as well as valuable lots in other fields from some
islands of the Archipiélago de las Pérlas that have not been well known
previously.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: Ihave the honor to submit, on behalf of the Board of Trustees
of the National Gallery of Art, the eighth annual report of the Board,
covering its operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945. This
report is made pursuant to the provisions of the act of March 24, 1937
(50 Stat. 51), as amended by the public resolution of April 18, 1939
(Pub. Res. No. 9, 76th Cong.).

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, the Board consisted of
the Chief Justice of the United States, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, ex officio; and five general trustees, David K. E. Bruce,
Ferdinand Lammot Belin, Duncan Phillips, Samuel H. Kress, and
Chester Dale.

At its annual meeting, held on February 12, 1945, the Board elected
Samuel H. Kress as President, succeeding David K. E. Bruce who
resigned, and re-elected Ferdinand Lammot Belin as Vice President,
to serve for the ensuing year. The executive officers continuing in
office during the year were:

Huntington Cairns, Secretary-Treasurer.

David BH. Finley, Director.

Harry A. McBride, Administrator.

Huntington Cairns, General Counsel.

John Walker, Chief Curator.

Macgill James, Assistant Director.
Donald D. Shepard continued to serve during the year as Adviser to
the Board.

The permanent Government positions on the Gallery staff are filled
from the registers of the United States Civil Service Commission, or
with its approval. On June 30, 1945, the permanent Government
staff of the Gallery numbered 245 employees. Since the beginning
of the war 61 members of the staff, or approximately 25 percent, have
entered the armed services, and during the past year 5 of these em-
ployees have obtained their discharges and have returned to the
Gallery.

The operating and maintenance staffs have been reduced to a
minimum, owing to the fact that the Gallery has desired to curtail
expenditures and the use of manpower to the greatest possible extent
during the war period. Nevertheless, owing to the intensive effort,
interest, and efficiency of the employees, it has been possible to main-
tain a high standard of operation and maintenance of the Gallery
building and grounds and protection and care of Gallery collections.

APPROPRIATIONS

For salaries and expenses for the upkeep and operation of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the protection and care of works of art acquired
by the Board, and all administrative expenses incident thereto as
authorized by the act of March 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 51), as amended by
the public resolution of April 13, 1939 (Pub. Res. No. 9, 76th Cong.),
the Congress appropriated for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, the
sum of $642,600. This amount includes the regular appropriation of
$634,000 and a supplemental deficiency appropriation of $8,600 for
increases in personal services and other Gallery expenses.

From these appropriations the following expenditures and encum-
brances were incurred :

In addition to the above-mentioned appropriations, the Gallery re-
ceived the sum of $35,000 from the Department of State to cover
expenses during the fiscal year of the Inter-American Office of the
Gallery for the promotion of art activities between the United States
and the Latin American republics.

ATTENDANCE

During the year 1945 the Gallery enjoyed the largest annual attend-
ance since the building was opened to the public in 1941, the number
of visitors being 2,078,739, as compared with 2,060,071 in the fiscal
year 1944, or an increase of 18,668. This is an average daily attend-
ance of 5,711 visitors, showing the continuing popularity of the Gal-
lery. The greatest number of visitors on any one day was 25,023, on
Sunday, September 10, 1944.

Men and women in the armed services are visiting the Gallery in
increasing numbers, accounting for approximately 85 percent of the
total attendance. For relaxation they make constant use of the Serv-
icemen’s Room, where writing and reading materials are furnished
them.

The Sunday night openings, together with the Sunday evening con-
certs offered free of charge, continued throughout the year and con-
tributed to the public’s interest. Special exhibitions of contemporary
art held during the year, especially art produced by members of the
armed services, have been unusually well attended.

PUBLICATIONS

The most ambitious project of the Publications Fund of the Gallery
since its organization was the publication of the book “Masterpieces of
Painting from the National Gallery of Art” in October 1944. The book
contains 85 color reproductions of paintings in the Gallery collections,
each matched with an interpretive passage from the world’s literature,
and was edited by Huntington Cairns and John Walker, of the Gallery
staff. The public demand for this book has been so great that a second
edition is now being printed.

The Information Rooms of the Gallery continued the policy of fur-
nishing moderately priced color reproductions of fine quality, and in-
creased the variety of postcards, portfolios, and illustrated catalogs
available to the public. A new edition of the General Information
booklet, which is of great assistance to visitors and may be obtained
without charge upon request at the Information Rooms, was issued
during the year.

Publishers of large collotype reproductions of paintings from the
Gallery collections have been gradually adding to their lists, and the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

8 new reproductions completed during the year make a total of 23
large reproductions offered for sale in the Information Rooms.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GALLERIES

In keeping with recommendations of the committee on the building
and a resolution of the Board of Trustees, it was decided to proceed
with the finishing of six new galleries, in order to make available addi-
tional exhibition space now required.

Accordingly, a contract was entered into for the completion, with
funds donated for the purpose, of galleries numbered 24, 25, and 26
in the west end of the building, in which will be exhibited recent ac-
quisitions of paintings and sculpture of Italian schools, and galleries
numbered 538, 54, and 55, in the east end of the building, for exhibiting
paintings of French and British schools. These galleries will be fur-
nished in a manner similar to adjacent gallery rooms, and it is con-
templated that the work will be completed in the autumn of 1945.

RETURN OF WORKS OF ART FROM PROTECTIVE STORAGE IN BILTMORE, N. C.

It was decided by the Board of Trustees that the works of art in
protective storage at Biltmore, N. C., during the period of danger
of air raids, should be returned to the National Gallery of Art, and
this return was effected on October 17-18, 1944.

The works of art were brought back to Washington by motor van,
under police protection, through the States of North Carolina and
Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and the trip was accomplished
without damage to any of the works of art. The storage rooms at
Biltmore House were closed, and the sum of $10,199.85, which was
the unexpended balance in the working fund furnished to the Na-
tional Gallery of Art for maintenance of the evacuation center, was
returned to the Public Buildings Administration.

In this same connection, it may be noted that the air raid protective
measures in effect in the Gallery building have been discontinued.

inally prepared by the Archive of Hispanic Culture, for publication
in the forthcoming issue of the American Art Manual for the years
1942-45. The Inter-American Office has also compiled a list of circu-
lating exhibitions of Latin American art in the United States, which

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of June 27, 1944, which pro-
vides “* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, * * *”

During the fiscal year emphasis on activities concerned with the
war effort and with Latin America has continued. It is hoped that
as the need for war studies becomes less, the Bureau may soon resume
its normal functions.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, left Washington for
Mexico on January 29, 1945, to continue the work of the Smithsonian
Institution-National Geographic Society archeological project in
southern Mexico. From February 24 to March 6 a reconnaissance
trip was made in the vicinity of Tapachula, Chiapas, during which a
number of archeological sites were located. ‘Two of these, at Caca-
huatan and at San Geronimo, contained carved stone monuments.

From March 6 to May 24 excavations were conducted at the site of
Piedra Parada, Chiapas, 12 miles north of the town of Ocozocoautla.
Most of the work was conducted on a large earth mound which cov-
ered a complex stone-masonry structure, but a number of excavations
were also made at other points in the site. Previous to inaugurating
this work, and at intervals during its progress, trips were made to a
number of limestone caves in the vicinity, all of which had been used
as places of offering and contained large quantities of ceramic re-
mains. The material from the caves belonged to the same relatively
early period as that from the mound site.

From May 28 to May 31 a new and large site of the La Venta cul-
ture was discovered as a result of information received from Juan
Del Alto, of Coatzacoalcos. It is located on the Rio Chiquito in
southern Veracruz, near the small village of Tenochtitlan, on lands
known as San Lorenzo. The site contains two large mound groups
and a considerable number of carved monuments, including the two
largest colossal heads of La Venta type yet discovered. Unique fea-

57
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

tures at the site are a stone aqueduct and a stone fount in the form of
a swimming duck, decorated with water symbols.

Dr. Stirling returned to Washington on June 17, 1945.

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, prepared during the fiscal year
12 articles on American Indian linguistic subjects. Outstanding
among these is one on the Guarani language of South America, pro-
duced through collaboration with Dr. G. 'T. Bertoni, and one on the
Quechua language, written with the help of Prof. J. M. B. Farfan of
Lima, Pera. A large proportion of Dr. Harrington’s time throughout
the year was spent in translating letters and documents in obscure lan-
guages for the Office of Censorship.

During the fiscal year Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., archeologist,
continued to work on the material obtained from the Lindenmeier site
in northern Colorado—the location where a group of so-called Folsom
men camped during the closing stages of the last glacial period—
expanding his studies to include comparisons with artifacts from
other sites attributable to early archeological horizons in the New
World. In this connection he prepared a manuscript “The New
World Paleo-Indian” for publication in the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution for 1944, an article “A Deep Burial on the
Clear Fork of the Brazos River” for the Bulletin of the Texas Archeo-
logical and Paleontological Society, and a paper “An Early Texan”
for the Scientific Monthly.

In March 1945 Dr. Roberts was designated as liaison officer between
the Smithsonian Institution and the Committee for the Recovery of
Archaeological Remains—a group representing the Society for Amer-
ican Archaeology, the American Anthropological Association, and
the American Council of Learned Societies—which was organized for
the purpose of providing ways and means for the recovery of ma-
terials that may be lost through the construction of dams and the flood-
ing of large areas along many of the river systems throughout the
United States. Dr. Roberts attended all meetings of this Committee,
presenting the Institution’s viewpoint and assisting in the drafting of
plans for carrying out such a recovery program. Dr. Roberts devoted
considerable time during the latter months of the fiscal year to a study
of the maps and project reports of the Corps of Engineers and the
Bureau of Reclamation for the dams which they plan to construct,
and to research in the archeological literature relating to these areas
in an effort to determine the districts where sites will be inundated and
where provisions should be made for survey and excavation projects.

In accord with the Smithsonian Institution’s policy of cooperation
with the Library of Congress, Dr. Roberts annotated four books on
anthropological subjects for the United States Quarterly Book List.
He also continued to serve as a member of the Institution’s Personnel

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

Utilization Committee and as a part of this work prepared a manu-
script for a handbook “Smithsonian Institution—Information for
Employees.” In addition he was the general department represent-
ative on the Efficiency Rating Review Board for the Smithsonian
Institution, and attended the United States Civil Service Commis-
sion’s Fourth Annual Institute of Efficiency Rating Boards of Review
in June 1945,

On September 22, 1944, Dr. Roberts was appointed Assistant Chief,
and during absences of the Chief served as Acting Chief of the Bureau.

Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., ethnologist, continued his work in con-
nection with the Ethnogeographic Board. As in the previous year,
he handled requests for information on geographical and other sub-
jects which came to the Board from the Army, Navy, and other war
agencies. When Dr. Wm. Duncan Strong resigned as Director in July,
Dr. Collins was made Acting Director, and at the first Board meeting
thereafter, in December, he was appointed Director.

At the invitation of the sponsoring committee, Dr. Collins attended
a meeting held in Montreal in September for the purpose of organizing
the Arctic Institute of North America. The purpose of the Institute
is to initiate, encourage, and support scientific research in Alaska,
Canada, and Greenland, on the premise that studies in many fields of
science will be required as the basis for efficient planning for the de-
velopment of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of North America.
As one of the governors of the Arctic Institute, Dr. Collins attended
several meetings in Montreal, at which plans for the operations of
the organization were formulated.

During such time as was available, Dr. Collins continued his re-
searches on the archeology of the Eskimo and related problems.

Dr. William N. Fenton, ethnologist, for the fourth successive year
continued to devote a large part of the year to activities arising from
the war effort. As research associate for the Ethnogeographic Board,
six reports on Area Studies in American Universities were completed
and issued in mimeograph form; others are in manuscript. These
reports cover a survey of Army training programs undertaken in 1944,
and again considerable time was spent in travel to the universities while
observing the programs and interviewing teachers and trainees. The
reception that greeted reports already distributed indicates that they
are not without some usefulness.

Scientific activities, although still of necessity somewhat curtailed,
picked up toward the end of the year. Dr. Fenton was reelected
secretary of the Anthropological Society of Washington, and was
appointed to the Board of Editors of the Journal of the Washington
Academy of Sciences, to serve for 3 years. Field researches on the
Iroquois were resumed. Through a grant from the Viking Fund of
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

New York, Dr. Fenton visited the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford,
Canada, between April 23 and May 19. The Archive of American
Folk Song, of the Library of Congress, again furnished recording
equipment, enabling Dr. Fenton to make complete sound recordings
of the chants of the Iroquois Condolence Council, previously un-
collected, Chanters for the Dead, and several social dances. While in
Canada, Dr. Fenton visited Toronto to consult with anthropologists at
the University concerning a postwar plan for Iroquois studies, and
certain specimens were studied at the Royal Ontario Museum of
Archaeology.

In addition to reports issued by the Ethnogeographic Board, sey-
eral book reviews, notes, and articles were contributed to scientific and
literary journals. A series on “Place Names and Related Activities
of the Cornplanter Senecas” appeared during 1945 in the Pennsyl-
vania Archaeologist. The Northwest Ohio Quarterly carried a “Com-
mentary on Samuel Crowell’s Account of Seneca Dog Sacrifice near
Sandusky (1830).” A second paper, by J. N. B. Hewitt, “Some
Mnemonic Pictographs Relating to the Iroquois Condolence Council,”
was completed by Dr. Fenton in the field and accepted for publica-
tion in the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, being
in proof at the close of the fiscal year. Considerable progress may be
noted on a related manuscript, which is a field report on “A Cayuga
Condolence Cane with Pictographs Denominating the Founders of
the Iroquois League,” a project that was undertaken in 1943 for the
Cranbrook Institute of Science.

Near the close of the fiscal year, Dr. Fenton visited Harrisburg,
Warren, and Philadelphia, Pa., for the purpose of furthering
ethnological studies among the Cornplanter and Allegany Senecas in
cooperation with the staff of the Pennsylvania Historical Commis-
sion, local historians in northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern
New York, and the University of Pennsylvania.

In connection with projected research in the prehistory of river
valleys, Dr. Fenton prepared a plan for “An Anthropological Survey
of the Allegheny River Reservoir Area of New York and Pennsyl-
vania.”

Dr. H. G. Barnett, anthropologist, has devoted his efforts during
the fiscal year to studies concerning the general problem of cultural
change. Data bearing on this problem were obtained in the past in
the field from various Indian communities and are supplemented by
diverse historical sources such as regional histories, diaries, pioneer
reminiscences, missionary accounts, church records, and a host of ofli-
cial reports on Indian investigations and reservation administration.
The Indian communities involved include those of the Yurok and
Hupa in northern California, the Siletz and Klamath in Oregon, and
the Yakima, as well as several smaller groups around the southern
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

end of Puget Sound, in the State of Washington. Two publications
are contemplated. It is expected that one of them, now in prepara-
tion, will be completed at an early date.

Dr. Gordon R. Willey, anthropologist, spent a large part of the
fiscal year in editorial work on the Handbook of South American In-
dians, translating and revising manuscript material and selecting
and preparing illustrations. He also began and completed the study
of several large collections of archeological specimens from south
Florida. These collections, now in the United States National Mu-
seum, came from sites in Palm Beach, Broward, and Dade Counties,
and were excavated by Gene M. Stirling and Lloyd C. Reichard, rep-
resentatives of the Bureau of American Ethnology, during the years
1933-19386, as a part of the Federal Relief program in archeology.
The field operations were conducted by Mr. Stirling and Mr. Reichard,
and their notes, drawings, and photographs were used by Dr. Willey
in the preparation of the final report, entitled “Excavations in South-
east Florida,” which will be published in the Yale University series
in anthropology. The manuscript totaled approximately 50,000
words, and included several tables, 8 line drawings, maps, and 17
collotype illustrations.

During the last few months of the fiscal year, a part of Dr. Willey’s
official duties were given over to preliminary preparations for archeo-
logical research in Peri. This projected program calls for a co-
operative investigation of the Virt Valley of northern Peri. Colum-
bia University, Yale University, and the Bureau of American Ethnol-
ogy are the proposed participants. Actual research and results of
research will be undertaken and published separately by the partici-
pants; collaboration will be in the form of common service functions,
such as field laboratories, transportation, and aerial photography.
The work is planned for the spring and summer of 1946.

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY

The Institute of Social Anthropology was created in 1943, as an
autonomous unit of the Bureau of American Ethnology, to carry out
cooperative training in anthropological teaching and research with
the other American republics. As the Director, Dr. Julian H.
Steward, was instructed in the official order establishing the Institute
to report to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, there is
presented here his report to Secretary Wetmore.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, carrying out a program of
cultural and scientific cooperation with the American republics under
a grant transferred from the Department of State, continued under
the directorship of Dr. Julian H. Steward. Dr. Alfred Métraux,
Assistant Director, was transferred to the War Department on April

2, 1945, to accept an assignment for work in Europe. Miss Ethelwyn
676212465
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

Carter served as secretary throughout the year. Dr. Henry J. Bru-
man, cultural geographer, who had been on leave of absence since July
17, 1944, resigned on June 30, 1945.

In Mexico, the Institute was represented by Dr. George M. Foster,
Jr., anthropologist, and Dr. Roland D. Brand, cultural geographer,
cooperating with the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia of the In-
stituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. From August to De-
cember they taught at the Escuela, and from December to June they
supervised a party doing field research among Tarascan villages in
Michoacan. The field party consisted of students from Mexico and
from several other American republics.

In Pert, the Institute was represented by Dr. John P. Gillin, an-
thropologist, until his resignation January 31, 1945, to resume his
teaching duties at Duke University. Dr. Gillin spent approximately
6 months making a study of Moche, a north coast Indian community.
Mr. Harry Tschopik, Jr., anthropologist, joined the staff of the In-
stitute on January 1, 1945, and was assigned to the field office in Lima,
Pert. In cooperation with the Museos Histéricos, under the direc-
tion of Dr. Luis Valearcel, he supervised a field party consisting of
representatives of the Museos Histéricos in making a cultural survey
of the central Highlands of Pert in the region of Hudnuco.

An agreement was concluded with the Escola Livre de Sociologia e
Politica, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for cooperation in teaching and re-
search in the social anthropology of Brazil. Representatives of the
Institute of Social Anthropology are to be detailed to Brazil at a
later date.

Arrangements for cooperative work in Colombia remained
uncompleted.

Publication Number 1 of the Institute of Social Anthropology,
“Houses and House Use of the Sierra Tarascans,” by Ralph L. Beals,
Pedro Carrasco, and Thomas McCorkle, was made available for dis-
tribution. Publication Number 2, “Cherdn, a Sierra Tarascan Vil-
lage,” by Ralph L. Beals, was received in galley proof from the printer.
Publication Number 3, “Moche, a Peruvian Coastal Community,” by
John P. Gillin, and Publication Number 4, “Cultural and Historical
Geography of Southwest Guatemala,” by Felix Webster McBryde,
were sent to the printer.

Of the $61,132 originally allocated by the Department of State to
the Institute of Social Anthropology for the fiscal year 1945, $3,500
was transferred back to the Department of State and $2,500 trans-
ferred to the Handbook of South American Indians for the purchase
of an extra 600 copies of volume 8 to be distributed by the Department
of State. From the remaining amount, $51,418 was actually obli-
gated, making a saving of $3,714.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

In June 1945 the Smithsonian Institution accepted a grant of $2,500
from the Office of Inter-American Affairs to be allotted to Dr. Gre-
gorio Hernandez de Alba of Bogota, Colombia, for work on the
anthropology of Colombia.

HANDBOOK OF SOUTH AMERICAN INDIANS

Work continued on the Handbook of South American Indians.
Volume 1, “The Marginal Tribes,” was received in page proof and
volume 2, “The Andean Civilizations,” in galley proof from the
printer; volume 3, “The Tropical Forest Tribes,” and volume 4, “The
Circum-Caribbean Tribes,” were completed and sent to the printer;
and volume 5, “Comparative Anthropology of South American In-
dians,” is in the final stages of preparation.

Mrs. Lucille E. Levine, stenographer, resigned on April 10, 1945,
and Dr. Gordon R. Willey was transferred to the Bureau of American
Ethnology from the roll of the Handbook of South American Indians
on August 17, 1944.

For the completion of the Handbook of South American Indians,
$6,000 was transferred from the Department of State. An additional
$2,500 was authorized by the Department of State to be transferred
to the Handbook to purchase 600 extra copies of volume 8 for distri-
bution by the Department of State from the amount originally allo-
cated to the Institute of Social Anthropology. Of this total amount,
$8,482 was actually obligated.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Because of lack of funds, no special researches were conducted
during the fiscal year.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editorial work of the Bureau continued during the year under
the immediate direction of the editor, M. Helen Palmer. There were
issued one Annual Report, one Bulletin, one special publication, and
one paper in the Institute of Social Anthropology series, as follows:

Sixty-first Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 1943-1944.
9 pp.

Bulletin 142. The contemporary culture of the C4hita Indians, by Ralph L.

Swanton.

Bulletin 143. Handbook of South American Indians. Julian H. Steward,
editor. Volume 1: The Marginal tribes. Volume 2: The Andean civilizations.
Volume 3: The Tropical Forest tribes. Volume 4: The Cirecum-Caribbean tribes.

Publications distributed totaled 11,570.

In addition to the regular work, the editorial staff of the Bureau
continued work on the publications of the Institute of Social Anthro-
pology.

LIBRARY

There has been no change in the library staff during the fiscal year.
Accessions during the year totaled 204. There has been a large in-
crease in gifts, both spontaneous and on our request. Aside from one
large gift which came to us as a unit, both types of gifts are double
the number received during the previous fiscal year. Exchanges also
much increased over last year and material is beginning to come in
from the various countries of western Europe now that postal service
is once more established. Several foreign serial sets have been
brought up to date by missing numbers supplied, sometimes in long
runs, so that our serial sets are in a very good position, considering the
disturbed conditions of the past 5 years.

The routine of accessioning and cataloging new material has been
kept up to date, and the checklist for the supplement to the last edi-
tion of the Union List of Serials was checked for new entries and
errors and returned to the editor.

ILLUSTRATIONS

During the year E. G. Cassedy, illustrator, continued the prepara-
tion of illustrations, maps, and drawings for the publications of the
Bureau and for those of other branches of the Institution.

COLLECTIONS

Collections transferred by the Bureau of American Ethnology to
the Department of Anthropology, United States National Museum.
during the fiscal year were as follows:

oe

168052. Collection of spoons and fishhooks from Indians of the northwest Pa-
cific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska; also a bone skin
scraper from the Alaskan Eskimo. From the estate of David I. Bush-
nell, Jr.

168260. Collection of arrows, skin quivers, and headdresses from the Hupa
Indians, Humboldt County, Calif., collected by BE. G. Johnson.

168929. Ethnological specimens collected by J. N. B. Hewitt from the Iroquois
Indians of the Six Nations Reserve, Grand River, Ontario, Canada,
and by James Mooney from the Cherokee of North Carolina.

MISCELLANEOUS

During the course of the year information was furnished by mem-
bers of the Bureau staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the
North American Indians, both past and present, and the Mexican
peoples of the prehistoric and early historic periods. Various speci-
mens sent to the Bureau were identified and data on them furnished
for their owners.

Personnel.—Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, who retired on June
30, 1944, was tendered an appointment to the honorary position of
collaborator on July 4, 1944. This action was taken in recognition of
Dr. Swanton’s long and distinguished services to the Bureau. Dr.
Gordon R. Willey was appointed on August 16, 1944, as anthropolo-
gist, by transfer from the staff of the Handbook of South American
Indians. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., was appointed Assistant
Chief of the Bureau on September 22, 1944.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1945:

There was allocated for the expenses of the Service $28,166, an
increase over the amount for the last year of $2,029.

The Institution no longer enjoys the use of the franking privilege
in transmitting packages through the mails, that privilege to Govern-
ment departments having been discontinued. This change in the reg-
ulations of the Post Office Department has increased considerably the
work in the Exchange office as well as the cost of distributing packages
formerly sent under frank but now requiring postage.

The number of packages passing through the Service during the
year was 386,758, a decrease from last year of 21,006. The weight of
these packages was 211,160 pounds, a decrease of 32,020 pounds. For
statistical purposes this material is classified as follows:

Packages are forwarded abroad partly by freight to exchange
bureaus for distribution, and partly by mail direct to their destina-
tions. The number of boxes shipped abroad was 983, an increase over
last year of 334. Of these, 462 were for depositories of full sets of
United States governmental documents. The number of packages
sent by mail to foreign countries was 61,038.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

Although the war in Europe ended in the latter part of the fiscal
year, it has not yet been possible to resume the regular sending of
consignments to the liberated countries. However, the Institution
was able to forward through the Office of War Information the boxes
that had accumulated here for France (182), Italy (134), and Belgium
(107). It also succeeded in sending through the United States Des-
patch Agent in New York, Howard Fyfe, the accumulations for
Sweden (111), Palestine (28), and Egypt (12). Regular shipments
to these countries, however, have not yet been started. The countries
to which consignments are being forwarded regularly remain the same
as at the close of last year, namely:

Eastern Hemisphere:
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Republic of Ireland.
Portugal.
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Africa.
India.
Australia.
New Zealand.
Western Hemisphere: All countries outside of the United States.

Shipments to other countries will be resumed at the earliest date
practicable.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
for transmission abroad through the Service is 93 (56 full sets and 37
partial sets). The partial set for the National Library of Peiping
has been changed to a full set. The depository for Mexico has been
changed as indicated in the list.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1945:

The Congress appropriated $334,651 for the operation of the Zoo for
the fiscal year. Of this amount, $296,277 was expended for all
purposes, including $35,562 for overtime pay of employees under the
legislative provision that put overtime into effect this year. This
leaves an unexpended balance of $38,374 subject to minor corrections
when a few outstanding bills are finally settled. The saving was
largely on salaries because of the impossibility of filling vacant
positions,

During the war the Zoo has been able to accomplish its primary duty
of maintaining an exhibition collection of live animals, and to main-
tain it at as high a level as ever before in its history. Owing to short-
age of manpower, certain phases of the care of the Park were neces-
sarily neglected, and no special improvements were made. The
personnel has been fully occupied in maintaining and keeping in order
as far as possible the grounds and buildings. An attempt is being
made at the present time to increase the staff to prewar numbers.

The United States Marshal’s Office has continued to turn over to
the Zoo quantities of food condemned for some reason as unfit for
human consumption but satisfactory for consumption by certain
animals. The managers of some of the larger vegetable stores con-
tinue to put aside trimmings for the Zoo, which gives certain of the
animals a supply of fresh vegetables and reduces considerably the cost
of maintenance.

The Zoo officials have cooperated as far as possible with the various
Government agencies, including the War and Navy Departments, and
continue to supply facilities for art and biology classes and to furnish
information to the public.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The most immediate need of the Zoo is an increase of personnel.
During the war more than 20 percent of all positions have been vacant.
The actual care of the animals has not been neglected, but very little
work has been possible in connection with the care and maintenance

73
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

of the buildings and grounds. Prior to the war, when the personnel
had 1% days off during the week, the Zoo was short-handed. Now
that there is such an accumulation of work, this condition is much
more noticeable, and when the 40-hour week goes into effect it will be
even worse.

A large backlog of work exists in connection with the restoration
of the Park buildings, fences, and other structures. Also, the Park
has always been insufficiently policed. A force of 14 policemen is
not large enough to patrol an area of 175 acres and to guard the Gov-
ernment buildings and property now in the Park.

The office building now in use is a historic structure built about
1805 but of which little is known prior to 1827. It was used as a
residence from then until 1890, when it was taken over by the Park as
an office. It is obsolete for an administration building. The fire
hazard is considerable and our records and our library are not safe.
The barn and garage adjacent to the office building is an ancient frame
structure. Modernization of these two buildings would greatly facil-
itate the work of the office.

It is hoped that the Zoo may continue the building program that
was interrupted by the war and replace with modern structures the
old unsanitary monkey house, lion house, and antelope house.

VISITORS

There is an increase in the number of visitors, including schools and
excursion parties, and it is expected that this increase will continue
owing to greater interest in the Zoo and to easier transportation
facilities.

A tabulation of cars parked in the Zoo during the fiscal year 1945
shows the following percentage of visitors by States:

ACQUISITION OF SPECIMENS

A few animals are now coming into the market, and the Zoo has
been able to add a number of interesting specimens. Chief among
these are a collection of attractive West African monkeys and a few
birds from South and Central America.

GIFTS

Many interesting specimens have been presented to the Zoo during
the year. Among these were a pair of Solomon Islands cockatoos,
a red-sided lory, a cardinal parrot, and a Pacific swamp hen presented
by Maj. Gen. R. G. Breene, U.S. A.; and black-striped and pretty-faced
wallabies from R. A. Bryant, Jr., of Coronado, Calif. Mrs. Erika
Cook Bascom brought with her from the Gold Coast a pigmy galago
and two green fruit pigeons, rare in captivity. From Sefior don
Alejandro Caballero Gamboa of San José, Costa Rica, came a collection
of brilliant cage birds, sent through Luis Marden of the National
Geographic Society, who also presented a trio of Costa Rican turtles.

James Landis, of the Foreign Economic Administration, was pre-
sented by the Government of Saudi Arabia with a pair of the rare and
beautiful antelope, Orya beatrix, which he sent to the Zoo.

George Ballou of Bethesda, Md., continued to donate various mam-
mals and birds collected during his field work in the south.

BIRTHS

Notable among the births was a hybrid gibbon, Hylobates agilis X
Hylobates lar. The mother discarded the baby after nursing it for a
time, and from then on it was raised by hand. At the present time
it is over 11 months old and one of the most popular attractions.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

On March 4, 1945, there arrived the first giraffe to be born in the
Zoo. This female is the offspring of a pair obtained in 1937 by the
National Geographic Society-Smithsonian Institution Expedition.
One of our two pairs of chinchillas, the first ever exhibited in the Zoo,
gave birth to a litter of three young, and the other pair one young.

Added to our list of hybrids was a baby monkey, the mother a white-
faced capuchin, the father probably a brown.

The births and hatchings are listed below:

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the op-
erations of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 380, 1945:

The work of the Astrophysical Observatory is conducted on funds
received largely from appropriation by Congress, amounting for the
fiscal year 1945 to $44,140, and in part from private sources. There
are two divisions:

(1) DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

This division has its headquarters in Washington, and maintains
three field stations for solar observations, at Table Mountain, Calif.,
Tyrone, N. Mex., and Montezuma, Chile. In Washington the di-
vision occupies frame buildings in an enclosure about 15,000 square
feet in area just south of the Smithsonian Building. The frame
structures have served for many years as the offices and laboratories
of the division. During the fiscal year 1945 extensive alterations and
repairs were made which provide greatly improved facilities for the
work of the division.

Work at Washington.—In the first half of the fiscal year a large part
of the time of Mrs. Bond, Mr. Hoover, and the Director was given
to a compilation of all solar-constant values for the period October
1939 to January 1945. This compilation is an extension of the great
table (table 24) of volume 6 of the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory. The extended table summarizes the important factors
employed in the reductions and also gives the preferred solar constant
for each day of observation in the 2114-year period July 1923 to
January 1945. Inasmuch as this period includes three sunspot
minima (July 1923, September 1933, May 1944), and thus covers a
complete double sunspot period, it became of interest to study all these
results to determine what relationship exists between solar constants
and sunspot numbers. A paper summarizing this study (Smithsonian
Misc. Coll., vol. 104, No. 12) shows a diametrically opposite relation-
ship between solar-constant values and sunspot numbers in the two
halves of the double sunspot period. It is important to discover in
the succeeding cycle of sunspots whether this complex relationship
will repeat itself. If so, the prediction of solar variation as given in

98
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 99

volume 6 of the Annals (fig. 14) and referred to in the 1944 report will
require some modification, since that curve did not include considera-
tion of sunspot effects.

Dr. Abbot and Mr. Hoover constructed and tested a new sensitive
radiometer which Mr. Abbot plans to use with the aid of the Mount
Wilson 100-inch telescope to study the distribution of energy in the
spectra of stars of various types. Definite progress was made in the
design of the instrument, and in the control of static charges, which
in the past have been most troublesome.

At the request of the United States Weather Bureau, two pyr-
heliometers belonging to the Bureau were repaired and recalibrated.
Also a silver-disk pyrheliometer was built, calibrated, and sold at
cost to the Bureau.

Dr. H. Arctowski has continued his studies of the effects of solar-
radiation changes upon atmospheric circulation and related atmos:
pheric problems. A paper summarizing this work is in preparation,

Work in the field.—Observations at the three field stations were
maintained in spite of the continued manpower shortage. Great
credit is due the directors of the stations for carrying the heavy ob-
serving load under difficulties. Owing to the serious illness of Mr.
Moore, director of the Tyrone station, that station was closed for
8 weeks in the spring of 1945.

War work.—Two sets of experiments were carried out at the request
of the Military Planning Division, Office of the Quartermaster Gen-
eral, to determine the surface temperatures attained by various sam-
ples of military clothing under conditions similar to those of actual
use in the field. For this purpose we employed a special thermo-
electric device developed some years ago at the Observatory for the
measurement of skin temperatures.

In June 1945 a contract was signed with the Office of the Quarter-
master General, under the terms of which the Observatory is to make
a detailed study of radiation received from sun and sky at Camp Lee,
Va., in connection with a series of tests being made at Camp Lee.
The preparation of instruments for this study was in progress at
the close of the fiscal year.

(2) DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

(Report prepared by Dr. Earl S. Johnston, Assistant Director of the Division)

During the early part of the year research connected with war
projects was terminated. This work dealt mainly with problems of
deterioration of cloth, cardboard, and electrical wire insulation by
molds and by ultraviolet light. Contact with these projects is still
maintained by Dr. Johnston, who was designated liaison representa-
tive of the Institution with the Tropical Deterioration Steering Com-
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

mittee which comes under the National Defense Research Committee.
He also represents the Institution as a technical adviser to the Navy
with reference to emergency rescue equipment, which section is now
under the United States Coast Guard.

The termination of this emergency work has permitted the resump-
tion of the Division’s regular research program. Two of our labo-
ratory rooms have been equipped with apparatus and facilities for
the continuation of our studies on photosynthesis and on the wave-
length effects of light on growth. It has been found necessary to
rebuild much of the CO, measuring apparatus and to carry out exten-
sive tests before our fundamental problems could be taken up. These
steps are now in process of completion, and four preliminary experi-
ments on wave-length balance and plant growth have been carried
out. Two other general problems have been pursued: (1) Influence
of light on respiration of the grass seedling, and (2) course of devel-
opment of the grass seedling as influenced by environmental factors
with special attention to the role of radiant energy.

It has been noted previously (Weintraub and Johnston, 1944) that
brief illumination of etiolated barley seedlings resulted in a marked
increase in rate of carbon dioxide evolution. In attempting to gain
information on the mechanism of this effect a study has been made of
the reducing sugar content of the plants as influenced by light; no
significant change in sugar content was found under the experimental
conditions employed. In the course of this work it became necessary
to devote considerable time to a study of methods of sugar analysis as
applied to plant tissues; some of the findings have been published.
Experiments are now in progress on measurement of oxygen consump-
tion concurrent with the carbon dioxide production.

The investigation of grass seedling development has proceeded along
several lines. In addition to effects of radiation itself, a study is being
made of the role of some other environmental factors such as tempera-
ture, nutrient supply, and aeration. Additional data have been ob-
tained regarding the action spectrum of mesocotyl inhibition in oats
over a wide range of light intensities; at low intensities a second maxi-
mum occurs in the neighborhood of 620 my. It is hoped that work on
the isolation of the photoreceptive pigments can be resumed shortly.
Comparison of the effectiveness of red and of violet light has been
made for several other species representing a majority of the tribes of
grasses ; the responses of all species have been found to be fairly similar
to that of Avena, thus greatly extending the generality of the earlier
results of Weintraub and McAlister (1942). The influence of light
on elongation of the grass coleoptile also is being studied; the results
to date have demonstrated a marked effect of temperature on the
response of this organ to light which causes inhibition at lower tem-
peratures but an apparent stimulation at higher temperatures.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101

PERSONNEL

On June 30, 1944, Dr. C. G. Abbot, for many years Director of the
Astrophysical Observatory, retired from administrative work. L. B.
Aldrich was appointed Acting Director, and on April 16, 1945, he suc-
ceeded to the post of Director. It is a pleasure to record that Dr.
Abbot remains at the Observatory as research associate and that his
advice and help continue to be available to the staff.

As of June 1, 1945, L. B. Clark, expert glass blower and technician
of the Division of Radiation and Organisms, was placed in charge of
the construction of instruments and equipment for both divisions of
the Observatory.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945:

In use and also in growth the library continued to reflect the prog-
ress of the war during the year just past. As the Army and the Navy
moved toward the final objective, occupying territory concerning
which they had earlier made a thorough search for significant infor-
mation, the reference use of the library by the war agencies notice-
ably decreased. The same reason, too, accounts largely for the drop
in the number of loans to outside institutions from 1,363 in 1944 to
840 in 1945. Foreign accessions, on the other hand, took an upward
turn late in the year, especially after VE-day, and the number of
pieces received through the International Exchange Service was 200
more than in the preceding year, while increasingly larger numbers of

publications had begun to come from abroad by mail. It is espe-
- cially gratifying to note here that some of the European learned so-
cieties and museums had been able to continue publication of im-
portant series straight through the years of the enemy occupation of
their countries.

While its more obvious direct use by the personnel of the war agen-
cies declined, there was no falling off in the demand for the library’s
less direct and conspicuous but no less important war service by the
members of the scientific and technical staff of the Institution, many
of whom were continuously busy with war projects requiring their
special knowledge. Most of this work was not different in kind from
the usual peacetime business of supplying the books and information
needed by research workers in making scientific investigations, and
no exceptional methods or procedures had to be used to do it. Now
and then, however, ingenuity and resourcefulness were taxed to meet
an out-of-the-ordinary or specially pressing requirement, sometimes
to the temporary disruption of established routine.

A forecast of the approaching end of the war was the return to
Washington in 1944 of the rare books and manuscripts that had been
removed to Lexington, Va., for safekeeping in 1942. The Institu-
tion is deeply indebted both to Washington and Lee University and
to the Library of Congress for providing the ideal conditions under

102
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 103

which they were housed and protected during the years of their evacu-
ation. The McCormick Library, in the stacks of which the Univer-
sity so generously gave them storage space, is a fine new fireproof
building, and the Library of Congress was so kind as to extend to the
Smithsonian material the 24-hour guard service which it maintained
over its own material similarly stored there. More fortunate pro-
vision for the safekeeping of the Institution’s irreplaceable books and
manuscripts could not have been made, and nothing was lost or in-
jured in any way.

Not a part of its official business, but a willingly accepted wartime
obligation, was the library’s agency in receiving and distributing the
popular books and magazines which members and friends of the Insti-
tution continued to bring in for men and women in the service. The
table in the main hall of the Smithsonian building was kept well
supplied with “take away” reading matter, and many books were
turned over to various service centers in the city.

ACCESSIONS

The first evidences of the returning tide of foreign publications came
so late in the year that their number and kind did not greatly affect
the picture of the accessions for the year as a whole, especially as
there had been a small but continuous falling off of serial publications
from abroad in the months before. The accessions division handled
altogether 25,914 incoming publications. Of these, 3,878, mostly
documents not required in the work of the Institution, were sent di-
rectly to the Library of Congress, while duplicates received as gifts
or in exchange, and some other publications not needed for immediate
use, were either given to other Government libraries or were kept in
reserve. All the rest were cataloged, entered in the current periodical
records, or assigned to sectional libraries for filing in pamphlet
collections.

Of the volumes received, 1,863 were purchased. The exigencies of
current peacetime scientific publication usually make it difficult to
stretch the book budget far enough to include older works needed to fill
gaps in the Institution’s working collections of reference books.
Narratives and reports of early voyages and travels are especially
important to the work of both the National Museum and the Bureau
of American Ethnology, containing as they do much direct or incidental
information about the animals, plants, and peoples of the regions
visited, while many of the older books on natural history, art, crafts,
industries, and inventions are constantly required for reference by
the different departments of the Museum and the National Collection
of Fine Arts. This year, as last, it was possible to buy a few of the
104 § ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

Institution’s desiderata in these and related fields when they came into
the book markets. Among them were Henri Beraldi’s “Les Graveurs
du XIX ° Siécle,” 12 volumes, Paris, 1885-92; George Dixon’s “A
Voyage Round the World, but More Particularly to the North-West
Coast of America, Performed in 1785, 1786, 1787, and 1788,” London,
1789; W. Vincent Legge’s “A History of the Birds of Ceylon,” Lon-
don, 1880; Urey Lisiansky’s “A Voyage Round the World, in the
Years 1803, 4, 5, & 6, Performed by Order of His Imperial Majesty
Alexander the First, Emperor of Russia, in the Ship Neva,” London,
1814; Samuel Palmer’s “A General History of Printing, from the
First Invention of It in the City of Mentz,” London, 1733; Leo
Schidlof’s “Die Bildnisminiatur in Frankreich im XVII, XVIII, und
XIX Jahrhundert,” Vienna, 1911; J. P. Williamson’s “English-
Dakota Vocabulary,” Santee Agency, Nebr., 1871; Francis Willugh-
by’s “Ornithologie,” London, 1676; William Wood’s “Index Ento-
mologicus,” new and revised edition, with supplement by J. O. West-
wood, London, 1854.

GIFTS

Space does not permit the separate listing of the 3,893 books and
papers which members and friends of the Institution so generously
gave to the library during the year. Among them were many items
that greatly enriched the collections, notably two gifts of more than
200 publications each, on photography, some of them old and rare,
which were presented to the division of photography for its sectional
library by George R. Goergens, and by the firm of Fuller & d’Albert.

Separates and reprints of their papers are always most welcome
gifts from scientific investigators, and our divisional libraries on
special subjects are largely built up of such contributions. In spite
of the wartime difficulties of publication and transmission, the year’s
record of the receipt of literature of this sort includes the names of
individual donors from most of the countries of North and South
America, and from Great Britain, Portugal, Egypt, Turkey, South
Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

EXCHANGES

The Institution’s policy of exchange of publications has always been
a liberal rather than a rigid one of equivalents, and many of its own
publications are sent out without expectation of any return in kind
at all. This policy has greatly benefited the library, for it has almost
invariably been reciprocated generously by the institutions on the
exchange list. During this last war year of paper shortage and small
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

editions, the library has had reason to feel especially grateful to the
issuing institutions who have sent us voluntarily, or upon request,
many needed publications over and above the hundreds distributed
regularly in routine exchange.

CATALOGING

Current cataloging according to the plan of work adopted last year
was well kept up, and it was even possible to do a little recataloging
of some of the older, inadequately cataloged material most in demand.
The union catalog was considerably improved, and work on it was
simplified by adopting some clarifying and labor-saving devices in
its arrangement, and by withdrawing from it old donor cards and
other extraneous records which were serving no present useful
purpose.

There are still many thousands of volumes of older accessions in
the different bureau libraries and in special collections that are not
represented in the union catalog at all, and a large number of them,
especially those in the Museum library, are not adequately cataloged
in the unit catalogs of the bureau libraries themselves.

Since its founding, almost a hundred years ago, the Smithsonian
Institution is so fortunate as to have acquired exceptionally rich col-
lections of literature in certain special fields of its interests, notably
in anthropology, zoology, botany, and geology, in addition to the pub-
lications sent as part of the Smithsonian Deposit to the Library of
Congress. Provision for the cataloging of this and other material,
mostly in the different bureau and sectional libraries of the Institu-
tion, has always lagged so far behind its inflow, through the years,
that the large accumulated “backlog” of work to be done on it might
almost be termed permanent. Certain it is that it cannot be satisfac-
torily reduced within any predictable future time except by a staff
of competent catalogers engaged to do it as a special project.

But only when the library finally has a complete catalog of all the
Institution’s books, so that it is possible to know exactly what and
where they are, can it be the scholarly tool and can its staff give the
fully effective service that contemporary scientific and technical
research requires,

DUPLICATES

The resources of the library’s large collections of duplicates and of
other publications on subjects not pertinent to the work of the Institu-
tion continue to be drawn upon by other Government libraries, and
many parts needed for the completion of sets of scientific serials
have been supplied to them. More than 6,000 of these publications,
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

too, were sent to the Library of Congress to be used for the rehabilita-
tion of destroyed libraries.

PERSONNEL

Changes in personnel were the appointment of Miss Mary L. Fleet
on October 16, 1944, to be in charge of serials and binding in the Mu-
seum library, succeeding Miss Elizabeth G. Moseley who had resigned
on August 31; and the appointment on September 18 of Miss Leona
Haviland as a cataloger. By transfer from the division of insects
Miss Mathilde M. Carpenter was attached to the library staff on
August 31 as biological aid in charge of the sectional library of the
division of insects. On October 9 Mrs. Carmen G. Randall, who
had been under temporary appointment as library assistant, was
transferred to the temporary position of senior bindery aid. Miss
Beatrice E. Smith served as a cataloger under temporary appointment
from June 30 to August 31, 1944.

NEEDS

Relief for the serious overcrowding of the shelves in all the build-
ings is the library’s most urgent need, and the whole matter of the
physical condition and arrangement of all its branches and parts
with relation to policies and provisions for their growth and adminis-
tration in the future needs detailed and careful study.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced in
value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the fund
now amounts to $5,864,061.73, in a selected list of securities classified
later.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are under the following

GENERAL APPENDIX
TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1945

123
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genrrat Aprenpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1945.

OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE” AND ITS
SPIRALING COUNTERPARTS?

By WILLIAM T. SKILLING

Professor of Astronomy, retired, San Diego State College, San Diego, Calif.

[With 2 plates]

Our earth is an infinitesimal part of a great whirlpool of stars called
the galaxy, or Milixy Way. Not only are the sun, moon, and planets
of the solar system moving as a very small unit that drifts with the
rotation of the galaxy, but all the visible constellations of the sky are
so close to us that they, too, are our fellow travelers in one small part
of this cosmic eddy. Only recently has the tremendous velocity of
our galactic rotation been measured and found to be 170 miles a second,
in the direction of the constellation Cygnus.

On account of the smoothness of our travel and the freedom from
any sharp turns in our course we do not feel this motion any more than
we do the lesser speed of the revolution of the earth about the sun at a
mere 1814 miles a second. It is not the motion but abrupt changes in
motion that we feel when riding in an automobile or train, and the
earth makes no such changes in speed. The curve that the earth fol-
lows in its motion about the sun, 93,000,000 miles away, is so gradual
that in each second the earth departs only one-ninth of an inch from
a straight line while going forward 1814 miles. Only by observing
other moving bodies and the so-called fixed stars are we able to meas-
ure or even perceive our annual motion, and it is little wonder that
astronomers have been slow in observing the vaster sweep of the whole
solar system and its relatively near neighbors around a center that is
2 billion times as far away as the sun.

Soon after the beginning of this century the great Dutch astronomer
Kapteyn, as a result of his studies in his native Holland, announced
the discovery of two “star streams” flowing in particular directions.
It has long been known that stars have some motion with respect to
one another. But this previously known star motion, including that
of the sun, was looked upon as being wholly at random. Kapteyn

was the first to show any systematic drifts of great numbers of stars
in any particular direction.

Gustaf Strémberg, at the Mount Wilson Observatory, examined the
motions of various classes of stars and uncovered some surprising
facts. His analysis of the motions of certain stars that the spectro-
scope showed to have very high velocities, 50 miles a second and up,
proved that their directions are by no means at random. They seem
to be leaving a particular part of the sky because the sun and its
planets are moving toward that region.

The most rapidly moving stars, Strémberg found, are those far-dis-
tant groups, each consisting of many thousands of closely associated
stars, which are called globular clusters. There are about a hundred
of these clusters.

Thus, these and other men were finding beads of knowledge that
eventually had to be strung together to show their relationship. The
first to do this was Bertil Lindblad, of the Swedish observatory at
Stockholm. He explained the apparent motion of high-velocity stars
by fitting them into a theory of galactic rotation. He showed that if
we assume the whole Milky Way system of stars to be revolving, then
what otherwise appear to be peculiar and unaccountable motions of
stars become natural consequences of that revolution. He likened our
system of a billion or more stars to the spiral nebulae that can be seen
far beyond the limits of the Milky Way and suggested that each of
these nebulae is itself a distant island galaxy, seen as a blur of light
because we are unable to distinguish any but the brightest individuals
among its millions or billions of component stars.

Lindblad’s suggestion was not new, but he was the first to form a
complete theory. As far back as the time of Sir William Herschel our
system of stars was being likened to the spiral nebulae. Herschel, with
the large telescope that his patron George III had enabled him to
build, could see many hazy patches of light that he shrewdly guessed
might be star systems. The name “island universes,” applied to these
suppositional galaxies, became common at that time.

Herschel’s telescopes were not powerful enough to resolve these
nebulous objects into separate stars, but he predicted that all such
clouds might one day be shown to consist of stars. With his largest
telescope he had already proved that some objects which his smaller
instruments showed only as glowing spots were really star clusters.
What could be more natural than that with means more abundant,
even, than those supplied by King George, telescopes might be made
that would break up into stars even the most distant spots on the sky?

This very reasonable guess of Herschel’s has since been found to be
partly at fault, for the spectroscope, of more modern times, shows in-
disputably that some of the nebulae are gaseous and that some are
OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE”—SKILLING 127

made of gas and dust clouds mixed. But both the spectroscope and
the modern telescope give evidence that many others are, as Herschel
suspected, composed of stars. In addition, more recent knowledge of
their distances shows that gaseous nebulae or those composed of il-
luminated dust clouds are within our own stellar system whereas those
that are composed of stars are outside of that system. Hubble calls
them “extragalactic nebulae” to distinguish them from true nebulae.
Shapley, of the Harvard College Observatory, calls them simply “gal-
axies.” This word indicates their likeness to the stellar system but
does not distinguish them from it as the prefix “extra” does.

The name by which these outside galaxies are popularly known is
“spiral nebulae.” Both parts of this name are in error for some do
not have the spiral form and none of them are mere clouds, which
“nebulae” implies. Nevertheless, a spiral form is the most striking
characteristic of those that do possess it. The name “island universes,”
pretty well suggests their nature, but it violates the usual meaning of
the word “universe.” Thus all names of these outside star systems seem
to be open to criticism.

But what evidence exists to support Lindblad’s theory that our
galaxy is one of these spiral nebulae? First, there is the evidence de-
duced from their distances.

The spiral nebulae lie at such great distances that the surveyor’s
parallax method used for nearer stars fails utterly to give any idea
of their location. However, their distances had to be known, at least
approximately, before it could be definitely decided whether they are
separate systems beyond our stars or only outlying parts of our galaxy.
Happily an exceedingly powerful indirect means of measurement was
discovered by which Hubble, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, learned
that the distance to a spiral in the constellation Triangulum is about
three-quarters of a million light years. Another still more conspic-
uous one in Andromeda was found to be at practically the same
distance.

The method employed by Hubble makes use of a certain kind of star
known as a Cepheid variable, a number of which had been discovered
in the spirals. These stars are exceptionally bright intrinsically and
can be seen at a great distance. As far away as these variable stars
ean be clearly seen their distances can be calculated, for their period
of change from maximum brightness to maximum again is a key to
their real brightness, and this, in turn, is a key to their distance.

A curve can be drawn (from table 1, for example) showing the
relation between period and brightness, and from the curve the actual
luminosity of a star of any period can be found. Then by simply com-
paring this real brightness with the brightness that the star seems to
have, as measured with a photometer, the star’s distance can be found.

(If there is obscuring matter between us and the star its dimming effect
must be found and allowed for before the comparison of real and ap-
parent brightness is made.)

The two nearest of the spiral nebulae were in this way found to be
so distant as to be well separated from the outermost stars of our
galaxy. The estimated distance from side to side of the Milky Way
system is about 100,000 light years. Seven or eight such systems
could be laid side by side in empty space between our stars and those
of the great nebula in Andromeda, one of our two nearest neighbors,
before the gap would be bridged.

A second point of similarity between our galaxy and the spiral
nebulae is size. The sizes of extragalactic nebulae, as found from
their angular diameters and distances, approach nearly enough the
size of the stellar system to warrant their being classed with it rather
than with even the largest of our own star clusters or star clouds, such
as are seen along the Milky Way.

Third, the similarity of our star system and the spiral nebulae is
shown in the flattened shape of each (plate 1). Herschel, with un-
limited patience, counted stars in all directions and found that the
stellar system is “shaped like a grindstone,” to use his own compari-
son. More recent counts amplify Herschel’s discovery by showing
that the sun and the solar system are not centrally situated in our
galaxy. To the naked eye or with a small telescope there seem to be
about as many stars in one direction as in another in the plane of the
Milky Way, but with a telescope that will penetrate to greater depths
many more stars can be seen in the direction of Sagittarius than in
that of Auriga. The reason is that we are far out from the center in
Sagittarius toward the “anticenter” (the point opposite the center)
near Auriga. Measurements of a different kind place us about two-
thirds of the way from the center of the circumference. But still we
are nearly in the plane of the Milky Way.

Finally, the motion of our galaxy is similar to the motion of the
spiral nebulae. It is now definitely known that the spirals are rotat-
ing. For this belief is there not strong presumptive evidence in the
appearance of the spiral nebulae? There seems little doubt that they
have acquired their flattened pinwheel appearance (plate 2) from
rotation about a center, for a group of stars would in time collapse to
their common center if it were not for the centrifugal effect of motion
OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE”—SKILLING 129

that counterbalances the inward pull of gravitation. If this appear-
ance were not sufficient proof of the rotation of the spirals, there are
spectroscopic observations to show it. V.M. Slipher, at the Flagstaff
Observatory, and more recently Dr. Hubble, at the Mount Wilson
Observatory, have used the spectroscope upon nebulae in much the
same way it is used in measuring the velocity of rotation of a planet.
Using spiral nebulae that do not have their flat side directly toward
us, the slit of the instrument was set as nearly as could be upon the
equator of the spiral, perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The
resulting spectral lines slant because of the approach of one side of
the light source and the recession of the other side. Slipher and
Hubble agree that there is motion in the direction we should expect;
most of the material of the nebula is at the more condensed central
part, and as this turns, the two arms projecting from its opposite sides
are left trailing behind.

At our great distance from the spirals the angular motion is too slow
to be observed with certainty on direct photographs of the nebulae,
even with pictures taken several years apart. Perhaps photographs
of the next century when compared with those taken by this genera-
tion of astronomers may show changes in the position of stars of these
galaxies.

There can be no question as to the rotation of spiral nebulae; what,
then, is the evidence that our system of stars is like them? Some of
the extragalactic nebulae that are not spiral show no sign of motion.
If our galaxy turns, how would the motion of its stars be observed to
show whether or not they are revolving about a common center?
Lindblad was unable to make any direct measurement of our galactic
rotation. The position of the earth within the galaxy is an unfavor-
able one for observation of its rotation. So Lindblad’s approach to
the problem was to explain, insofar as possible, all observed motions of
the stars of the galaxy (as they appear to move with reference to our
sun) in terms of a great rotation.

Lindblad interpreted the apparent motion of the so-called high-
velocity stars as being caused by our more rapid rate as we and they
revolve, all in the same direction, around the center of the stellar
system. ‘These slow “high-velocity stars” seem to be headed backward
with respect to the true direction of all the stars. They seem rapid
because they lag behind so rapidly.

But why would not stars equally distant from the center of the
galaxy all move equally fast? For comparison, it is well known that
a comet travels very slowly while going around the end of its long
elliptical orbit that is farthest from the sun. Then it gains great

“speed through years spent in falling closer. Halley’s comet, for
example, went about 35 times as fast in 1910, when it was making the
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

quick swing around its “perihelion,” as it is moving now, during the
1940 and 1950 decades, when it is out beyond the orbit of Neptune.
As the comet falls back toward the sun it will regain its speed. Even
the earth, which has an orbit nearly but not quite circular, goes faster
in December than in June because it is then 3 percent nearer the
central sun. It is partly due to this greater velocity of the earth that
winters in the Northern Hemisphere are a week shorter than sum-
mers. If their orbits were exactly circular around the sun, all bodies
at equal distances from it would go at the same velocity, whether they
were planets, comets, baseballs, or grains of sand. Stars would behave
in the same way in going around their attracting center.

In the great rotation of our galaxy most star orbits around the
common center are nearly circular, and therefore any two stars fairly
close together, say within a hundred light-years of each other, move
at nearly the same velocity. The sun isa typical star and has a nearly
circular orbit. The difference between the velocity the sun actually
has and what it would have if its orbit were exactly circular is found
by comparing its motion with the average for all stars in its vicinity.
This variation from the average velocity is called solar motion. It is
12 miles a second, as was found by several observers. The variation of
the rate of any star from the velocity it would have if its orbit were
circular can be similarly found. ‘These variations in the velocities of
stars caused by differences in the shapes of their orbits are often spoken
of as their “peculiar motions,” to distinguish them from the variations
in velocities caused by differences in distance from the center of the
galaxy.

Although an occasional star is found to have a velocity with respect
to the sun greater than 50 miles a second, it is never going in the
direction of the sun’s revolution around the galactic center. It is
always a slow star that we are overtaking. No stars have been found
that run as much faster than the sun as some of them run slower.
The reason is that they would be thrown out of the galaxy by centrif-
ugal effect if they did. Neighboring stars can go a little faster than
the sun, but they cannot go much faster. If a star should pass us
with a velocity as much as 30 or 40 miles a second greater than that
of the sun, we could bid it farewell, for such a motion would carry
it out of the stellar system beyond the gravitational control of the
stars.

In this way the puzzling stream of “high-speed stars” was ex-
plained by Lindblad in simple terms of gravitation. They are really
low-velocity stars at the slow end of eccentric orbits, and we, and
other stars of fairly uniform speed, are overtaking and passing them.
These eccentric stars will in time fall in toward the center, regaining
speed, but now they are lagging badly behind.
OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE”—SKILLING 131

And the extreme high speed of globular clusters of stars, as much
as 170 miles a second, simply means that these clusters are not part
of our galaxy at all, or at least do not rotate with it, and the observed
velocity is really our own speed of travel with the galaxy as we go
rapidly past the stationary clusters.

Soon after Lindblad’s explanation of “high-velocity” stars and other
phenomena of stellar motion, a Dutch astronomer, Oort, developed
a direct method of studying the rotation of the galaxy by using the
velocities of many stars at known distances from us. He worked out
a comparatively simple means of using such measurements to learn

a great deal about the stellar system and our position in it. His plan
of procedure has been used since then by a number of astronomers,
who have applied it to various classes of stars. Notwithstanding the
great difficulty of making the required measurements the different
workers have arrived at very similar results.

Oort’s plan is based on the fact that revolving bodies controlled
by a central attractive force move at unequal speeds depending on
differences in distances from the center (fig. 1). The different veloci-
ties of planets revolving around the sun illustrate this. Pluto, the
outermost planet known, travels at 3 miles a second; Jupiter, nearer
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

the sun, at 8.1 miles; the earth at 18.5; and Mercury, nearest the sun,
has an average speed of nearly 30 miles a second.

Our solar system of sun and planets has practically all its mass
at the center; 996% percent of it resides in the sun, only one-seventh
of 1 percent in the planets. Being so constituted, the rate of motion
of a planet at any known distance from the center is very simply
calculated by means of Kepler’s great discovery of more than 300
years ago, his law of “harmonic motion.”

The rate of motion (and the period) of a star at any given dis-
tance from the center of the stellar system is not so easily found,
for the mass of the system is more widely distributed. There is
no great central star dominating all else. If the distribution of
material in the stellar system were quite uniform throughout, with
no concentration of stars toward the center, the whole flattened
Milky Way system would rotate as a wheel, and we could detect no
motion at all unless we could observe some outside landmarks, such
as extragalactic nebulae, that do not revolve with the stars.

Actually, however, the stars of our galaxy are sufficiently con-
centrated near its center to give measurably different stellar veloci-
ties. Yet the galaxy is so large and the difference of velocity as
seen from the earth so small that our greatest telescopes are needed
to observe the relative motion; even with the largest telescopes we
cannot observe individual stars of our system as far away as the
center of the galaxy, and only with difficulty can star velocities be
measured as far as one-fourth the distance to the galactic center.
Since Oort’s method of detecting and computing the rotation of the
stellar system depended upon measuring their relative motion, his
work had to be based upon observations of the most distant observ-
able stars. But even these are relatively close in terms of the dimen-
sions of the galactic whirlpool.

Because the closest stars that can be used in obtaining data for
Oort’s method had to be more than 1,000 light-years distant from us,
Plaskett and Pearce of the Dominion Observatory, Victoria, B. C.,
worked with those very hot and white giants of classes O and B.
Rigel, lying at the foot of Orion, is one of these and is one of our
brightest-appearing stars, but being only about 500 light-years away
is too close to be used in Oort’s method. However, stars of this type
can easily be seen at much greater distances with such a telescope
as the one at Victoria.

Others have used those reddest of all stars, the N type, which aver-
age several hundred times the brightness of the sun. The so-called
planetary nebulae are stars surrounded by gas, which makes them ex-
ceptionally luminous. The peculiar, brilliant gas, supposed to have
been thrown out by some violent explosion long ago, can be seen at
OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE” —SKILLING 133

astonishing distances. But in some respects the best stars of all to
show rotation of the galaxy are the Cepheid variables, the stars that
gave distances to the spiral nebulae as mentioned above. Joy, at the
Mount Wilson Observatory, has studied about 150 of these, dis-
tributed mainly along the Milky Way. ‘The results thus obtained
are very dependable because of the unusually reliable manner, ex-
plained above, in which their distances can be determined.

Motions of these stars could theoretically be measured in two ways:
by getting the angular distance they travel across the sky in a cer-
tain length of time—their “cross motion”—or by finding the speed
in miles a second by which they come closer to us or move farther
away—“radial motion” or “motion in the line of sight.” The spectro-
scope will measure this line-of-sight speed. The lines of the spectrum
of an approaching or receding star are shifted a little toward the blue
or the red end of the spectrum as a result of the motion. This is
often called the Doppler shift. The greater the speed of the star
the greater the shift.

Cross motion is not useful in studying galactic rotation, as many
years must elapse between the taking of two photographs of the
stars to show any appreciable change in their positions. But the
spectrum of a star can be photographed in a few minutes (or hours,
depending on its dimness) and the star’s radial velocity is found
immediately.

The general principle of Oort’s method may be readily understood
by considering the solar system. A planet, such as Venus, when
nearest the earth and directly between us and the sun has cross
motion because it goes faster than the earth, but it has no radial
motion that would be indicated by the spectroscope because it is keep-
ing parallel to the earth’s orbit and so is not changing its distance
from the earth. Likewise Mars when nearest the earth on the opposite
side from the sun is not changing its radial distance, although it has
cross motion because it moves slower than the earth.

If we assume another planet a little in advance of the earth, or
behind it, in the same orbit, the hypothetical planet would show
no radial motion. The spectroscope would show it as a stationary
object. But in all other directions except these four—toward the
center, away from the center, straight ahead, or straight behind—
planets would appear to be coming closer to us or getting farther
away from us, and the spectroscope could measure this speed of
approach or recession.

So it is with the stars. Those directly ahead of us or behind us
in our revolution about a common galactic center, and those toward
the center and away from the center, show no motion in the line
of sight to be measured by the spectroscope. (This would be true
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

except for the special motions already mentioned, usually slight,
for which correction can be made.) All other stars—all that are not
in these four directions—both those farther from the center of the
system than we are and those closer to it, have more or less apparent
motion in the line of sight. Those having the greatest motion are
the stars halfway between the points of no motion. Therefore, at
45° along the Milky Way to each side of the center of the stellar
system and at 45° each side of the anticenter maximum radial motion
is indicated by the spectroscope.

Hence, spectroscopic measurements of radial velocities of stars along
the Milky Way will show where the center is, around which the stars
revolve. It must be at one of the points of zero radial velocity, and
halfway between two points of maximum velocity. It is found to be
in the Milky Way in the direction of the great star clouds of Sagit-
tarius and Scorpio. The anticenter (180° from the center) is in the
Milky Way where the constellations of Taurus, Auriga, and Gemini
meet. A third point of interest is the one toward which the solar sys-
tem is moving. It is in the Milky Way also, and naturally is at right
angles to the line leading to the center. It is located in Cygnus, near
the star Deneb.

The distance to the center, as well as the direction to it, can be found
from the star velocities given by the spectroscope. The principle upon
which this is done may be briefly stated. A star at the same distance
as the sun from their common center of revolution would, if fairly
near the sun, be almost in the tangent to the sun’s orbit (that is, 90°
from their common center). But if the star is 6 or 8 thousand light-
years ahead of the sun, it would have turned in toward the center
several degrees from the tangent at the sun. At 1,000 light-years
distance it would be seen about 1° off the tangent, or 89° from the
center instead of 90°. Cepheid variables were measured out to a dis-
tance of about 8,000 light-years from the sun. The direction to a star
at that distance with no radial motion is not quite the same as the
direction to a closer star with no radial motion. There is a measurable
angle which gives the curvature of the sun’s orbit. (See fig. 1.)
Joy’s result with Cepheids and the results of others using different
classes of stars agree very well in giving about 33,000 light-years as
the distance of the solar system from the galactic center in Sagittarius.

The diameter of the whole stellar system has been estimated at about
100,000 light-years; hence our place in the system is about two-thirds
of the way out from the center toward the edge of the Milky Way,
in the direction of the constellation Auriga and away from the con-
stellation Sagittarius.

Another interesting value growing out of these spectroscopic meas-
urements is the velocity of sun and stars around the great central
nucleus of star clouds.
OUR REVOLVING “ISLAND UNIVERSE”—SKILLING 135

The result actually given by the star’s spectrum is the component
of velocity directed toward or away from the observer. (See fig. 1.)
The maximum value of this line-of-sight velocity is called Oort’s con-
stant because it figures so prominently in the method devised by Oort
for studying galactic rotation. It isa constant quantity for any given
difference in distance to stars along the Milky Way: for each additional
1,000 light-years in any of the four directions of maximum radial mo-
tion, the radial motion increases about 314 miles a second. Thus, for
a star at 8,000 light-years from us the spectroscope should show a
velocity of about 28 miles a second. Using the well-known laws of
gravitation, this value can be related to the speed of rotation of the
galaxy. Oort worked out an equation in which his “constant” would
be one of the known terms, the distance to the center another known
term, and the velocity of the sun the unknown term to be found.

Based upon the above principles various observers have arrived at
somewhere near 170 miles a second as the velocity of the sun and its
planets in their revolution around the center. Most of the stars that
are near enough to be visible to the naked eye move at about the same
speed, and that is why a great telescope is needed to study the revolu-
tion of the galaxy.

Knowing the velocity of the sun and its distance from the center
it is a mere matter of arithmetic to find its period of revolution around
the center. The radius of the orbit is 33,000 light-years, each light-
year being nearly 6 trillion miles. The period found proves to be in
the neighborhood of 200 million years.

Geologists place the age of the earth at around 2,000 million years,
basing their estimate on the chemical analysis of rocks containing the
radioactive element uranium and a peculiar kind of lead into which
it very slowly changes at a known rate. The relative amounts of the
two metals show when the rock was formed. From these figures it
would seem that the sun and earth have had time for only about 10
revolutions around the distant center of the stellar system since the
earth was formed and solidified.

Slow and difficult as it has been to work out and prove this theory
of galactic rotation, the theory simplifies astronomy by relating to one
another various puzzling facts about motion that are hard to under-
stand one by one. Such matters as “star streaming,” “asymmetry of
motion,” and “high- and low-velocity stars,” are more easily explained
together than separately. In this respect the rotation theory has, in a
measure, paralleled the heliocentric theory of the solar system by
which Copernicus explained such riddles as “retrograde motion” of
planets.

[With 4 plates]

The idea of transmutation seems to have arisen among the
Alexandrian Greeks in the early centuries of our era, and to have been
transmitted to western Europe by the Arabs. The alchemy of the
Middle Ages was something more than the pretended art of turning
base metals into gold by the philosopher’s stone: it was a phase in the
development of systematic chemistry. In the sixteenth century
Paracelsus gave it a new direction by declaring that its true object was
not the making of gold but the preparation of medicines, and this led
to increasing attention being paid to the investigation of the proper-
ties of substances and of their effects on the human body (1).

It was not, however, until 1896 that the dream of the alchemists was
realized with the discovery of the “natural” radioactivity of uranium
by Becquerel (2), when the first genuine transmutation was recognized.
Within two years Madame Curie discovered radium, with a radioac-
tivity (in the pure state) several million times that of uranium (8).
This “gave an impetus to the systematic chemical examination of ura-
nium minerals and soon led to the detection of several new radioactive
bodies” (4). Almost as soon as they were discovered their effects on
the human body were studied, and the consequence to physics, medi-
cine, and later to industry of the discovery of radioactivity has been
immense, but the distribution of the radioactive material has been
much influenced by international conditions during the (nearly) 50
years since radium was discovered. Half the world’s supply of radium
at the time of the last war was taken by industry, and its value rose
to 100,000 times that of gold (5). This philosopher’s stone, presented

to the world for nothing by the Curies (6), was now selling at a very
high price.

But away from the distractions of the world of industry the first
successful “artificial” disintegration of ordinary chemical elements
was made by Rutherford in 1919 at Cambridge by passing alpha par-
ticles through nitrogen which produced scintillations on a screen when
the absorbing matter present was greater than that which corresponded
to the ordinary range of alpha particles (4). Rutherford concluded
that the scintillations were due to particles ejected with great speed
from the nitrogen nucleus by impact of an alpha particle, and sug-
gested that these particles were hydrogen nuclei or protons. Evidence
of the capture of an alpha particle by the nucleus of the nitrogen atom
was obtained by Blackett (7) a few years later by photographing al-
pha-ray tracks in a Wilson expansion chamber. In 1934, Joliot and
Curie (daughter of Madame Curie) gave the first chemical proof of
artificial transmutation and of the capture of the alpha particle (8).

The alpha particle, with its two positive charges, has twice the
potential barrier to surmount in order to penetrate an atomic nucleus
as a single charged particle, and consequently search was made for a
means of accelerating hydrogen nuclei or protons carrying a single
positive charge. Most investigators used high voltages for the pur-
pose, but among those interested in the subject was E. O. Lawrence,
born 2 years after the discovery of radium, who saw a paper by the
German physicist, Wideroe, describing a method for energizing ionized
particles by hollow cylindrical electrodes in a tandem pair, each elec-
trode being connected to the leg of an oscillating high-frequency cir-
cuit. Lawrence conceived the idea of raising the efficiency of the
system, without increasing the length of the apparatus to unmanage-
able proportions, by giving the particles a circular motion by employ-
ing a powerful magnetic field within which a hollow electrode was
fixed. A design for “a magnetic resonance accelerator for ions” was
made, and a model of the apparatus tried out. It worked, and was
given the nickname of “cyclotron” (9). With a linear accelerator and
an oscillating current of 40 kv., 30 tandem electrodes would be required
to achieve an ion energy of 1.2 mev.; 150 revolutions in the cyclotron
with an oscillating current of only 4 kv., however, produces ions of
equal energy (10). The result has been a succession of cyclotrons (see
table 1) built at the University of California, Berkeley, by a team
which were said “not to know the meaning of a regulated existence .. .
as day and night the work went on” (10).

_ 8A single hollow D-electrode was used in the early apparatus; later a pair of D-shaped
electrodes, now a characteristic feature of cyclotron design, were used.

Each apparatus was bigger than its predecessor and capable of
producing greater quantities of radioactive material (pl. 1, fig.1). In1
day (1940) as much radio sodium, as measured by gamma-ray activity,
could be made as would correspond with 100 mg. of radium. For an
initial cost of some £10,000 (prewar of course) and with annual run-
ning costs of, say, £2,000, a cyclotron could yield energies of 8 million
electron-volts or the energy equivalent of gamma radiation from
100,000 g. of radium (11). But while the cost was trivial compared
with that of radium, the size of the apparatus was becoming consid-
erable and much additional space was required for the devices neces-
sary to protect those who came near the machine at ‘work. When one
looks at a cloud-chamber photograph (pl. 1, fig. 2) “and realizes that
it represents the ionization which occurs in a layer of one’s body
about a thousandth of an inch thick every one-hundredth of a second,
the amount of ionization present in the body of anyone standing near
the cyclotron becomes impressive” (12). Stage by stage the technical
difficulties of these huge machines were surmounted, and the scientific
investigations begun. A study of the properties of artificial radio-
active substances is now proceeding apace, and alongside this, work
has begun on their effects on the human body.‘ This paper is con-
cerned with the constructive applications of the new discovery to
medicine and the way in which the cyclotron can be used in “the
preparation of medicines.”

Not long before the United States entered the war, the designer of
the cyclotron was described to an American audience in these words:
“Lawrence and his collaborators are providing medicine, biology, and
physics with agents that should revolutionize our knowledge of the
structure of the world and everything that lives in it” (13). The

*This work is being directed by Lawrence’s medical brother (J. H. Lawrence) at the
Crocker laboratory, built, equipped and staffed for the sole purpose of studying and
developing the biological applications of the cyclotron (No. 3 of table 1) housed in the
building (10).
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

harnessing of atomic energy resulting from the artificial disintegra-
tion or transmutation of elements could indeed transform the world
in a manner beyond the dreams of the old alchemists. Against the
background of world war and the sinister possibilities that can be con-
jured up, it is to be hoped that the future results of “atom smashing”
will not be merely destructive but rather for greater social integration
and the increased welfare of mankind (14).

THE CYCLOTRON AS A MEDICAL INSTRUMENT

The physics of the cyclotron have been described in other papers
in this Journal and elsewhere (9, 15). It was first designed for use
in the domain of atomic physics, but it has provided medicine and
biology with two new tools for research, viz, a beam of very pene-
trating uncharged particles or neutrons® and an array of artifi-
cially radioactive substances which can be used in two different
ways. They can be administered in quantities so small that their
presence can be detected only by sensitive physical apparatus, and
in this high dilution no biological effects of the substance can be
observed with the means at present available. The progress of the
radioactive atom through the organs of plant, animal, or man can,
however, be followed by physical detectors, and yields information
otherwise unobtainable. Illustrations of the use of these “tagged
atoms” or tracers in biological and clinical research will be given
later.

In larger quantity, radioactive substances can be administered so
that the radiation they emit is used in some localized region of
the body to produce definite biological changes—usually destructive
ones such as the elimination of unwanted cells. The problem in this
case is to localize the radioactive substance in the particular region
required. This is not always so difficult as it might seem at first
sight. Selective absorption of certain substances in particular
organs has been familiar for a long time. And since virtually all
the known elements can now be made artificially radioactive, it is
possible to select the most suitable element for the purpose required
and then proceed to make a radioactive compound in the composi-
tion of which it is included. The length of life of the artificial
product is the limiting factor and that cannot be predetermined.
This therapeutic administraton of radioactive substances is a more
difficult field of research than metabolic studies with tracer sub-
stances, and progress must of necessity be slower and less spectacular.
But already it is possible in certain instances (see later) to achieve
as much by the internal administration of a radioactive element in

can be produced.
MEDICAL USES OF THE CYCLOTRON—SPEAR 141

the patient’s own home as could previously be done by a series of
exposures to X-radiation which is a much more exhausting experi-
ence for the patient and requires either in-patient accommodation
or at least frequent visits to the clinic or hospital. Radioactive
elements prepared by the Berkeley cyclotron are distributed (usually
by airplane) to various parts of America for use in hospitals and
laboratories. In 1942 there were 13 cyclotrons in the United States
and 9 planned or in building. There were 10 in other countries,
including 3 in England.

The neutron beam provided by the cyclotron is thousands of times
more powerful than any other method at present can furnish. Neu-
trons ionize in a different manner from that of gamma- or X-rays,
and, since ionization and biological action are linked, the biological
action of neutrons on normal and diseased tissues constitutes a new
and wide field of research.

These three uses of the cyclotron in biological research will now be
considered in greater detail.

TAGGED ATOMS IN TRACER SUBSTANCES

Radioactive or tagged atoms are used to enable the investigator
te see where the rest of his material is going—in just the same man-
ner as tracer bullets are used in antiaircraft or other gunfire (16).

The method was used first by Hevesy (17) in 1923 when he em-
ployed radium D as a tracer for its isotope lead, and later radium
E for bismuth in his studies on plant metabolism. These substances
are not, however, those normally used by plants, and were admittedly
foreign substances introduced into the plant’s economy for experi-
mental purposes. The great advantage of the artificially produced
radioactivity is that substances can be selected which are natural to
the plant’s metabolism. One radioactive atom in a million is sufficient
for the progress of the substance to be followed with extreme ac-
curacy by physical detectors and at this dilution no biological effects
of the radioactivity can be detected. By “tagging” atoms of a sub-
stance natural to the plant or animal under observation it is possible
to discriminate between the added compound and similar compounds
already present in the system. This is a conspicuous advantage over
ordinary methods of chemical and biochemical analysis where added
substances are indistinguishable from those already present.

It is possible to make radioactive isotopes of all the stable ele-
ments, and these isotopes behave identically with the commonly ob-
tained element both chemically and physiologically. The two differ
only in the fact that the artificial product is physically detectable
by its radioactivity in whatever chemical reactions it takes part. A
list of some of the more commonly used radioactive elements is given
in table 2 (18).

Tracer substances have proved of great value in studying metabolic
process in plants and animals, but it must not be supposed that their
introduction has supplanted ordinary chemical methods which still
have a recognized place and use. A new tool is not necessarily the
best for all purposes.

An ingenious device is used at Berkeley for the preparation of
radioactive substances simultaneously with the production of neu-
trons for other purposes. The substance to be activated, e. g., red
phosphorus, is introduced into the vacuum chamber of the cyclotron
on probes so arranged as not to interfere with the bombardment of
the beryllium target and the emission of neutrons from the target
chamber (19). The cyclotron vacuum has, however, to be broken
when the probes are inserted or withdrawn at intervals of several
days.

Various methods are used for the detection of tracer substances:

(a) Measurement of uptake.-—An animal is fed with a radioactive
substance and after a given time is sacrificed. An assessment is then
made of the radioactivity of any or all the organs of its body. The
process is repeated with other animals of the same species killed after
different intervals. The assessments of radioactive material are then
plotted against time on a graph, the quantity of material being given
as a percentage of substance originally administered found per gram
of tissue examined. It is, of course, not necessary to use the whole
organ in every case; a weighed portion may be used instead, and in
MEDICAL USES OF THE CYCLOTRON—SPEAR 143

some cases a piece can be taken from the animal under anesthesia
without killing it.

(b) Autophotography—the tracer substance is administered and
after the predetermined time the animal is killed or a portion of an
organ removed (biopsy) under anesthesia. The tissue is sectioned as
for microscopic purposes and some of the sections are stained with
colored dyes and others placed upon photographic plates. The areas
of fogging, which correspond to radioactive deposits, are compared
with the almost identical stained preparations and the distribution
of the tracer substance studied qualitatively. In this method the
sections used for fogging plates are impregnated in the final stage of
preparation with collodion in place of the parafiin customarily used
in histological work. For large organs, such as one of the long bones,
the autophotograph can be compared with an X-ray picture of the
same part (e. g., see pl. 3, fig. 2). Very thin substances—the leaf
of a plant, for example—do not need to be sectioned on a microtome
but can be placed direct upon the photographic plate (pl. 2, fig 1).
The fogging of the plate is due to the emission of the beta rays from
the tracer substance, and the best photographic results are obtained
when something like 210° beta particles per sq. cm. strike the film
during the exposure period.

(c) Geiger counter—A method involving the sacrifice of the subject
under examination is obviously not applicable to hospital practice!

For the detection of tracer substances in human subjects a prepara-
tion is chosen which emits gamma radiation (e. g., radio iodine).
After administration, a Geiger counter, placed on the surface of the
body (16, 20) over the organ to be investigated, records the radio-
activity due to tracer present (pl. 2, fig. 2). Radio iodine is made by
the deuteron bombardment of metallic tellurium, and has a half-life
of 8 days. It emits both beta and gamma rays.

(d) Double tag—An ingenious modification of the autophoto-
graphic method is occasionally used. By using the unstable H* in
the preparation of the dyes fer staining it is possible to combine
color change and radioactivity in the same preparation.

By such methods it has been possible to show the selective absorp-
tion of various activated substances in particular tissues; a variation
in absorption in different states of activity of living tissues due either
to normal circumstances in health or abnormal conditions imposed
by disease; and even a variation in different parts of the same cell (21)
which can be examined after disintegration of a mass of cells by the
ultracentrifuge which separates the central and heavier nuclear mate-
rial from the surrounding and lighter cytoplasm.

The amount of tracer substance taken up depends on the total con-
tent of the same (inactive or natural) elements in the tissue at the time
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

of administration of the tracer element, the rate of turn-over of the
material in the organ concerned, and whether or not new tissues are
being laid down, 1. e., active cell multiplication, is going on at the time.

Radio sodium, an emitter of gamma rays, given to a patient by the
mouth as common salt, can be detected by means of a Gieger counter
within 2 minutes of administration, in the fingertips. The ele-
ment ,;,Na** has a very short half-life of 14.8 hours, and less than 10
percent is eliminated from the body within the period of measurable
activity.° It is excreted by the urine and sweat glands.

Radio tron fed to cows appears in the milk within 24 hours. It is
taken up selectively by the red corpuscles of the blood and by bone
marrow, and in anemic animals the uptake is over 50 times that of
normal animals. Its absorption depends on the organism’s need for
iron and it is best administered in a series of small doses as the per-
centage uptake is greater under these conditions. It used to be thought
that the iron content of the body was regulated by excretion, but
observation with radio iron has shown that just as much iron is
excreted by anemic dogs as by healthy ones.

Radio iodine is taken up rapidly and in large quantity by the
thyroid gland, which absorbs 5,000 times as much as other tissues.
The concentration of radio iodine (8- and y-ray emitter) can be
raised in animals to a level which leads to the complete destruction
of the gland, yet the action is so localized that the adjacent parathy-
roid gland is unaffected (pl. 3, fig. 1). The activity of the unhealthy
thyroid gland varies markedly according to the nature of the disease
affecting it. In a state of overactivity (hyperthyroidism) the uptake
of radio iodine is rapid, and this is followed by a rapid loss of the
element. Loss of glandular activity is reflected in a very small uptake
of iodine. It is possible to classify different types of disease of the
gland by the radio-iodine uptake. In malignant disease of the thyroid
its cells, unfortunately, lose their capacity to take up iodine, so that
it is unlikely that cancer of this gland can be treated by the adminis-
tration of radio iodine.

Radio carbon has been used in the study of plant metabolism and
quite revolutionary discoveries have been made, especially as regards
the capacity of plants to reduce carbon dioxide. Others besides the
chlorophyll-producing plants can reduce carbon dioxide, and the
latter, contrary to general belief, are able to do so in complete dark-
ness though the activity is less than one-twentieth of that in sun-
light. It takes 100 minutes for radio carbon to be built up into the
plant solids. Barley can synthesize sugar from radio carbon in 2

*In designating a specific isotope of an element, the total mass is written as a super-
scription on the right of the chemical symbol and the atomic number as a subscription on
the left.
MEDICAL USES OF THE CYCLOTRON—SPEAR 145

hours. Perhaps the neatest way to manufacture “tagged” sugar, since
chemical synthesis of sugar is a difficult process, is by the action of
bacteria in reducing carbon dioxide made with radio carbon.

Radio calcium and radio strontium are taken up selectively by bone,
especially in regions where active growth is taking place. Radio
strontium, with a half-life of 55 days, is preferable to radio calcium
whose half-life is 180 days and cannot be prepared in the same high
concentration as radio strontium. The two elements belong to the
same group of the periodic table and have similar chemical and
physiological properties. A striking illustration of the deposition
of radio strontium in growing bone is shown in plate 3, figure 2. Five
hundred millicuries of the element were given to a child 2 days before
amputation of the leg for a cancerous growth. An autophotograph
of a longitudinal section of the leg, compared with an X-ray photo-
graph on the same scale, shows the deposition of the radioactive ele-
ment in the tumor cells (malignant. growth) and in the epiphysial
line (normal bone growth).

Radio phosphorus is taken up by bone, bone marrow, spleen, lymph
nodes, and liver as well as by certain cancerous growths (sarcomata).
Its use in the treatment of blood diseases is described in the next
section.

Tracer substances are also being used to study the metabolism of
insects and in some interesting studies in comparative morphology.
Organs supposed to be homologous in different species can be tested
for their uptake of certain radio elements and their activity compared.
True homologues deal similarly with a given radio element.

THERAPEUTIC ADMINISTRATION OF RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES

Since it was known that some substances are selectively absorbed in
animals and man, the question arises whether this fact can be used for
therapeutic purposes. The idea of intracellular radiation opens up
quite a new field of radiation technique. X- or gamma radiation, as
normally applied, reaches the cells upon which it is directed by passing
through layers of normal cells whose resistance to the radiation consti-
tutes a limiting factor in the dosage attainable. The rays also have a
constitutional effect known as radiation sickness, which may assume
serious proportions. There is now a large range of artificially radio-
active substances which are absorbed by cells and emit their energy
from within the cell boundary (22a). They are all temporarily radio-
active with a wide range of radiation energy from soft beta rays to
high-energy gamma rays, and they can be administered with far less
danger of producing radiation sickness.

Radio iodine has been used in a few cases of thyroid disease but is
unlikely to be of use for malignant growths in the gland. The heavy
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

homologue of iodine, known as element 85, was first prepared at Berk-
eley and has similar properties.

The administration of radio strontium is still in the early experi-
mental stage. It is selectively absorbed in bone.

The furthest developments have been made with radio phosphorus
which has now been used therapeutically on a relatively large scale.
Radio phosphorus, ;,P*%?, is prepared by the bombardment of red phos-
phorus with high-speed deuterons (heavy hydrogen nuclei). In the
reaction, the proton is repelled and the neutron captured, so that the
stable red phosphorus ,;P** becomes the unstable isotope ;;P* which
breaks down spontaneously to stable sulfur ;.S** with the emission of a
beta ray which can be detected physically. The half-life of radio
phosphorus, i. e., the time during which its energy is reduced to one-
half by the break-down of its unstable atoms, is 14.3 days. It is usu-
ally used as the compound Na,HPO,, disodium hydrogen phosphate,
in a dilution of 15 mg. per cc. or the equivalent of 0.4 millicurie of Ra
when freshly prepared.

Ordinary phosphorus occurs in all living tissues. A phosphorus
atom spends, on an average, about 2 months in the body of a rat before
it is excreted. But its speed of movement in different organs of the
body varies widely. For example in muscle the uptake, “turn-over,”
and elimination is rapid and the concentration of phosphorus at any
given time low. In bone, on the other hand, the turn-over is slow
and local concentration high. In growing tissues the uptake is more
rapid than in adult. Radio phosphorus is taken up selectively by
bone and bone marrow, spleen, lymph, and liver, and by proliferating
cells anywhere both normal and malignant. In the case of bone, the
rate at which radio phosphorus is deposited in normal, rapidly grow-
ing and cancerous tissue is a function of the activity of the enzyme
alkaline phosphatase (22 ¢). But the results show an individual vari-
ation in the actual amount deposited, and a variation for different
parts of the same tumor in the case of malignant growths, i. e., when
autophotographs are made the fogging of the plates is uneven.

There are certain human blood diseases characterized by the over-
production of blood cells, either the white (leukemia) or the red
(polycythemia), and since radio phosphorus is selectively absorbed
in the lymphatic tissues and bone marrow where the overproduction
occurs, this element has been tried therapeutically in the treatment of
these diseases with encouraging results. The uptake of radio phos-
phorus in leukemia is greatly in excess of that in a normal healthy
animal or person, and in a concentration which reduces, at least tem-
porarily, the great excess of white blood cells (fig. 1). Ifthe trouble is
an overproduction of red cells, their reduction is effected by a concen-

MEDICAL USES OF THE CYCLOTRON—SPEAR 147

tration of the salt in the bone marrow, where red cells are manufac-
tured, without disturbing the normal number of white in circulation.
The presence of cancer (sarcoma) “screens” both kinds of blood cells
so that doses of radio phosphorus which would normally have affected
the blood-cell count have no such effect if a tumor is present, as the
radio phosphorus becomes concentrated in the tumor cells (pl. 4,
fig. 1).

Fieure 1.—The effect of radio phosphorus in reducing the excessive white-cell
count (Ww, B. c.) in a ease of leukemic disease of the blood (22a). The red-cell
count (R. B. c.) is practically unaltered.

Radio phosphorus was first used therapeutically in 1936, when it
was found that its beneficial effect on certain blood diseases resembled
that following X-radiation. It is still early to judge its usefulness,
but it is clear already that artificial radioactivity is at least as good
as the X-radiation treatment and far less inconvenient for the patient.
Neither is a certain cure, but considerable periods of relief are often
obtained before the blood shows abnormality again. It is possible
that better results will be obtained by a combination of (external)
radiotherapy and (internal) administration of radio salts, but it will
take some time to determine what is the best form in which to give
the combined treatment.

MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF NEUTRONS

The bombardment of beryllium by deuterons in the cyclotron pro-
duces a yield of high-energy neutrons which is of sufficient intensity
for radiotherapeutic trials. For this purpose the cyclotron (No. 20
of table 1) was made more “presentable” from the patient’s point of
view by being enclosed in a shell of white-enameled woodwork which
concealed the entire apparatus and the protecting screens of wax and
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

water (pl. 4, fig. 2). A small hole was left through which a canalized
beam of neutrons emerged. The attempts began in 1938, and caution
was needed because of the danger of serious damage to normal tissue.
Cancer patients were chosen, however, whose condition was hopeless
from every other point of view. This was perhaps hardly a fair test
of the usefulness of a neutron beam in medicine, and it was not to be
expected that the results would be in any way spectacular. ‘To begin
with, 24 patients, all in the advanced stages of their disease, repre-
senting hopelessly incurable cancer, received cautiously administered
doses, the magnitude of which was determined in a purely arbitrary
fashion (10). Because of the fixed limitations of space, at first only
lesions confined to the head and neck could be treated. These experi-
ments served to supply information concerning skin tolerance, depth
dosage, and the nature of the primary response of tumor tissue.
Later on, with an improved lay-out, a larger number of patients were
given neutron irradiation, and these provided a wide diversity of
tumors including sites other than the head and neck. So far the
results have not been too good (table 3). But neutrons have already
caused the disappearance of a malignant growth (23), though no such
case is regarded as a cure until several years have elapsed since treat-
ment. Compared with the results of X- and gamma radiation of
cancer, neutrons have not so far proved better, but they have been
useful in a few instances where X-rays had been tried and failed. It
will obviously take time to discover what is the best way in which to
give them, e. g., what should be the total dose, intensity, number of
exposures, over-all time, the precise method of combination with other
types of radiation, and so on.

A great deal of experimental work has been going on besides the
relatively few therapeutic trials which have been made, and the
biological effects of neutrons on a variety of tissues have been studied
and the results compared with those produced by other types of pene-
MEDICAL USES OF THE CYCLOTRON—SPEAR 149

trating radiations, both at Berkeley and elsewhere (24). There
is, however, as yet no accepted physical unit by which neutron and
X- or gamma-ray dosage can be directly compared. If intensity
of radiation is measured in ion pairs per centimeter, then neutron
intensity is a thousand times that of gamma rays.

At Berkeley the unit dose of neutrons is measured by means of a
Victoreen ionization chamber and the dose is described as 1 “n-unit”
when the Victoreen (calibrated for X-rays) records 1 roentgen.’
Measured in these terms, it is reckoned that 1n is equivalent to about
2.5 r. (25). The crucial question, however, is whether neutrons can
bring about desirable biological reactions which cannot be obtained
with other types of radiation. Investigations on the effects of neu-
trons on cancerous growths in animals as well as human beings were
being made, up to the outbreak of war, to test this point. It is
possible that best results will eventually be obtained by combining
neutron irradiation with other forms of treatment. It is already
clear that there are differences in the biological action of neutrons
and X-rays, and effort must now be directed to exploit these dif-
ferences to the advantage of radiotherapeutic treatment.

Neutrons are very penetrating. When “cross-fire’ methods are
used 30 to 40 percent of the dosage comes from the opposite side.
Much work needs still to be done on the comparative effects of slow
and fast neutrons (26) and the exclusion of neutrons from regions
where they are not wanted.

In spite of their penetrating abilities neutrons are more easily
absorbed by such light elements as water, wax, and especially borax
than by heavy elements such as lead or platinum, though blocks of
lead are used in canalizing the beam for medical and biological
experiments (27). The demand for cyclotron time was so heavy
when apparatus 26 (table 1) was in full running, that it was decided
to build a new and bigger machine (No. 3 of table 1) to be reserved
for medical and biological work. Before this aparatus was completed
plans were begun for the giant cyclotron on the hills behind the Uni-
versity campus. It was decided that protection would be a serious
problem with this machine and that it would be best to isolate it as
far as possible from other laboratories. Even with cyclotron 20
there was unavoidable interference by penetrating neutrons with
delicate physical apparatus in nearby laboratories, particularly in
the chemical department adjacent to the cyclotron building. The
cyclotron team arranged a special signal to warn their neighbors that
neutrons were about to be liberated in their neighborhood; it was

possible to detect neutrons several miles away. The war has inter-
rupted much of the peacetime research of the medical cyclotron, but
a remark by Prof. Sir J. J. Thompson, of Cambridge, at Winnipeg
shortly after the discovery of radium applies equally well to the prod-
ucts of the cyclotron: “It is imperative, lest we should be passing over a
means of saving life and health, that the subject should be investi-
gated in a much more systematic and extensive manner than there
has yet been either time or material for” (18).

Looking down on the Berkeley campus of the University of Cali-
fornia, said to be the largest educational center in the world, across
the great expanse of San Francisco Bay, with its artificial island of
400 acres and with two of the greatest bridges in the world, the scene
is now dominated by the vast circular observatory-like building, 165
feet in diameter and 90 feet high, erected on a hilltop to house the
latest cyclotron. As we think of the human activity behind all this
achievement the motto on the California State Capitol seems peculiarly
appropriate—“Bring me men to match my mountains.”

Early in the winter of 1942 the Naval Medical Research Institute
became interested in the problem of prolonging survival after ship-
wreck. At this time the problem of procuring drinking water on life
rafts was in a confused state. Several methods had been developed
and many proposed, yet no coordinating agency existed to evaluate
the methods developed, or make recommendations for those proposed.
It was clear that in order to make progress in the problem of survival
an agency for coordinating the available data was necessary. Also
a need had arisen for answers to certain questions pertaining to the
practical and physiological aspects of the problem.

The “Drinkability of Sea Water” (1)? was first investigated be-
cause factual evidence on its effects was lacking and various rumors
were extant. It was soon learned that sea water was not potable,
since greater dehydration occurred with its use than without. This
was due not only to the large amount of water required to excrete the
salts of sea water, but also to the loss of water by vomitus and diarrhea
which frequently followed when the sea water was consumed at a too
rapid rate. In fact, it was found that for every volume of sea water
drunk, approximately two volumes of fresh water were required to
prevent electrolyte imbalance in the body.

Shortly after the experiments with the potability of sea water had
been completed, work was instituted to test and develop methods for
procuring potable water, to produce a physiological and practical
ration, and to provide means for the protection of survivors from the
elements, rain, heat, cold, sun, and sea.

Several methods for preparing drinking water from sea water on
life rafts were in a partial state of development. However, no method
approached practicability for life-raft use even though available infor-
mation intimated as much. In fact, few investigators realized that it
was a long step from the successful employment of a method under the
ideal conditions of the laboratory by skilled laboratory technicians
to its use under the trying conditions on a life raft by an inexperienced
individual. ‘Those responsible for the evaluation of the various sug-
gestions and devices pertaining to survival at sea soon realized how
little knowledge was available and how much had to be learned about
the entire problem.

Several methods for producing potable water from sea water had
reached a state of development sufficient to merit consideration for
life-raft use. The first four methods described below are based on
physical devices for producing potable water.

1. The Visscher body still—This still consisted essentially of a
vacuum pump to reduce pressure in the system and of a small boiler
strapped about the body to utilize body heat for fuel to distill fresh
water from sea water. Condensation of the water vapor was achieved
by immersing a coil and collecting bottle in sea water.

The still had much in its favor, though the disadvantages out-
weighed the advantages. It required the expenditure of a significant
amount of muscular energy to maintain the reduced pressure; in
northern latitudes, a partially fasting individual could ill afford to
lose the body heat required for the evaporation of the water. Sec-
ondly, considerable machine tooling and engineering were involved
in the production of a special vacuum pump which was to be subjected
to the corrosiveness of sea water The weight and volume ratios
(water produced per unit of weight or of volume occupied by the
apparatus) were very poor. Finally, the loss of any one part made
the still useless,

2. Safety fuel still (2)—“Canned heat” was used as fuel to distill
the sea water and the cool sea water was used to condense the water
vapor. The smallest model of this still, though possibly suitable for
large lifeboats, was much too bulky and heavy for life-raft use. Fur-
thermore, the still was affected by wind, wave, and rain as well as the
corrosiveness of sea water. Considerable manipulation and intelli-
gence were required for operation and, contrary to available data, the
still did not produce enough water on a weight-volume ratio to recom-
mend its use. It had many more parts than did the Visscher still so
the possibility of the still becoming inoperable through loss of a part
was greater.

3. Armbrust cup (3).—This method differed but little from a
method developed during the last war, whereby the moisture of the
DRINKING WATER FROM SEA WATER—CONSOLAZIO, ET AL. 155

breath was condensed in a wet felt-jacketed metal container. The
calculated efficiency peak for such a method is but 15 milliliters of
water per hour and even with a tight-fitting mask and a highly effi-
cient condenser this degree of efliciency was never reached in labora-
tory and field tests. Under experimental conditions a maximum of
5 milliliters per hour was attained and no subject was found who could
tolerate the device for 8 hours. Another limiting factor was that the
device required quantity production from an already overtaxed metal-
working industry.

4. Delano solar still (2), (4).—The source of heat for this still is
solar radiation. The sunlight passes through a transparent plastic
window and is absorbed by black toweling which backs up the plastic
sheet. The toweling is kept wet with sea water, and the evaporating
moisture condenses on the plastic window and drains into a reservoir
at the bottom of the still. Under ideal conditions the apparatus was
capable of producing 300 milliliters of water a day, but it was much
too fragile for life-raft use. In fact the models tested in the labor-
atory required continual repair. Another disadvantage was that the
apparatus had to be oriented to the sun. On a cloudy day, there-
fore, the efficiency of the still fell off markedly. In view of these
disadvantages and its bulk, the canned water, then available, was to
be preferred.

Since all the above devices were unsatisfactory, chemical methods
of treating sea water presented possibilities.

5. Goetz method (1).—This method was one of the earlier chemical
methods and one that received considerable publicity for the reason
that the ratio of water produced to the volume of chemical employed
was of the order of 14to1. It required little manipulation—sea water
was scooped into a plastic bag into which was dispersed a small pack-
age of silver and barium oxides. The chlorides of sea water were
precipitated as silver chloride, the sulfates as barium sulfate, resulting
in a solution of approximately 0.3 N alkali which caused the magnesium
in sea water to precipitate as magnesium hydroxide. The precipitate
was allowed to settle and was then clamped off in the bottom of the
bag leaving a cloudy supernatant fluid. Into this was stirred a cake
of citric acid which neutralized the sodium hydroxide to sodium ci-
trate. Thus the end result was the conversion of the approximately
3 percent sodium chloride of sea water into approximately 3.3 percent
sodium citrate.

The limiting factor in the use of this water was that the sodium
citrate was converted by the human organism into sodium bicarbonate,
with a resultant severe alkalosis. The kidneys, in order to rid the body
of this excess alkali excreted an excess of water, which led to more
severe dehydration than if the water had not been drunk. Though
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

the water was better than sea water, the combination of induced alka-
losis and dehydration condemned the method.

6. Aquamax method (5).—This relatively simple ion exchange
chemical method was limited by the fact that the weight and volume
ratio of water produced to chemical employed was too low for con-
sideration. Chemical analysis of the water produced permitted its
recommendation as drinking water, but no physiologic studies were
made. Development of a field kit would have lowered the ratio still
further.

7. Red Jacket (6)—This method was similar in principle to the
Aquamax method. The factor that limited its use was the low weight
and volume ratio. A field kit was developed which had much to rec-
ommend it for simplicity, but the added weight of the kit resulted in a
much lower water ratio.

8. British Permutit (7) and American Permutit (2), (8), (9).—
These methods were very similar and were in fact originally exactly
alike. A silver and barium zeolite was employed, which upon inter-
action with the salts of sea water caused the precipitation of silver
chloride and barium sulfate and sodium and magnesium zeolites. The
chemical was loosely packaged into a small cartridge, and a number
of the cartridges were packaged into a bakelite processing container.
The container, shaped in the form of a cylinder, had two removable
lids. On one end a filter was placed over a screwed-down cap with a
protruding teat. At the other end a screw cap with a rubber vent
allowed the formed gas, but not the water, to escape. Sea water was
scooped into the container to an inscribed mark, and the contents of a
cartridge were added. The top lid was screwed on and the contents
shaken for 20 minutes. The processed water was removed by sucking
on the teat at the bottom.

Although the original Permutit methods produced excellent water,
the ratio of water produced to chemical employed was almost as poor
as those of the previously mentioned methods. They had, further-
more, not been considered practical for life-raft use for a number of
reasons. First, it was less trouble and expense to package canned
water. Second, the method of processing was complicated; the parts
at times required mechanical tools for disassembling, especially the
screw caps. Third, the method of removing the drinking water was
much too difficult. Fourth, the resistance in the filtering system was
frequently too great for a man to suck out the water.

9. Naval Medical Research Institute method (2), (10), (11).—Dur-
ing the last part of 1942 a new chemical method for the preparation
of drinking water from sea water was discovered by Spealman (12).
Basically, the method consisted of adding silver oxide to sea water
and filtering off the precipitated silver chloride and magnesium hy-
DRINKING WATER FROM SEA WATER—CONSOLAZIO, ET AL. 157

droxide. Uric acid was then added to the filtrate, precipitating so-
dium urate which was filtered off.

The method was developed at the Naval Medical Research Institute
with field application primarily in mind. Two simple plastic bags
and two filters were designed so that minimum space was occupied
by these processing devices. The silver oxide was dispersed into the
sea water contained in one of the plastic bags. The contents were
then filtered into the second bag and the uric acid was dispersed into
the filtrate. A final filtration into the first bag, which had been rinsed
with sea water, produced potable water. The time required for the
complete operation was approximately 30 minutes. The produced
water, from a physiologic standpoint, was excellent but the taste al-
though not objectionable was slightly brackish.

The method produced 7.4 volumes of water per unit volume of
apparatus, a high ratio. The weight ratio, 5.6 of water to 1 of appara-
tus, also represented a very substantial improvement over other
methods.

The standards for drinking water for life-raft use had initially been
set empirically to meet the Treasury Department standards (13).
These standards were unnecessarily exacting for water that was to
be used for emergency purposes as they were adopted by the Treasury
Department on June 20, 1925, for drinking water and culinary water
supplied by common carriers in interstate commerce. The attempt to
meet these impractical and unphysiological standards was unfortu-
nately one of the prime factors in limiting the chemical methods since
the exacting demands lowered the weight and volume ratios.

The first approach to the problem of increasing the efficiency of the
chemical methods was to determine how much salt could be left in
drinking water. Two groups of men were placed on a semistarvation
regime (14) (15) and allowed 500 milliliters and 1,000 milliliters of
water per day. One half of each group had its water slightly salted
(0.3 to 0.4 grams of sodium chloride per 100 milliliters), the other
half drank distilled water. The men drinking distilled water excre-
ted between 3 and 4 grams of sodium chloride daily. The group
drinking 500 milliliters of slightly salted water conserved 100 milli-
liters of water per day more than the comparable 500-milliliter group
that drank distilled water. The group drinking 1,000 milliliters of
slightly salted water conserved 230 milliliters of water per day more
than the group that drank 1,000 milliliters of distilled water. By al-
lowing 0.3-0.4 percent salt to remain in drinking water a consider-
able reduction was made in the daily water requirement. Further-
more, considerable reduction was made in the chemical required for
producing potable water.

676212—46——11
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

It was evident, too, that a further gain in weight and volume ratio
could be made if the sulfate ion in sea water was not removed. Cur-
rent opinions arising from Treasury standards emphasized that sul-
fate in drinking water should be at a minimum (250 parts per
1,000,000) owing to the suspected cathartic action of the sulfate ion.
In order to elucidate this point, experiments were conducted with
men placed on a semistarvation regime, who drank 500 milliliters to
1,000 milliliters of water per day prepared from sea water by the
Naval Medical Research Institute method (15). In this experiment
all the magnesium but none of the sulfate was removed. Ill effects
were not observed and all the sulfate ingested in the water (50
ME/liter) was found to be excreted in the urme. The evidence showed
clearly that this quantity of sulfate was completely absorbed from
the intestinal tract and was not retained by the tissues. Under these
circumstances it could not act as a cathartic.

As already mentioned, the Permutit method was a single-step
chemical method. Its weight and volume ratios as originally em-
ployed, however, were extremely poor. It was demonstrated that if
the above adjustments in final chloride and sulfate content were made
and if a simple field kit were developed, the ratio of water produced
to apparatus employed could be increased to a point where it would
be superior to any other available method. The original low weight
and volume ratios were due to conformance to Treasury standards
which were not in accord with field requirements, and to the absence
of a practical field kit.

The following recommendations were consequently transmitted to
the Permutit Co.:

1. A collapsible processing container should be developed embodying the prin-
ciples worked out by the Naval Medical Research Institute and the National
Carbon Co., since this container had little volume or weight and was better
adapted to life-raft use.

2. The chemical should be formed into highly compressed briquets to con-
serve space.

3. Sodium chloride should be left in the drinking water to a concentration of
0.3-0.4 percent to increase the weight and volume ratio of the chemical and aid in
conservation of body water.

4. The sulfate need not be removed to further increase the weight and yolume
ratios.

5. A lightproof and waterproof method of packaging as developed by the In-
stitute and the Reynolds Metal Co. should be employed since it not only offered
excellent protection against exposure to water and light but added little to
weight or volume.

These recommendations were immediately adopted and prepara-
tions were made for raft trials, since it now had become obvious that
all the laboratory work done would be of no avail if the findings were
not proved to apply to actual field conditions.
DRINKING WATER FROM SEA WATER—CONSOLAZIO, ET AL. 159

The modified Permutit method resulted in a briquet of silver zeolite
slightly smaller than the size of a package of cigarettes. One had
but to drop a briquet into a collapsible bag containing sea water. The
new processing bag contained a built-in filter with a sucking tube just
below the filter. With a little manipulation the briquet was disinte-
grated whereupon the chemicals proceeded to react with the salts as
described. Twenty minutes of manipulation removed as much of the
salts as was necessary to produce potable drinking water. The pre-
pared water was drunk by sucking on the protruding tube at the bottom
ofthe bag. To do this required 3 to 5 minutes.

In February of 1943 the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery authorized
the Naval Medical Research Institute to conduct sea trials under simu-
lated conditions of survival on life rafts in the Gulf of Mexico. The
primary objective was the testing of various methods of producing
drinking water from the sea. The secondary objectives were ob-
servation of the suitability of a new tablet ration, methods for preven-
tion of sunburn, and, in general, of the performance of life rafts and
equipment, such as signaling devices, water-collecting devices, fishing
gear, and clothing, as well as a study of available space and the physi-
ologic phenomena of shipwreck survival such as water requirement, in-
cidence of seasickness, and conservation of body water. The following
water-making devices, all in a rather well-developed state, were tested :
the Naval Medical Research Institute method, the Permutit method as
modified by the Naval Medical Research Institute, the Delano solar
still, and the Safety fuel still.

From July 7 to 11, 1943 (2), 21 men,‘ ages 19 to 44, spent 97 hours on
a restricted regime with the daily fluid intake limited to 500 milliliters,
and a dietary intake of approximately 330 calories in the form of tablet
rations in which chewing gum and vitamin concentrate were included.

Sixty-one of the 96 hours, including 2 nights, were spent floating in
rafts 10 to 20 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, near Pensacola, Fla.
The remaining time was spent on the escort vessel. Rafts included
Navy one-man parachute rafts, Navy four-man rafts, and a special
seven-man raft supplied by Transcontinental and Western Airlines.
Each was captained by one of the staff members of the Naval Medical
Research Institute.

* Plans for these sea trials were made with the cooperation of the Liaison Committee
on Emergency Rescue Equipment of the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Develop-

160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

With the exception of the seven-man raft, all rafts were to depend
for their drinking water on the particular type of water-making device
delegated to each raft, e. g., one raft contained four Delano solar
stills. The seven-man raft was to depend on the Safety fuel still for
its water supply; other water-making devices were supplied to this
raft for test purposes only. When the water produced was below
500 milliliters per day per man, the deficient quantity was supplied
to the individual from the water supply of the escort vessel.

Water volumes produced by the various methods tested were meas-
ured and logged by the raft captain. He noted also whether the other
occupants of the raft were able to carry out their assigned methods
from printed directions, and what difficulties were encountered,
if any. No assistance was rendered by the raft captain unless the
subject could proceed no further.

On the early morning of the first day all subjects went over the
side of the escort vessel and into their designated rafts. Water-
making devices were broken out whenever the time rose for producing
water, except for the solar stills which were in operation as soon
as the individuals could get their appliances together.

Of the original 21 individuals starting as subjects, 3 had to be
removed on the second and third days, owing to seasickness. All but
3 of the remainder also suffered from seasickness but became adapted
by the end of the second day.

The following requisites relative to water-making devices were
noted:

1. A method for field use must be made extremely simple since the effects of
exposure to cold, water, heat, sun, hunger, and thirst, plus the added factors
of lack of sleep and seasickness leave men in a poor mental and physical condition.

2. The method employed should require little time for its operation or manipula-
tion and few directions. It was found that the individuals tended to employ
the warm daylight hours for catching up on lost sleep.

3. The device employed should have a minimum of parts and all parts should
be well secured to the person or to the raft.

4. The device employed should be of rugged construction and resistant to
corrosion.

5. The complete kit should occupy very little space in the raft since space was
at a premium.

As expected, the method of first choice was found to be the Permutit
method as modified by the Naval Medical Research Institute. It
required fewer directions and less time, attention, and manipulation
than any of the others. Several minor faults were found that were
corrected later.

1. The closure on the plastic bags was made more secure.

2. The filter was bonded into the bag to prevent leaks caused by sharp particles
of chemical being trapped in between the filter and bag which, upon kneading,
caused pinhole breaks in the bag.
DRINKING WATER FROM SEA WATER—CONSOLAZIO, ET AL. 161

3. The sweetish taste, about which complaints were made during the raft trials,
was found to be imparted to the water by the Vinylite plastic bag caused by
the lubricant employed in the manufacture of sheet Vinylite. The taste was
eliminated by heating the finished fabric to 160° F. to evaporate the solvents
and lubricants employed.

The method of second choice was the Naval Medical Research
Institute method. This method, involving two stages, required double
the time, attention, and manipulation of the Permutit method. How-
ever, it still possessed the advantage of higher weight and volume
ratios.

The third choice was the Safety fuel still, to which there were
however, many objections. It occupied an excessive amount of space
in the seven-man raft, the igniting flints quickly became corroded
and useless, and corrosion also affected the still itself. The lighting of
the fuel was a serious problem, especially in high seas and high winds,
the burning fuel gave rise to fumes irritating to the already physically
upset subjects.

The solar stills were not even considered for use. They were
continually in a state of disrepair. In fact, of the original five
employed, none were in working order after the third day. They
required ‘continual attention and always had to be oriented to the
sun. The maximal water production was of the order of 150 milli-
liters per day. They had to be carefully put away at night so that
no damage might come to them in the crowded raft.

The comparative data on all the water-making devices tested on
the life rafts are presented in table 1.

Owing to the fact that the chemical had been compressed to the
maximal degree consistent with disintegration on use, the Naval Medi-
cal Research Institute method produced considerably more water by
volume than any of the other methods tested. Greater compression
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

of the chemical was, therefore, recommended to the Permutit Co. It
was pointed out, however, that too much pressure made the briquets
indispersible and, therefore, useless. Fortunately, an earlier observa-
tion at the Naval Medical Research Institute permitted much greater
compression than had formerly been possible. If an inert chemical
which swells to 6 to 12 times its original volume when exposed to water
is added to the briquets, it acts as a disruptive agent. This develop-
ment was incorporated into the new Permutit brigquets, and proved
very successful. The result has been that an exceptionally small briquet
can now be manufactured which, within a minute after being added to
sea water, crumbles and falls apart into very small] sandlike particles.

Table 2 presents the water analysis of the major constituents of the
drinking water produced by this process,

Briquets with the latest modifications are now in mass production
and are being packaged in a can exactly the same shape and volume as
the standard Navy water can. This design was chosen by the Naval
Bureau of Aeronautics in order to minimize changes in the parachute
back pad and parachute type raft. Calculation from the figures given
in table 1 shows that the new briquet yields the following ratios as
compared to packaged water:

This can, filled with water, occupies a volume of approximately
700 milliliters and weighs approximately 512 grams, containing a
volume of water of 340 milliliters. The same can, containing demin-
eralizing equipment, has a total weight of approximately 800 grams
for a total volume of approximately 700 milliliters. The demineraliz-
ing equipment will have a potential supply of 3,000 milliliters of
water, a gain of approximately nine times the available water for
the same given space. The man-days of available water (500 milli-
DRINKING WATER FROM SEA WATER—CONSOLAZIO, ET AL. 163

liters per day) for the same volume of space is 6 man-days for demin-
eralizing equipment as against 0.7 man-day for packaged water.
Directions are stamped on the processing bag in waterproof ink.
The directions were written in very simple English so that they might
reach all types of unindoctrinated individuals.
The following are the printed directions as stamped on the proc-
essing bag:

1. Serew plug in outlet tube at bottom and fill bag to line with sea water.

2. Add briquet. Tightly roll top of bag down toward buckle and strap securely.

3. Allow briquet to stand in contact with water for a few minutes. Then
gently knead bag with hand for 10 minutes until entire briquet is broken into a
fine powder.

4. Shake bag occasionally for at least 20 minutes more, so that desalting
material is kept in thorough contact with the water.

5. Now suck clear filtered drinking water through drinking tube.

6. After sucking out all water, rinse bag in sea water to remove used-up
desalting material,

These developments have led to the adoption of the Naval Medical
Institute modification of the Permutit method by the Naval Bureau
of Aeronautics, the Army Aviation Corps, and various private air-
lines operating with the Army and Navy, and it is now being con-
sidered by the War Shipping Administration for possible use on
transports and freighters.

[With 2 plates]

Any attempt to compare plastics and metals on a competitive basis
is difficult because of the versatility of both groups of materials. It is
in the same class with the ancient discussions of which is the more
valuable man on a baseball team, a good hitter or a good pitcher.
Both are necessary to a well-rounded team. Our team in this case com-
prises all the materials of engineering that are making possible the
present and future scale of living for all of mankind.

The general idea that plastics will in some way be competitors of
metals (especially light metals) in the postwar world may be true to
a certain extent, but the areas of overlapping will be found to be
comparatively small. In the first place, plastics are not a tonnage
industry as practically all metals are. Even magnesium, the newest
candidate among the metals, is being produced at something like
double the entire output of plastics. If the automotive world sud-
denly decided that plastic cars were actually here and tried to swing
into production, it would put the chemical industry in an impossible
situation. Three hundred and fifty thousand tons of plastics (the
present production for parts) would not go very far, and the tanks,
retorts, and piping required to jump plastics production up to any-
thing approaching the tonnage required would be a real headache.

Even in the competitive area, the rivalry is not general. Molded
plastics compete with metal chiefly when metals are die-cast, sand-
cast, or machined. Laminated plastics are competitors with metals
when the latter are considered in sheets, formed or machined. Resin
coatings compete with metals used as plating mediums. These are the
three principal occupants of the twilight zone where plastics and
metals overlap.

Outside this area the two types of materials are mutually exclusitve—
each supreme in its own right. Plastics cannot be used where con-
tinuous heat above 400° F. will be applied. Plastics lack the surface
hardness of most metals, although many plastics seem to be better
under abrasion than many metals. Again, if only a small space is
available and the cross section therefore limited, metals are invariably
chosen because they provide the requisite strength.

SOME BROAD DISTINCTIONS

Plastics are beyond the competitive reach of metals where (1)
satisfactory electrical insulating quality is required; (2) a material is
needed that will waterproof textiles so as to leave them flexible enough
to use as raincoats, shower curtains, and the like; (3) transparency
is required; (4) a material is sought that is suitable for protection
against ordinary heat conduction in such simple applications as coffee-
pot handles, gas-stove handles, electric-iron handles and thousands
of like parts; (5) the material must feel warm and comfortable to the
touch, so that one’s skin won’t freeze to it in cold weather, and must
not get too hot to handle in very hot weather; and (6) a choice of
built-in colors is desired.

If those were the sole bases of comparison between plastics and
metals, metals would already be at the start of a long decline. How-
ever the problem cannot be settled so simply in favor of either side.
Let us go back to the two most important fields where the choice may
be difficult—formed metals versus molded plastics and sheet metals
versus sheet plastics, and see if it is not necessary to draw some finer
distinctions.

To begin with, not all metals can be formed with equal ease. As
with plastics, compromise is usually invoked. A certain alloy steel
may be ideal as to service quality but to get it in the shape needed might
involve so much cost as to make its specification unwise. If some
bright engineer found an airplane propellor design that needed a
metal so hard to work that it would cut the entire propeller production
of the country to one-tenth its present rate, it is unlikely that the
advantages accruing from its use would be considered enough to
justify the loss of production.

Molded plastics need rather expensive steel molds, but so do metal
die-castings. Sand-cast metals offer a cheaper approach, but may —
leave too much machining to be done to get the needed accuracy.
Plastics molded parts seem to fit into a middle band of accuracy. If
the part is really rough and a sixteenth of an inch means nothing, a
sand-casting is certainly indicated; if the tolerances, however, are
less than 0.001 inch, carefully machined metal is a better choice; be-
PLASTICS AND METALS—SCRIBNER 167

tween these two sections is where molded plastics may have an even
chance.

Other things being equal, the greatest. advantage plastics have to
offer the prospective buyer is built-in color, and its twin brother, sur-
face permanence. In the case of plastics neither corrosion nor elec-
trolysis will alter what was bought and paid for.

Die-cast or stamped metal is most certainly indicated when thin
sections must be rigid or bear any appreciable strain. Strong, thin
plastic parts can easily be made in limited shapes by using reinforce-
ments of laminates or fiber stocks, but they will not be rigid. On the
other hand, plastics can carry threads very nicely, as nicely indeed as
metals if there is enough “meat” around the thread to prevent its
cracking out.

ENGINEERING FACTORS IN SELECTION

Basically the first factor determining the choice of plastics or
metals is the available space or volume of the part. If it is relatively
small, plastics are almost automatically out unless their use is de-
manded by one of the six “exclusives” mentioned earlier.

After the space factor comes cost. All plastics cost more than
metals, on a pound basis. The saving grace for plastics comes from
the advantage of their low specific gravities. (See table 1.) Even
magnesium at 1.80 is higher than the average range of 1.06 to 1.50 for
plastics. Perhaps, indeed, a correction of the usual strength values
for the specific-gravity effect may bring plastics up into the range of
the engineering metals. Unfortunately, to make any showing at all
for plastics we must choose the very best plastics material, and be
careful to select one of the weaker alloys for comparison.

On this basis, for instance, let us make some tensile-strength com-
parisons. (See table 2.) Chrome-moly steel and stainless steel run
around 180,000 pounds per square inch, aluminum alloy 62,000, and
magnesium alloy 46,000. One of the strongest plastics we have is
Pregwood, impregnated plywood. Pregwood’s tensile strength is
30,000 pounds per square inch. Other “strong” plastics are paper
laminate at 12,500 pounds per square inch, canvas laminate 9,500, and
wood-flour-phenolic molded parts 8,500. It is evident that plastics
offer no competition in direct comparisons of this type.

Now suppose we set up our system of handicaps based on dividing
the strength figures by specific gravity so we can determine specific
tensile strength or tensile strength per pound. (Again see table 2, in
which the materials are listed in their order of merit in this respect.)
Immediately one of the plastics contestants, Pregwood, moves up to
third on the list at 23,000, behind magnesium alloy at 25,400, and
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1945

stainless steel at 23,600. Chrome-moly steel comes in at 22,900, alu-
minum alloy at 22,100, and then a terrible drop to paper laminate at
9,400, canvas laminate at 7,100, and wood-flour-phenolic, molded, at
6,200.

This comparison shows that if the competition be confined to sheet
materials, the plastics stand up fairly well in tensile strength by
weight, but the moment it centers about really shapeable forms by
bringing in the moldable group, the plastics lose position rapidly.

With respect to compressive strength the steels are strongest; with
some of the plastics better than some of the other metals, as can be
seen in table 3. When the specific gravity correction is applied, how-
ever, all the plastics (except Pregwood, now) rate higher than the
metals. Therefore if compressive strength is the determining factor
in a specific design, plastics (some form of thermosetting phenolic or
urea) will serve the purpose best pound for pound.

Similar data on modulus of elasticity in tension, which is a measure
of a material’s rigidity, are given in table 4 and show clearly that the
metals are outstanding in this respect, even on a per-pound basis.
And beyond that, on shear strength, impact strength, and flexural
strength there is just no point in presenting tables, no matter how they
might be corrected for comparative weights, for the plastics are
woefully inferior to metals in these respects.
PLASTICS AND METALS—SCRIBNER 169
THE CASE FOR PLASTICS

Faced by this story of comparative performance, why don’t plastics
fold up and leave the field of engineering materials entirely to the
metals? In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, when a plastic material
is faced with a really severe service application of an engineering na-
ture it does fade right out of the picture—unless the stronger metal
has its own handicap (such as poor resistance to corrosion or even
electrical characteristics) that may be even more serious than the
mechanical deficiency of the plastic.

Fortunately for plastics there are enough applications for which any
material will have enough strength if it can be dropped six times from
the height of a table to a concrete floor without breaking. Certainly
if you can design around compressive strength, almost any kind of
thermosetting plastic material, except plywood, will give the best re-
sults on a pound basis. Under tension, plywood is right up in the
front fighting it out with the leaders in the metal world on a pound-
for-pound basis, asking no quarter and giving none. That is the
reason the famous Mosquito bombers are made of plywood (actually a
different kind of wood for each part of the structure, birch in one spot,
boxwood in another, etc.).

Plastics have a few outstanding service qualities where these pre-
viously mentioned measures of strength are not all-important. One
of these is abrasion resistance. Ammunition chutes of laminated
phenolic outwear steel. Plastic gears are not only quieter but wear as
well as steel. Under impact plastic sheets won’t dent and gradually
deform before failure, but will just break all of a sudden, while metal,
although it will not fail completely, will get battered out of any usable
shape. Plastics will dampen vibration better than metals, too, which
means less noise, or the avoidance of synchronous beats set up in other
parts of a machine.

Sheets of plastic cannot be drawn to new shapes as easily as metals,
but usually when odd shapes are wanted they can be created in plastics
before making the sheet itself; in other words, sheets of metals are raw
materials suitable for a great deal more working than sheets of plastics.
The plastics man starts one step back of the sheet, uses the same basic
material and pre-forms it to the desired shape instead of into the
sheet itself.

There is one unfortunate characteristic of plastics that occurs also
in metals but not so badly, and that is creep. Creep (cold flow in this
case) is the constant change in dimension under stress. The thermo-
plastic plastics are strongly subject to it and therefore are avoided for
stressed service; in the thermosetting materials creep is present but
unless the material is used with practically no factor of safety it may be
cliscounted entirely.

CLASSES OF PLASTICS

In any comparison of plastics and metals it should be remembered
that there are many types and forms of “plastics.” All plastics are
divided into thermosetting and thermoplastic types. The first group,
the themosetting, are somewhat like concrete in their internal action.
As raw materials they will first soften under heat and then harden.
Practically no further softening will take place right up to the charring
point. A part once molded wrong might as well be scrapped, since the
material canot be used overagain. (Like all technical statements, that
one must immediately be qualified. It has been reported that the H. J.
Heinz Co., of 57-variety fame, developed a liquid that would soften
a completely cured phenolic part, than which there is no more com-
pletely set item thinkable, so that the part could be manipulated by
hand, and would come back to its original hard state when dried. Also,
some of the airplane companies on the west coast have a process whereby
PLASTICS AND METALS—SCRIBNER val

they can shape within certain limits laminated structures that have
been considered completely cured. With those reservations our defini-
tion of thermosetting is still good.)

The thermoplastic materials, the other general class of plastics, are
those which have the quality of softening under heat and hardening
when cool; a simple analogy in this case is paraflin.

The thermosetting group are usuable on an average up to around
300° F.; some will go to 400° F. The moldable materials that go above
those figures are based on cement binders as a rule and are not classed
as plastics. Thermoplastic materials, as a rule, are not rated much
