The Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson
of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United
States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of
the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property
and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in
an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President,
the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust
in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

Know Thy Neighbor as Thyself

5) DILEON RIPEEY

THIS PARAPHRASE OF THE BIBLE saying, ‘Love Thy Neighbor as Thy-
self,” a true saying, and one to be emulated if in larger affairs it
had not a mocking ring, is one that I often think of in connection
with the Smithsonian. To know is to learn but also to give a little.
If one knows anything it is a scrap of learning. Every scrap should
be shared for all bear upon a central theme. The assemblage of
knowledge is like a pyramid. Its creation is the very abnegation of
self, and in the process we learn to know each other, more sanely,
I believe, than love would ever let us do, clouded with the mists of
sentiment or tears, as that may be.

Speaking at the dedication of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York in 1874, Professor Joseph Henry, first Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian, stated that James Smithson’s memorial,

Ee : ie GE
the Institution, should be a work place, a “college of discoverers,”
a haven for research, ‘discovering new facts, new phenomena and
new principles,” and making this information known to all. Knowl-
edge should be spread abroad by museums based on this research.
This is the finest memorial of all, for “what, in comparison to this,
are local monuments, pyramids of flint, statues of brass or obelisks
of marble!”

These two generations past have been the generations of self, on
which mountains of egocentrism have been erected, eroding over
the years, as always, in the sands of anomie and the washings of
self-pity. I went to Persepolis not long ago and walked over the
desert into the blue silk and damask tents erected to celebrate two
thousand five hundred years of a dynasty that never was. Created
with cunning skill by French decorators for the nonevent, the tents
still stood, the curtains giving way at one’s entrance to the great
banquet pavillion; within, a crescent-shaped dias with a crescent
table, backed by a row of pale blue velvet tall chairs arranged on
one side only, not for conversation but for the admiration of the
courtiers and press. No sound broke the spell except for a faint
soughing of the wind, which made the gilt candelabra sway slightly
in a ghostly reverie. Oh, Ozymandias have you told us nothing?

The accumulation of knowledge must not be a selfish thing, for
knowledge and learning go hand in hand, and to learn is to teach.
James Smithson in his charge to his heirs—his administrators for
the future—said that his Institution should serve for “the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men” (i.e., mankind). One of
my colleagues, Wilcomb Washburn, has recently discovered a letter
of Smithson’s in French, addressed to Baron Georges Cuvier, the
most celebrated French savant of his day, written from Germany
in 1806, twenty years before Smithson’s death, in which he pres-
aged the language of his famous will. A translation might be, “It
seems to me, Sir, that the man of genius who through important
discoveries expands the scope of the human mind is entitled to
something beyond a mere and fruitless admiration [for this we
might read “ego trip’”’]. That he is entitled to expect that all con-
tribute as much as they can to facilitate research so that, if fame is
achieved, they can share in the benefits. And it would indeed be
unjust that national differences as well as resentment and war
should have any bearing in this matter. The works of scientists

4 / Smithsonian Year 1982
being for all nations, they themselves should be looked upon as
citizens of mankind.”

It seems to me that what Smithson is writing is that as scientists
or scholars of history or art at the Smithsonian, we are obligated
to increase and diffuse knowledge, and in the process sweep away
the cobwebs of self-pity, deriving satisfaction not from self-
promotion but rather from the rewarding tasks of increasing and
diffusing knowledge. We must reach what we know and discover,
as best we can, using research as a tool for illumination.

The Smithsonian Institution is embarking on a course which, if
successful, will lead to an expansion on an international scale of
our motto. For perhaps the first time in our history, we are em-
barking in a spirit of social responsibility on a creative effort to
increase understanding and respect for our neighbors.

One of our mandates, the diffusion of knowledge among men
(among mankind) works both ways, within and without. We can,
for example, tell Americans about their history, but how can we
extend that to tell Americans about the history of the rest of the
world, especially about those parts and nations of which we are
still so woefully ignorant. Our entire awareness of others has been
concentrated until recently on the so-called Western world: Europe
—extending east to Russia, south to the Mediterranean—and parts
of Latin American, our traditional neighbors. Until World War II,
Asia was known to relatively few Americans. Few Americans pene-
trated beyond Japan and China. The vast worlds of more southern
Asia (except for the Philippines), tropical Asia, the southwest
Pacific areas (except for Australia), and Africa and the Middle East
were essentially little-known and beyond most people’s means to
visit or experience.

Now this Institution has an opportunity to combine objects, col-
lections such as those in the Freer Gallery of Art, the National
Museum of African Art, collections in our kindred departments of
Anthropology and History and Art, into our Quadrangle, a new
Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures, to be built
south of the original Smithsonian Castle. This Center will delineate
to Americans as well as to the world the necessity to ‘know your
neighbor,’ to respect our fellow inhabitants in this shrinking world,
and in the process generate an increased measure of self-respect in
ourselves and in our neighbors as well. Traditions and cultures

Statement by the Secretary / 5
alien to the massive onslaughts of mechanistic technology are frag-
ile indeed. They are being eroded every day just as the forests of
the tropics disappear. Cultures drift away like the dust that follows
the draft of a lifting jet plane on a far-away runway. Cultures and
traditions represent the only stability, the only defense against the
mindlessness of self, and the only model for the cultivation of self-
respect.

In the world of this vast region, home to almost two-thirds of
the human population, there are now ninety-two nations, where
perhaps a dozen reigned before World War II. We in America,
still unused to the totality of this change, remember only dimly
some of the new names and find little occasion to think of the im-
plications involved, except perhaps to be bothered by reading of
the debates in the General Assembly of the United Nations, or to
hear of some man-made or natural catastrophe on the other side of
the globe. Our Center will help to correct this lack of understand-
ing on our side as well as theirs. We will have a chance to fore-
gather here to discourse, to exhibit their traditions and cultures in
a meaningful way, and to demonstrate the long history of inven-
tion, intellectual achievement, and civilization, of which those of us
on both sides must remind ourselves before it is too late. So we

tects, shows the Quadrangle’s pavilions and landscaping, north side.

have embarked upon the creation of this Center in an effort to “put
out more flags,” to shine the light of understanding between us.

In this effort, approved by the Regents of the Institution, we are
pledged to raise $75 million for construction, half by the Smith-
sonian itself and its dedicated friends, and half by the federal gov-
ernment. Over the past few years many others have shared this
vision and have helped us bring it closer to fruition. To signify the
government’s commitment to the project, the United States Con-
gress in its 1983 budget has approved legislation authorizing con-
struction of the Quadrangle and has appropriated the federal share
of the financing in the amount of $36.5 million to add to almost
$1 million appropriated the year before.

The Smithsonian’s private financing has received a munificent
boost in the generosity of Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, a psychiatrist
and medical publisher who resides in New York City. He has
pledged not only 1,000 works of Asian art, valued well in excess
of $50 million, but also $4 million towards construction of the Far
Eastern gallery within the Quadrangle, which will house his collec-
tion as well as those of others and be named in his honor. In mak-
ing these gifts, Dr. Sackler reflected the synthesis as well as the
essence of the Quadrangle in saying that ”. . . in the years to come,

Washington will continue to grow into a world cultural capital,
augmenting its status as a world political center.”

Support for our Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian
Cultures continues to come in from abroad as well as from other
friends of the Institution in many parts of the country. We will
celebrate and commemorate their gifts in appropriate ways within
the new structure and in the various programs that will flow from
it; especially in outreach and public education.

Throughout the past year the existing programs of the Institu-
tion, as well as the supporting functions that are crucial to their
success in reaching the broad audiences that we serve, have been
marked by a continuing high level of public interest and achieve-
ment. Steady progress has been made towards completing in 1983
the initial physical inventory of the National Collections entrusted
to our care. Not only will we then be able to refine more intelli-
gently our previous estimates of holding some 75 million items, but
we will also have more substantial information about the location
and condition of all these objects, thus enabling us to manage and
conserve them for generations yet to come.

Another significant element in the care and conservation of col-
lections is the Museum Support Center, the facility in nearby Suit-
land, Maryland, currently under construction. We expect to take
possession of the building within budget and on schedule in this
winter of 1983. To the partnership, Metcalf/KCF and to the chief
architect of the project, Coke Florance, we offer our appreciation
for so thoughtfully resolving the problems of space for collections
storage and research, along with conservation training, in a massive
edifice that, nonetheless, provides a comfortable working environ-
ment in harmony with its natural surroundings.

In the area of collections acquisition, gifts and purchases have
enabled us to extend modestly the evidence of our cultural heritage
and of the physical world inhabited by us and by those who have
gone before us. The National Museum of African Art has acquired
two early and important Benin bronzes, while the National Portrait
Gallery, in association with the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foun-
dation at Charlottesville, Virginia, has purchased Gilbert Stuart’s
“Edgehill” portrait of Thomas Jefferson painted in 1805. Following
the pattern established in the joint purchase of the Stuart portraits
of George and Martha Washington, the portrait, named for the

plantation of Jefferson’s grandson where it hung for many years,
will be exhibited for alternating three-year periods at the Portrait
Gallery and at Monticello.

The lives of two other presidents were the focus of major win-
ter exhibitions and related activities. To commemorate the one-
hundredth anniversary of the birth of Franklin Roosevelt on Janu-
ary 30, 1882, a number of events took place in several Smithsonian
museums. Early January saw the opening of the exhibition Roose-
velt’s America: New Deal Art from the National Museum of Amer-
ican Art. Shortly thereafter a small exhibition, FDR: The Early
Years, chronicling his early life and entrance into the political
arena, opened at the National Portrait Gallery. Our friend, the dis-
tinguished journalist Joseph Alsop, a cousin of the late president,
presented a lecture, “FDR: The Great Change,” in conjunction
with the exhibition. At the end of January the National Museum of
American History presented Franklin Delano Roosevelt: The Inti-
mate Presidency, which included the White House desk and micro-
phones from which he delivered his famous “fireside chats,” his
1938 Ford with special hand controls, and a wide range of photo-
graphs of FDR and of the nation during his presidency, giving an
especial quality of verisimilitude to the event.

On February 22 a gala birthday party at the National Museum
of American History, followed by fireworks on the Mall, marked
the two-hundredth-fiftieth anniversary of Washington’s birth and
the opening of a major exhibition, George Washington: A Figure
Upon the Stage. The exhibit surveys the many ways in which
Americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have idolized
and indeed utilized Washington and the aura of his name. Also,
perhaps this exhibition helps to humanize “G.W.”, showing sides
of his character and his ambitions, usually clouded in the atmo-
sphere of the almost imperial tradition. Smithsonian historian
Margaret Klapthor, curator of the exhibition, points out that “the
image and character of Washington have taken various forms,”
with each era favoring an appearance related to its own values. The
National Portrait Gallery mounted a related exhibition of prints
depicting George Washington and showing the variety of ways in
which the Founding Father was perceived by his contemporaries.

Irish songs and fancy footwork marked the March 17 opening
of Celebration: A World of Art and Ritual, which examines the

Gilbert Stuart’s “Edgehill” portrait of Thomas Jefferson, painted in 1805, is now
jointly owned by the National Portrait Gallery and the Thomas Jefferson Memo-
rial Foundation, Incorporated, Charlottesville, Virginia. The painting will be
exhibited for alternating three-year periods at the nrc and at Monticello.

universal phenomenon of celebration and demostrates how differ-
ent people mark the important events and cycles in their societies.
The exhibition includes approximately 600 objects—95 percent of
which have never before been exhibited—from more than 60 cul-
tures and the collections of 9 Smithsonian museums. A related
exhibition was presented later in the year at the National Museum
of African Art: Life . . . Afterlife: African Funerary Sculpture,
which examines the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, and afterlife
experienced by many African cultures. Other notable exhibitions
included two companion shows at the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden—Raphael Soyer: 65 Years of Printmaking and
Soyer Since 1960—honoring the very substantial output of this
talented artist and contributor to the museum’s collections. The
Hirshhorn was also host to the De Stijl: 1917-1931, Visions of
Utopia exhibition, illuminating the art, architecture, and design of
the influential Dutch movement that was characterized by elemen-
tary, geometric forms and pure, primary colors. The exhibition was
one of several international events marking the two-hundredth
anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations
between the United States and The Netherlands, the longest peace-
ful relationship the United States has had with any foreign power.

Further reflecting significant international influences in art and
design, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum opened in September a retro-
spective view of the history of Scandinavian design during the last
100 years, which included furniture, glass, ceramics, metal work,
and textiles as part of a national celebration of “Scandinavia
Today.”

A selection from the Meserve Collection of the original glass
plate negatives of Mathew Brady’s portrait photographs were ex-
hibited for the first time in May at the National Portrait Gallery in
a specially designed room, evocative of the mid-nineteenth century.
This unigue collection of immense historical importance also in-
cludes the only print ever made from the last photograph of Presi-
dent Lincoln. Perhaps the most haunting likeness of Lincoln, it was
taken on April 10, 1865, in a studio four blocks south of the
Portrait Gallery building just four days before his assassination.

During the past year our colleagues in the physical and natural
sciences also have made lively and important contributions in
exhibitions as well as in research. Of the former, perhaps the most

Statement by the Secretary / 13
extraordinary was inua: spirit world of the bering sea eskimo,
which opened in June in the Evans Gallery of the National Museum
of Natural History. Featuring for the first time nearly 500 objects
collected for the Smithsonian more than 100 years ago by the
naturalist and surveyor Edward Nelson, the exhibition recreates
the world of the Bering Sea Eskimo and traces the roots of Eskimo
cultural and artistic traditions. Many objects in the exhibition were
associated with elaborate myths and decorated with dual animal
and human images, reflecting the belief of the Eskimos that every-
thing had an inua, a human-like essence or spirit that was revealed
to people in dreams, visions, or when encountering animals. Also at
the National Museum of Natural History, the ever-popular Dino-
saur Hall was reopened after a hiatus of several years during which
it has been renovated and the paleontological exhibits enlarged and
current theories of evolution presented.

Dr. Terry Erwin, a curator in the museum’s Department of Ento-
mology, continued his studies of the tropical rain forest canopy and
of the insect life abiding there. This research reveals that the num-
ber of insect species worldwide may be substantially larger than
previously suspected, and that tropical deforestation, therefore, will
inevitably destroy far larger numbers of species than had been
anticipated or supposed.

The world’s tropical rain forests are home to half of the earth’s
plant and animal species, and thus are areas of immense priority to
numbers of Smithsonian scientists. During a symposium on the
ecology and management of the tropical rain forest, which was held
at the University of Leeds in England last spring, Dr. Ira Rubinoff,
director of our Tropical Research Institute in Panama, proposed the
establishment of a system of Tropical Moist Forest Reserves in the
temperate zones, financed by the developed nations in order to save
this crucial international resource.

Dr. David Roubik, an entomologist at the Institute and an expert
on the African honeybee let loose on an unsuspecting New World
in Brazil in 1957, has been working closely with Panamanian au-
thorities on ways of adapting to these notoriously aggressive bees,
which arrived in the Republic from the south late last winter. He is
sharing his information with Central American governments as
well, for this is a matter of concern as the species spreads north-
wards.

14 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Another study on the effects of forest habitat destruction was
conducted by Dr. James Lynch of the Chesapeake Bay Center for
Environmental Studies, whose work was an investigation of the
size and stability of bird populations in Maryland. Dr. Lynch has
begun work with other Smithsonian scientists on a similar study in
the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, part of the winter migration
route for a fifth of our North American bird species.

At the National Zoological Park’s Conservation and Research
Center in Front Royal, Virginia, studies on the behavioral ecology
and population dynamics of wildlife from around the world are
underway. This work is being used as a means of training scientists
from India and Europe in the use of sophisticated techniques for
studying endangered animals in their own countries and elsewhere
in the world.

The reptile and amphibian house of the Zoo’s Rock Creek loca-
tion has been renovated and reopened to the public. The refur-
bished structure proves to be much more effective than the former
house for studying these exotic animals and encouraging breeding
and survival rates in captivity. For the second consecutive year the
Zoo received the highest award from the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums for captive propagation programs.

The National Air and Space Museum commemorated twenty-five
years of space exploration with an exhibition and a conference of
that name, both of which seek to place accomplishments of the
space age in a social, cultural, and political context. The Museum’s
Garber Facility, for the restoration and preservation of aircraft,
celebrated its fifth anniversary with a week-long series of events
for the general public.

The observatory atop Mount Hopkins in Arizona was renamed
for our colleague Fred Lawrence Whipple, and dedicated in his
honor last May. Fred Whipple was the first director of the Smith-
sonian Astrophysical Observatory when it moved to Cambridge,
and was a primary developer of the concept of the MMT. The
newly renovated gamma ray reflector—the largest in the world—
has resumed operation at the Whipple Observatory and will enable
astronomers to probe high energy events in the far reaches of the
universe.

In an effort to understand other aspects of universality and
fundamental processes, the Smithsonian sponsored an international

Statement by the Secretary / 15
symposium on “How Humans Adapt: A Biocultural Odyssey.” A
diverse group of scholars met to debate what may be one of the
most critical questions of our time: has Homo sapiens, having come
this far in his several million years, learned anything at all that
can help him survive in the present global village and adapt to the
future? The papers from the symposium—the keynote speaker of
which was the late René Dubos—will be published by the Smith-
sonian Institution Press in the winter of 1983.

During the summer, the Festival of American Folklife returned
to its original plot on the National Mall among the Smithsonian’s
museum buildings. The larger and more accessible site accents the
strong, complementary relationships between museum collections
and the presenters of living traditions. This sixteenth annual festi-
val featured the rich and diverse folk traditions of Korea during
the anniversary of a century of diplomatic relations between our
two countries, as well as the Diamond Jubilee of the State of Okla-
homa. It reflected the traditions that Oklahomans nourish and
support, particularly those associated with two major activities—
horses and oil—and brought a functioning rig and a quarter-mile
race track to the Mall. The festival was also the setting for the
awards ceremony for the first annual National Heritage Fellow-
ships, honors given by the National Endowment for the Arts to
traditional musicians and craftsmen who have made outstanding
contributions to the cultural life of the nation.

As in previous years, we should not let this report slip by with-
out mentioning certain comings and goings of Smithsonian staff.
We were terribly saddened this year by the death of John Estes,
the experienced director of the International Exchange Service. By
the end of the fiscal year we learned that another dear friend and
companion, our Assistant Secretary for Public Service, Julian T.
Euell, who had served in that capacity for nearly a decade, would
be accepting the directorship of the Oakland Museum. Still other
departures included Noel Hinners, the director of the National Air
and Space Museum, who became director of the Goddard Space
Center; Robert Angle, director of our National Associates program,
who assumed membership responsibilities for the National Trust
for Historic Preservation; and both David Estabrook, director of
Elementary and Secondary Education, and Richard Griesel, our

business manager, who have left for the vineyards of private indus-
try. We have been fortunate to be able to promote Jacqueline
Austin to the helm of the National Associates, Ann Bay to the
head of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Joe Chmelik to
business manager.

At the same time we should note two nearly simultaneous
arrivals at the old Patent Office Building. Alan Fern, formerly of
the Library of Congress, has been named director of the National
Portrait Gallery, and Charles Eldredge, the former director of the
Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas, has assumed the
directorship of the National Museum of American Art. I am confi-
dent these two innovative and sensitive scholars will lead their
programs in imaginative ways and in the spirit of partnership.

If the pursuit of knowledge is the aim of this Institution, then
we can look forward to an enlarging era in the programs planned
for the future of our new Center described in the opening of this
statement. Americans long to be friends with all the world. We are
frustrated by those who fail to understand that we hope that our
civilization, our history of democracy and freedom is a real one,
in spite of the ups and downs of our progress. If James Smithson
had a vision—that somewhere across the ocean from the Europe of
stratified hierarchies and iron-bound convention of the eighteenth
century, this new world could achieve such an ideal—we could
hardly deny that that vision was proleptic. It is in the fulfillment
of that ambition of our precursor that we must proceed.

There is a time in the world for the realization of these ambi-
tions. The eagle on the Great Seal may have arrows or thunder-
bolts clutched in one set of claws, but there is an olive branch in
the other. Justice and equality demand that America be strong and
competent in the role of peace-keeper, but peace itself demands
understanding, friendship, and mutual self-respect, hand in hand
with certainty. Respect above all for cultures and traditions across
the face of that great arc of the world stretching from Atlantic to
Pacific, from Africa to East Asia, should insure that we can “know
our neighbors as ourselves,” and in this knowing, learn to respect
and live with new friends for the future. For indeed there is no
other choice.

18 / Smithsonian Year 1982
The Board of Regents

Tue Boarp oF Recents held three formal meetings during the last
year. Additional meetings of the Regents’ Executive Committee,
the Audit and Review Committee, the Personnel Committee, and
the Investment Policy Committee were held throughout the year
and reported at the Regents’ meetings.

The first meeting of the Board of Regents was held on Janu-
ary 25, 1982, in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian Castle and
was called to order by the Chancellor. The Executive Committee
reported that it met on January 5, 1982, to discuss the Regents’
agenda and took special note of the Audit and Review Committee’s
close attention to Smithsonian business, the Secretary’s and staff’s
strengthened measures regarding museum protection, and plans to
cope with ever-tightening budget stringencies. The Audit and Re-
view Committee reported on two of its meetings, one held jointly
with the Personnel Committee on October 14, 1981, and the other
held on December 2, 1981. The committee proposed a resolution to
indemnify Smithsonian Regents, officers, and employees for liabili-
ties and expenses incurred as a result of litigation arising from
service for the Institution, and the resolution was incorporated by
reference into a new Bylaw of the Board of Regents, Section 2.09,
entitled INDEMNIFICATION. The Audit and Review Committee also
reviewed possible insurance to cover the indemnification and,
accordingly, the Regents directed the Treasurer to secure appro-
priate ‘Directors and Officers” insurance.

The Audit and Review Committee decided that the thorough
auditing conducted annually on the Smithsonian’s trust funds
should be extended to an annual audit of the federally appropriated
funds by the Institution’s independent auditors, Coopers and
Lybrand. In view of the fundamental importance of this matter the
Regents expressly endorsed the committee’s action. Other commit-
tee reviews included:

Coopers and Lybrand’s audit of fiscal year 1981 trust funds;
Smithsonian procedures for reporting financial interests; draft

Statement by the Secretary / 19
standards of conduct; museum security; Smithsonian procedures
for construction and repair services; and computer services.

The Personnel Committee of the Regents reported that it had
reviewed the financial-interests statements of the Secretary’s top
assistants and that it found no conflict of interest whatsoever.

The Treasurer informed the Regents that a self-assessment
review has recently been conducted at the Institution to identify
lower priority programs that might be reduced or eliminated, and
alternative modes of operation that might create savings of dollars
or workyears. After extensive discussion, the Regents agreed that
in view of the existing security and financial constraints the Insti-
tution should eliminate summer evening hours on a trial basis,
subject, if necessary, to further review by the Audit and Review
Committee.

It was noted that final congressional action resulted in fiscal year
1982 federal appropriations totaling $142,534,000, some 9 percent
below the amount requested. That appropriation included $960,000
for Quadrangle planning—the first federal appropriation for this
project. The Treasurer also reported that the Office of Management
and Budget (oms) allowance for all appropriations for fiscal year
1983 was $192,610,000, reflecting increases for Museum Support
Center equipment, critical security and maintenance, and inflation
in pay, utilities, and rent. In addition, oms allowed the Institution’s
full request ($36.5 million) for Quadrangle construction, but did
not allow the Institution’s request for an additional 99 positions to
open and operate the Museum Support Center and 48 other posi-
tions to strengthen security.

The Investment Policy Committee reported that they met on
November 17, 1981, to review the performance of the Institution’s
three investment managers and to discuss strategies for the future.
It was noted that the managers continue to out-perform market
averages and that the annualized return from each of the managers
for the last three and one-half years was about 16 percent per year.

The Secretary outlined the Five-Year Prospectus, FY 1983-1987
and stressed his commitment to include projections beyond the
five-year period where appropriate. Priorities of the Institution
were the equipment for the Museum Support Center, the comple-
tion of the Quadrangle, the enhancement of collections manage-
ment activities, security, and automation. The Regents approved

20 / Smithsonian Year 1982
the Prospectus as submitted, in anticipation that annual revisions
will similarly be presented for approval.

The Secretary briefed the Regents on the status of the Quadran-
gle project, introducing Mr. George Brakeley of Brakeley, John
Price Jones, Inc., the fund-raising consultants. The total income
from unrestricted trust funds, gifts, pledges, and interest amounted
to $14,017,600 as of November 30, 1981. The Regents discussed
the strategies for raising the balance of the $37,500,000 from
domestic and foreign foundations, corporations, individuals, and
foreign governments. During the fall the Quadrangle design was
approved by both the National Capital Planning Commission and
the Commission on Fine Arts.

The Museum Support Center was reported to be 45 percent
complete and about two months ahead of the January 1983 com-
pletion date. In a report on the status of the collections inventory,
it was noted that the target date for completion of the baseline
inventories remains June 1983, after which the inventories will be
a continuing process and priority.

The Secretary presented a report on the equal opportunity pro-
gram, noting only marginal improvement in increasing the repre-
sentation of women and minorities, particularly in the higher
grades. Recognizing that commendable efforts have already been
made and without being critical, the Regents urged the administra-
tion to redouble its efforts and explore all possible strategies.
Subsequent to the meeting the Audit and Review Committee
agreed to review the subject in the spring.

In other actions, the Board of Regents effected an amendment to
the bylaws of the National Portrait Gallery Commission, reap-
pointed Mrs. Elizabeth Brooke Blake, Mr. David Lloyd Kreeger, and
Mrs. Margaret McKee to the National Museum of American Art
Commission, and paid tribute to the late Dr. Robert Elliot Silber-
- glied, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Insti-
tute, who died in a plane crash on January 13, 1982.

The Chancellor announced that Mr. Webb had resigned as chair-
man of the Executive Committee. Accepting that resignation with
great reluctance, the Chancellor assured the Regents that Mr. Webb
would remain on the Executive Committee for the duration of his
term. With the consent of the Regents, the Chancellor appointed
Mr. Humelsine as chairman, effective January 25, 1982.

Statement by the Secretary / 21

The traditional Regents’ Dinner was held on Sunday evening,
January 24, 1982, in the Thomas M. Evans Gallery of the National
Museum of Natural History/Museum of Man, where the exhibi-
tion Deep Ocean Photography provided a dramatic setting. The
Secretary addressed the guests about his and Mrs. Ripley’s faun-
istic and floristic survey of the Namdapha Region in Arunachal
Pradesh, India.

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was called to order
by the Chancellor on May 3, 1982, in the Regents’ Room. The
Executive Committee reported that it met on April 14 to consider
the proposed agenda for the Regents’ meeting. The committee
noted that the decision to restrict summer evening hours was wide-
ly announced and received little criticism. At the suggestion of the
committee, the Regents voted to confer on James E. Webb the title
of Regent Emeritus upon the expiration of his term on June 21 and
to elect David C. Acheson to membership on the committee effec-
tive June 22, 1982. After considering a large number of suggested
nominees, and the recommendation of the Executive Committee,
the Regents voted to request that the Congressional Regents intro-
duce and support legislation to appoint Nancy Hanks as a citizen
Regent of the Smithsonian, for the statutory term of six years.

It was noted that, in response to a poll conducted through the
mails in April, the Regents voted to establish the James E. Webb
Fellowships for the promotion of excellence in the management of
cultural and scientific not-for-profit institutions. The Regents ob-
served that this was a particularly appropriate honor for Mr. Webb
and that this program in public administration will be of great
benefit to the Institution.

The Audit and Review Committee reported that they met on
March 23, 1982. At that meeting the independent auditors, Coopers
and Lybrand, highlighted their December 31, 1981, Report to Man-
agement and introduced their consolidated audit plan for fiscal year
1982. Mr. Acheson reported that on March 13 the committee
visited the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York City. Mr. Hughes
had informed the Committee about a current, as yet incomplete,
internal audit of the gem collection in the National Museum of
Natural History/Museum of Man.

The Audit and Review Committee noted that the indemnifica-
tion resolution and bylaw adopted by the Regents on January 25,

22 / Smithsonian Year 1982
1982, had, through inadvertence, not included coverage for Regents
Emeritus and members of Regents’ committees and advisory bod-
ies. To effect this coverage—and to clarify the intent of the resolu-
tion that Smithsonian employees and officers will be indemnified
for liabilitity arising out of service on boards of other organiza-
tions when that service is part of official Smithsonian duties—the
Regents voted to amend the resolution and bylaws, Section 2.09.

The Treasurer informed the Regents that the Institution was
allowed to submit to Congress a supplemental appropriation re-
quest of $2.3 million to cover one-half of fiscal year 1982 pay-raise
costs. This amount, together with cost-reduction actions taken as a
result of the self-assessment review, will permit the Institution to
continue operations with a minimum of disruption to essential ac-
tivities. Revised projections for Unrestricted General Trust Funds
still anticipated a break-even budget, with increased net gains ex-
pected from the Smithsonian magazine being offset by lower re-
turns in other auxiliary activities and increased administrative
expenses.

The performance of the Institution’s investment managers was
reviewed by the Investment Policy Committee at its meeting on
April 28, 1982. Mr. Hohenlohe noted that total Smithsonian en-
dowments continued to outperform the standard market indices.
The Board of Regents approved the total return income payout for
fiscal year 1983 as recommended.

By invitation six members of the National Board of the Smith-
sonian Associates joined the meeting of the Board of Regents for
the discussion of the Quadrangle. The Secretary highlighted the
report circulated in advance, noting progress through the tentative
design phase. Accordingly, the architect’s drawings, specifications,
and construction estimate were submitted to the General Services
Administration. A second estimate was also obtained by the Insti-
tution. The estimates suggested that some cost savings will be re-
quired to meet the $75 million budget, but these savings will not
force any major alterations to the project. The Secretary added that
the Smithsonian will not appeal to Congress for any amount
greater than the $36.5 million requested for construction. He also
noted progress in the congressional approval of the construction
authorization.

Mr. Ripley outlined the foreign gifts and pledges to date and

Statement by the Secretary / 23
noted prospects for additional foreign donations. It was noted that
all gifts and pledges ($13,910,800), added to Smithsonian unre-
stricted fund transfer ($12,357,100), total $26,267,900—more than
two-thirds of the $37.5 million goal.

The Secretary underscored the importance of the National Board
of the Smithsonian Associates in the domestic fund-raising cam-
paign, noting that the extraordinary generosity and dedication of
several members has been critical to launching a sequential strategy
for soliciting leadership-level gifts, to be followed by an expanded
search for more moderate gifts. A series of special regional meet-
ings will be arranged for the Secretary in this connection. A
broader appeal to the entire membership of the National Associates
may ensue.

One of America’s leading collectors of Near and Far Eastern art,
Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, made a firm proposal for the donation of
works of oriental art valued at $50 million and also $4 million in
cash toward the construction costs of the Quadrangle, with the
condition that the new gallery of Near and Far Eastern art will be
named for him. After discussion, the Regents authorized the Secre-
tary to negotiate terms of the agreement, subject to further review
by the Board.

Mr. Ripley informed the Regents that the Museum Support Cen-
ter was 65 percent complete on April 22, 1982, and that procedures
are being developed to facilitate a complex, multi-stage move to the
center. The Secretary reported on the status of the Institution-wide
collections inventory and the progress in formulating up-to-date
collections management policies.

It was noted that the Secretary received the rank of Commander
in the Order of Orange-Nassau just prior to the visit of the Queen
of The Netherlands, in recognition of the work culminating in the
Queen’s opening of the De Stijl exhibition at the Hirshhorn Mu-
seum and Sculpture Garden, as well as, more generally, the Smith-
sonian’s work over the years. The Regents offered their approval
and congratulations.

The traditional Regents’ Dinner was held in honor of Mr. Webb
the evening of May 2, in the “Commons” of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution Building. The guests gathered in the Victorian Garden,
where a model of the Quadrangle was on view. The Chancellor
presented a citation to Mr. Webb dedicating the Webb Fellow-

ships in his honor: “”. . . the Webb Fellowships will nurture man-
agement abilities of Smithsonian employees and visiting scholars
for years to come—and will therefore continue to symbolize our
profound gratitude for this sensitive and dear colleague.” The Sec-
retary offered a toast to Dr. Fred L. Whipple, in whose name the
astronomical observatory at Mt. Hopkins was to be dedicated on
May 7, 1982. There followed a showing of the film In Open Air,
procured through the generosity of the Allbritton Foundation in
connection with the exhibition of the American Impressionists’
paintings.

The Chancellor called to order the autumn meeting of the Board
of Regents on Monday, September 20, 1982, in the Regents’ Room.
The Executive Committee reported on their August 25 meeting,
where the Committee discussed contingency plans, should a pay
supplemental appropriation not be forthcoming, and called for a
staff report on the projected deficit of the Division of Performing
Arts to be distributed to the Audit and Review Committee. The
Treasurer reported that the Institution’s banking and cash-manage-
ment systems are being simplified, streamlined, and modernized.
The Committee then discussed in detail the status of the Quad-
rangle project and agreed to recommend proceedings as proposed
(see below).

The Audit and Review Committee reported on its meeting of
May 21, 1982, noting that Coopers and Lybrand had found no
weaknesses in accounting and controls in their audit of fiscal year
1981 federal appropriations. Mr. Jameson presented a report on
the status of equal opportunity and affirmative action, emphasizing
the persisting problems of underrepresentation in professional and
administrative positions. The Committee received a report on the
organization of book publishing at the Smithsonian.

The Treasurer informed the Regents that the Institution received
a federal supplemental appropriation of $2.7 million, some $400,-
000 above the Institution’s request of $2.3 million for fiscal year
1982; that Unrestricted General Trust Funds were projected to pro-
vide a small surplus of $47,000, compared to an original breakeven
budget; and that substantial gains by the magazine, the National
Associates, and the Smithsonian Institution Press largely offset
higher administrative and program expenses and a substantial
deficit in the Division of Performing Arts.

26 / Smithsonian Year 1982

The Treasurer added that House and Senate mark-ups of the
Institution’s fiscal year 1983 appropriation request were not antici-
pated until late in September, and it would appear the Institution
would again be required to operate under a continuing resolution
for a portion of the new fiscal year. Net income from Unrestricted
General Trust Funds is expected to total $12,237,000 in fiscal year
1983, an increase of $720,000, due primarily to improved perfor-
mance in certain of the auxiliary activities and holding program
growth and administrative costs to a minimum. The Regents ap-
proved this budget, reauthorizing the Collections Acquisition,
Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach programs for a sec-
ond five-year period at an annual level of $2.2 million, an increase
of $200,000 above the previous funding level. This increase will
allow some expansion for research and education outreach projects
and will expand the Collections Acquisition Program to include the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum. The Regents reviewed and approved for
submission to the Office of Management and Budget a request for
federal appropriations totaling $178,653,000 for fiscal year 1984.
The Secretary added that, with the approval of the Chairman of
the Executive Committee, the Institution signed a contract for the
sale of the Belmont Conference Center and 82 surrounding acres
to the American Chemical Society.

The Regents’ Investment Policy Committee reported that the
market value of the Smithsonian Endowment Funds, paralleling
substantial gains in the stock market, increased from $77.4 million
at the end of June to just under $85 million as of the beginning of
September. Over the last four years and two months, there has
been an annual compounded rate of return of 13.3 percent, some
two percentage points ahead of the major market indices and well
ahead of the annual inflation rate of approximately 10 percent.

The Secretary reported on the completion of the intermediate
working plans for the Quadrangle, noting that final plans are ex-
pected to be completed by November 15. A request for bids will be
issued in early January. To save about three months and approxi-
mately $1.5 million in escalation costs, separate design and bid
packages are being prepared for solicitation—as soon as receipt of
a construction appropriation is assured—for constructing a perim-
eter fence, removing existing landscape materials, and relocating
utility lines. On September 14 the Commission on Fine Arts gave

Statement by the Secretary / 27
general approval to the building plans but asked for further study
of landscaping details. The National Capital Planning Commission
will review the project in October.

The Secretary added that, in accordance with the Regents’ earlier
approval, he signed an agreement with Dr. Sackler providing for a
pledge of $4 million toward construction of the Quadrangle; a
donation of nearly 1,000 works of Oriental art valued at well over
$50 million and selected by the director of the Freer Gallery; a
provision that the director of the Freer be also the director of the
western portion of the Quadrangle interconnecting with the Freer,
such portion to be known as the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery; and
that the director be assisted by an assistant director whose prin-
cipal duty would be day-to-day management of the gallery; a
mutual commitment to continue a program of scholarly publica-
tion based on the collection, conducted at the donor’s expense; and
an understanding that the donor’s commitments are contingent
upon the Smithsonian obtaining $36.5 million in federal funds for
construction costs by July 1983.

Mr. Ripley stated that as of July 31, 1982, a total of $27.4 mil-
lion had been raised or committed toward the fund-raising goal of
$37.5 million. The sequential fund-raising technique recommended
by Brakeley, John Price Jones, Inc., is being utilized, concentrating
first on commitments from prospects with substantial gift potential
and those with close associations with the Smithsonian. Members
of the National Board of Smithsonian Associates have given or
pledged $1.4 million, and that total is expected to reach $2 million.
Members of that board have also assumed active roles in fund-
raising among corporations, foundations, and other individuals,
and have been helping to organize regional functions at which the
Secretary will present the concepts and plans for the Quadrangle
to local leadership. A broad general appeal will be directed to
Smithsonian Associates through Smithsonian magazine in 1983.
Solicitation of foreign gifts continues in the Middle East and South-
east Asia and among businesses with interests in African nations.
Mr. Brakeley stated that the campaign is going very well and he
is confident that the required funds will be raised on schedule.

The Quadrangle authorizing legislation, signed June 24, 1982,
stipulated that no funds appropriated for construction shall be ob-
ligated or expended until the Regents have available from non-

federal sources a sum which, when combined with the appropriated
funds, is sufficient for the construction. Assuming approval of this
appropriation (the House included it in the continuing resolution
for fiscal year 1983), the Board of Regents needed to certify the
availability of the nonfederal sources before any construction ap-
priation could be obligated. Given the success of efforts to date,
the strength of future prospects, and the existence of trust funds in
the event insufficient funds are raised, the Regents voted to express
gratitude to the Congress and the President for the authorization
of the Quadrangle project and the anticipated implementing appro-
priation; to affirm full confidence in the ability of the Institution
to secure from nonfederal sources remaining funds to total $37.5
million towards the Quadrangle project; to pledge that unrestricted
trust funds of the Institution will be directed to the project to the
extent necessary to guarantee its commitment of $37.5 million of
nonfederal funds; and to certify therefore that, with an appropria-
tion as requested, total project funds of $75 million are available,
and construction may commence. Subsequent to the meeting, the
Regents’ resolution was communicated to the chairmen of the
Smithsonian’s authorizing and appropriations committees in the
Congress.

The Secretary highlighted a report on the construction of the
Museum Support Center, then more than 90 percent complete,
ahead of schedule, and within budget. Favorable bids were received
for supplying the storage equipment for “’wet” collections, while
specifications continue to be developed for other kinds of storage
equipment (to be bid in January 1983).

In recognition of Mr. Warren Robbins’s service to the Smith-
sonian and to the nation in founding the National Museum of
African Art and overseeing its development from a small private
venture to its present status, the Regents voted to award him the
Henry Medal. The Regents also voted to appoint to the Commis-
sion of the National Museum of African Art, effective January 1,
1983, Frank Moss, Frances Humphrey Howard, Roy Sieber, David
Driskell, and Robert Nooter for a term of three years; Walter
Washington, Richard Long, John Loughran, Susan Samuels, and
Robert Thompson for a term of two years; and Franklin Williams,
Lee Bronson, John Duncan, Michael Sonnenreich, and Sylvia Boone
for a term of one year.

It was noted that in response to the Acting Secretary’s letter of
June 15, the Regents had unanimously voted to concur in the pro-
posed agreement for the purchase of Gilbert Stuart’s “Edgehill”
portrait of Thomas Jefferson. The Secretary added that the acquisi-
tion has proceeded as outlined, and this unique portrait is now
shared by the National Portrait Gallery and Monticello at a cost of
$500,000 to each. Display of the portrait will alternate between
the two every three years.

The Secretary also reported that Julian T. Euell, Assistant Secre-
tary for Public Service since 1973, will be leaving to become direc-
tor of the Oakland Museum, October 1, and the Secretary added
he will be reorganizing some aspects of the Public Service func-
tions at that time.

The traditional dinner was held on Sunday evening, Septem-
ber 19, at the National Zoo in the Reptile House, following cock-
tails in the Ape House. After dinner the Secretary greeted the
Regents and guests and introduced the new Regent, Miss Hanks.
He also paid tribute to the departing Assistant Secretary for Public
Service, Julian T. Euell. He went on to honor the generous sup-
porters of the Quadrangle, particularly Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, and
spoke briefly about his aspirations for this significant addition to
the Smithsonian’s museums.

CHRISTIAN C. HOHENLOHE, TREASURER

Summary: In fiscal year 1982, the overall financial resources pro-
vided to the Smithsonian permitted maintenance of its extensive
programs in exhibits and research, in public education and out-
reach. During this time of financial uncertainty, the continued
strong support from Congress, from donors, from granting agen-
cies, and from revenue-generating auxiliary activities made possible
the progress and important accomplishments noted elsewhere in
this report. The bar chart on the facing page summarizes the funds
provided to the Smithsonian from a wide variety of sources, as well
as the application of these moneys for an equally diverse range of
programs. Evident from this chart is the growth of the operating
budget in 1982 over prior years; as in the most recent years, how-
ever, this growth related less to program expansion than to the
ever higher costs of salaries, supplies, utilities, and collection pur-
chases. While some enhancements were possible, notably for the
new Museum Support Center and for the collection inventory pro-
cess, the year was characterized by fiscal restraint, self-assessment,
and cost-reduction efforts. Due to partial hiring freezes and budget
constraints, the full-time staff of the Smithsonian was kept to a
level below that of last year.

While not unaffected by the government budget restrictions of
this fiscal year, the Institution was nevertheless allowed a federal
appropriation sufficient to sustain ongoing operations. After de-
tailed and understanding review by the Congress, total federal ap-
propriations of some $145 million were passed, including $131 mil-
lion for operations; it is this appropriation which provides the In-
stitution’s base resources for research, education, and exhibition

33
programs, for study and care of the national collections, and for
administrative and support services. Of signal importance to the
Institution was a planning appropriation of $1 million in support
of the Quadrangle, the center more fully described by the Secre-
tary in his Statement; this commitment of federal funds to a proj-
ect whose costs will be met from matched federal and nonfederal
funds was most welcome. (Subsequently, on October 2, 1982, the
remaining funds of $36.5 million were voted and signed by the
President for fiscal year 1983.) Also important to the Institution in
fulfilling its public duties was the annual appropriation for the nec-
essary, but less inspiring, task of repairing and maintaining the
large and diverse physical plant. Significant funding was also re-
ceived from federal agencies in the form of grants and contracts,
primarily for scientific research.

In addition to the core support provided by the federal appro-
priations, the Institution is also dependent on nonappropriated
trust funds to enrich its programs and expand their reach. Strong
public acceptance of the Institution’s services continued during the
year, with tangible financial return from the Smithsonian Asso-
ciates programs and other auxiliary activities, as well as generous
gifts and grants from individuals, foundations, and corporations.
While net revenues from nonappropriated sources, after deduction
of the operating expenses and sales costs of auxiliary activities,
were lower than in fiscal year 1981, ongoing program commitments
were met, and, as budgeted, transfers were made of $2 million to
unrestricted endowment and $1 million toward Quadrangle con-
struction reserve. Together with the transfers of prior years as
well as favorable investment return, the unrestricted endowment
of the Institution now totals some $37 million; continued addition
to this fund remains a high priority of the Institution.

Significant progress was made during the year in securing finan-
cial support for the Quadrangle. As outlined more fully below,
gifts and commitments to this project from outside sources as well
as the Institution’s own resources now total almost three-quarters
of the nonfederal funds of $37.5 million needed for construction.
Fund-raising efforts for this major project are actively underway.

Operating Funds—Sources and Application

Growth in the overall operating budget of the Institution contin-
ued, but at a slightly slower pace than experienced in previous
years. Total gross operating funds, as shown in Table 1, increased
by over $17 million, or 7 percent, from $236,296,000 in fiscal year
1981 to $253,366,000 in fiscal year 1982. These funds were derived
from three major sources: 52 percent from federal appropriations,
43 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 5 percent from fed-
eral agency grants and contracts.

After deducting expenses of the nonappropriated auxiliary and
bureau activities, net operating income grew by only $4.4 million,
approximately 3 percent, and was derived 80 percent from federal
appropriations, 12 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 8
percent from federal agency grants and contracts. Application of
these funds by all Smithsonian bureaux is outlined in Table 2, with
further supporting detail in succeeding tables.

FEDERAL APPROPRIATION

The federal appropriation for the core operating programs of the
Institution totaled $131,170,000 in fiscal year 1982. The increase
of $8.7 million, or 7 percent, over fiscal year 1981 was approxi-
mately equivalent to increased costs resulting from inflation in
such areas as pay, utilities, rent, and other objects of expense. The
appropriation included specific increases for these inflationary costs
as well as for such high-priority programs as the inventory of col-
lections and equipping of the Museum Support Center. These were,
however, partially offset by an across-the-board reduction to all
Smithsonian programs, part of a government-wide cutback aimed
at reducing the nation’s overall budget deficit. In order to prevent
major disruption to ongoing programs and public activities, a series
of financial actions were taken. Additional control on hiring, travel,
and all nonessential purchases and contracts was instituted. Based
on a comprehensive management review of all Smithsonian pro-
grams, certain activities were curtailed or deferred, including elim-
ination of spring and summer evening visiting hours in all mu-
seums except the National Air and Space Museum and the Na-
tional Zoological Park. Following regulations set forth by congres-
sional committees, funds were reprogrammed among bureaux to

36 / Smithsonian Year 1982
meet priority needs. These actions enabled the Institution to com-
plete the year with a minimum of disruption.

FEDERAL AGENCY GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

Grants and contracts from federal agencies totaled $13,217,000,
approximately 7 percent less than received in the previous year.
This support not only contributed substantially to research and
educational projects being conducted by Smithsonian personnel,
but also benefited the granting agencies by providing access to
specific expertise and resources maintained at the Institution. As
illustrated in Table 3, the majority of these funds, over $9 million,
were provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion to continue work at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory in satellite tracking, maser design and construction, and stud-
ies of the upper atmosphere and stellar magnetic fields. Support
from the Defense Department, the National Science Foundation,
and other government agencies provided an additional $4 million—
primarily to science activities—for a broad spectrum of projects,
including dating Antarctic ice sheets, enhancement of a volcano
data file, a tumor registry program, coral-reef research, sorting and
study of polar marine specimens, a medical entomology project,
and the Smithsonian’s annual Festival of American Folklife.

NONAPPROPRIATED TRUST FUNDS

In fiscal year 1982, nonappropriated trust fund revenues to the
Institution from gifts and grants, endowment fund and current in-
vestments, and revenue-producing activities totaled $108,979,000,
an increase of $9,333,000, or 9 percent, over fiscal year 1981. After
deduction of expenses incurred by the bureau and auxiliary activi-
ties, however, net income declined by $3,339,000 to a total of
$20,383,000. As displayed in Table 2, these revenues provided
support for programs of virtually every bureau of the Institution.

Restricted fund income to the Institution totaled $6,821,000 for
the year, of which $3,154,000 was derived from gifts and grants;
$2,886,000 from restricted purpose endowment investment income
and interest paid on fund balances of restricted purpose funds; and
$781,000 from other sources, including primarily fund-raising ac-
tivities of the Archives of American Art and Cooper-Hewitt Mu-
seum and the sales desk at the Freer Gallery of Art. Available only

for specified purposes, restricted funds provided substantial sup-
port for a wide variety of research, exhibitions, publications, and
educational activities, and served as the major funding source for
the Freer Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Marine Station at
Link Port (formerly the Fort Pierce Bureau). A particularly signifi-
cant contribution was received by the Office of Museum Programs
in fiscal year 1982 in the form of a three-year grant of $1.1 million
from the Kellogg Foundation. This grant will be used to fund a
series of fellowships, colloquia, workshops, and videotapes de-
signed to strengthen the education role of America’s museums.
Revenues to Unrestricted Special Purpose funds during the year
totaled $4.7 million. Bureau activities, such as the National Air
and Space Museum Theater and the membership programs of the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum, generated revenues of $2,925,000, while
gifts, interest earned on the investment of bureau fund balances,
zoo parking revenues, and other miscellaneous income accounted
for an additional $1,786,000. Also included in this fund category
are allocations for the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies,
and Educational Outreach programs, for pre- and postdoctoral fel-
lowship awards, and for revenue-sharing to bureaux housing cen-

trally managed shop and concession activities. As specified by the
Bylaws of the Regents, transfers were made to endowment of
otherwise unrestricted bequests received during the year.

Unrestricted General Purpose fund revenue is derived primarily
from investment income and net revenues of the auxiliary activi-
ties. After deduction of auxiliary activity expenses, net general
unrestricted funds provided some $11 million for general Institu-
tional purposes, a decrease of approximately $3.5 million, or 24
percent, from the previous year (see Table 6).

Several factors have contributed to this reduction in income,
including lower postal subsidies to nonprofit organizations, lower
museum visitation, limiting of summer evening hours to the Na-
tional Zoological Park and the National Air and Space Museum,
and higher expenses, particularly as related to the recording pro-
gram of the Division of Performing Arts. Unanticipated costs of
promotion and record production combined with an unfortunately
high rate of bad debts and inventory adjustments resulted in a net
loss to this activity of more than $2.5 million. Of net revenues
generated by the auxiliary activities, some $8.1 million was from
the Associates programs. The Smithsonian magazine was respon-
sible for the majority of this income, continuing its success of pre-
vious years. Sizable surpluses totaling over $1.5 million were also
generated by the Museum Shops, the Mail Order Division, and the
Smithsonian Institution Press, which in fiscal year 1982 was re-
organized to include the publishing activities of the Smithsonian
Exposition Books. Income generated by concessions, parking, and
food services provided an additional $1.5 million, which was some-
what below last year’s results, due primarily to lower visitation
and the costs of converting two concessionaire-managed food fa-
cilities (at the National Air and Space Museum and the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden) to Smithsonian-run operations.

Notwithstanding the decline in unrestricted general purpose rev-
enues, continued support was provided a wide range of administra-
tive and programmatic activities, including major operating sup-
port for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Office of Telecommuni-
cations, Office of Folklife Programs, and the Visitor Information
and Reception Center. Special allotments were also made for fund-
raising efforts related to the Quadrangle construction, for the coop-
erative education and other programs initiated in fiscal year 1981

education, research, and outreach projects. These allocations al-
lowed the purchase of significant works including a major collec-
tion of West African textiles, a portrait of Thomas Jefferson
painted by Gilbert Stuart, and two seventeenth-century Chinese
scroll paintings by Tao-chi. The funds permitted extension of the
Institution’s outreach through special lectures and concerts, radio
features on Smithsonian activities, and programs for the elderly
and institutionalized, and also furthered research in such diverse
areas as the ecological impact of the Africanized honeybees in Cen-
tral America, the behavioral ecology of reef sharks, and the devel-
opment of an oral history on the origins of modern astronomy and

to plant funds for Quadrangle development, and $2,021,000 to un-
restricted endowment principal to ensure income for future needs.

Special Foreign Currency Program

Foreign currencies accumulated from sales of surplus agricultural
commodities under Public Law 83-480, determined by the Treasury
Department to be in excess of the normal needs of the United
States, are made available to the Smithsonian through the Special
Foreign Currency Program. An appropriation of excess foreign cur-
rencies equivalent to $4,320,000 was received under this program
in fiscal year 1982. Some $3.4 million was used to continue a pro-
gram of grants to United States institutions for field research
and advanced professional training in the countries of Burma,
India, and Pakistan. Fields of study focused on areas of traditional
Smithsonian competence, including archaeology and related disci-
plines, systematic and environmental biology, astrophysics and
earth sciences, and museum programs. The balance of funds ap-
propriated—$960,000—was provided for the international effort to
preserve the monumental site of Moenjodaro in Pakistan. This ap-
propriation represented the first increment of a total of $4 million
equivalent in nonconvertible Pakistani currency expected to be

the project. Obligations during the fiscal year by research discipline
and country are provided in Table 8.

Construction

Funding provided for construction and renovation projects at the
Institution totaled $12,962,000 in fiscal year 1982, as shown in
Table 9. Of this amount, $9,744,000 was from federal appropria-
tions, and $3,218,000 was from nonappropriated trust funds.

An appropriation of $7,680,000 was provided for major repairs,
renovation, and building improvements to Smithsonian facilities,
with a further $1,104,000 designated specifically for buildings and
exhibits of the National Zoological Park. Projects supported by
these appropriations included maintenance of building exteriors,
particularly of the Arts and Industries Building and the Renwick
Gallery; renovations to protect the safety, security, and health of
the public, staff, and collections; elimination of architectural bar-
riers to assure accessibility for disabled persons; energy conserva-
tion efforts; and programmatic modifications to outlying research
and animal preservation facilities.

An additional $960,000 was provided for Quadrangle develop-
ment planning, marking the first federal appropriation for this
project for which planning has been underway since 1978 with
support from unrestricted trust funds. The Quadrangle represents
a special partnership of federal and nonfederal funding; of the
anticipated total construction cost of $75 million, one-half will be
provided from federal appropriations and one-half from nonappro-
priated sources. As of the end of the fiscal year, gifts for the
Quadrangle, transfers from unrestricted trust funds, and earned
interest totaled some $9,656,000; together with additional com-
mitments from outside sources, anticipated revenues from the sale
of real estate, and planned unrestricted trust fund transfers in the
future, over $27.6 million of the $37.5 million has been raised. In
recognition of the success of fund-raising efforts and of the Insti-
tution’s commitment to the project, a construction appropriation of
$36.5 million was passed in October 1982, and construction will
commence early in 1983.

on September 30, 1981. The majority of these funds—$88,858,000
—is invested in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment fund under
outside investment management; $1 million is on permanent de-
posit with the United States Treasury; and the remaining $373,000
is held in miscellaneous securities and donated real estate. Approxi-
mately 59 percent of the endowments, as shown in Table 10, are

restricted, with income available only for purposes specified by the
donor. The remaining 41 percent—or $37,160,000—are unre-
stricted, with income available for general Institutional purposes;
certain of these unrestricted funds, however, such as the Lindbergh
Chair of Aerospace History, have been designated internally for
specific purposes, as noted in Table 13, which lists all Smithsonian
endowments.

Investment management of the Pooled Consolidated Endowment
fund is conducted by three professional advisory firms under the
oversight of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer,
and subject to guidelines established by the Board of Regents. As
of the end of fiscal year 1982, the firms (with their respective por-
tions of the fund) were Fiduciary Trust Company of New York
(50 percent), Batterymarch Financial Management Corp. (31 per-
cent), and Torray Clark & Company (19 percent). The total rate of
return for the fund during fiscal year 1982, as calculated by an
outside investment measurement service, was +15.7 percent (in-
cluding interest and dividend income as well as market value ap-
preciation), as compared to +12.1 percent for the Dow Jones In-
dustrial Average and +9.9 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500
average (both calculated on the same basis). Table 11 displays the
market values of the major components of the fund for prior years,
and the activity during the past year is shown on Table 12.

The Smithsonian utilizes the Total Return Income policy, which
defines total investment return as yield (interest and dividends) plus
appreciation, including both realized and unrealized capital gains.
A portion of this return is made available for expenditure each

year, and the remainder is retained as principal. This total return
income payout is determined in advance each year by the Board
of Regents based on studies of anticipated interest and dividend
yields, the Institution’s programmatic needs, inflationary factors,
and the five-year running average of market values, adjusted for
capital additions or withdrawals. The income payout rate for fiscal
year 1982 to restricted purpose endowments in the Pooled Consoli-
dated Endowment fund constituted an 8 percent increase over the
prior year, while the payout to unrestricted endowments was re-
duced from the earlier level, permitting a proportionately greater
reinvestment for unrestricted endowments. After the income payout
of $3,275,000 during the year, a total of $2,064,000 of excess inter-
est and dividend yield was reinvested into endowment principal.

A full listing of all endowment funds is shown on Table 13. De-
tail of the securities held in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment
fund as of September 30, 1982, may be obtained upon request

Related Organizations

The Science Information Exchange, Inc., which has served as a
national source for information on research in progress since its
founding in 1949, ceased operation on October 31, 1981; a certifi-
cate of dissolution was granted in June 1982. Under a contract with
the Department of Commerce, the Institution has continued dur-
ing the past year to provide the Exchange with administrative and
fiscal services necessary to closing out the operation, transferring
the assets to the Department of Commerce, and paying the out-
standing net liabilities. All operations are expected to be closed
out by June 1983.

Reading is Fundamental, Inc., associated with the Institution
since 1968, is an independent, separately incorporated entity dedi-
cated to the improvement of reading abilities in children. Primary
support is derived from private contributions and a federal con-
tract with the Department of Education to operate the federal
Inexpensive Book Distribution Program.

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the
National Gallery of Art, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts were established by Congress within the Institu-
tion but are administered by separate boards of trustees. Inde-
pendent financial reports are prepared by each of these organiza-
tions. Office space and fiscal and other administrative and support
activities are provided the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars on a reimbursement basis.

The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) is an independent, non-
profit corporation working closely with the National Zoological
Park. It operates, under contract, a number of beneficial conces-
sions for the National Zoo; Fonz provided concession and rental
fees to the Zoo amounting to approximately $268,000 during cal-
endar year 1981 (FoNz’s fiscal year). In addition, Fonz contributed
other important financial and volunteer support to Zoo programs.
Financial affairs of this organization are described separately else-
where in Smithsonian Year 1982.

54 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Accounting and Auditing

The nonappropriated trust funds of the Institution are audited an-
nually by an independent public accounting firm. In order to pro-
vide a comprehensive audit of all Smithsonian funds, this inde-
pendent verification has been extended in fiscal year 1982 to cover
appropriated funds as well, and the report of Coopers & Lybrand
is contained in the following pages. Additional reviews are con-
ducted annually on a number of Smithsonian activities by the in-
ternal audit staff. Additionally, the Defense Contract Audit Agency
conducts an annual audit of grants and contracts received from
federal agencies, as well as their allocated administrative costs.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Regents met during the
year pursuant to their responsibility, under the bylaws of the Insti-
tution, for reviewing the Smithsonian’s accounting systems and
internal financial controls; for facilitating communication between
the Board of Regents and auditors from the internal audit staff,
the independent accounting firm, and the General Accounting
Office; and for reviewing operations of the Institution for compli-
ance with approved programs and policies.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution

We have examined the statement of financial condition of the
Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1982 and the related
statement of financial activity for the year then ended. Our exam-
ination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards and with generally accepted governmental auditing stan-
dards and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting rec-
ords and such other auditing procedures as we considered neces-
sary in the circumstances. We previously examined and separately
reported upon the statements of the trust funds and the statements
of the federal appropriations of the Smithsonian Institution for the
year ended September 30, 1981, combined totals of which are in-
cluded in the accompanying financial statements for comparative
purposes only.

In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended Sep-
tember 30, 1982, referred to above, present fairly the financial
position of the Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1982,
and the results of operations and changes in fund balances for the
year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of Presentation. These financial statements do not include the accounts
of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which
were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (Institution)
but are administered under separate boards of trustees. (See Note 2.)

The accounts of the federal funds have been prepared on the obligation basis
of accounting, which basis is in accordance with accounting principles pre-
scribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth in the
Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The obliga-
tion basis of accounting differs in some respects from generally accepted
accounting principles. Under this basis of accounting, commitments, such as
purchase orders and contracts, are recognized as expenditures, and the related
obligations are reported on the balance sheet even though goods and services
have not been received. Such commitments aggregate $30,929,000 at Sep-
tember 30, 1982.

The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from
private sources, from federal grants and contracts and from certain business
activities related to the operations of the Institution. The federal funds reflect
the receipt and expenditures of funds obtained from Congressional appro-
priations.

Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed
on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the
Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund account-
ing. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classi-
fied for funds control, accounting and reporting purposes into funds estab-
lished according to their appropriation, nature and purposes. Separate ac-
counts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying finan-
cial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined
into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded
and reported by fund group.

The assets, liabilities and fund balances of the Institution are reported in
self-balancing fund groups as follows:

Trust current funds, which include unrestricted resources, represent the
portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution
operations. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific purposes are
segregated from other current funds.

60 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to
restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the princi-
pal be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endow-
ment and similar funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of princi-
pal but only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment
funds. Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing
board for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion
of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds rep-
resent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the
principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the
governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the
income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.

Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisi-
tions and funds expended for plant.

Federal operating funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is
available for support of Institution operations. Separate subfund groups
are maintained for each appropriation—Salaries and Expenses appropria-
tions, Special Foreign Currency appropriations, and Barro Colorado
Island Trust Fund.

The balance of this fund represents amounts available for support of
specific Institution operations including the Special Foreign Currency
Program, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Appropriations, and Barro Colorado
Island Trust Fund.

Federal construction funds represent the portion of expendable funds
that is available for building and facility construction, restoration, reno-
vation and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each ap-
propriation—Construction and Improvements, National Zoological Park,
Restoration and Renovation of Buildings and Museum Support Center.

Federal capital funds represent the amount of the investment of the
United States Government in the net assets of the Institution acquired
with federal funds and nonexpendable property transfers from Govern-
ment agencies.

Investments. All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other
disposition of investments are accounted for in the fund in which the related
assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar
manner, except for income derived from investments of endowment and simi-
lar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if
unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds.

Merchandise inventory. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or retail cost
method (for those inventories held for resale).

Materials and supplies inventory. Inventories of materials and supplies are
carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method.

Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian
Magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription,

Financial Report / 61
which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian
Magazine are charged against income over the period of the subscription.

The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary
activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.

Works of art, living or other specimens. The Institution acquires its collec-
tions, which include works of art, library books, photographic archives, ob-
jects and specimens, through purchase or by donation of the items them-
selves. In accordance with policies generally followed by museums, no value
is assigned to the collections on the statement of financial condition. Pur-
chases for the collections are expensed currently.

Property and equipment. Capital improvements and equipment purchased
with trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized at
cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of three to ten years. All other capital improvements and equipment
purchased with trust funds are expensed currently.

Real estate (land and buildings) purchased with trust funds is recorded at
cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended there-
for, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in
the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at
nominal values. Depreciation on buildings purchased with trust funds is
not recorded.

Buildings and other structures, additions to buildings and fixed equipment
purchased with federal funds are recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over a period of 30 years.

Certain lands occupied by the Smithsonian Institution’s buildings were ap-
propriated and reserved by the Congress for that purpose and are not re-
flected in the accompanying financial statements. Property and nonexpendable
equipment acquired through transfer from Government agencies are capi-
talized at the transfer price or at estimated amounts taking into consideration
their usefulness, condition and market value. Nonexpendable equipment pur-
chased with federal funds is recorded at cost depreciated on a straight-line
basis over a period of 10 years.

Government contracts. The Institution has a number of contracts with the
U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the
Institution. Contract revenue is recognized when billable or received in the
trust funds.

Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made
significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s
programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these state-
ments since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.

Annual leave unfunded. The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual
leave in accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the
cost of leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense. The
cost of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accompanying
financial statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal funds.

2. Related activities

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several sepa-
rately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution
serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these
organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institu-
tion facilities occupied, etc. totaled approximately $323,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1982. The following summarizes the approximate ex-
penditures of these organizations for the fiscal year ended September 30,
1982 as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not
included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund
subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at
market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction
takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $148.04,
290,802 units were owned by endowment, and 309,427 units were owned by
quasi-endowment at September 30, 1982.

64 / Smithsonian Year 1982
The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment manage-
ment of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach,
the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized
gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to
the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and the
amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from
the current funds.

In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being
available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such
factors as, but not limited to: (1) 41/2°/o of the five-year average of the mar-
ket value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period),
(2) current dividends and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and
scientists and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price
Index; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment
fund is less than 110°/o of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of
donation), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends
received. The total return factor for 1982 was $5.94 per unit to the Restricted
and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $5.00 per unit to the Unre-
stricted General Purpose Endowment Funds; new units were purchased for
the Unrestricted Endowment Funds with the $.94, the difference in the total
return factor. The total return applied for 1982 was $2,230,000 to the Re-
stricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $1,046,000 to the
Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds.

Endowment reimbursement represents payment of income, which had accu-
mulated in principal of the endowment funds, in accordance with a settle-
ment related to a lawsuit.

7. Receivables

Receivables at September 30, 1982 included the following:

8. Advance payments

Advance payments represent advances made to Government agencies, educa-
tional institutions, firms and individuals for services to be rendered or prop-
erty or materials to be furnished.

Financial Report / 65
As of September 30, 1982, the Institution has advances outstanding to the
U.S. Government of approximately $4,084,000, principally for construction
services to be received in the future. The Institution at that date also had
advances outstanding to educational institutions amounting to approximately
$2,150,000, principally under the Special Foreign Currency Program.

9. Property and equipment

At September 30, 1982, property and equipment which has been capitalized
(see Note 1) is comprised of the following:

Depreciation and amortization expense reflected in expenditures of the cur-
rent funds for 1982 was $495,000. Depreciation expense reflected in expendi-
tures of the capital funds of 1982 was $9,619,000.

The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1982 includes $8,568,000 of
unexpended plant funds.

10. Pension plan

The Institution has separate retirement plans for trust and federal employees.
Under the trust fund’s plan, both the Institution and employees contribute
stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual annui-
ties, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The cost
of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1982 was $2,771,000. It is the
policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently. There are no
unfunded prior service costs under the plan.

The federal employees of the Institution are covered by the Civil Service
Retirement Program. Under this program, the Institution withholds from the
gross pay of each federal employee and remits to the Civil Service Retire-
ment and Disability Fund (Fund) the amounts specified by such program.

66 / Smithsonian Year 1982
The Institution contributes 7°/o of basic annual salary to the Fund. The cost
of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1982 was approximately
$5,200,000.

11. Excess of expenditures and other deductions

The net excess of expenditures and other deductions over revenue and other
additions disclosed for federal operating and construction funds in the State-
ment of Activity for the year ended September 30, 1982 arise because certain
multiyear appropriations, having been recorded as income in prior years and
carried forward as fund balance, were expended during the year.

12. Nonmandatory transfers for designated purposes

The following transfers among trust funds were made for the year ended
September 30, 1982 in thousands of dollars:

13. Income taxes

The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Sec-
tion 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that
section are taxable only on their unrelated business income. The Internal
Revenue Service has issued a Technical Advice Memorandum to the Institu-
tion indicating that income derived from sales of certain items in the Museum
Shops may constitute unrelated business taxable income. The application of
this memorandum is under discussion with the Internal Revenue Service.

It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an
instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the
Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income
taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such dual status but
intends to do so in the near future.

Management believes that any income taxes required as a result of settlement
of these matters would not have a material effect upon the financial position
of the Institution.

SCIENCE

DAVID CHALLINOR,
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies

Effective management of renewable resources is dependent on
knowledge of the factors that influence the abundance and distri-
bution of biological populations. A major question to be answered
for management purposes is the extent to which variations in these
populations result from the activities of man or from fluctuations
in natural phenemona (e.g. seasonal and longer-term weather con-
ditions). Long-term environmental research at the Chesapeake Bay
Center for Environmental Studies (cBces) is focused on these ques-
tions in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats.

Educational research at the center is focused on a better under-
standing of the extent and effectiveness of educational processes
that occur outside the formal school setting. Of particular interest
are learning in museum-like settings and the role the family may
play in increasing public understanding of science.

AIRSHED AND WATERSHED STUDIES

On-going cBces watershed research focused on the effects of in-
creased acidity on ecosystem processes and the role of buffer-zone
forests in modifying runoff from agricultural fields. The former
study, conducted by David Correll and Deborah Ford, has docu-
mented a long-term increase in rainfall acidity, with an accom-
panying increase in hydrogen ion inputs. The data indicate that

69
hydrogen ions may be displacing significant amounts of essential
plant nutrients (magnesium, calcium, potassium) from the soil.

The second project, conducted by Correll and William Peterjohn,
showed that riparian forest vegetation is important in removing
nutrients and sediments from surface and subsurface water. Sur-
face runoff from a 10 ha experimental cornfield was reduced by
approximately 4.1 tonnes of particulate matter, 11 kg of particulate
organic nitrogen, .83 kg of ammonia nitrogen, 2.7 kg of nitrate
nitrogen, and 3 kg of total particulate phosphorus per ha of ri-
parian forest. In addition, 45 kg per ha per year of nitrate was
removed from subsurface water that flowed from the cornfield
through the riparian forest. This study demonstrated how nutrient
and sediment removal by the solar-powered natural riparian forests
can be coupled with intensely managed agro-ecosystems to control
diffuse source pollution.

ESTUARINE RESEARCH

As part of the watershed/estuarine research program, a study was
conducted by Thomas Jordan, David Correll, and Dennis Whigham
to determine the roles of high and low elevation estuarine marshes
in nutrient-exchange processes within the estuary. The study
showed that both types of marshes imported particulate carbon
and nitrogen and exported dissolved nitrogen and carbon. Particu-
late phosphorus was imported, and dissolved phosphorus was
exported only by the low elevation Typha (cattail marsh).

Data from the tidal exchange studies were then combined with
data from the csces watershed study to determine the relative role
of the marshes—compared to tidal mudflats—in over-all nutrient
flux within the estuarine basin. The marshes were shown to have
only a minor effect on total mass balance of carbon, nitrogen, and
phosphorus when compared to the mudflats. The primary role of
marshes seems to be transformation of particulate nutrients into
dissolved nutrients.

In companion studies, Park Rublee, Susan Merkel, and Maria
Faust studied the role of microorganisms in tidal nutrient transport
from the Rhode River marshes. Fluxes of bacteria, phytoplankton,
and several dissolved organic compounds were traced in the high
and low elevation marshes. Flux calculations suggested a small,
net import of both bacterial and algal biomass into the marshes.

70 / Smithsonian Year 1982
In agreement with the nutrient flux studies, this project showed
that the primary role of microorganisms in marshes appears to be
nutrient recycling rather than transport.

Rublee, Merkel, and Faust also found that bacterial biomass did
not account for a large portion of the total organic-matter transport
from the marshes. Their study demonstrated that marsh sediments
were not an important source of bacterial biomass in ebbing tidal
waters. By measuring numbers of bacterial cells in sediments, in-
terstitial water, and overlying water, the researchers were able to
show that while cells are most numerous in sediments (10° cells
per cc), 99 percent of the bacteria were tightly bound to the
sediments.

Additional studies of microbial populations in the estuary were
conducted by Rublee, Merkel, Faust, and Joe Miklas. They found
that phytoplankton accounted for 80 percent of the total microbial
biomass, and that bacterial production—estimated to be between
1.2 and 50.2 X 10° cells per day per liter—requires a significant
carbon input, most likely from phytoplankton. These findings are
consistent with the results of earlier work at caces, which detailed
the importance of phytoplankton-bacteria interactions in the
estuary.

Research on litter dynamics of Rhode River forested and her-
baceous marshes was conducted by Dennis Whigham and Jay
O’Neill. The rates of litter generation varied from about 50 to 500 g
of carbon per m? per year. Rates for two forested wetlands were
200 gC m~? yr? and for two upland forests were 242 9 gC m~?
yr_*. The amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were
much higher, however, in the litter zone of the intertidal marshes,
thus demonstrating that the turnover of nutrients from litter is
slower (approximately 4 years) in those habitats. These data pro-
vide additional vertification of other studies suggesting that inter-
tidal marshes of the Rhode River are primarily sites for nutrient
transformation.

Although salinity regulates the biological zonation within estu-
aries, it is difficult to predict community responses to altered
salinities resulting from floods, droughts, or water use by humans.
In a “before-during-after” sequence of experiments, Anson Hines
and Kathryn Comtois have measured the response of bottom-
dwelling invertebrate communities of the Rhode River estuary to

Science / 71
a drought in 1981, which caused a major increase in salinities and
shifted the salinity regime of Chesapeake Bay “upstream” by
60-80 miles. The community response to the elevated salinity was
a major increase in abundance of most species and no significant
change in several others. Only one species of amphipod crustacean
declined sharply. Surprisingly, no infaunal species from the lower
portions of the Chesapeake Bay invaded the Rhode River communi-
ties, even though elevated salinities persisted for more than a
year. Continued studies by Hines and Comtois on predation by
blue crabs and bottom-feeding fish (spot and hog chokers) indi-
cated that predatory impacts are greatest in the top 5 cm of sedi-
ment in late summer, when estimated turnover rates of bottom
invertebrate populations are high. Experiments with predator ex-
clusion cages placed on the bottom during summer showed signifi-
cantly higher densities of sedentary infaunal species and higher
survivorship of clams within caged, compared to uncaged, areas.
In other experiments, they found that high densities of adult clams
can reduce larval recruitment of bottom invertebrates.

Investigation of population dynamics of fish in the Muddy
Creek/Rhode River estuarine system were continued by Hines and
Miklas. The over-all goal of this project has been to analyze and
interpret the causes of annual variations in reproductive success
and year-class strength of fish that use the system as a spawning
or nursery area.

Extensive shoreline seining surveys, otter trawl collections and
trapping have provided the initial description of spatial, seasonal,
and annual variations in the population, size and age, structure,
growth rates, and distributon of the more than twenty common
speces of fish in the Rhode River. A temporary weir was operated
for the past several years on Muddy Creek to trap and tag semi-
anadromous species (white and yellow perch, shad, carp, pumpkin-
seed, and pickerel, among others) in order to provide accurate
censuses of the spring spawning runs. Yellow perch and pickerel
were essentially absent from the system in 1982, and spot, an-
chovies, and pumpkinseed sunfish also declined. Young striped
bass and bluefish showed major increases, while populations of
several species of minnows appeared to remain relatively constant.
White perch remained at relatively low, but stable, levels. Con-
struction of a much larger and permanent fish weir was completed

72. / Smithsonian Year 1982
in 1982. The weir will be used to continue the longer-term studies
on annual variations in fish populations. The next phase of the
project will be to conduct correlation analysis between fish popu-
lations and parameters of weather and water quality.

UPLAND ECOLOGY

A wide variety of plant and animal research projects were con-
tinued by James Lynch and Dennis Whigham. Lynch continued
his research on the community ecology of ants and expanded it to
include additional study sites in Florida and Mexico. At cBcEs,
he and Edward Balinsky focused on the influence of ants on plant
survivorship during secondary plant succession and_ studied
the role of ants as dispersers of plant propagules. Most of the
common forest herbs that flower and fruit in the spring produce
specialized seeds that are dispersed by several species of ants. The
ants carry these seeds to their nest sites where they feed on fleshy
outgrowths on the seeds. Future work will consider whether ant
nests are the best sites for seed germination and seedling survival.
Working with Patricia Mehlhop, a Smithsonian Post-Doctoral
Fellow, Lynch has expanded his earlier work on ant community
structure and behavioral ecology to include studies of specialized
aggressive and foraging behavior by different worker subcastes of
several ant species.

Lynch continued his long-term studies of the ecology and
evolutionary biology of plethodontid salamanders in temperate
and tropical areas of the New World. This research, which has
been conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University
of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, is currently
focusing on the degree of ecological and genetic differentiation
associated with speciation events in Middle America salamanders
of the genera Bolitoglossa, Chiropterotriton, and Pseudoeurycea.

Recent results of this research indicate an unexpectedly ancient
origin for many living salamander species, despite the fact that
these amphibians tend to show only slight morphological differ-
ences. For example, electrophoretic data suggest that a newly
described Guatemalan species (Bolitoglossa meliana) diverged from
the other members of its species group some 10-15 million years
ago.

Science / 73
Lynch and Whigham’s work on the effects of forest fragmen-
tation on Maryland bird communities was expanded to include
studies of habitat relationships of neotropical migrants on their
wintering ground in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Along with
Eugene Morton of the National Zoo, they studied habitat relation-
ships of the hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina), Kentucky warbler
(Oporonis formosus), and approximately twenty other migratory
warblers, vireos, and flycatchers. Results to date indicate that each
migrant species responds to a unique combination of habitat factors
on its wintering grounds. For example, the density of hooded
warblers is primarily a function of the amount of tree-canopy
cover and the density of shrubs in the forest understory. The
researchers were also able to demonstrate statistically significant
differences in bird frequency between humid and dry forests. This
was particularly obvious for the hooded warbler, which was
encountered in over 90 percent of the survey points in the humid
evergreen forest, with an average density of 1.2 birds per survey
point. In drier forests, the density of hooded warblers was only
about .4 birds per survey point. The white-eyed vireo was the
only migrant that was present at substantially higher densities in
areas of dry forest.

James Lynch and Edward Balinsky continued to monitor small
mammals at cpces and began intensive monitoring of mammal
populations at three additional sites that are being used to study
the impacts of mammals on propagules of important tree species.
These studies now are being conducted in a recently cleared field,
a 35-year-old successional forest, and in two old-aged hardwood
forests. At each site, a 50 m X 20 m deer exclosure has been
constructed, and small mammal populations are monitored both
inside and outside the exclosures. Peromyscus leucopus (white-
footed mouse) is the dominant small mammal at all sites.

Whigham, Lynch, and Balinsky, by using exclosures that also
exclude mice, have been able to demonstrate that Peromyscus is
the primary predator of seeds of common oaks and _hickories.
Rodent predation is less important on small-seeded trees (e.g.,
black cherry, Prunus serotina; dogwood, Cornus florida) and is
especially low on the wind-dispersed seeds of tulip popular (Lirio-
dendron tulipifera) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). Long-
term studies of seedling survivorship in the same tree species are

74 / Smithsonian Year 1982
being conducted at all sites both inside and outside the mammal
exclosures.

Seed density manipulation studies showed that seeds of nut-
bearing trees are removed most rapidly at high densities, but that
almost all seeds are ultimately eaten by rodents and deer. Forest
trees produced numerous seeds in 1981, the first mast year in the
last seven, and Whigham and Lynch were able to test the hypoth-
esis that more seeds escape predation in years of heavy fruit pro-
duction. Compared to years with lower seed production, seeds were
removed more slowly in the fall of 1981, but almost all seeds had
nevertheless been removed by the spring. Seedlings of most tree
species surveyed were only found in areas from which predators
were excluded. Beech (Fagus grandifolia) was an exception, and
numerous seedlings of this species were present throughout the
forest in the spring of 1981. Cohorts of beech seedlings have been
marked in permanent plots and their growth and mortality is
being monitored.

Dennis Whigham has continued his long-term studies of forest
herb populations, and has completed a study of nutrient and
biomass allocation patterns in the cranefly orchid (Tipularia
discolor). He demonstrated that for 13 micro- and macro-nutrients,
Tipularia assimilates more nutrients from the soil than were trans-
located from storage structures during periods of rapid growth of
leaves and reproduction structures. These results constitute addi-
tional evidence that woodland herbs may play an important role
in nutrient cycling in forests. Results also suggest that large
nutrient storage structures, which are common to most forest
herbs, may be important mainly as adaptations to enable the
plants to survive heavy predation.

EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH

Over the past few years, the education staff has been investigating
the effects of school field trips on learning among elementary-
school children. In a recent collaborative effort with the National
Zoological Park, specific types of pre-trip teaching materials were
developed, and the learning resulting from a single-visit field trip
to the Zoo was assessed. Although there was significant variation
among the experimental conditions, all classes who visited the Zoo
showed a great deal of learning from a very structured tour of the

Science / 75
aquatic mammal area. For educators, a natural question arose: For
learning, how important was it that the students actually went to
the Zoo? Might they not have performed better if they had
received the same information in the classroom, free from the
distractions of a field trip?

A study conducted by John Falk and John Balling, with the
assistance of Ellen Goldstein, attempted to answer these questions.
Essentially, the same “tour” of the aquatic mammal area of the
Zoo was given to classrooms of fourth-grade children, similar to
those in the original study, using a slide/lecture presentation
format. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess learning. The
results showed that the students who received the “tour” in the
classroom learned significantly less than the children who visited
the Zoo. These findings are further confirmation of the pedagogical
efficacy of field trips.

In another museum-related study, John Falk spent two months
in India investigating field-trip learning at the National Museum
of Natural History in New Delhi. In a series of previous studies,
Falk and his colleagues at the center have shown that the learner’s
perception of the museum setting dramatically affects learning.

In particular, the relative novelty of the setting can impinge
upon learning so much as to totally deflect the best efforts of both
exhibit designers and museum instructors. In his India study, Falk
tried to investigate three issues:

1. determine whether novel field-trip phenomena are a general
human experience or primarily an American/Western experience;

2. test the relative importance of “exhibit quality” versus
“novelty effects” on learner behavior; and

3. determine whether “novelty effects’ can be ameliorated in
the relatively short time available for the field trip.

The experiment involved 320 Delhi fourth- and fifth-form
school children participating in a school field trip to the museum.
Upon arrival at the museum, classes were divided in half and taken
on museum tours that began at different locations. Therefore, the
students in each group stopped in front of the target exhibitions
and received a prearranged lecture/discussion at different times
relative to the beginning of the tour. If exhibition quality was the
most salient factor affecting behavior and learning, no differences
should exist between the behavior of children in front of an

76 / Smithsonian Year 1982
exhibition, regardless of when during the tour they encounter it.
If factors such as novelty and fatigue played an important role,
behaviors should significantly differ as a function of time. The
‘dependent measure was an “on-task,” “off-task,” nonverbal
behavior, observational instrument developed by Falk in work at
the center and the British Museum (Natural History) in London.

Preliminary data analysis showed that behaviors, which were
highly correlated with cognitive learning, were significantly differ-
ent in front of the same exhibition, depending upon whether it was
viewed early or late in the tour. Consistent with previous research,
children spent more time attending to the exhibit and the lecturing
docent at the end of the tour, after having time to acclimate to
their setting. Early into their visit, more than half the time, chil-
dren were attending to everything but the intended lesson.

A major new initiative undertaken by the Education Program
in 1982, is a National Science Foundation—funded research project
to investigate the role of the family in the promotion and main-
tenance of scientific literacy in America. In collaboration with
educators at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, John Balling
and Deborah Hilke are conducting a series of studies designed to
examine parent-child interactions with regard to science-related
topics. As part of the first investigation, an attempt is being made
to determine what aspects of family interactions children and
adults view as important to the success of their exchanges. A
relatively novel application of a well-known psychological measure-
ment technique termed the “Q-sort,” which has been used
extensively in personality assessment, is being employed to gather
data on attitudes toward family interactions.

Preliminary analyses of the data on children have shown that
dimensions such as the amount of personal freedom and imagina-
tion permitted, the amount of responsibility required, and the
degree to which the adults and children work cooperatively or
independently underlie their judgments. It is hoped that after both
more adult and child data are acquired, points of intergenerational
conflict and agreement regarding family interactions can be identi-
fied. Such information should help developers of materials design
more successful family activities.

In a postdoctoral research study, Judy Diamond and Alan Bond
investigated family learning from an ethological perspective. In

Science / 77
particular, they investigated mechanisms of cultural transmission,
which were described in terms of the behavioral interactions
between fathers and their children as they fished from a pier on
Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Verbal and nonverbal behaviors were
analyzed, and the patterns of association in the behavioral reper-
toire were described in detail. A wide variety of transmission
techniques were revealed, ranging from behavioral clusters sug-
gestive of modeling or simple showing, to complex combinations of
behaviors involved in teaching. Based upon their study, Diamond
and Bond suggest that the behaviors used to transmit information
vary systematically with both the specific content of the trans-
mitted information and the social role of the actor or person doing
the transmitting. Diamond and Bond conclude that, while certain
information transmission behaviors—such as showing or naming—
have similar functions in adults and children, others—such as
giving praise and telling—have different functional associations,
depending on age. These contrasting sequences of development
may reflect a fundamental distinction in the ontogeny of complex
behavior patterns.

Another longstanding research interest at the cpces has been
environmental influences on human behavior and the ways in
which human preferences for various landscapes are formed. John
Balling and John Falk have been exploring the effects that man’s
evolutionary history may have on these preferences. Underlying
much of their work is the hypothesis that human evolution, in
large part, took place along or near river courses in the East
African savanna. Preferences for natural settings with scattered
trees, short grass, and some type of water body may, therefore,
reflect an innate preference for the environment in which much
of our biological (and psychological) apparatus evolved.

Previous research by Balling and Falk have shown strong prefer-
ences by Americans for savannalike settings. In order to validate
these findings in light of evolutionary, rather than cultural, influ-
ences, cross-cultural data were required. Last year, Falk collected
data from two populations of Nigerians living in the rain forest
of West Africa. This year, he collected comparable data from
urban and rural Indians. These subjects possess very different
cultural and environmental experiences than the North American
populations previously sampled. Preliminary analysis of the data

78 / Smithsonian Year 1982
showed an overwhelming preference by Indians for savanna over
all other biomes sampled. Earlier analysis revealed the same pattern
for Nigerians. These cross-cultural findings lend strong support
to Falk and Balling’s evolutionary basis for landscape preference
theory.

EDUCATION MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

Two major educational materials development projects were carried
out during the year, one for families and one for early adolescents.
The Smithsonian Family Learning Project (srr) is a series of
family-activity packets for hands-on exploration of home science
topics such as: home energy, houseplant and lawn ecology, food
science, and pets. The srip staff of John Falk, Laurie Greenberg,
Jamie Harms, and Vicki Dedrickson was involved with intensive
testing and revision for eventual publication and widespread
dissemination of the materials. Both workshops and monthly
mailings to over 1,200 families in 43 states provided evaluative
information for revision of both text and graphics. Press coverage
through the Smithsonian News Service, the Christian Science
Monitor, the NBC “Today Show,” and a variety of syndicated
radio shows has given the srip exposure to families and profes-
sionals across the U.S. The project staff is currently working with
Smithsonian Exposition Books to publish the activity packets.
Growing out of increasing national concern for the declining
scientific competence and literacy of American youth, the National
Science Foundation awarded the center a grant to develop science
materials for early adolescents in out-of-school contexts. The
project, entitled Science Activities for Informal Learning (sarz), is
directed by John Falk and co-coordinated by Barbara Steinberg
and Gary Heath. Cathy Brady is a materials developer on the
project, and John Balling serves as a consultant. In sat’s first year
as a pilot project, its staff has developed several dozen science-
related activities to be done in a potential cross-age teaching
situation, namely that of babysitting, in which the adolescent can
assume some aspects of an adult role. Interest in the project and
its materials has been expressed by a wide variety of informal and
formal educators and groups such as the Girl Scouts, Red Cross,
school and community service programs such as Head Start, and

Science / 79
museums and science centers within the Smithsonian and elsewhere
around the country.

The National Air and Space Museum

The National Air and Space Museum (nasm) has continued to
fulfill the expectations of its public by expanding its integrated
series of programs in research, exhibitions, collections manage-
ment, education, and public service. Building upon a base that has
satisfied more than 55,000,000 visitors, the museum opened a
series of new exhibits, produced a number of significant publica-
tions, and laid the foundation for a research effort of even greater
potential than its current one.

It is characteristic of Nasm that plans for research, exhibits and
collections management are closely tied together so that efforts in
one area can benefit another. This emphasis in cutting across
boundaries is especially important in the fields of education and
public service; the museum feels that the diffusion of knowledge is
equally important to the increase of knowledge. As a result of this
coordinated effort, the components of the museum work together
like a finely tuned watch in a imaginative, innovative cost effective
operation.

Three major research efforts began in fiscal year 1982. The
Aeronautics Department began work in earnest on a four-volume
history of aviation, intended to be the definitive work in the field.
In a parallel endeavor, the Department of Space Science and Ex-
ploration established the framework for the compilation of a
history of the Space Telescope. As part of a nationwide system
for the storing and research of planetary mission data, agreements
have been made with the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA) to establish Nasm’s Center for Earth and Planetary
Studies as one of eight Regional Planetary Image Facilities located
in the United States. The center, cosponsored by nasa and the
Smithsonian Institution, will provide access to planetary images
and other data for investigators from nearby colleges and universi-
ties, as well as continue its archival role for data acquired by lunar
and planetary missions.

80 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Rockets reach for the stars in this unusual view
of the National Air and Space Museum.
Both the Aeronautics and Space Science and Exploration depart-
ments continued their research in a number of other major areas,
but with particular concentration on the study, care, and docu-
mentation of the artifacts in the collection. An important oral
history project is under way to record and transcribe interviews
with prominent participants in the last thirty years of space as-
tronomy. Visiting scholars will continue to be invited to deliver
seminars on the history of space science and exploration; T. Keith
Glennan (nasa’s first administrator) and John Naugle (former
chief scientist for NASA) were among those involved in the program
this year.

An investigation by the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies
(cers) of the distribution and orientation of Martian structures
indicates that the formation of the structures was primarily due
to the weight of the Tharsis volcanic province on the crust of the
planet; additional sources of compression are needed to account
for the planet-wide occurrence of such landforms. Comparisons
of martian and Egyptian desert features were completed during
the year and are being published by nasa. Analysis of lunar
orbital geochemical data has proven useful for mapping the extent
of volcanic units on the surface and subsurface, where impact
craters have exposed older geologic units. Some areas of the Moon
that were thought to be ancient anorthositic crust now appear
to represent the earliest volcanic deposits, some of which may be
present in the Apollo 16 suite of lunar samples.

In November 1981, soil and sand samples taken in the Western
Desert of Egypt along the flight track of the Space Shuttle
Columbia were used to calibrate the Shuttle Multispectral Infrared
Radiometer results. Over twenty-five published works resulted
from research by the cers staff this fiscal year. Joint research in the
Sinai with the Suez Canal University was initiated with studies of
enhanced Landsat images of the northern Sinai peninsula. The
center is now operating under the direction of Dr. Ted Maxwell.
In July, cers’s research director, Dr. Farouk El-Baz, left the center
to join private industry.

Naso research was also reflected in the expanded series of pub-
lications which have been well received by the public and well
reviewed by the critics. Museum personnel have created an exten-
sive publishing program, which includes everything from popular

82 / Smithsonian Year 1982
books to scholarly works. These publications are listed in Ap-
pendix 6.

The three nasm—produced publications entered in the 1982 Blue
Pencil Awards (sponsored by the National Association of Govern-
ment Communicators) each won awards: first place in the category
of books for the Aircraft of the National Air and Space Museum
catalogue; second place in popular publications exceeding sixteen
pages went to the exhibition booklet, Jet Aviation: Threshold to a
New Era; and third place in the category of brochures for the NAsM
Langley Theater brochure.

The creation of exhibitions requires a similar degree of research
that a book does, and often an exhibition will result in the cor-
rollary publication of a book. The major exhibition for the year,
25 Years of Space Exploration, opened on July 1, 1982. Using film,
photographs, space artifacts, and memorabilia, the exhibition
recalls those tumultuous years that saw not only tremendous
achievements in space, but remarkable and sometimes shattering
social and cultural changes. The theme of twenty-five years of
space exploration will be reinforced with lectures planned for the
anniversary of the Sputnik launch in October and the U.S. launch
of Explorer 1 the following January. A joint symposium on the
subject will be held in October 1982, in association with the
National Academy of Sciences, which also opened a space art
exhibit, using pieces from NasmM’s collection.

In addition to 25 Years of Space Exploration eight other major
exhibitions were opened.

Black Wings: The American Black in Aviation opened in Sep-
tember 1982, depicting the previously untold story of American
black aviators from Eugene Bullard’s service in France in World
War I, to the black astronauts assigned to the space program. A
model of the World War II P-51 Mustang and the fighter used by
the Tuskegee airmen are also exhibited. The exhibition highlights
much new information and many photographs not previously
displayed.

Other exhibitions during the year included: a show of twenty-
eight works of art documenting various aspects of the Space
Shuttle program; Aerial Aircraft Carriers, the history of aerial
carriers (mother-ships) and the vehicles they carry; Jacqueline
Cochrane—World Record Holder, focused on the outstanding

Science / 83
forty-year career of this aviation pioneer; The Flying Roosevelts,
a photo exhibition documenting the many uses of the airplane by
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, in keeping with the Smithsonian
Institution’s commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Solar Challenger, the air-
craft that made aviation history by flying across the English
Channel, powered only by energy generated from sunlight; USS
Enterprise, an eleven-foot model of the aircraft carrier, including
its eighty-three model airwing, built by and donated to the
museum by Stephen Henninger; and a display of fifty aircraft
models all in one case.

Nasm’s third imax film, Flyers, opened in the Langley Theater
on August 6. The film, sponsored by Conoco, Inc., is a new
departure in the genre, being an action drama featuring the exploits
of a fictional World War II Navy pilot, who continues his love of
flying by restoring aircraft and doing stunt work for films. Flying
sequences show many different types of aircraft ranging from soar-
ing sailplanes to modern jets. The other two max films, To Fly
and Living Planet, continue to draw large audiences, and the
theater operates at near capacity at all times. The ten-millionth
visitor to the Langley Theater was welcomed on July 20, 1982.

A new presentation opened in the Albert Einstein Spacearium
in September. Entitled Probe, the planetarium show is an odyssey
that transports visitors to the surface of Venus, through Jupiter’s
system of satellites, and past the ringed world of Saturn, explain-
ing how the spacecrafts’ journeys were made, and detailing some
of the lessons learned by these spectacular voyages. The previous
attraction New Eyes on the Universe drew almost one million
visitors during its two-year run.

Besides the intensive work that results in major exhibitions and
publications, the museum has a constant goal of making it easy
and interesting for the public to use its facilities for other than a
standard museum visit. Nasm’s public service efforts during the
year included a wide variety of offerings. Among the best received
of these were:

The fifth anniversary of the Paul E. Garber Facility was
celebrated in April with a festive five-day open house for the
public. Staff from all offices of Nasm and docents were on hand
to welcome, assist, and answer questions of the more than 8,500

84 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Area visitors tour the NAsm’s Paul E. Garber Facility, which celebrated its fifth anni-
versary in April with a 5-day open house.
enthusiastic visitors who toured the facility. The opportunity to
climb into airplane cockpits for photograph sessions, to watch
and question the restoration staff while they worked, and to freely
tour three buildings on their own were some of the visitor high-
lights of the celebration.

“D.C. Day,” was held in February; five hundred junior-high-
school students from the District of Columbia spent a day at NASM.
Activities included an opening talk by Space Shuttle astronaut
Frederick Gregory, demonstrations by Nnasm staff members on
building kites, model rockets and airplanes, photo-taking opportu-
nities in the galleries, and a display of Space Shuttle art, with
paintings done by the students themselves.

The sixth annual Frisbee Festival was held in September. This
popular event drew 15,000 people to the Mall to watch demonstra-
tions by Frisbee champions—both human and canine—and_ to
attend workshops offered at several levels of proficiency.

A new, free daytime international concert series, held in coopera-
tion with area embassies, was inaugurated during the spring and
summer, with performing groups from around the globe, and
evening concerts were also presented by the Navy’s Commodores.

The ever-popular free aviation and space-fiction films presented
on fall and winter evenings were shown in the Langley Theater.
Nine aviation lectures were also held in the theater, and 81 live
lectures were presented in the Albert Einstein Spacearium.

The museum’s Briefing Room was used for live lecture demon-
strations for school groups and also for three mini-lecture series,
presented during the year by NAsm curators, on topics of aero-
nautics, astronomy, and current events in space science.

The museum continued to support the National and Resident
Associate programs through staff lectures and use of the building
for over 126 activities this past year. Increased use of nasM facili-
ties for special events and events by outside organizations num-
bered 58, with sponsorship of lectures and special events by
outside organizations increasing.

In April, three dozen science writers from the Washington, D.C.,
area spent a day behind the scenes at the Garber Facility and at
the museum’s Center for Earth and Planetary Studies. The program
was sponsored by the local chapter of the National Association of
Science Writers, and was coordinated by nasm’s Office of Public

86 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Affairs and Museum Services and the Smithsonian Institution’s
Office of Public Affairs. The writers also toured the National
Museum of Natural History.

Nasm served over 100,000 visitors through 4,100 tours and
theater and spacearium reservations. In addition to the regularly
featured tours, three new tours have been added: a group “tour
of the month,” emphasizing a particular theme or anniversary, a
highlight tour designed for the mentally retarded and learning
disabled, and a summer family tour for parents and children.

The nasm educational staff presented classroom lectures to
Washington, D.C.’s, Dunbar High School students on topics such
as early flight, aerospace heroes, rocketry, and the Space Shuttle;
these lectures were then followed by visits to related exhibition
galleries in the museum.

On a larger scale, through the training of regional resource
persons, 800 sessions were presented nationwide to 24,000 people
in 28 states. Presentations on the principles of flight were made
to students, local teachers, senior citizen groups, and the general
public at local libraries, schools, nursing homes, and banks.

This year’s intern program for graduate and undergraduate
students included opportunities for twenty-two students—the
museum’s most successful intern program to date.

The collections management program of the museum was en-
hanced with the establishment of a new documentation storage
center at the Garber Facility, which will be maintained under strict
controls for humidity and temperature. The center will support
the museum’s archival and reference services by providing addi-
tional storage for the museum’s extensive document and photo-
graph collections. Over one-half-million photographs from the
Wright Field collection were sorted and boxed and will be moved
into the new storage center along with archival material stored at
- the North Capitol Street building and in other areas at the Garber
Facility.

Nasm’s videodisc image storage and retrieval project, initiated
by the Atherton Seidell program, has proven to be an outstanding
success and is the subject of great interest by not only museums
and universities but also by commercial firms. A keyword indexing
system is also being developed to support this disc.

Computerization of the registrar’s manual records and report-

Science / 87
ing systems—including computer-generated accession memoranda,
donor listings, and gallery listings—was completed. Information
will continue to be added as it is received.

The nasm inventory project is nearing completion. All space
artifacts have been inventoried, and the remainder of the aero-
nautical inventory is being reconciled. The total Nasm inventory
project will be completed by January 1983.

The Space Science and Exploration Department implemented its
five-year collections plan by acquiring new, scientific artifacts of
the space program both in the area of space astronomy and manned
space flight. An archival and preservation task force was estab-
lished to carry out and monitor the acquisition of documents re-
lated to the artifact collection and their preservation. A major goal
of rationalizing loans of space artifacts to other museums was
reached with the establishment of a departmental loan committee
to review computer-inventoried loans.

Three aircraft restorations were completed in fiscal year 1982:
Ecker Flying Boat, Benoist Type XII, and deHavilland DH-4. Work
continues on several other important aircraft. An intensive preser-
vation program at the Garber Facility has been initiated to method-
ically clean and preserve the entire collection of aircraft. Twenty
aircraft were preserved this year.

The aeronautics collection was augmented by the addition of
a Lockheed U-2, Martin B-57, Monocoupe, and Farman Sport. The
B-57 is the first of Nasm’s aircraft to be stored at Dulles Interna-
tional Airport.

Noel W. Hinners resigned his position as director on June 8,
1982, to become the director of the Goddard Space Flight Center.
Walter Boyne was appointed acting director, and a search com-
mittee to fill the position of director was established by Dr. David
Challinor.

NATIONAL HUMAN STUDIES FILM CENTER

Dr. E. Richard Sorenson, director of the National Human Studies
Film Center, and Tibetan research assistant Ragpa Dorjee filmed in

88 / Smithsonian Year 1982
1982 at Gyudmed Tantric Monastery of the Gohe Samaje—one of
the most advanced and disciplined centers of learning in the
Tibetan system—recording ceremonial events that only highly
initiated and educated monks have hitherto been allowed to see.
At Dzonkar Choede, one of the most ancient monasteries of Tibet,
now transplanted to South India, Sorenson and Dorjee also re-
ceived permission to film the annual Mahayasksha Cham cere-
mony. With the work in those two South India monasteries, the
researchers obtained for the first time in history, research film
footage of the training and development of traditional Tibetan
monks. Such monks played crucial roles in Tibetan history.

The Research Report Film “Jyapu: Industrious Productivity as
Life Style,” prepared under the direction of Dr. Sorenson with the
participation of the scholars of the Royal Nepal Academy to com-
memorate the Academy’s Silver Anniversary, was shown at the
Smithsonian Institution in May and at the celebrations in Nepal in
June. The film was praised by the Chancellor of the Royal Nepal
Academy. Since then, it has been shown to numerous groups, in-
cluding academics and students in several countries as well as the
United States.

Significant fiscal and logistical support was provided by the
Royal Government of Bhutan so that Dr. Sorenson could survey
Bhutan for sites where traditional Bhutanese culture could be
filmed. Several promising sites were identified.

In Micronesia, Dr. Sorenson’s research project, “The Artistic
Lifestyle of the Western Caroline Islands,” continued on the most
traditional atoll left in the Pacific. A detailed photographic and
community census, prepared by Project Coordinator Mathias
Maradol, is being used as part of the preliminary annotation of the
research film record.

HUMAN STUDIES FILM ARCHIVES

On October 1, 1981, the National Human Studies Film Center was
restructured to emphasize film preservation in a new component:
the Human Studies Film Archives. The purpose of the archives
is to locate, acquire, preserve, and document film and video mate-
rials of non-Western and Western cultures for research.

Pamela Wintle, formerly of the Film Center, is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the archives. Assisting her in

Science / 89
From the files of the new Human Studies Film Archives comes this photograph of
Berber Nomad girls, Sahara Desert, Algeria, 1930. (Photographer, George L. Waite)
developing archival policy is Dr. Herman Viola, Director of the
National Anthropological Archives, and an advisory group of
professionals reflecting various dsciplines.

The first six months of fiscal year 1982 were used to effect the
restructure, to conduct an inventory of the holdings, to move the
archives and the cold-storage film vault into the National Museum
of Natural History, and to establish office systems. Subsequently,
priority has been given to designing archival procedures and
establishing the technology for acquistion, preservation, control,
and research use of the current collection and future acquisitions.
A new, enlarged, cold-storage film vault was designed, and con-
struction will begin in January 1983.

National Museum of Natural History

EXHIBITIONS

At the National Museum of Natural History (NmMNnu), the paleo-
biology halls in December 1981 returned to the public eye one of
the Smithsonian’s most popular attractions—the dinosaurs.

Rearranged for better viewing, interpreted by new textual in-
formation, and integrated with displays of other reptiles, plants,
and animals that lived in the same age, the huge beasts are once
more delighting and awing visitors.

The nmnu has added to the company of its dozen older mounted
dinosaurs some spectacular new attractions, one of which is
antrodemus, a fierce flesh-eater with powerful gaping jaws, posed
in full stride in pursuit of another dinosaur. Soaring overhead is
a life-sized model of the reptile Quetzalcoatlus northropi. Its
forty-foot wingspan makes it the largest flying animal on record—
twice as large as any bird that ever lived.

The old dinosaur exhibition was shut down for an extended
period during the early stages of the reorganization of the muse-
ums’s paleobiology halls into the large, all-encompassing exhibi-
tion Fossils: The History of Life. Eight highlights in the complex
are now open, with seven others in various stages of planning
and construction.

All of the evolutionary events in the fossil complex are indexed

tion. Below. Vacuuming the backbone of the diplodocus was part of the preparation

for opening the new Dinosaur Hall.

and illustrated on a spectacular new twenty-seven-foot-high
“Time Column” at the entrance of the Dinosaur Hall.

The public can view the dinosaurs and the Time Column from
a new west balcony that is connected to the hall’s existing east
balcony by a cantilevered ramp. On the west balcony—which can
be entered from the second-floor rotunda balcony—are five huge
monolithic slabs of fossil resources, illustrating how over eons of
geological time plant and animal remains have been concentrated
into valuable mineral wealth.

The outstanding event of the museum’s 1982 special exhibition
season was the opening on June 18 of inua: spirit world of the
bering sea eskimo in the Thomas M. Evans Gallery. This large
exhibition drew upon one of the museum’s hidden treasures—the
unparalleled collection of Eskimo ethnological material acquired
100 years ago by Edward W. Nelson. On explorations along the
Bering Sea Coast by dog sled, kayak, and on foot, Nelson collected
some 10,000 ethnological artifacts, ranging from wooden cere-
monial masks to clothing, household implements, and carved ivory
hunting equipment. Rich in technology, art, and religious sym-
bolism, the comprehensiveness of the collection and its careful
documentation make it the finest Eskimo collection in the world.

The idea of mounting a big exhibition of Nelson material was
suggested in 1979 by Ann Stevens, the late wife of Senator Ted
Stevens (Republican—Alaska) after she was shown the collection
in the museum’s attic, where it had been carefully preserved for
more than 100 years. Struck by the collection’s beauty and impor-
tance, and the fact that very little of it had ever been placed on
exhibit, the Stevenses urged museum anthropologist, William Fitz-
hugh to organize a traveling exhibition so that the works could
be shared by other Americans. Fitzhugh and anthropologist Susan
_ Kaplan took the collection down from the attic and gave it the
first comprehensive study of this century, writing a 300-page
scholarly catalog to accompany the exhibition (with nmnu Archae-
ologist Emeritus Henry B. Collins contributing an essay on
Nelson).

After the exhibition closes at the museum on January 3, 1983,
a smaller version will be circulated to locations in Alaska and else-
where in the United States and Canada by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution Traveling Exhibition Service (sires). It is the first traveling

exhibition ever assembled from NMNH’s ethnological collections.

The Evans Gallery hosted five other superb exhibitions during
fiscal year 1982: China’s Inner Frontier, photographs of the 1923
Wulsin Expedition to Northwest China (October 8—-November 5,
1981); Hopi Kachina: Spirit of Life, a tribute to the unique culture
of Arizona’s Hopi Indians (November 13, 1981—January 3, 1982);
Deep Ocean Photographs, featuring mural-sized U.S. Navy photo-
graphs of a two-mile-high volcanic seamount beneath the Atlantic
Ocean (January 22—April 18, 1982); A New Look at the Work of
Edward Curtis, a sites exhibition, organized by Christopher
Lyman, which raised critical questions about the Curtis photo-
graphs of American Indians (March 4—-April 15, 1982); and
Brazilian Feather Art (May 11—May 31, 1982).

The museum’s Rotunda Balcony Gallery featured Revelations of
Nature, nature photographs by Frank Greenwell (October 6—De-
cember 6, 1981); Botanical Prints, by Henry Evans (December 9,
1981-February 7, 1982); Artist and Botanist: A Collaboration,
orchid watercolors by Dr. Regina O. Hughes (February 13-
April 11, 1982); The Tarahumara, sculptures and drawings of the
Tarahumara people of Mexico by George Carlson (April 17-
June 13, 1982) and Sigrid James Bruch: Recent Work, oil paintings
of birds and other zoological subjects (June 19—August 15, 1982).

An exhibition of Contemporary North American Indian Art,
sixty-five paintings and sculptures by more than forty leading
North American Indian artists, was shown in the second-floor
special exhibit gallery (March 13—September 12, 1982); Grass
Work of Labrador, a collection of basketry and other craft works,
was on view in the Learning Center Gallery (August 30-
October 30, 1982); and Deep Sea Dives to Biological Frontiers, a
permanent exhibition about communities of unique, deep-sea
organisms living a mile and a half beneath the Pacific Ocean,
opened in the museum’s first-floor Sea Life Hall (February 18,
1982).

ANTHROPOLOGY

Paleopathology, the study of disease and trauma in the people of
the ancient and historical past has enjoyed an increased interest
in recent years—as attested to by many recent articles in the
anthropologic and medical literature. The NmNnu’s large skeleton

94 / Smithsonian Year 1982
collections, which have literally hundreds of examples of skeletal
disease and abnormalities, make it one of the world centers of
paleopathology research. In December 1981, museum physical
anthropologist Donald J. Ortner, in collaboration with Walter G. J.
Putschar, a leading authority on skeletal pathology, published a
monumental 479-page reference work on skeletal paleopathology
titled “Identification of Pathological Conditions in Human Skeletal
Remains” (Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology No. 28).
This book grew out of a paleopathology lecture series presented
annually at the museum by the authors between 1971 and 1974.
The authors have recorded many examples of paleopathology from
the museum’s reference collections and have traveled to museums
of anatomy and pathology throughout the world to examine, cata-
logue, and photograph modern specimens of bone disease and
archaeological remnants. The book has received an enthusiastic
response from the anthropological and medical communities.

North American ethnologist William L. Merrill in 1981 and
1982 continued his research on the Raramuri (Tarahumara) world
view and religion. Little known to most Americans, the 50,000
Raramuris live in many small hamlets scattered over the rugged
sierra and canyon country in southwestern Chihuahau, Mexico,
200 miles southwest of the U.S. border. During 1982 Dr. Merrill
examined museum collections of Raramuri materials at the South-
west Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural His-
tory, the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles, the Laboratory of Anthropology at the Mu-
seum of New Mexico, and the Maxwell Museum. These materials
provided insights into regional variations and changes through
time in Raramuri material culture.

The computer is being used to file and manipulate this data and
other detailed and complexly interconnected information on the
kinship and social organization among the Raramuri—aspects that
have intrigued Dr. Merrill since his original fieldwork in the
Raramuri country in the 1970s.

Dr. Merrill was also active in the last year in encouraging
American Indian involvement in museums. He coordinated the
loan of Zuni ceramics from the Smithsonian collections for a
traveling exhibition currently being organized by the Zunis. He
also visited the new Acoma museum in New Mexico and selected

Science / 95
appropriate Acoma pieces from the Smithsonian collections to
lend to it.

The Smithsonian, under John Wesley Powell in the late nine-
teenth century, pioneered in studies of North American native
languages. Today it continues its work in this area. The research
has an urgent aspect to it because many of the 200 languages
spoken by North American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos are
dying out. The museum’s linguist, Dr. Ives Goddard, in addition
to his linguistic editing of the Handbook of North American
Indians, has been conducting linguistic field work on the Munsee
language on the Moraviantown Indian Reserve, Ontario. This
eastern Algonquian language is believed to be the one spoken by
the native residents of Manhattan Island at the time the Dutch
arrived. Today Munsee is only spoken in two small, surviving
Delaware Indian communities in Oklahoma and Ontario. Since
Dr. Goddard began documenting the vocabulary, pronunciation,
and grammatical structure of the language in Ontario in the 1960s,
the number of speakers has dwindled from forty-two to twenty.

Dr. Goddard also spent a considerable amount of time in fiscal
year 1982 working on the editing and translation of a complete
corpus of native Massachusett writings. Massachusett, the native
language of East Massachusetts, was one of the first native lan-
guages committed to writing in the New World—a project accom-
plished by John Eliot, a missionary. This system, based on English
letters, was used for the first bible printed in America (the first
edition of which was published on a press at the Indian College
in Harvard Yard in 1663) and was subsequently used by Indians
to write many documents. Goddard plans to publish these Massa-
chusett writings in collaboration with Dr. Kathleen J. Bragdon.

BOTANY

On coral reefs, dense populations of herbivorous fish and other
browsing animals feed constantly on seaweeds. To protect them-
selves from this voracious grazing, the algae have evolved a
variety of survival techniques, including the manufacture of potent
and toxic chemical defenses—nature’s equivalent of chemical
warfare.

Marine biologists over the past decade have become increas-
ingly interested in these algal chemical compounds and are study-

96 / Smithsonian Year 1982
ing them for their potential as new drugs, pharmaceuticals, pesti-
cides, and other useful industrial products.

In a collaborative study of “Chemical Defense in Tropical
Marine Algae,” at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, published in 1982,
museum marine botanist James N. Norris and William Fenical, a
chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, reported on the
potency of a variety of unique or unusual natural compounds they
isolated from the green, brown, and red algae on the Caribbean
reef.

When the extracted compounds—which included halogenated
and nonhalogenated terpenoids—were tested in controlled labora-
tory conditions on reef damsel fishes, in most cases they were
either lethal or caused physiological stress. Not surprisingly, field
observations indicate that algae producing these compounds are
not eaten by herbivorous fish and invertebrate reef animals.

The same compounds were tested in the laboratory to see if
they had antibiotic properties. Here again, they often proved effec-
tive. Norris and Fenical report that sometimes a compound did not
harm fish but was toxic to bacteria, suggesting that its role might
be as a defense against free-floating microbial pathogens in the
reef environment.

The nmnu’s botanists sometimes are unable to name a plant in
the field because it lacks the structures (usually flowers or fruits)
that are used for classification. One way to overcome this difficulty
is to collect the living plant (if it is not too large) for cultivation
in the museum’s east courtyard greenhouse, where it can be
observed on a long-term, daily basis. In addition to learning the
plant’s name—and some new species are discovered in this man-
ner—the botanist can learn much about the plant’s reproductive
biology, which can lead to a fuller understanding of its relation-
_ ships and evolution.

Dr. Robert Faden, a specialist on the family Commelinaceae
(dayflowers, spiderworts, and wandering Jews), is finding the
greenhouse invaluable for his research. In recent months, several
Commelinaceae, which are cultivated in the greenhouse, have
flowered for the first time. These include the Bromeliad-like
Cochliostema odoratissimum (originally from Ecuador), whose
large, fragrant, orchid-like flowers suggest a complex pollination
system that is still unknown. Dr. Faden is currently studying the

Science / 97
reproductive biology of several Commelinaceae, including Palisota
hirsuta and Commelina erecta. The former, grown from seeds and
cuttings collected by Dr. Faden in Ghana, has been found to have
an elaborate breeding system—with both hermaphroditic and male
flowers, each with two kinds of pollen—that operates to maximize
cross-pollination. Commelina erecta was first studied by Dr. Faden
in the Big Thicket country of eastern Texas in 1981. Analysis of
the field data and further experiments on the reproductive biology
of plants from Texas are now continuing at the museum.

Other botanical research highlights in the past year included
publication of museum botanist Stanwyn G. Shetler’s book Varia-
tion and Evolution of the Nearctic Harebells. Culminating many
years of work on the perplexing biological variation among the
plants allied to the common harebell or bluebell-of-Scotland,
Shetler’s treatise not only reports his own findings for the New
World but also presented a synthesis of the many other studies
of Eurasian harebells.

ENTOMOLOGY

In an article in the Coleoptera Bulletin, museum entomologist
Terry L. Erwin in 1982 proposed a new and startling answer to a
question that scientists have been guessing at for more than a
century: How many insect species are there in the forests of the
tropics?

Based on his research on the tropical forest canopy of Panama,
and subsequent work at Manaus, Brazil, and at the Tambopata
Nature Reserve in southeastern Peru, Erwin concludes that the
current estimates of arthropod species numbers are far too low.
His findings show that there could be as many as 30 million
species extant globally, not 1.5 million as is usually estimated.

Dr. Erwin points out that it is important to know, when setting
aside tracts of tropical forest for conservation, that small biotopes
are unique to thousands of insect species—many of which could
be beneficial to mankind. Conversely, it is important to know that
with the rapid destruction of tropical forests, many more insect
species are becoming extinct than previously thought.

Erwin’s pioneering field work on the natural history and diver-
sity of the insect fauna of the tropical forest canopy—a virtually
unstudied and unknown habitat 30-55 meters above the forest

98 / Smithsonian Year 1982
floor—is now focusing on Peru, where more than half the arthro-
pod species he is collecting are new to science. Many may have
potential usefulness in forestry, agriculture, and medicine.

Other entomological research highlights during 1981 and 1982
included Dr. Don Davis’s three-month expedition to the southern
deserts and forests of Chile to collect Lepidoptera. Approximately
20,000 moths were collected along with more than 20,000 other
insects. A preliminary survey of the microlepidoptera indicate that
between eighty and ninety percent of the species collected are new.
Dr. Oliver S. Flint, Jr., published ‘Studies of Neotropical Caddis-
flies XXXIII: New Species from Austral South America (Trichop-
tera)” (Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology No. 377), in which
110 new species and one new genus of caddisflies are described
and illustrated—the largest single group of new caddisfly species
ever described in a single paper.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

The Atlantic Barrier Reef Ecosystem at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, a
600-page volume published in June 1982, was the first in a series
of major publications for an on-going museum project that is the
most exhaustive and comprehensive long-term study of a Carib-
bean coral reef and its surroundings ever taken.

Museum invertebrate zoologist Klaus Ruetzler, coordinator of
the multi-year, interdisciplinary study, was co-author of the book
with museum geologist Ian MacIntyre. The publication contains
thirty-four scholarly accounts of the scientific findings to date.

The book begins with a summary of past work on the Belizean
reefs and cays—an area that had never received any concentrated
scientific attention until two decades ago, even though Charles
Darwin had included the Belizean reefs in his classic 1842 work
on the classification of principal reef types.

Heavily illustrated with color and black-and-white photographs
and illustrations, the book includes in-depth descriptions of the
barrier reef complex and its climate and environment. There are
discussions of distinctive communities, including an unusual sub-
marine cave, and several sections on the flora and fauna inhabiting
the cays, reefs, and surrounding waters.

The latest phase of the study project began in 1982 as Ruetzler
and museum colleagues Gordon Hendler, James Norris, Brian

Science / 99
Kensley, and Kristian Fauchald launched the Smithsonian Western
Atlantic Mangrove Program (swamp), a study of the ecosystem of
shallow-water mangrove islands a few miles away from the cay.
These mud islands, submerged at high tide, are covered with man-
grove trees, the roots of which accumulate and anchor soil, serve
as a nursery for many forms of marine life, and act as a buffer
to protect the reef’s cays from erosion.

Among the many other significant invertebrate-zoology research
achievements during the year were: the discovery of a new pro-
priceptor (position-sensing) organ in the nervous system of nema-
tode worms by Duane Hope and S. L. Gardiner; the publication
of a 549-page volume on the natural history of ‘““The Crayfishes
of Georgia,” by Horton H. Hobbs, Jr., a comprehensive study
based upon some forty-three years of personal field work in a
state that has the richest recorded crayfish fauna of any in the
Americas; the discovery of a new order of crustaceans by Thomas
Bowman; a study of the population genetics of sea urchins by
David Pawson; and the publication of the Audubon Society Field
Guide to North American Seashells, written by Harald A. Rehder.

Museum invertebrate zoologist Robert P. Higgins, in the fall of
1981, conducted two weeks of field work as a guest of the Insti-
tute of Oceanology at Quingdao, a Chinese city on the northern
coast of the Yellow Sea. He is the world’s only authority on the
tiny kinorhynch, a creature belonging to a little-known, but eco-
logically important, marine phylum that lives in ocean sediments
throughout the world. Making day trips in a research vessel pro-
vided by the institute, Higgins was able to collect four or five pre-
viously unknown species. He also lectured on his research in
meiobenthology, the study of very small marine organisms, a
field the Chinese want to develop.

MINERAL SCIENCES

Researchers were intensely occupied throughout the year with the
collection and study of Antarctic meteorites. A large body of new
material was discovered with the help of geophysicist Robert F.
Fudali, who took part in the National Science Foundation Antarctic
Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) expedition in November, Decem-
ber, and January of 1981-1982.

Fudali, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory colleague Ursula

100 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Marvin, and five scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and
other institutions, spent six weeks encamped in the Allan Hills
region, northwest of McMurdo Sound. There they used snow-
mobiles to carry out a systematic “clean-up” search of two ice-
field areas that had yielded a considerable amount of meteorite
material in previous years. About 375 meteorites and meteorite
fragments were recovered—a record for an Allan Hills expedition.
Fudali located a forty-two-pound iron meteorite, the largest find.
The material included another iron, six achondrites, four carbona-
ceous chondrites, and several enigmatics. Most of the remainder
are ordinary chondrites.

As part of a joint NSF-NASA—SI program, all Antarctic meteorites
are being shipped to the nmnu for characterization and descrip-
tion. A major effort, headed by Roy S. Clarke, Jr., is going into
the study of Antarctic metal-rich meteorites. Brian Mason is han-
dling the basic classification and description of all meteorites col-
lected by nsF expeditions as well as those collected by expeditions
organized by the National Institute of Polar Research of Japan,
in Tokyo, where he spent May and June 1982 as an invited
scientist.

Dr. Kurt Fredriksson attended the Seventh Symposium on
Antarctic Meteorites in Tokyo and delivered a paper on chondrule
analysis. During the year, he completed and published his work
on the ultrafine matrix in chondrites (the most primitive and
abundant class of stony meteorites). This matrix may represent the
earliest condensate from the solar nebula. As an extension of this
work Dr. Fredriksson worked at the ion-microprobe analyzing
facility of the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, Federal Republic of
Germany, looking for magnesium isotope anomalies in certain
unusual aggregates that possibly also represent the earliest con-
densates of the solar system. During this study, the preparation
of samples, using highly sophisticated techniques, was accom-
plished through the volunteer work of two geology graduates
from Carleton College and Purdue, working closely with Dr.
Fredriksson.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Museum paleontologist Richard Grant, in 1981 undertook the first
major collecting field trip to be made by a Smithsonian scientist

Science / 101
on the Chinese mainland during the modern era. His five-week
rock and fossil collecting trip, covering a broad swath of the huge
country, was arranged under an agreement between the Smith-
sonian and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Dr. Grant and
Professor Jin Yu-gan of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and
Paleontology are cooperating on a study of the 240-million-year-
old brachiopods of the Permian Age that are found in South China.

Grant traveled in China with three Chinese geologists and a
Chinese technician, collecting at sites on the Yuangtze River,
Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Laibin and Heshan in Quangzi
Province, and Nanning near the Vietnamese border.

More than 700 pounds of silicified Permian material was col-
lected and shipped to the museum where it is now undergoing
acid processing. Professor Jin Yu-gan made a reciprocal visit to
the NMNH from January to September 1982 and, while here,
traveled to Permian brachiopod sites in the Glass Mountains of
Texas and the Great Basin.

Museum paleobiologist Richard H. Benson continued to work
on two long-range projects during the year. The first of these—
the study of sudden events in deep-sea history—depends upon the
processing of deep-sea-drilling project cores for ostracodes. Empha-
sis is focused on tracing the evolution of the South Atlantic
Ocean, especially with respect to its Cenozoic history. Since Creta-
ceous events provide the geologic setting for the Cenozoic, Benson
is attempting to demonstrate the Cretaceous depths of the Rio
Grande Rise and the Walvis Ridge. Dr. Jeon Peypouquet, Univer-
sity of Bordeaux, France, collaborates with Dr. Benson in this
research.

The second project, begun four years ago, is a study of ostra-
code skeletal allometry with special attention to both ontogenetic
and phylogenetic change. Benson is currently studying the ostra-
code genus Poseidonamicus; a companion study is a comparison
among primate skulls.

Curator Thomas R. Waller’s systematic revision of the living
scallops of the world’s oceans is a program of broad scope that
will continue for many years. The project involves use of the
scanning electron microscope to observe the microstructure of
scallop shells of many growth stages and from many environ-

102 / Smithsonian Year 1982
ments, including specimens from bathyal and abyssal depths
dredged by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Texas
A&M University. The evolutionary origins of groups of scallops
are being traced by study of fossils dating back 230 million years
to the dawn of the Mesozoic Era.

Molluscan research in related areas is concentrating on some
nonscallops, with two other projects begun this year; one is an
investigation of periostracal mineralization in the Lithophaginae,
a subfamily of the Mytilidae, or mussels. Some preliminary results
of this work were given in July at a symposium on shell micro-
structure during the annual meeting of the American Malacologi-
cal Union in New Orleans. Waller’s talk was entitled ‘“Mineraliza-
tion in the Periostracum of Lithophaga nigra (Mollusca: Bivalvia)
and its Taxonomic Implications.”

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

It has long been generally believed that Hawaii was an unspoiled
paradise when the English explore Captain James Cook and other
Europeans first saw it in the late eighteenth century, and that only
after their arrival on the scene did the alarmingly rapid disappear-
ance of the islands’ unique animals and plants begin. But a study
by museum paleobiologists Storrs L. Olson and Helen F. James
now establishes solid evidence that by the time of European
arrival the Hawaiian Archipelago had already been drastically
altered and despoiled by prehistoric Polynesians.

Olson and James reported in the August 13, 1982, Science mag-
agazine that an analysis of tens of thousands of bird fossils, found
in recent years on five of the main Hawaiian Islands, shows that
at least thirty-nine species of native birds vanished in the rela-
tively short period between A.D. 400-600 (when the Polynesians
colonized the islands) and Cook’s arrival in 1778.

Gone forever was about half of the islands’ incredibly diversi-
fied and rich assemblage of unique native land birds: seven species
of geese (many of them flightless), two species of flightless ibises,
a sea eagle, a small hawk, seven flightless rails, three species of
owls, two large crows, one honeyeater, and at least fifteen finches.

The distribution of many of the surviving species also was
altered. In many cases, populations that were once found through-

Science / 103
out the islands remained only on individual islands. Some species
were extremely rare by the time the Europeans arrived and shortly
thereafter became extinct.

The Polynesian residents in Hawaii hunted birds for food and
decorative feathers. However, it would have been impossible for
them, with the limited technology available, to have hunted to
extinction many of the populations of small forest birds. Ulti-
mately, in the opinion of Olson and James, the cause of most of
the prehistoric extinctions of Hawaiian birds was the burning of
lowland forest habitats. Taro, sweet potatoes, and a variety of
other food plants imported by the Polynesians were planted and
raised in lowland areas that were cleared for cultivation by fire.

Museum scientists Victor Springer and George Zug headed an
expedition to the Fiji Islands in mid-April to early June 1982.
Traveling by ship and plane more than 2,000 miles in and around
Fiji's 180 islands, they assembled an extensive collection of the
region’s fishes, amphibians and reptiles, including many new
genera and species. The expedition was organized as a result of
Springer’s interest in the unusual distributions and relationships
of Indo-Pacific near-shore fishes, which he attributes to the
region’s geotectonic history.

In 1982 Springer published “Pacific Plate Biogeography, with
Special Reference to Shorefishes,” (Smithsonian Contributions to
Zoology No. 367). This major study is concerned primarily with
central and western portions of the Pacific Ocean (The Pacific
Plate, which underlies most of the Pacific Ocean, occurs as far
east as the northern Pacific Coast of the Western Hemisphere).

Springer says that in his study he has attempted to mesh the
relatively little that is known about the distributions and relation-
ships of the shorefish fauna of the Pacific Plate with the little that
is known about the geotectonics of the plate. Up to now, scientists
have not made such a connection. In Springer’s view, the tectonic
influences on dispersal, invoked to explain the distributions of
localized terrestrial and freshwater organisms, are equally impor-
tant in explaining the distributions of localized, shallow-dwelling
marine organisms. The volume discusses what is known about the
distributions of 179 shorefish family groups, as well as selected
terrestrial and marine taxa of other organisms. It reviews the com-
plex geotectonic history of the plate and adjacent plate margins

104 / Smithsonian Year 1982
and advances scenarios to explain why the Pacific marine biota—
shorefishes in particular—behave distributionally as they do.

SMITHSONIAN MARINE STATION AT LINK PORT

Under the administrative auspices of the NMNH since March 1981,
the Smithsonian’s marine facility at Fort Pierce, Florida, has ac-
quired a new name during the 1981-82 year. What was formerly
known as the Fort Pierce Bureau, is now officially designated the
Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port. Along with the new
name, a new and expanded program of research has been initiated,
consisting of a multi-bureau cooperative research effort. Contribut-
ing to this research are Smithsonian scientists from the Chesapeake
Bay Center for Environmental Studies (csces), the Radiation Biol-
ogy Laboratory (rBL), and the NMNH, as well as resident scientists,
postdoctoral fellows, and a number of national and international
visiting investigators. For the museum curator or land-bound in-
vestigator, the marine station provides the opportunity to test
hypothesis in the field, where long-term study sites can be estab-
lished and marine organisms kept in culture.

Studies cover a broad range of topics ranging from an investi-
gation of the spectral quality of light in the Indian River Lagoon
to investigations of the ecology, systematics, and life histories of
macroalgae, foraminifera, and a wide variety of invertebrates.

Among this work is Dr. Richard Houbrick’s investigation of the
developmental aspects of a cerithiid snail that inhabits the high
intertidal mangrove flats of the Indian River, and Dr. Joseph Rose-
water’s studies of the histories of littorinid gastropods and the
functional morphology of an unusual sand-burrowing bivalve.
Cinematographic work by Smithsonian biological films producer
Kjell Sandved is helping Rosewater understand how the bivalve
ejects sand as it burrows; Drs. Raymond Manning and C. W.
Hart are studying unknown species of sand-dwelling crustaceans,
which will form the basis for a future quantitative sampling pro-
gram to determine breeding cycles and seasonal variations in
abundances of these species.

A comparative study of the underwater light field in the Indian
River with that of Rhode River, Maryland, was initiated by a
collaborative team headed by Dr. Jack Pierce, nmnu, Dr. David
Correll, csces, and Dr. William Klein, rst. With the help of scien-

On an exploratory trip to the Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port, Florida,

Dr. Raymond Manning of the NMNH uses a sampler to collect stomatopods and cal-
lianassids in the Indian River.
tists at the Harbor Branch Foundation, the Smithsonian team has
measured the intensity and spectral quality of underwater light
and the water-quality parameters that may affect the transmittance
of light through the water column, including levels of chlorophyll,
dissolved organics, and particulate loads. Results to date indicate
higher intensities of light in the Indian River than Rhode River
and a change in the spectral quality, with a shift to greater pene-
tration of the blue-green wave lengths and a higher attenuation
of the orange bands. The study will be continued at different sea-
sons and at times of differing concentrations of tannic and humic
acids in the water.

OFFICE OF EDUCATION

One of the popular services the office provides to museum visitors
are weekly presentations of films related to natural history and
anthropology and lectures and slide shows by the museum’s cura-
torial staff and invited guests. In December 1981, a Dinosaur Film
Festival celebrated the reopening of the Dinosaur Hall. Extra show-
ings were scheduled to accommodate the large number of visitors
who wanted to see the films. In conjunction with the exhibition
inua: spirit world of the bering sea eskimo, special Friday lectures
and films were presented to enrich visitors’ understanding of the
Bering Sea Eskimo environment and culture. Films about Eskimo
life were shown on a daily basis in the Gallery Theater. The
Eskimo lectures and films were supported with funds from the
Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates.

The highly successful Gifted Students in Science Program was
continued for a second year, with support from outreach funds.
Twenty-three students were selected from ninety-one Washington
area applicants to work on research projects with curators or other
museum personnel. The Collaborative (with the National Zoo and
the National Museum of African Art) Outreach Program to the
elderly, disabled, and institutionalized served 7,355 persons be-
tween October 1981 and May 1982. Efforts to find private funding
to continue this program, as well as funds for a national program
with the National Council on the Aging, are underway.

The Office of Education provided school and adult tours of
exhibitions from October through May 15, with the assistance of
about 200 docents, who were also trained to provide tours of the

Science / 107
inua exhibition in the Evans Gallery. About one hundred docents
also contributed to the successful operation of the museum’s Dis-
covery Room and Naturalist Center. Families and school groups
visited the Discovery Room at the rate of almost 10,000 each
month—full capacity. The Naturalist Center increased its usage
by almost forty percent during the spring months, with a remark-
able 150 persons attending a Sunday “Draw-In” on August 1.

Laura McKie, education specialist in Anthropology, was selected
by the African Studies Program of Indiana University to partici-
pate in a six weeks’ travel and study seminar in Niger, Nigeria,
and Senegal. Her experience will be used to enrich the training of
the docents for the Hall of African Cultures.

HANDBOOK OF NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS

Subarctic, a basic reference work on about thirty-five Indian tribes
of Canada and Alaska, was published in 1982. It is the fourth
volume to appear in the twenty-volume Handbook series on the
prehistory, history, ethnology, and linguistics of the Native North
Americans. Editing and typesetting have been completed on the
second part of Southwest (volume 10), scheduled for publication
in 1983, which covers all non-Puebloan peoples. The first part of
Southwest (volume 9), on the Pueblos, was published in 1980.
Research and editing on Arctic are underway. California and
Northeast, issued in 1978, are both in their third printing. The
Handbook is under the general editorship of NmNu’s Dr. William C.
Sturtevant.

SMITHSONIAN OCEANOGRAPHIC SORTING CENTER

During the 1981-82 year, 2,253,634 specimens of algae, fishes,
and invertebrates were sorted at the Smithsonian Oceanographic
Sorting Center (sosc), and 374,093 specimens were shipped.to 102
taxonomists throughout the world. Recent acquisitions include
fishes from Halmahera, collected by Dr. Paul Taylor, and marine
algae from the northern Philippines, collected by Dr. Ernani G.
Menez. Dr. Gordon Hendler participated on a National Science
Foundation expedition along the Antarctic Peninsula and returned
with a valuable general collection of benthic invertebrates. Samples
of this collection are being prepared with specialized techniques

108 / Smithsonian Year 1982
such as the freeze-drying of bryozoans for the extraction of poten-
tial anti-cancer compounds. Ms. Betty Landrum developed a com-
puterized data system at sosc that is compatible with the system
used for the nMNH fish collection, thus eliminating considerably
duplication of effort. Dr. Frank Ferrari completed a study concern-
ing the introduction of oithonid copepods from coastal waters of
China into the San Francisco Bay and delta system.

OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR

The museum’s Office of the Registrar has been actively engaged
in the establishment of new registration systems in the departments
of Botany and Vertebrate Zoology. The new systems are designed
with a view towards an automated registration system. The office
continues to monitor the registration system for the department of
Anthropology, Mineral Sciences, Paleobiology, Invertebrate Zool-
ogy, and Entomology. Registration was very active during the year.
The office recorded approximately 1,490 accession transactions,
1,071 incoming collections, 3,453 outgoing shipments, and 1,200
numbers assigned in blocks to Botany and Vertebrate Zoology to
be used for incoming and outgoing shipments.

The office participated in the Museum Registration Methods
Workshop and the Northeast Museum Conference Registrars Com-
mittee Deaccessioning Workshop—the latter chaired by Margaret
Santiago, with approximately seventy-five registrars and other
museum professionals participating. The registrar continues to
review registration systems in other science museums. The most
recent visits were to the British Museum (Natural History), the
Sedgewick Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the
Museum Documentation Centre in England.

INVENTORY

The museum’s comprehensive collection inventory was nearly
seventy-eight percent complete at the end of fiscal year 1982.
Item-by-item inventories are being compiled for valuable speci-
mens, types, and many specimens going to the new Museum
Support Center; the remainder of the museum’s collection of over
60 million specimens is being inventoried in batches. Inventories
finished or near completion include the anthropology collections,

Science / 109
type specimens of plants, invertebrate and vertebrate animals and
fossil organisms, valuable mollusks, gems, minerals and rocks,
certain important groups of insects, invertebrates, mammals and
birds, large stratigraphic suites of fossils, the egg and nest collec-
tion, fish, reptiles and other vertebrates stored in large tanks, and
the collection of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center.

BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS

Design work based on last year’s ventilating and air-conditioning
systems of the NMNH was begun. These designs, when implemented
in future years, will bring significant improvement to the environ-
ment so vital to the conservation of our collections and to the
comfort of our visitors and staff.

Continued progress was made in improving the building’s fire-
protection systems. The installation of complete fire detection and
suppression systems was begun in the nonpublic areas of the main
museum building.

National Zoological Park

In fiscal year 1982 the National Zoological Park (Nzp) continued
its commitment to education, science, recreation, and conservation
through animal exhibitions, symposia, research with the collec-
tions, publications, and continuing research and breeding of en-
dangered species. These programs were accomplished through the
combined efforts of the Office of Animal Programs, the Office of
Support Services, and the Office of the Director.

CONSTRUCTION

In December 1981 the renovated Reptile and Amphibian House
and Small Mammal House were completed, and preparations for
opening began. The construction contract for Monkey Island was
awarded, and excavation started in December 1981, with the
project to be completed in October 1982. The Aquatic Vertebrate
Facility design was completed in February 1982 and is now on

110 / Smithsonian Year 1982
hold until construction funds can be programmed. Plans for im-
provements along Olmsted Walk began with the award of an
exhibit design contract in the latter part of 1982, and a design
contract was awarded in August 1982 for renovation of the Monkey
and Elephant houses. Construction should start at the end of 1982.

At the Conservation and Research Center (crc), the small-
mammal-facility construction contract was awarded in November
1981, and work was completed in September 1982. Work on the
hoofed-stock facility was finished in December 1981, and after
completion of yardwork and the outside fencing, the facility opened
on July 1, 1982. This building has been named the Rivinus Barn
in honor of Mr. Edward F. Rivinus, former director of the Smith-
sonian Institution Press, who alerted the nzp staff to the availability
of the property.

The Master Development Plan for the Conservation and Re-
search Center was completed March 1982, and copies were dis-
tributed. The schematic design for the veterinary hospital was
completed, and a design contract will be awarded later in 1982.

The Office of Support Services continued the routine annual
maintenance and repair of the animal quarters and related areas.
In some instances, some of the animals had to be off exhibit for
a few days due to the repairs.

January 13-17, 1982, the Zoo was closed to the public due to a
very heavy snow storm. The first priority was to clean the walks
to get food to the animals, and then the public access areas were
cleared.

ANIMAL COLLECTION AND EXHIBITS

During fiscal year 1982 the following endangered mammal species
were born: golden lion tamarins, maned wolves, Eld’s deer, Persian
onagers, and clouded leopards. Other major births were grey seals,
a spectacled bear, a sloth bear, California sea lions, a bongo, a
ruffed lemur, Bengal tigers, and a red-bellied tamarin.

Animals received during fiscal year 1982, which are new to the
present collection, were: burrowing rats from Brazil, four pairs
of Aleutian Canada geese, a guanaco from the Bronx Zoo, red-
crested cardinals, red and white crakes, an Eastern flying squirrel,
a Jarrow’s spiny lizard, a giant toad, a Tokay gecko, a tree shrew,
a Senegal bushbaby, a giant coot, and a Johnstone’s crocodile. A

bear cub, upper right. Below right, Keeper
Leader Michael Davenport introduces one of the
new gharials to its pool. Below left, is Tomoka,
the male gorilla—the fourth Zoo-born gorilla—
who reached the grand age of 21 years on Sep-
tember 9, 1982.

major acquisition to the herpetology collection was the gift of six
gharials from the King of Nepal to the United States. The gharials
arrived on June 30, 1982; unfortunately, two were dead on arrival.

April 16, 1982, marked the tenth anniversary of the arrival in
Washington of giant pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing. Ten
years of friendship with the People’s Republic of China was recog-
nized at the nzp with the unveiling of a plaque expressing friend-
ship and goodwill. On March 17, 1982, Ling-Ling, the giant panda,
had come into estrus and, since the ensuing breeding encounters
were not successful, she was artificially inseminated over a three-
day period, beginning March 19. The Panda House was closed to
the public on July 13 to give Ling-Ling seclusion in the event she
was pregnant, but on August 26 it was determined that she was
not. The behavior watch continued anyway until August 30, and
the Panda House was reopened on September 8.

Other notable occasions during the year include: the May 20
receipt of white-naped cranes and Derbyan parakeets as gifts from
the Peking Zoo; the twenty-first birthday, September 9, of Tomoka,
the Zoo’s male gorilla (and also the fourth zoo-born gorilla); the
annual December trip of the nine reindeer to the Ellipse for the
Pageant of Peace. This year the trip was longer, since the reindeer
are now located at the Conservation and Research Center, Front
Royal, Virginia; the computerization record, begun April 1982,
for all bird eggs laid at Rock Creek; and two major openings: the
Reptile and Amphibian House, on December 18, 1981, and the
Herplab, located in that facility, on September 21, 1982.

RESEARCH

The very active research staff and associates continued their varied
projects. Katherine Ralls continued her cooperative research with
the Fish and Wildlife Service on the threatened California sea
otter prior to undertaking translocation of this species. Kenneth
Green, principal investigator of the Image Analysis and Graphic
Facility for Ecological Studies (maces) who is funded by nim for
a three-year period, kept on with a study that will enable primate
field workers to utilize remote-sensing data from LANpsAT satellites.
W. P. J. Dittus and Anne Baker—Dittus continued their long-term
research on primates of Sri Lanka with National Science Founda-
tion support. Eugene Morton continued his studies of Kentucky

Science / 113
warblers at the Conservation and Research Center and also his
research on neotropical bird migration and the habitat of hooded
warblers in Yucatan, Mexico. John Frazier, under contract with the
Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service,
proceeded with studies to establish reliable age techniques in sea
turtles. His work also includes studies on sea turtles in Peru,
Ecuador, Panama, Mexico, and Cayman. During the summer of
1982 Dr. Frazier conducted a survey of sea turtles and their habi-
tats and birds in the Egyptian Red Sea. He is also collaborating
with Egyptian colleagues to begin sea turtle field studies there, and
Dr. Frazier has also initiated a study of the breeding of loggerhead
turtles in Greece.

The research begun in 1980, under the coordination of John
Seidensticker, on the behavioral ecology of the native wildlife at
the Conservation and Research Center and adjoining Shenandoah
National Park near Front Royal, Virginia, continues very actively.
An analysis of the vegetation of the area is also underway. This
program serves to train overseas and local biologists in ecology,
conservation, and management field techniques.

Dale L. Marcellini completed a study on lizard population
ecology; data were collected on two species of Puerto Rican Anolis.
In August 1982, Daryl Boness and Olav Oftedal began a long-term
study of California sea lions on San Nicolas Island, California.
This is a multidiscipline project participated in by nzp, Marineland,
British Columbia Provincial Museum, and University of California,
Berkeley. Mel Sunquist began a study of small carnivores and om-
nivores at Hato Masagural in Venezuela, and John Eisenberg,
R. Rudran, and Richard Thorington continued their long-term
investigations of red-howler monkeys in llanos of Venezuela.
R. Rudran kept on with his study of the effects of deforestation on
the vertebrates of the Sinharajah in Sri Lanka.

In March 1982, Devra Kleiman spent seven weeks in the
People’s Republic of China—at the Ying Xiong Gou captive-
panda facility in the Wolong Nature Reserve—observing giant
pandas during the breeding season. She also spent some time at
the Chengdu Zoo training Chinese counterparts in the collection
and analysis of behavior data, and she held discussions on the
Smithsonian giant-panda field study with Chinese scientists and
officials in Peking. Later in the summer, Dr. Kleiman went to

114 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Above. April 16, 1982, marked the 10th anniversary of the arrival of giant
pandas Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling at the nzp. Below. Ten years of friendship
with the Peoples Republic of China was recognized with the unveiling of a
plaque. Participants in the ceremony were (from left) Ambassador Chai

Zemin, an interpreter, Ambassador John Holdridge, and Dr. T. H. Reed,
director of the nzp.

Brazil to discuss with officials the protocol and possibility of a
program for reintroduction of the golden lion tamarin into the
Poco d’Anta Biological Reserve.

The inbreeding studies continue with a program in modern
genetic principles being offered to nzp collection managers, and a
24-hour hand-rearing facility at Rock Creek has been established
with trained volunteers participating.

A symposium on “The Biology and Management of the Cer-
vidae’’—which included participants from all over the world—
convened at the Conservation and Research Center in August
1982. The papers will be published in the nzp symposia series to
be edited by Christen M. Wemmer, curator-in-charge of the Con-
servation Center.

The nzp was well represented at the Third International Therio-
logical Congress held in Helsinki, August 12-20, 1982. John
Eisenberg, Olav Oftedal, Edwin Gould, and James Dietz were in
attendance, presenting papers and participating on panels in specific
sessions.

The departments of Animal Health and Pathology continued
their aggressive program of preventive, medical, and surgical care
of the collection. The research of these departments includes the
study of pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in zoological species. The
antibiotic studies have been expanded to evaluate the results of
aerosol therapy (nebulization) on blood and tissue levels in birds
and mammals. An in-depth study on the best parvovirus vaccine
is also being conducted, concurrent with a study to evaluate the
best vaccination procedure for developing immunity to canine dis-
temper. The present killed-distemper vaccine is not providing ade-
quate protection, and the use of a modified live vaccine could cause
a vaccination-induced disease in exotic carnivores. Studies on the
repair of avian fractures proceeded apace, including the use of
bone grafts, tissue glue, and plastic inserts to return the bone to
its normal function.

The Department of Pathology continues its on-going research
and vigilance against infectious diseases that may threaten the
collection. This is accomplished through a complete autopsy, a
systematic dissection of the carcass, with tissues being taken for
culture, and a complete microscopic examination of all organs.
Reproductive physiological research continues in semen collection

116 / Smithsonian Year 1982
and preservation, with artificial insemination being performed on
various species, such as elephants, rhino, giraffe, clouded leopard,
giant panda, and Dorcas gazelle, among others. The concern is the
general lack of success in zoo animals to become pregnant when
artificially inseminated. Dr. Bush and associates made a second
trip to South Africa for further studies and to collect tissues and
semen in cooperation with South African colleagues.

The medical records of NzP are now computerized, and nzp is
the first zoo to do so. On the computer are a multitude of records:
medical and surgical, anesthesia, X-ray, preventive medical, para-
site, and pathology.

PUBLIC INFORMATION AND EDUCATION

The Office of Public Information and Education has continued its
programs of contact with the public. The office, with the Friends
of the National Zoo (Fonz), has established a wildlife studies
certificate, which is awarded when an individual has completed
six courses in the approved curriculum (conservation, animal
behavior, veterinary studies, and certain electives). This fiscal
year, the first annual nzp public symposium “Animal Extinctions:
What Everyone Should Know” was held. Internationally known
speakers were on the program, and the symposium was well
received by the public.

In order to promote better coordination among the nzp and FONZ
offices with presentations to the public, the Information Services
Panel was established this year. The panel has been very success-
ful in assuring consistency in the quality of programs offered to
the public.

The office continued its programs with the D.C. Program: A
Closer Look, the Highschool Teacher’s Workshop, and Zoo

‘Observation Training; and is proceeding with its successful work
with the Zoolab, Birdlab, and now Herplab educational units,
which are very popular with the public.

ADMINISTRATION

The Smithsonian Institution Office of Audits, from December 1981
to March 1982, conducted a review of the nzp’s management and
administration. The audit resulted in the realignment of the

Science / 117
supply and warehousing function and has brought directly into
the management and administrative operations the functions of
the Office of Management Services to better serve the nzp depart-
ments and offices. The Supply and Warehousing Unit was trans-
ferred from Support Services to the Office of Management
Services and was retitled Receiving/Warehousing Unit.

On August 21, 1982, Dr. John F. Eisenberg resigned as assistant
director for Animal Programs to become Ordway Professor of
Ecosystem Conservation at the University of Florida, Gainesville.
Effective June 16, 1982, Dr. Dale L. Marcellini was appointed
acting assistant director for Animal Programs until a permanent
assistant director is appointed. Dr. Donald L. Janssen, associate
director, Department of Animal Health, resigned to take a position
at the San Diego Zoo.

FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL ZOO

The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) continued their assistance
to the National Zoological Park in education, science, recreation,
and services to the public.

This year the Smithsonian Institution renewed the contract
with Fonz for operation of the parking lots at the Zoo.

A principal part of Fonz’s contributions to the Nzp is the core
of well-trained, educated guides, who provide their time on a vol-
unteer basis during the week and on weekends. Many of these
volunteers spend many hours at the Zoo working in all areas. The
bus program, which is so popular with D.C. elementary school
classes, is still being provided, and ronz has contributed funding to
programs in science, financing research projects, field trips, and
intern and postdoctoral programs.

Financial information for calendar year 1981 is provided in
detail below. In addition, a percentage of the restaurant and park-
ing concessions is available directly to the Smithsonian for the
benefit of the National Zoo and is reported as income in the
Financial Report of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Office of Biological Conservation

The Office of Biological Conservation (osc) is responsible for for-
mulating many of the Institution’s responses to requests for infor-
mation concerning the conservation of the world’s environment.
Working with government and nongovernment organizations in
the United States and abroad, the osc has continued to assemble
data regarding the status of endangered species and ecosystems
throughout the world, and has been engaged in activities designed
to improve public awareness and understanding of conservation
issues.

The SI-Threatened Plants Committee (1ucn) Latin America
Project has completed the compilation of candidate lists of endemic
and possibly threatened species for Middle America (Mexico and
Central America). The 6,000 scientific plant names with assigned
status categories have been entered into the Wang computer at the
committee’s headquarters at Kew, the Royal Botanic Gardens,

Science / 119

England. The final publication, which will include the lists and an
introduction concerning the needs for conservation efforts in
Middle America, is expected to be published in 1983.

Similar work on the flora of South America has continued. Con-
tributors from each country have been requested to submit lists
that will then be evaluated to determine if the candidate species
are threatened on a world scale.

Threatened species of economic importance or that are crop
relatives or represent monotypic genera—as well as those that are
of aesthetic interest or horticultural value—will be featured as
Red Data Sheets in the next volume of the IUCN Red Data Book,
expected to be published in 1983.

The director served as cochairman of the “Ecosystem Mainte-
nance Panel” at the U.S. Strategy Conference on Biological Di-
versity held November 16-18, 1981, in Washington, D.C. The
panel addressed the need for careful management of natural, pro-
tected and man-modified ecosystems. Proceedings of the conference
were published by the State Department in April 1982.

The coordinator attended a Regional Workshop on Conserva-
tion of Tropical Plant Resources in Southeast Asia, held in New
Delhi, India, March 8-12, 1982. Serving as a member of the work-
shop Scientific Program Committee, he delivered, on behalf of the

120 / Smithsonian Year 1982
director, two papers: “Smithsonian Institution Endangered Flora
Information-Processing: Experiences and Goals” and “The World’s
Diminishing Plant Resources,’ which will be published in the
forthcoming conference proceedings.

Work has continued on the contract to provide illustrations of
ten plant species (three carnivorous Sarracenias, seven Mexican
cacti) frequently found in international trade. The illustrations will
be included in the United States Identification Manual, which will
be used by customs inspectors enforcing the Convention on Inter-
national Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(cITES)

The director and coordinator have completed three chapters for
a book about worldwide conservation problems: “Wetlands,”
“Plants for Man,” and “Savannas, Prairies, Arid and Semi-Arid
Zones.”

Working with the government of Jamaica, West Indies, the osc
is in the process of developing a comprehensive ‘Situation Report”
on the island’s environmental issues, including the potential for
managing renewable resources, conservation problems, and recom-
mendations for future programs. The report will be used to develop
a national conservation program.

The director submitted a paper to the international conference
on Current Topics in Plant Taxonomy, held at the University of
Reading, United Kingdom, July 7-9, 1982. “Taxonomic Problems
Relating to Endangered Plant Species” will appear in the published
proceedings of the conference.

A color-illustrated book, Endangered Plants of the United States,
is in the editorial stage, and illustrations are being selected. It is
hoped that this text will stimulate concern among students and
the general public.

The osc continued its role in supporting the Charles Darwin
Foundation for the Galapagos Isles, and the Seychelles Islands
Foundation.

Office of Fellowships and Grants

The Office of Fellowships and Grants (orc) continues to serve as
an Institutional link with scholarly organizations throughout the

Science / 121
world. It brings scientists and scholars to all parts of the Smith-
sonian to utilize the unique resources available, as well as to inter-
act with professional staff. The office also encourages research
by universities, museums, and research organizations in the fields
of art, history, and science. At present, two major activities are
managed and developed by the office: Academic Programs and the
Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program.

Academic Programs at the Smithsonian support and assist visit-
ing students and scholars, providing opportunities for research to
be conducted at Smithsonian facilities, in conjunction with staff
members. Residential appointments are offered at the undergradu-
ate, graduate, and professional levels.

The Smithsonian also enhances the quality of its research and
extends the reach of its scholarly efforts through the Smithsonian
Foreign Currency Program (srcp). The srcp offers grants to the
Smithsonian and other U.S. scholarly institutions for research in a
limited number of foreign countries where “excess currencies” are
available. It is particularly effective in strengthening the “increase
and diffusion of knowledge” on an international scale.

ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

Academic programs at the Smithsonian are an important comple-
ment to those offered at universities. The national collections and
the curators who study them are unparalleled resources that are
not available anywhere else and are essential to scholarly research.
In general, university education is based primarily on the study of
books or artifact reproductions. At the Smithsonian, historical and
anthropological objects, original works of art, natural history
specimens, living plants, animals, and entire ecosystems are avail-
able for study. The educational experience, which combines uni-
versity training with field research, is one that is significantly
enhanced, and the breadth of field opportunities at the Smithsonian
is unmatched.

The orc administered a variety of academic appointments in
fiscal year 1982. The program of Research Training Fellowships
was begun in 1965. This year fifty-five pre- and postdoctoral
fellowships were awarded. These appointees pursue independent
research projects under the guidance of staff advisors for periods
of six months to one year in residence at one of the Institution’s

122 / Smithsonian Year 1982
bureaus or field sites. Topics of study for Smithsonian fellows in-
cluded: the role of plant litter in nutrient cycling; ancient Chinese
ritual jades and weapons; quantum physics and the composition
of the stars; functions of juvenile/adult color dimorphism in coral
reef fishes; intercultural interaction on the Southern Plains; and
classical medicine and social development in early America.

In addition to the general program funded through the Office
of Fellowships and Grants, competitions for pre- and postdoctoral
fellowships may also be held for specific awards. At the suggestion
of First Lady Nancy Reagan, the First Ladies Fellowship was estab-
lished for the study of costume in America at the National Museum
of American History. The International Environmental Sciences
Program supported a fellowship for the study of the social behavior
of iguanas in the llanos of Venezuela.

In addition, twenty graduate student fellowships were offered
for ten-week periods during 1982. The participants are usually
junior graduate students beginning to explore avenues that develop
into dissertation research. This year some of these fellows studied:
learning among a group of captive orangutans; the indigenous
roots of New York Dada; design elements of Near Eastern textiles
and clothing; Caribbean sponges; and tool marks on the hull of the
Philadelphia.

A number of senior fellowships continued to be offered at the
Institution. The distinguished botantist G. Ledyard Stebbins, emeri-
tus professor at the University of California at Davis, came to the
National Museum of Natural History as a Regents Fellow this
winter. In addition to continuing his research on the population
biology and systematics of the genus Antennaria, Dr. Stebbins
gave a number of talks and seminars to both lay and professional
audiences. Sir David Bates from the Queens University of Belfast
began a stay of six months at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory (sao) as a Regents Fellow, working with members of
the divisions of atomic and molecular physics, optical and infrared
astronomy, and radio and geoastronomy. Also appointed a Regents
Fellow was Dr. Gerald Wasserberg, California Institute of Tech-
nology, who came to the National Air and Space Museum in Sep-
tember. He is working on popular publications on the significance
of the space program and its scientific and political evolution since
the early 1960s and on a chronology of the origin of the solar
system.

Science / 123
The nas reappointed R. E. G. Davies to the Lindbergh Chair
to continue his studies on the history of air transport. In addition,
John M. Logsdon was appointed to the first Chair in Space History.
Dr. Logsdon is director of the graduate program in Science, Tech-
nology and Public Policy at The George Washington University
and while at nasm will complete a study of U.S. space policy from
1969 to 1972.

To honor Regent Emeritus James E. Webb, the Institution an-
nounced the establishment of a number of fellowships in his name,
designed to promote excellence in the management of cultural and
scientific not-for-profit organizations. The first awards were offered
in late fall of 1982 to persons from outside the Institution to come
to the Smithsonian, and for Smithsonian staff to spend training
periods away from the Institution.

During fiscal year 1982 bureaus continued to offer support for
visiting scientists and scholars in cooperation with the orc. These
awards make possible visits to the Smithsonian by persons who
do not fall within the framework of the research training program,
principally scholars at mid-career. The office also continued ad-
ministration and partial support of the short-term visitor program.
Forty-four persons spent from one week to a month at the Institu-
tion conducting research, studying collections, and collaborating
and conferring with professional staff.

The expanded role of internships in the academic community is
paralleled by increased support for interns within the Institution.
The NAsM supported sixteen interns through the orc this year,
almost double the number in 1981. The Cooper-Hewitt Museum
again appointed three students under the Sidney and Celia Siegal
Fellowship fund. Internships in environmental studies at the
Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies and in primate
conservation training at the National Zoological Park also con-
tinued. The Smith College-Smithsonian Program in American
Studies is now in its third year; six students will participate in a
seminar course and conduct research projects under the direction
of staff members.

Progress on the organization of internship activities at the
Institution continued. Institution policies regarding internships
were published, and an internship council—consisting of intern-
ship coordinators representing all bureaus and offices—was formed.
Placement of interns will be through these coordinators, but the

124 / Smithsonian Year 1982
ore will continue to administer all stipend awards for internships.

For the second year the orc, in cooperation with the Office of
Equal Opportunity, has offered academic opportunities aimed at
improving minority participation in Smithsonian programs. Start-
ing with internships in 1981, the program expanded to include
fellowships for faculty of historically black colleges and minority
faculty members of other colleges. Awards were made to twenty
interns who were placed at a variety of bureaus and offices on the
Mall and also at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the
Radiation Biology Laboratory, and the sao. Some of the appoint-
ments have already developed into more permanent relationships.
Orc also awarded seven fellowships to faculty persons to conduct
research on subjects ranging from plant taxonomy to Eastern
Cherokee sacred formulas and a social history of black New
Yorkers during slavery and freedom. Also as a part of the minority
education effort, two Smithsonian archivists went to Albany State
College, Georgia, to offer a two-day workshop on developing an
archival system.

SMITHSONIAN FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards grants
to support the research interests of American institutions, includ-
ing the Smithsonian, in those countries in which the United States
holds blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of surplus
agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. The program is
active in countries in which the U.S. Treasury Department declares
United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of
normal federal requirements, including, in 1982, Burma, Guinea,
India, and Pakistan. Research projects are moving toward conclu-
sion under program support in the former excess-currency coun-
tries of Egypt, Poland, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia.

The Smithsonian received a fiscal year 1982 appropriation of
$4.320 million in “excess” currencies to support projects in anthro-
pology and archaeology, systematic and environmental biology,
astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum professional fields.
From its inception in fiscal year 1966, through fiscal year 1982,
the srcp has awarded about $49 million in foreign-currency grants
to 225 institutions in 40 states and the District of Columbia.

This year, projects ranged through many disciplines, including
archaeological investigation of Oriyo mound in Gujarat, India;

Science / 125
geological investigations of the Egyptian desert; paleoanthropo-
logical studies of Later Miocene hominids in Pakistan; archaeo-
logical mapping of the Theban Necropolis; examination of ceramic
production and distribution in Rajasthan, India; linguistic study of
the nomenclature of ancient economic plants in South India; oral
histories of Tibetan refugees; micropaleontologic studies of Ceno-
zoic marine sedimentary sequences; and ecological studies of
parasitic drosophilids.

The Smithsonian conveyed to the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (uNEsco) in 1982 the first of
four projected contributions to the international effort to restore
and preserve the Indus civilization city of Moenjodaro in Pakistan.
The 4,500-year-old city, which flourished from about 3000 B.c. to
1500 B.c., with its sophisticated planning, sanitation, and social
organization, anticipated developments that were to blossom sev-
eral thousand years later. Floods of the Indus River and highly
saline ground waters have caused serious destruction of the exca-
vated remains. The preservation project, long in the planning stage,
has begun with a scheme for ground-water control.

Through the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program and other
relationships, the Institution has a long-term interest in American
research centers abroad. In spring 1981, Dr. Alice Ilchman was
retained by the Smithsonian to study the Institution’s role in secur-
ing the future of such centers and developing their activities
further. As part of the response to Dr. Ilchman’s recommendations,
the orc has been assisting these centers to form a cooperative
organization for advancement of the interests shared by all. During
fiscal year 1982, the new organization, The Council of American
Overseas Research Centers, was established, its membership con-
solidated, and bylaws adopted. An effort was begun to investigate
possible sources of continuous funding for the centers.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

One of the aims of science is to describe in molecular detail the
way in which processes occur. In biology, a reductionist approach
is to take the cellular systems apart and then to characterize the
components that are present. From such information about the

126 / Smithsonian Year 1982
sub-units, it is assumed that an understanding can be constructed
of the way the parts interact.

Another approach is to study biological systems as a whole by
describing their behavior, either as individuals or as populations,
in response to environmental stimuli. From these data, it can be
deduced what sort of components or sub-units must be present.

The research of the Radiation Biology Laboratory (rst) utilizes
both approaches to understand how plant growth and development
are influenced by the environment. The disciplines of biochemistry,
plant physiology, physics, biophysics, genetics, and engineering
are used in an interdisciplinary manner. In addition, it is necessary
to measure accurately and precisely environmental variables. The
RBL has continued such measurements and emphasizes measure-
ments of sunlight and its utilization for photosynthesis and photo-
morphogenesis. Specifically, the research of the laboratory concen-
trates on four areas: measurement of environmental processes and
energy flow in biological systems, such as photosynthesis, water
relations, and carbon metabolism; regulatory processes of plants,
such as membrane synthesis and pigment synthesis; measurement
of the amount, duration, and color quality of sunlight present in
the environment; and age determination of biological artifacts
based upon their radiocarbon content. Administratively, the re-
search is grouped into three units encompassing individual proj-
ects: Regulatory Biology, Environmental Biology, and Carbon
Dating.

REGULATORY BIOLOGY

All plants that are capable of becoming green when grown under
natural conditions have, in addition to green chlorophyll, a pigment
that is sensitive to the light environment. This pigment (phyto-
chrome) is the photoreceptor for many important light responses
in plants. It is a large, photochromic protein that can be inter-
converted by light between biologically active and inactive forms.
Although these forms can be detected optically both in plant cells
and in extracted solutions, the molecular differences between the
two forms remain unknown, as does the mechanism of action of
the molecule.

Recently, in the rst new methods have been developed for puri-
fying and characterizing the biologically active and inactive forms.

Science / 127
This development has required major effort in refining plant protein
purification procedures and the use of some innovative techniques.
Large quantities of phytochrome can now be purified, free of con-
tamination by other proteins. One immediate result has been the
recognition that partial breakdown of phytochrome must have
occurred in the phytochrome described in all previously published
work. Precautions can now be taken to eliminate this problem
routinely, and sensitive procedures have been developed for moni-
toring extracts for the presence of contaminating, degraded forms.

Among the findings with undegraded materials is the fact that
the process of reversion of the active phytochrome in the dark to
inactive phytochrome is profoundly affected by limited breakdown.
This fact probably explains past observations that phytochrome
extracted from monocotyledonous plants showed dark reversion,
while no dark reversion could be detected in intact living plants.
When care is taken to eliminate breakdown in phytochrome ex-
tracts from monocotyledonous tissue, reversion is essentially
absent.

When a solution of undegraded phytochrome obtained from rye
seedlings is placed under red light, eighty-four percent of the
molecules are converted to the biologically active form. The absorp-
tion characteristics of the partially degraded molecule are changed
by the presence of salts in the solution. As the concentration of
salts is increased, solutions of the biologically active form absorb
more strongly.

Other colored pigments (yellow, orange, and red carotenoids)
are also present in plants, and their synthesis is regulated by blue
light. The precursor of these pigments, phytoene, is a forty-carbon
colorless compound, which is synthesized from a five-carbon com-
pound, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (rp), by a series of enzymatic
reactions. In cell-free enzyme extracts from the fungus Neurospora
crassa, the conversion of pp to phytoene has been found to require
both soluble and membrane-bound enzymes. The enzyme that con-
verts the twenty-carbon intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophos-
phate (ccrr) to phytoene is membrane-bound and regulated by
blue light. The conversion of 1PPp to GGpp requires two soluble en-
zymes, an isomerase and a prenyltransferase. Partial purification
of one of these enzymes (prenyltransferase) has been achieved,
and the enzyme activity that can be extracted is increased by blue

128 / Smithsonian Year 1982
light applied to intact cells prior to extraction. Thus, it is concluded
that blue light exerts at least one of its effects in the living cell at
this locus in the biosynthetic pathway for carotenogenesis.

In the fungus Phycomyces, the levels of the carotenoid beta-
carotene are regulated by blue light. Previous data from the RBL
indicated that the photoreceptor regulating the synthesis of beta-
carotene is beta-carotene itself. Low levels of beta-carotene are
synthesized in the dark, and blue light increases the rate of syn-
thesis. It is postulated that this mechanism protects the cells from
damage caused by exposure to high-intensity light, since caro-
tenoids are good quenchers of singlet oxygen, which is produced
by the intense light.

Preliminary data were obtained on the growth rates of fungal
cells for three strains of Phycomyces, wild type (wrt), an albino
strain incapable of synthesizing beta-carotene (C-5), and a strain
which produces abnormally large amounts of beta-carotene (B-401).
When these three strains were grown at 15° C under intense blue
light (50 W m7%), the albino cells ceased growth quickly. How-
ever, the growth of the B-401 strain also was inhibited by blue
light, as compared to dark-green controls, while the wild-type
grew at the same rate as in darkness. Apparently the wild-type
strain has something in addition to carotenoids that protects it
from the intense blue light, and this characteristic is diminished in
the B-401 strain. It is postulated that, even though the additional
beta-carotene can quench damaging singlet oxygen if present, ex-
cessive amounts may produce blue-light-induced photodynamic
damage directly.

When algae are grown under light-limiting conditions, they
utilize accessory pigments contained in specialized structures called
phycobilisomes that absorb light and transfer the absorbed energy
to reaction centers for photosynthesis. These phycobilisomes play
a major role in absorbing light in blue-green algae. Phycobilisomes,
isolated from the blue-green alga Nostoc by the method developed
in the rBL, were found to consist of colored phycobiliproteins
(eighty-five percent) and uncolored polypeptides (fifteen percent).

These phycobilisomes can be dissociated to their component
parts, and these parts purified and identified. In addition, for the
first time, conditions have been determined whereby functional
phycobilisomes could be reassociated from these components in

Science / 129
the test tube. Using these conditions, it was possible to show that
the absence of one, small, colorless polypeptide prevented such
in-vitro reassociation. From this fact, as well as corroborating evi-
dence from other studies, it is suggested that this colorless poly-
peptide has a crucial role in the specific attachment of two phyco-
biliproteins—namely, phycocyanin with allophycocyanin. These
two previously identified phycobiliproteins constitute the core of
native phycobilisomes.

Green plants contain chloroplasts in which are located the
pigments for photosynthesis. A large portion of the chloroplast is
composed of membranous sacs (thylakoids), in which the electron
transport reactions of photosynthesis take place. Some of the poly-
peptides of these thylakoids are made in the chloroplast on chloro-
plast ribosomes, and some are made in the cytoplasm on cytoplasm
ribosomes. Thylakoids of the alga Chlamydomonas, and thyla-
koids of other plants have ribosomes bound to them. Previous
work suggested that the thylakoid-bound chloroplast ribosomes
might be specifically involved in synthesizing polypeptides that are
added to the thylakoids.

Thylakoids can be isolated from Chlamydomonas, but intact
chloroplasts cannot. Thus, it is not possible to determine the rela-
tive amounts of messenger RNA (m-RNA) in thylakoids and stroma.
Therefore, highly purified intact chloroplasts were obtained from
immature first-true leaves of spinach. The chloroplasts contained
thirty percent of their ribosomes bound to thylakoids. The thy-
lakoid-bound ribosomes had properties similar to the thylakoid-
bound ribosomes of Chlamydomonas and pea.

Polyribosomes were released from the membranes by controlled
digestion with trypsin. Ribosomal sub-units were released with
high salt and puromycin, and release was totally dependent on
the presence of both together. A chloroplast synthesized polypep-
tide, the large sub-unit of ribulose-bis-phosphate carboxylase, was
isolated, and an antibody was prepared against it. The carboxylase
is a protein localized in the stroma. Messenger rna for it should
not be present on thylakoids if thylakoid-bound ribosomes syn-
thesize thylakoid proteins exclusively.

Total RNA was prepared from chloroplasts, washed thylakoids,
and stroma. The rna was translated in the wheat-germ-protein
synthesis system, and the presence of radioactive polypeptides was

130 / Smithsonian Year 1982
tested with specific antibody, using the indirect immunoprecipita-
tion technique. Significant quantities of labelled, large sub-unit of
ribulose-bis-phosphate carboxylase were formed using thylakoid
RNA as message, as well as stroma RNA. These results indicate the
presence of m-rna for large sub-unit of ribulose-bis-phosphate
carboxylase on thylakoids as well as in the stroma. Thus, thylakoid-
bound polyribosomes may not be exclusively involved in the
synthesis of thylakoid polypeptides as originally hypothesized.

The light stimulus for inducing flowering in plants is received
in leaves, and something in the leaves is altered. This alteration
results in a change in materials moving from the leaves through
the phloem sap to the terminal bud where flowering occurs. Despite
many years of concentrated effort, isolation of the postulated
hormonal materials that control flowering has not been successful.
One plant that is very sensitive to light stimuli, Perilla, a member
of the mint family, was tested. Phloem sap from vegetative and
flowering material was extracted and fractionated into neutral
ethyl acetate, acidic ethyl acetate, neutral butanol, and acidic
butanol fractions. These fractions were examined by high pressure
liquid chromatography (Hptc), and a number of significant differ-
ences between vegetative and flowering extracts were identified.
Most of the differences are quantitative, but a few may be qualita-
tive. The reproducibility and chemical nature of these differences
are being determined.

Similarly, samples of duckweed—vegetative and flowering—have
been examined collaboratively with Professors Takimoto and
Takahashi of Japan. Sensitive assays for benzoic acid and abscisic
acid found no differences. In addition, bioassay failed to detect
significant levels of gibberellins. Cytokinins were found. No corre-
lation of the levels of these plant hormones with flowering has yet
been detected.

The reproductive behavior of many plants is also affected by the
duration and spectral quality of sunlight. This response, known as
photoperiodism, is based on the ability of the plant to measure the
relative length of the day. In order to do so, the plant, utilizing a
suitable photoreceptor molecule, must be able to detect the dif-
ference between light and darkness.

Laboratory studies in the rBt have shown previously that flower-
ing in barley, which is promoted by increasing daylengths, can be

Science / 131
enhanced by the addition of long wavelength, far-red light to
the daily photoperiod. It is also known that this far-red light
causes structural changes in the chloroplast that result in increased
efficiency for photosynthesis. Extensive experiments were contin-
ued to test the hypothesis that enhanced flowering was caused by
more efficient photosynthesis. Plants were grown in the presence
of an herbicide that produces plants that are completely devoid of
chlorophyll and, thus, lack any photosynthesis. The promotion of
flowering by far-red light was, however, found to be unaffected.
Therefore, chlorophyll is not the photoreceptor molecule that
regulates the photoperiodic enhancement of flowering.

It was found, further, that flowering was not only enhanced by
far-red light in the absence of chlorophyll, but was in fact better
than that in the green controls. Preliminary indications are that
the far-red light stimulates the uptake or utilization of glucose, the
sugar that must be supplied externally in the growth medium to
the plant to replace photosynthesis. Thus, some photoreceptor
other than chlorophyll seems to be involved with carbohydrate
metabolism that may be in the causal chain of events leading to
the promotion of plant reproduction.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

The photosynthetic activity of a plant depends on several vari-
ables, such as the irradiance and spectral quality of the incident
radiation, the temperature of the plant, the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the surrounding air, the availability of water to the
roots, and the level of nutrients in the root medium. In green-
houses, light from electric lamps is often added as a supplement.
However, the relative effectiveness of these lamps in producing
photosynthetically active radiation is temperature-dependent. Their
efficiency for emitting light decreases as the temperature is
reduced toward the minimum temperatures—about 10° C (50° F)—
below which horticultural crops cannot be sustained. Similarily,
the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant decreases, principally
because of the decreasing rate of chemical reactions at these
reduced temperatures. For a cool-temperature crop, such as lettuce,
it was found that the plant mass could be heated directly with in-
frared radiation to achieve higher photosynthetic efficiencies with-
out expending the large amounts of oil or electrical energy that

132 / Smithsonian Year 1982
would be necessary to heat the ambient air in the greenhouse or
growth chamber. However, the use of a far-red radiation source
enhances the photochemical processes of photosynthetic activity
above that obtained with only “white” lamps. The combination
of plant irradiation with infra-red energy and the use of far-red
lamps to enhance photosynthesis provides an alternative to the
high cost of heating the ambient air.

This far-red enhancement effect also works with plants that
require higher temperature for growth. However, these plants must
be maintained at a higher ambient temperature since the far-red
lamps do not emit sufficient radiation to increase the plant to a
high enough temperature to enhance photosynthesis.

The most common environmental perturbation leading to reduc-
tions in primary production in higher plants is water stress. Many
of the factors that control plant growth, such as turgor pressure,
are directly affected by changes in plant water balance. Photo-
synthesis is particularly sensitive. As the plant dessicates, turgor
pressure declines, and the stomatal openings in the leaves close,
reducing the supply of carbon dioxide from the ambient air to the
chlorophyll-containing tissues within the leaf lamina. Further des-
sication leads to inhibition of not only light harvesting, but also
the production of reducing power and carbon reduction.

The physical measurement of water stress by plant physiologists
is a determination of the chemical activity of water in the plant
relative to the chemical activity of pure water. This measurement
is called “water potential” and reflects the fact that reduction of
the chemical activity of water in the plant reduces its capacity to
react in chemical reactions and to diffuse. Under favorable growth
conditions for crop plants, water potential is normally high, but
when dessication occurs, water potential declines by a readily
measurable amount. The level of water potential required to pro-
duce an effect upon photosynthesis varies considerably between
species. Plants adapted to the very dry saline habitats are able to
accomplish photosynthesis at much lower water potentials than
are less hardy species.

Wild species are well adapted to water stress and differ from
more sensitive crop species. An understanding of these wild plants
may someday help to improve drought resistance in important
crop plants. Such a plant that has adapted to a very broad range

Science / 133
of water potentials is Spartina alterniflora, or common cordgrass,
an abundant and highly productive species found along the
Atlantic coastline. Although this plant is tolerant of very low
water potentials, it grows best in mild, unstressed environments.
It manifests many of the effects of water stress typical of those
plants that are not tolerant of water stress. For example, it has a
reduction of leaf area with increased water stress.

Clues to the mechanism by which this adaptation is accom-
plished are found in the analysis of pressure-volume data. As
relative water content is reduced below about seventy percent,
the dependence of the inverse of plant water potential upon rela-
tive water content, becomes linear. Extrapolation of this linear
relationship to 100 percent relative water content permitted esti-
mation of osmotic potential and turgor pressure in the normal,
physiological range of relative water content, which is typically
seventy-five to ninety percent. Data obtained in this region could
also be used to calculate the modulus of elasticity; i.e., the change
in turgor pressure per unit of change in relative water content.
At high relative water contents, the osmotic potentials of plants
adapted to severe stress were always lower than osmotic poten-
tials in plants adapted to moderate stress. Plants adapted to
severe stress were also more rigid—the modulus of elasticity was
greater—than plants adapted to moderate stress.

These results show that the ability to maintain turgor pressure
includes adaptation of the physical, as well as the biochemical,
properties of plant tissues. The physiological meaning of the
increased modulus of elasticity is that larger changes in turgor
pressure are produced by the same change in relative water con-
tent. The ecological benefit is that plants having a high modulus
of elasticity are better able to exploit habitats in which water is
limited. The capacity for reduction of osmotic potential as stress
increases is evidence of osmotic regulation in this species.

Measurements of the light penetrating the water in the Rhode
River estuary of the Chesapeake Bay showed a marked increase
in the transmissivity of the water when ice had formed. This
increase is a complex phenomenon that is not readily explained.
It could be due to various factors, such as a decrease in plankton,
less run off from the land—which can carry a great deal of silt
and other matter into the estuary—or the failure of other mechan-

134 / Smithsonian Year 1982
isms that normally prevent light from easily penetrating to any
extent. These failures could be due in part to frozen conditions on
the land and upper reaches of the river.

Seed germination and morphological responses in plants have
been attributed to the relative amounts of energy in red (660 nm)
and far-red (720 nm, 730 nm) light absorbed by the phytochrome
pigment. New data, taken in Rockville, Maryland, using an inter-
ference-filter scanning radiometer developed by the rst shows
very little change in the 660 nm/730 nm ratio of irradiances, but
large changes in the 660 nm/720 mm ratio do occur. These data
are representative of both global (horizontal surface) and direct
beam (normal incidence) irradiances. Occasionally the 660 nm/
730 nm ratio will show a large change at very low irradiances
(0.01 Wm~? nm~*), but these changes seem to be the exception
rather than the rule. Since the wavelength band widths are only
5 nm, these changes are generally predictable. The 720 nm filter
measures energy at the peak of the water absorption band, which
extends from approximately 715 nm to 730 nm. The 730 nm filter
measures at a point little affected by the change in atmospheric
water. Since these ratios seem to depend on atmospheric water, it
would be expected that the 660 nm/720 nm ratio would show even
larger changes in the normal incidence measurements near or on
the horizon.

CARBON DATING

The laboratory provides analytical service for the research interests
of the Institution’s staff by providing radiocarbon chronologies
for samples of geological and archaeological interest. During the
past year more than 300 such service samples were dated. Addi-
tionally, a major portion of laboratory research continues to focus
upon paleoclimates, the early occupations of the Americas, and
investigation of the relationships between changing environment
and changing cultures.

Collagen extracted from a portion of rib bone of a mammoth
skeleton found just east of Washington, D.C., dated to 21,000 or
20,000 years ago, while plant matter from the underlying deposit
dated to about 26,000 years, a period spanning the onset of the
last major continental ice advance. Analyses of fossil pollen grains
from the deposit are being undertaken to provide some clue to the

Science / 135
presence of this grazing mammal in an area presumed to be scrub
boreal forest.

Collagen from bones in a cave deposit in West Virginia have
spanned a range of 23,000 to 20,000 years ago for remains of a
tropical bat now found only south of Georgia. The apparent tem-
perate character of the area is of considerable interest for inter-
pretation of data from Meadowcroft Rockshelter not far to the
north, where earliest human occupations have been successfully
dated to 21,000 years ago, and it is especially interesting since
that site lies only seventy kilometers south of the continental ice
border. Floral and faunal remains from the rockshelter indicate
boreal forest at that time and prompt major reconsideration not
only of man’s adaptability to cold ice-front regimes, but also of
assumptions regarding geographic-transgressive vegetation regimes
as one moves away from the front of a continental ice mass.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

The past year might be called “Year of the Director” at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sao). The former director
had an observatory named in his honor; the current director chaired
a committee that produced a landmark scientific report; and the
next director of the observatory was selected and appointed.

On the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, Fred L. Whipple,
former director of sao, was honored by the Smithsonian Board of
Regents’ decision to rename sao’s field site at Mt. Hopkins, Ari-
zona, the “Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory.” Since 1968,
this facility, located some thirty-five miles south of Tucson, has
served as SAo’s major observatory for ground-based astronomy,
including studies of planetary, stellar, and extragalactic objects.
Mt. Hopkins is also the site of the Multiple Mirror Telescope,
operated jointly with the University of Arizona.

The formal change in name was marked with ceremonies on the
summit of Mt. Hopkins, May 7, 1982. As Assistant Secretary
David Challinor noted, it was appropriate to name the facility
“after the man who conceived it, planned it, and, during its fledg-

136 / Smithsonian Year 1982
ling days, nurtured it so the site might become the multi-faceted
research center it is today.”

While former director Whipple was being feted by his colleagues
and friends, the current director, George B. Field, was receiving
national praise for his efforts on behalf of the astronomical com-
munity as chairman of the Astronomy Survey Committee. Com-
missioned by the National Academy of Sciences and funded by the
National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the committee undertook the formidable
task of reaching a consensus within the large and diverse commu-
nity of scholars and researchers on national priorities for the next
decade. The report of that committee, Astronomy and Astrophysics
for the 1980's, published in the spring of 1982, established a set
of research goals and ranked recommendations for major new
instrumentation and facilities to fulfill them. Among the projects
urged by the committee were: an Advanced X-ray Astrophysics
Facility (axaF) to provide a permanent national X-ray observatory
in space; a Very-Long-Baseline (vB) array of radio telescopes de-
signed to produce images with an angular resolution of 0.3 milliarc-
seconds; a New Technology Telescope (Nntr) of the 15-m class, to
provide a tenfold increase in light-gathering capacity at optical
wavelengths and a hundredfold increase at infrared wavelengths;
and a Large Deployable Reflector in space for spectroscopic and
imaging observations in the far-infrared and submillimeter wave-
lengths, complementing and extending the capabilities of the
largest ground-based telescope.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in partnership with
the Harvard College Observatory (Hco) as members of the Center
for Astrophysics (cFA), is uniquely placed to respond to the recom-
mendations of the committee, having specialists and research
groups active in all areas of modern astrophysics. The person who
will be responsible for exploiting sao’s potential for leadership will
be Irwin I. Shapiro. A professor of physics and geophysics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shapiro was named senior
scientist at sao on July 1, 1982, with his appointment as director
to be effective January 1, 1983. (At that time, Shapiro will also
become director of Hco and the cra. George Field will return to
research and teaching duties as senior scientist at sao and professor
of astronomy at Harvard.)

Science / 137
As director of the cra, Shapiro will be responsible for leading a
research staff of more than 140 scientists engaged in a broad pro-
gram of astronomy and astrophysics. Data-gathering facilities in-
clude, besides the Whipple Observatory, an international network
of field stations to observe artificial satellites, an optical astronomy
facility in Massachusetts, a radio astronomy facility in Texas, and
satellite-borne and rocket-borne telescopes for X-ray and infrared
observations. Research results are published in established journals
as well as in the Center Preprint Series, the Smithsonian Special
Report series, and other technical and nontechnical publications
distributed to scientific and educational institutions around the
world.

Smithsonian scientists are encouraged to teach in the Harvard
University Department of Astronomy and other departments, as
well as at other universities and colleges. Both a Visiting Scientist
Program and a Postdoctoral Fellowship Program are sponsored by
sao at the cra. An extensive public education and information
program is coordinated by the sao Public Affairs Office.

The Center’s research programs are funded by various combina-
tions of sources. SAo’s programs are supported by federal appro-
priations and trust funds from the Smithsonian Institution and by
contracts and grants from both the private sector and government
agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, the
National Science Foundation, and the Air Force Geophysics Lab-
oratory. The Langley-Abbot Program, funded by the Institution,
provides fundamental support in the area of solar physics and
related research. Harvard members are supported by university
funds and by outside contracts and grants.

The Center’s research activities are organized in seven divisions
under the leadership of associate directors, who are charged with
coordinating the investigations and planning the resources required
to carry out programs. The research accomplishments in each of
these divisions during the past year follow.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS

Burgeoning developments in astronomy continued to create new
and exciting demands for precise and comprehensive atomic and
molecular data and for extensive understanding of physical and

138 / Smithsonian Year 1982
chemical processes. The goals of Atomic and Molecular Physics
Division members are to provide these data and the basic under-
standing of the processes. Research was carried out in theoretical
and experimental physics and chemistry relating directly to the
interpretation of astronomical observations and entering into
theories of astronomical phenomena. These research topics are
interwoven by the vital interaction between theorists and experi-
mentalists, which continues to be a strength of the division.

Recent measurements of the cross-section for charge transfer in
the collision of C** ions with atomic hydrogen seemed to suggest
a possible discrepancy between the low energy (<250 eV) and the
high energy data (>2 keV). Accurate theoretical calculations were
performed for the charge transfer process, and the results for the
cross-section showed that two channels contribute with very dif-
ferent energy dependence in such a way that the total cross-section
is in harmony with both sets of experimental data.

Most plasma diagnostic techniques require accurate electron-
impact excitation cross-sections for multiply charged ions and
many need transition probabilities for transitions involving meta-
stable levels. Measurements of these atomic parameters were em-
phasized in the laboratory. The Ion-Beam Facility was used to make
the first measurement of the electron-impact excitation of the
ground term of C+, 2s 2p ?P°, to the 2s2p? 7D term. The 41335 A
spectral line produced by this excitation is observed in the sun
and other astronomical sources and is an important, electron tem-
perature and density diagnostic when used with other lines of Cr.

A facility was developed for measurement of radiative transition
probabilities for intersystem transitions in light ions of astrophys-
ical interest. The ions are created and excited by the electron bom-
bardment of gases, stored in an ion trap, and the photons from
radiative decay are detected. The magnitudes of the A-values for
typical spin-forbidden transitions are between 10? and 10% sec™?.
Because of its use in solar transition-zone diagnostics and as a
test of theoretical atomic calculations, the Si III (1892 A) line was
measured first, and an A-value of 1.63 X 10% was determined.

The opacity of the earth’s atmosphere in the wavelength region
1750-2050 A is controlled by the absorption cross-sections of the
rotationally discrete Schumann-Runge bands of Os. The cross-
section of the Schumann-Runge bands (12, 0) through (1, 0) were

Science / 139
measured with a 6.65-m photoelectric scanning spectrometer of
high enough resolution (0.0013 A) for the cross-sections to be
independent of the instrumentation—a result never previously
achieved. Definitive band oscillator strengths have been determined
directly from the measured cross-sections and were used to obtain
predissociation line widths of the bands by fitting computed cross-
sections to those measured.

HIGH ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS

High Energy Astrophysics Division members devoted considerable
time during the past year to the reduction and analysis of scientific
data from the two High Energy Astronomy Observatory satellites
(HEAO 1 and 2). Research programs covered a wide range of astro-
nomical topics, including stellar coronae, supernova remnants,
globular clusters, binary X-ray systems, normal galaxies, narrow
emission-line galaxies, radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, Seyfert gal-
axies, quasars, clusters of galaxies, and surveys and identifications
of galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources. Substantial observing
time with a number of ground-based optical and radio telescopes
was obtained and utilized as a part of these scientific programs.

Analysis of data from the Scanning Modulation Collimator ex-
periment on board HEAo-1 continued, with the objective of identi-
fying bright X-ray sources with optical objects. A major milestone
was the completion of the data-reduction phase by creating merged
directories of all mission data for each of 1,200 possible X-ray
sources. So far, about 240 sources are indicated; of these 50 may
be contaminated by stronger sources. Other X-ray sources were
also identified, including a new transient-like source, H0O323+02—
with what (sometimes) appears to be a normal G-star with a
large infrared excess—and three probable Be-star X-ray systems.
At least two of the latter, 4U0728—25 and 3A2206+543, are
interesting in that a low-luminosity, quasi-steady, X-ray component
may be observed. Study of 2A1704—241, the first normal M-giant
emitting system, was completed.

Basic data processing, support of the Guest Observer Program,
and varied scientific programs are the focus of the division’s HEAO-2
(Einstein Observatory) research. Completion of a first-pass analysis
of all Einstein data led to revision of the aspect solution and the
High Resolution Imaging (ur1) processing software, and resulted

140 / Smithsonian Year 1982
in an improvement in source-position accuracy to about 3.3 sec
at 90 percent confidence, as compared with the earlier estimated
error of 10 sec.

In support of the Einstein Guest Observer Program, division data
aides and scientists provided both data and programming assistance
to visiting researchers, who, last year, numbered more than 90.

Among the results of the Einstein investigations were the fol-
lowing: discovery of a new class of X-ray-emitting galaxies—
“dull” galaxies, otherwise optically undistinguished; development
of a classification scheme for galaxies based on X-ray emission,
optical morphology, and radio properties; statistical studies of
complete samples of quasi-stellar objects (Qsos); evidence for
evolution of gso X-ray luminosity; correlation of X-ray and optical
properties of gsos; determination of cluster X-ray luminosity func-
tion; extension of cluster classification schemes; the discovery of
an X-ray pulsar in the supernova remnant MsH 15-5(2); and mass
estimates of supernova progenitor stars.

Studies of solar and stellar coronal plasmas continued to focus
on understanding the physics of coronal formation. Substantial
progress was achieved in two areas: the first involved observational
tests of coronal heating, using Skylab and related solar data, and
the second, Einstein data analysis and interpretation of stellar
X-ray emission, with particular attention to magnetic-field-related
processes. Significant advances were also made in studies of plasma
and magnetohydrodynamic processes.

OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY

Research in optical and infrared astronomy concentrated on extra-
galactic and galactic astronomy, with special emphasis on studies
of clusters of galaxies, active galactic nuclei, redshift surveys, star
clusters, and the formation and evolution of stars. In support of
research throughout the Center, the division operated the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, the site
of the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), a joint project with the
University of Arizona.

This year, major improvements were made in the performance
of the mmt, which now meets or exceeds all the original design
specifications. Automatic alignment and tracking are now accom-
plished at the final combined focal plane. The mount works excep-

Science / 141
tionally well, with absolute pointing better than one arc second
and very smooth tracking. The median image size was measured
to be better than one arc second Fwum, which confirmed the earlier
reports of excellent seeing. The telescopes at the Whipple Observa-
tory also reached new heights of productivity in support of dozens
of research programs, and division efforts to develop and refine
the instruments, detectors, and software systems continued. Of
particular note was the establishment of a new Image Processing
Facility in Cambridge.

In extragalactic astronomy, noteworthy work on several clusters
of galaxies studied in detail showed that, in general, the structure
and kinematics are more complicated than previous dynamical
studies have admitted. However, select cases of binary clusters
were shown to yield significant information about their dynamical
evolution. The mrt played an essential role in this research.

Various aspects of active galaxies were investigated. International
Ultraviolet Explorer observations were used to study galaxies that
have undergone recent bursts of star formation. The mmr Infrared
Photometer and Circular Variable Filter were utilized to observe
asos where optical lines of interest have been redshifted into the
infrared. Examples of interacting galaxies and their relationship to
Qsos were examined, and, by use of the mmr, a survey of faint
Qsos was carried out.

The first stage of the cra Redshift Survey was completed, and
work began on two major extensions. In collaboration with the
Observatorio Nacional, a copy of the Z-machine was built and
put into operation in Brazil, which will allow the extension of the
Redshift Survey to the Southern Hemisphere.

The kinematics of the globular clusters in M31 were surveyed
with the mnt; and a slight rotation in the cluster system as a whole
was found. Several aspects of open clusters were also studied: faint
photometry of the lower main sequence in the Hyades and Pleiades
showed that the cluster ages derived from the turn-on-point dis-
agree with those from the turn-off-point by a large factor. Newly
developed techniques for measuring accurate radial velocities of
faint stars were used for a variety of projects, including a new
convergent point solution for the Hyades and direct measurements
of the kinematics of open clusters. Binaries were found to be a
frequent phenomenon.

142 / Smithsonian Year 1982
During 1982, major improvements were made in the performance of sao’s
Multiple Mirror Telescope at the Whipple Observatory, Mt. Hopkins,
Arizona.

This image of an edge-on spiral galaxy shows several independent struc-
tures: a bright nucleus, the thin inner disk of stars, and a larger envel-
oping halo of material. Current theory suggests that spiral galaxies may be
stabilized by such massive haloes of dark material “invisible” to normal
instrumentation.

Infrared observations from the ground, the nasa Kuiper Air-
borne Observatory, and from high-altitude balloons were used for
imaging and spectroscopy of astronomical objects, such as regicns
of star formation and the galactic center, and high-resolution
spectroscopy of the earth’s atmosphere.

Division scientists also operated a balloon-borne telescope that
produced a high-resolution, far-infrared map of a large area
(1° X 4°) of the galactic center. Finally, work on a major project,
the Helium-Cooled Infrared Telescope on Spacelab 2 continued;
the experiment is scheduled to fly aboard the Space Shuttle in 1984.

PLANETARY SCIENCES

Members of the Planetary Sciences Division carry out all three of
the traditional forms of scientific activity: they study the planets
by observational, theoretical, and laboratory techniques.

This past year, the observational program centered on the Oak
Ridge Observatory (formerly Agassiz Station) in Harvard, Massa-
chusetts. With its 61-inch reflector, this facility is ideally suited to
provide the astrometric observations needed to calculate the orbital
elements of small bodies—comets and asteroids, for example—in
the solar system, which require the determination of positions on
a number of different nights. The Oak Ridge program of regular
observation of newly discovered, unusual, and faint minor planets
and comets is operated closely with the International Astronomical
Union’s Minor Planet Center and Central Telegram Bureau (di-
rected by a division member). These resources seek to verify obser-
vations, compute orbital elements, and disseminate, on a timely
basis, information to astronomers worldwide.

Observational studies were also carried out by division scientists
who participated as members of the imaging team on the Voyager
mission. The group found the ring system of Saturn to be vastly
more complex than had been imagined.

Theoretical studies of planetary bodies and comets included an
investigation of the effect of decay on the motions and cohesive-
ness of comet nuclei and the examination of the dynamics of
postulated double comets. Recent improvements in the accuracy of
models of the primitive solar nebula have contributed to under-
standing of the origin of refractory inclusions and chondrules in
meteorites. Efforts to relate the long-term dynamical behavior of

144 / Smithsonian Year 1982
orbiting objects (such as the material in Saturn’s rings) to mass
distributions continued.

The laboratory approach to solar system science is employed
by application of the techniques of mineralogy and petrology to
studies of the detailed properties of meteorites and lunar samples.
Meteorites contain a cryptic record of events and processes asso-
ciated with the origin of the solar system, and even presolar
system history. Lunar samples contain an equally cryptic record
of the earliest internal evolution of a small planet. Research
centered on the origin of refractory inclusions in carbonaceous
chondrites: the major question being explored is whether these
materials represent high-temperature condensates from nebular
gas or residues of distilled interstellar dust.

Particular attention was also given to the history of the lunar
highlands crust. A division member leads a consortium in studying
the properties of constituents of highlands breccia 67015; early
findings suggested an unexpectedly complex geology at the Apollo
16 site.

Measurements of *’Ar produced in potassium as a function of
depth at the Homestake Mine were carried out. These measure-
ments will provide a value for the cosmic-ray background of the
chlorine solar neutrino detector, and a decay-mode independent
half-life for proton decay. Findings should contribute to an under-
standing of the highly complex interior of the sun.

RADIO AND GEOASTRONOMY

The Radio and Geoastronomy Division conducted studies in radio
astronomy, aeronomy, and geophysics, as well as research and
development programs in maser technology. Division members
operated a satellite laser tracking network and a radio astronomy
facility near Fort Davis, Texas, where a Very Long Baseline Inter-
ferometry (vLBI) station is also located. During the year, the Fort
Davis installation was renamed the George R. Agassiz Station.
Visi research focused on several areas. Using long-period map-
ping of proper motions of interstellar maser sources, statistical
parallaxes were measured for a number of sources. The accuracy
of the techniques has been advanced to about 10 microarcseconds.
The first millimeter-wavelength visi observations of extragalactic
sources were performed. Data on NGc 1275 at 3.3-millimeter wave-

Science / 145
length revealed a very compact component, 0.1 milliarcsecond in
size, which probably produces the observed X-ray emission by
inverse Compton scattering.

In other programs, the Very Large Array (vLA) or viB1 method
was used to study M87, compact H II regions, OH maser sources,
BL Lac objects, and hydrogen in planetary nebulae. The group
also operated a fringe verification procedure during viB1 observa-
tional programs.

Division members also carried out a project to measure ozone
in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere by using a ground-based
millimeter-wave technique.

Studies of the earth’s thermosphere based on data from satellite-
borne mass spectrometers continued. Data from the Esro 4 and
S3-1 satellites were augmented by those from the Atmosphere
Explorer-C satellite, which provided needed information for greater
heights. The major emphasis was on the geomagnetic variation
and its relation to the heat sources and the dynamics of the
disturbed thermosphere. An important result was the identification
of the effects of winds and waves generated by the heat input
and the successful modeling of the time lag and the persistence of
disturbance.

Work on problems of orbital dynamics included a study of the
effects of atmospheric drag in relation to strategies for the con-
struction of a large space platform and related investigation of
the secular effects associated with the critical inclination and
harmonic resonance.

Sao’s hydrogen maser group continued their maser research
and experiments using ultra-stable clocks. Three vic-11 series
masers were built; one was delivered to the Tokyo Astronomical
Observatory and two others were constructed for the Nasa Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. Two additional masers are under construc-
tion for the U.S. Naval Observatory. Experimental work is under
way with cryogenically cooled masers to investigate hydrogen
collision effects on wall surfaces coated with freezing gases of
various types and to demonstrate stability data at the 10~*® level
for time intervals between one minute and one hour.

The simulation of Doppler detection of pulsed low-frequency
gravitational waves using clocks and a multi-link Doppler sys-
tem in a deep-space probe was completed. With today’s precise

146 / Smithsonian Year 1982
timing and space-tracking technology, it is possible to detect
pulses at the 10~** level in the Doppler signatures. These gravita-
tional pulses are thought to originate in the collapse of super-
massive black holes of about 107 solar masses, which are believed
to exist at the core of some galaxies. This is the first feasible
system developed that could detect such waves.

The division continued operation of a satellite laser-tracking
network, which provided routine laser-tracking coverage for geo-
physical research conducted at sao and other research organi-
zations in the U.S. and abroad. In addition to tracking, five-day
mean pole positions were provided to the scientific community on
a routine basis. During the year, the laser-tracking stations were
closed in Natal, Brazil, Orroral Valley, Australia, and Mt. Hop-
kins, Arizona. Arrangements were made to relocate the laser from
Natal to Matera, Italy, under a joint program with the Consiglio
Nazionale delle Richerche. The network also completed the upgrad-
ing of the Arequipa, Peru, laser to improve range accuracy from
10 cm to 3-5 cm.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS

Research programs in solar and stellar physics focused on various
problems concerned with stellar activity and mass loss and the
behavior of hot plasmas in the universe. The pursuit of the “solar-
stellar connection” in both observational and theoretical areas
provided an important theme. Division scientists recognize that
phenomena long known to occur on the sun are present, often in
extreme form, in stars as well; and study of the physics of the
sun provides an on-going framework to test against other objects
in the universe.

Experimental programs in the division included development of
speckle imaging techniques, which can be applied both to the solar
fine structure and to extended stellar atmospheres. The rocket
coronagraph program, to measure the solar atmosphere in the
acceleration region of the solar wind, provided a unique spectro-
scopic tool for use in probing the plasma characteristics and
energy requirements of the solar wind. A version of this instru-
ment is now planned for development on a Shuttle mission in
1985. Complementary theoretical studies under the Langley—Abbot
Program of the Smithsonian Institution assessed the physical

Science / 147
implications of such observations for both solar and stellar winds
and mass loss.

Research in stellar activity was carried out by using a variety of
observational and theoretical techniques. The collaborative program
between Smithsonian and Mt. Wilson observatories to monitor
the long-term variability of the flux in the Ca II emission lines
yielded rich insight into the presence and character of stellar
activity cycles. Complementary measures of line profiles, spectro-
scopic rotation rates, and magnetic fields in stellar atmospheres—
all fundamental parameters of activity—are also under way at the
Whipple Observatory. Measurements of high-temperature plasmas
in stars were obtained by using the HEAo-2 (Einstein Observatory)
and the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellites. On-going
theoretical calculations of radiative processes in optically thick
chromospheric emission lines and other features in static and
expanding solar and stellar atmospheres enabled the requirements
to be defined for the energy balance in cool atmospheres.

The wealth of new quantitative spectroscopic measures has
demanded, and will continue to require, thorough understanding
of atomic, ionic, and molecular behavior. Studies of plasma pro-
cesses at high temperature and, in particular, the spectroscopic
response of hot gases to conditions of nonequilibrium contributed
valuable insights to all spectroscopic—optical, ultraviolet, or
X-ray—measurements. In addition, models of nonradiative shocks
and their observable consequences can be predicted to infer
characteristics of the shock itself. Application of such studies can
be found not only in solar or stellar atmospheres, but also in
the observation of gaseous interstellar remnants left from super-
nova explosions or Herbig—Haro objects. Achievement of a basic
understanding of such processes and their diagnostics directs and
enhances the pursuit of nonequilibrium phenomena in many other
objects.

These interdisciplinary studies generated considerable interest
among astrophysicists, as evidenced by the highly successful
Second Cambridge Workshop on “Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and
the Sun.” This was held in October 1981 at the Center for Astro-
physics, and was supported in part by the Langley—Abbot Program
of the Smithsonian Institution, Smithsonian Astrophysical Obser-
vatory, and Harvard College Observatory. The proceedings were

148 / Smithsonian Year 1982
published in SAO Special Report No. 392, which documents both
invited and contributed papers.

Studies in the history of astronomy, carried out by a division
member, provided a broad perspective on the development of
ideas, thoughts, and style during the early centuries of astronom-
ical research.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS

Valuable progress was made this year in the understanding of
magnetic fields, interstellar clouds, accretion flows and mass
outflows, spiral structure, galaxy formation, radiation processes,
X-ray sources, the clustering of galaxies, convection theory, and
extragalactic radio jets. Research was carried out on a diverse
range of astrophysical phenomena, with theoretical studies often
applied to the support and interpretation of observational data.
The basic studies in stellar and galactic dynamics, stellar and
galactic structures, gravitational theory, radiative transfer, kinetic
theory, hydrodynamics, scattering theory, and cosmology also
continued.

Members of the division contributed significantly to the educa-
tional programs of the observatories and collaborated frequently
with scientists in other institutions as well as with members of
other divisions. Specific research programs addressed the follow-
ing: physics of gamma-ray bursts; supersymmetry theories of the
elementary particles and their applications; various problems in
relativistic cosmology; thermal effects in quasar accretion flows
due to irradiation by the quasar continuum; theoretical study of
magnetic helicity conservation; and investigations of radiative
processes and radiative transfer theory, including the Comptoniza-
tion of X-rays and the escape-probability method for spectral
lines.

In a study of the dynamics of globular clusters, statistical corre-
lations were found between internal dynamical properties of
clusters and their distances from the galactic center. Attempts to
reconcile the observed properties with theoretical models of dy-
namical evolution are under way.

A numerical simulation demonstrated that the accretion of
lunar-sized planetesimals is a plausible mechanism for the forma-
tion of the earth. It was shown that “secondary infall’’ was not a

Science / 149
viable mechanism for forming the shallow-density-profile galactic
halos.

A systematic study of a number of clusters of galaxies has
begun. So far, the focus has been on clumpy systems, which are,
in a sense, dynamically young. N-body models indicated that
these systems, if bound, will eventually have a smooth, centrally
condensed galaxy distribution.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

The tropics have always interested biologists, largely because
diversity of tropical life is so immense, and the different kinds of
tropical organisms make their living in such varied and occasionally
bizarre ways, and because the plants and animals that have sur-
vived in this diverse world are so precisely adapted to their ways
of life. Here the ecologist can study the mechanisms maintaining
the balance of nature in the most complex of natural communities,
while the morphologist and behaviorist find ample opportunity for
the comparisons that are as essential now to understanding biology
as they were in Darwin’s time, or Aristotle’s. Understanding
tropical biology, however, has taken on a new urgency: why are
natural communities in the tropics so lush, while small farms here
can be devoured by pests after only a few harvests, and large-scale
farming often leads to land with the color, texture, and fertility of
a brick? How can the diversity of life recover from the growing
human onslaught? These questions cannot be answered fully by
research explicitly directed to the purpose. Unforeseeable discov-
eries—by curious naturalists interested in plants and animals for
their own sake—will offer essential leads to practical problems of
crucial importance.

To this end, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)
maintains a full-time resident staff of trained scientists, many of
whom are engaged in long-term studies of tropical organisms. STRI
is equipped with modern facilities, an excellent up-to-date library
(for which a new building is in progress), and a full supporting
staff. Among its facilities is a field station in the 4,200-hectare

150 / Smithsonian Year 1982

place, but it actually teems with activity. A full-time residential staff of scientists are

Barro Colorado Nature Monument. This is an easily accessible
reserve of tropical forest, where a “growing house” for plant
experiments—complete with a plant physiology laboratory—was
completed in November 1981. There are also marine stations,
where one can study the contrasting communities on the two sides
of an isthmus which split the oceans only three million years ago.

Stri offers short-term and 12-month fellowships to citizens of
all countries and maintains a vigorous program of training for
young scientists from tropical countries, capitalizing on their life-
time residence in, and first-hand knowledge of tropical regions. In
the current fiscal year, EXXON grants supported thirty such stu-
dents from Panama, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru.
Moreover, student assistants from tropical countries have collab-
orated in a great variety of staff projects, ranging from the pollina-
tion biology of tropical flowers, to the breeding of pelicans. For
many of these students, str1 represents an introduction to an active
research community and an acquaintance with fellow research
scientists—both provide crucial career impetus. In addition, a
student on Barro Colorado can build on sixty years of previous
research; the marine stations have also amassed an impressive
amount of background information.

For centuries scientific knowledge of tropical nature was largely
based on fragmentary studies conducted by travelers and expatri-
ates, many of them amateurs. Even today, the majority of scien-
tists ranked as experts in tropical biology can spend only a few
weeks of the year actually working in the tropics. Piecemeal,
sporadic study inevitably fails to comprehend the long cycles and
rare events that are so often the essence of tropical adaptations.
Str1 provides opportunities for long-term research, which few
institutions can match.

Stephen Hubbell, who has just joined the stri staff on an inter-
mittent appointment, and Robin Foster, a stri research associate,
have just finished mapping half a square kilometer of forest on the
“plateau” of Barro Colorado Island (scr). This project has required
fifteen man-years of work so far, involving students from the U.S.,
Panama, and Mexico.

Since each kind of tree has its own pests and diseases, it has
long been thought that trees of a single kind, which are crowded
too closely together (or more especially, their seeds and seedlings),

152 / Smithsonian Year 1982
are particularly liable to become extinct. Since disease is supposedly
most rampant in the tropics, and insect pests most voracious there,
the diversity of tropical trees has been attributed largely to such
“penalties of abundance.” Hubbell and Foster hope to infer what
factors maintain tropical tree diversity from the patterns of dis-
tribution of individual species (the extent to which a species occurs
in “clumps,” and the degree to which it is confined to particular
topography or soil) and the manners in which trees of different
species are commingled. The plot will be resurveyed at intervals
to assess growth, mortality, and recruitment of the different species.

Over the years many students on sci have studied features of
reproduction in trees, especially how seed dispersal affects repro-
duction success. Is there a penalty for overabundance? What form
does it take? Mapped plots make such studies much easier.

David Hamill, a graduate student from the University of Iowa,
has mapped the distribution of Ocotea skutchii seedlings and sap-
lings around various mature trees of this species on Hubbell’s
mapped plot and is monitoring their survival and growth. A
fungus, unique to the species, causes lesions on all the saplings,
girdling the stems of many and killing those which cannot sprout
from below the wound. Seedlings far away from the parent plant
have twice as good a chance of living three years as those living
closer to it; this differential survival is not enough to even out the
distribution of these trees.

Victoria Sork, of Washington University, finds that Gustavia
superba, a subcanopy tree, is much rarer in the old forest of Hub-
bell’s mapped plot and has many fewer young per adult than in
Gerald Lang’s plot of young forest on BcI—or in even younger
forests on the nearby mainland. Sork is monitoring seed production,
prospects of germination, and seedling survival in these three plots
to see if these factors explain the differences. She is also comparing
the demography of these plants on sci, which abounds in fruit-
and seed-eating mammals, and on the mainland, where such an-
imals are much rarer, to see what difference the animals make.

Carol Augspurger, of the University of Illinois, is mapping seed
and seedling “shadows” for wind-dispersed trees of several differ-
ent species. Fungi, perhaps related to the Irish potato blight, attack
seedlings of many of these species—especially seedlings that are
densely crowded in the shade. In some species, only seedlings in

Science / 153
“light gaps,” opened by large fallen trees, can survive. Augspurger
is trying to learn more about how these diseases are communicated
and to determine the length of time that infectious spores last in
the soil.

Henry Howe, of the University of Iowa, for the fourth year, is
continuing his study of reproduction in Virola (wild nutmeg),
monitoring the fruit and flower production of selected trees, the
species eating and dispersing the fruit, and the proportion of fruit
dispersed. He and his student, Eugene Schupp, are setting out
fruit at different distances from parent trees and find that the pros-
pects of fruit placed far from the parent are much more promising.

Eugene Schupp is also beginning a study of flowering, fruiting,
the consumption of flowers or green fruit by natural enemies, fruit
dispersal, and seedling germination and survival in an understory
shrub, Faramea occidentale, which flowers much more heavily
every second year. His study will last three years.

These studies are backed by a long-term monitoring program
sponsored by the Environmental Sciences Program (Esp) of the
Smithsonian Institution, which—along with the accumulated re-
sults of individual research—provides a large and profound fund
of background information. This increases the value of shorter-
term studies manyfold and provides data on climatic and biotic
patterns, which are of fundamental value in themselves.

Dr. Donald Windsor, staff coordinator of environmental moni-
toring on sci, has become an expert in data-processing and the
assessment of the dynamics of the forest community. He reports
that environmental monitoring in str1 study areas (e.g., Gamboa
and Gatun) dates from the French era of Panama Canal construc-
tion, with the earliest records in 1859. At the present time, con-
tinuous records of rainfall, soil moisture, and sediment and runoff
volume in the Lutz ravine of scr enable scientists to estimate rates
of erosion and water retention in a known area of forest, for com-
parison with that of nearby cleared plots in the Panama Canal
Area.

Measurements of windspeed, temperature, and of light intensity
and spectral quality at different levels in the forest are obtained
from instruments mounted on “The Tower,” a 138-foot structure,
which pierces the canopy near the Lutz ravine. The instruments
provide data for estimating the input of solar energy to the forest,

154 / Smithsonian Year 1982
the quality of light available for different photosynthetic pathways,
and the rate of water loss by evaporation from the forest as a
whole. Knowledge of the “hydrologic budget” is supplemented by
information on dissolved nutrients passing out of the watershed
through the Lutz-ravine weir.

Douglas Rocha, whose meticulous attention to the reading and
maintenance of monitoring equipment assures the accuracy of this
information, also collaborates with the Smithsonian’s Radiation
Biology Laboratory and the Skin and Cancer Hospital of Phila-
delphia in providing specialized data on tropical light conditions
that affect human health.

Bonifacio de Leon is in his eighth year of following the phenolo-
gies of Bcr trees—their annual patterns of leaf, flower, and fruit
production—which are basic to understanding the movements and
reproductive cycles of numerous forest animals.

Seed dispersers need to eat. The factors governing the timing
and amount of fruit produced by different kinds of trees is decisive
to the livelihood of a whole host of forest animals.

Dipteryx trees normally fruit at the end of the late rainy-season
fruit famine, but, like many other trees that flower in response to
the onset of the rainy season, they often fruit poorly, if at all,
after a wet dry season. William Glanz, of the University of Maine,
finds that squirrels start mating much later in the year and pro-
duce far fewer young when Dipteryx fruit is in short supply. He
has also been censusing mammals, and finds that the numbers of
squirrels and agoutis have fallen sharply the last two years, perhaps
because of the fruit shortages caused by the wet dry season of
1980 and 1981.

Pacas are fruit-eaters of the forest floor, comparable to the
mouse deer of the Old World tropics, and perhaps the favorite
neotropical game animal. Mickey Marcus, a str short-term fellow
from the University of Maine, has begun a radio-tracking study
of pacas to see how their behavior and feeding habits change
during the onset of the autumnal fruit shortage. He has also begun
a live-trapping survey, comparable to that completed by the Esp
three years ago, to estimate the density of pacas and other fru-
givorous mammals in the Lutz catchment.

dispersed by one or two “specialists,” while others had far more
general appeal.

Allen Herre collaborated in a study on the factors affecting pol-
lination success in fig trees: are more isolated trees, or those trees
fruiting at certain times of year, likely to have fewer seeds ferti-
lized?

Charles Handley is continuing his studies of fig-eating bat
populations and their responses to changes in fig production. He
is also mapping the fig trees on various parts of BcI to assess the
amount of food available. Figs are important to bats because, un-
like most fruits, they are available all year long. This may be
related to their pollination system.

Other animals respond to seasonal changes in the supply of
different kinds of food. Young iguanas, for instance, hatch from
their eggs at the onset of the rainy season when flowers and new
leaves are most abundant. Stanley Rand and his collaborators have
been marking the adult females which congregate each February
at various nesting sites around scr to lay their eggs, radio-tracking
a few to learn how far they travel after nesting. Brian Bock is
monitoring how many young emerge and where they go. Iguanas
are a favored game animal in Panama, and Rand now understands
enough of their demography to advise the joint STRI/Government
of Panama project concerned with increasing the number of iguanas
available for cropping. Kathy Troyer continued her work on when
and how young iguanas acquire the “gut flora” they need to digest
mature leaves and has also compared the ways young and adult
iguanas try to control their body temperatures.

Henk Wolda now has eight years of data on fluctuations of leaf-
hoppers and some other insects caught at light traps on Barro
Colorado Island. Such insects tend to be most abundant at the
beginning of the rainy season, when new leaves are most preva-
lent, but the populations of the different insect species change
irregularly from year to year, fluctuating quite as much over the
long-term in the tropics as in the temperate zone. Wolda is also
studying an endomychid beetle, Stenotarsus rotundus. During the
last four years, 30,000 or more of these beetles have aggregated
to diapause for ten months of the year on a single palm tree, dis-
persing to feed for the first two months of the rainy season. As
these beetles eat fungi—which are presumably most abundant late

Science / 157
in the rainy season—their seasonal rhythm is an extraordinary
mystery.

Seasonal rhythms in leaf-eating insects cause seasonal rhythms
in the breeding of the birds that eat them. Judy Gradwohl and
Russell Greenberg of the National Zoo are continuing their studies
of how year-to-year variations in survival and reproduction of
understory antwrens is affected by change in the supply of insects
the antwrens eat.

At the beginning of the rainy season, the animals that break
down the leaf litter awake to feed and reproduce, as do the insects
that eat them, and as do the small lizards that eat the predatory
arthropods. Robin Andrews, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, and Stanley Rand are continuing to census the
small lizard Anolis limifrons on selected plcts for the tenth con-
secutive year.

Long-term research also plays a major role in stri’s marine
program. On the reef flat at Galeta, srri’s Caribbean marine lab-
oratory, John Cubit, Michael Vassar, Judith Connor, and others
are continuing a monitoring program for the esp. They are follow-
ing rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, tidal level
and salinity, sea-urchin populations, and the proportions of the
various zones of the reef covered by each principal kind of alga.
Caribbean tides are slight and erratic. About twice a year—some-
times more often—calm weather, low tides, and lack of cloud-cover
exposes the reef flat to a merciless sun, devastating the reef-flat
community. Fifty square meters of the reef have been continuously
irrigated by seawater for the past sixteen months to compare its
community with those of neighboring sectors subject to exposures.

As part of John Cubit and James Norris’s studies of algal com-
munities at Galeta, Judith Connor has followed the seasonal
rhythms of algal reproduction on the reef flat. The rhythm of two
species at the top of the reef flat and two subtidal species peak
during the dry season; other species at the seaward edge of the
flat reproduce all year long.

As part of John Cubit and Walter Adey’s study of algal produc-
tion, Peter Griffith estimates photosynthesis and respiration by
monitoring the depth and speed of water moving across the reef
flat, and the amount of oxygen it acquires (if by day) or loses (if
by night) during its crossing. This is the first time reef production

158 / Smithsonian Year 1982
has been monitored on a twenty-four-hour basis. Griffith finds that
respiration rate varies through the night; this contradicts the
assumption under which marine productivity is usually calculated.

Stephen Garrity, a stR1 predoctoral fellow, is comparing the
effects on rocky shore snails of the strong tidal cycle on the Pacific
side—where even the lowest tides rarely cause mass mortality—
with those of the unpredictable lows on the Caribbean side—which
can be as devastating on rocky shores as on reef flats. More gen-
erally, he is following how snails respond to the risks of life on
tropical shores.

In 1976, a great earthquake in the Darien threw whole hillsides
into the sea, creating half a mile and more of new rocky shore in
places, and vast expanses of bare earth. Nancy Garwood has been
monitoring the revegetation of the land, while John Cubit, Sally
Levings, and Stephen Garrity have been monitoring the recovery
on the coast. Ten months after the quake, the rocks were green
with leafy algae; in another year, littorinids, thin-shelled limpets,
and herds of isopods had devoured those algae. Later, patches of
crustose algae and—nearer high tide—velvety. patches of algal
turf began to spread, and heavier-shelled herbivorous snails waxed
more prevalent. Only in 1982 did populations of predatory snails
really attain substantial levels, but they are still low.

Olga Linares has continued her studies of the Diola people of
Senegal, who live in an area that used to average over 1,500 mm
of rain a year. The famous Sahelian drought has had great effects
further south: last year, the Diola lands received 700 mm, and
annual rainfall has never exceeded 1,500 mm during the past ten
years. The northern Diola are now growing millet and sorghum
instead of rice, and are also raising peanuts as a cash crop. The
drought has caused a shift to a male-dominated agriculture, which
requires plows and fertilizer because larger areas have to be cullti-
vated, leaving land fallow for far shorter periods.

Ross Robertson has begun a study of what happens to reef fish
populations around the Great Barrier Reef when crown-of-thorns
starfish devastate the corals on their reef. This study will entail
yearly visits to Australia. And Robertson has found that it is
possible to study the daily feeding rhythms of sharks by watching
them from a helium balloon. This study will complement his
research on the daily rhythms of feeding and reproduction in reef

Science / 159
fish of the San Blas Islands, where he wishes to know why differ-
ent kinds of fish time their activities as they do. On the San Blas,
he has also been examining the lunar periodicity of damselfish
spawning and recruitment, and seasonal and year-to-year variation
in settlement at various reefs of other kinds of fish.

Most of the pelicans of tropical America breed within thirty
miles of the Pacific mouth of the Panama Canal. Gene Montgom-
ery has found that their breeding is intimately tied to dry-season
upwelling in the Bay of Panama, which brings the schools of fish
they eat near the water surface. This year the upwelling failed,
and the pelicans produced very few young.

Long-term research sometimes provides the opportunity for
spectacular natural experiments. David Roubik, who had been
studying the ecology of bees on Barro Colorado Island and at many
mainland sites for the past three years, was prepared for the day
when Africanized bees invaded from South America. In July 1982,
the killer bees finally reached Barro Colorado Island, and Roubik
initiated a whole array of studies to assess the impact of these
invaders on local bee communities, and on the fruit set of bee-
pollinated plants, such as the tree Luehea seemanii.

Roubik and Leslie Johnson, of the University of Iowa, have been
studying how stingless bees compete for food. The bees are rather
like ants: if two species encounter each other over food, the more
aggressive wins, but less aggressive species find much food over-
looked by their competitors. James Ackerman, a former stri pre-
doctoral fellow, and Roubik monitored seasonal and year-to-year
changes in the abundance of orchid bees (euglossine) at various
sites by attracting them with scents. Robert Schmalzel, Wilson
Devia, and Enrique Moreno have been preparing a “pollen flora”
of Barro Colorado Island, so that one may identify the flowers a
bee has visited from the pollen it is carrying. Allison Snow, Lucinda
McDade, and others have studied the relation between pollinator
visits and the amount of fruit set.

Studies of the variety and precision of adaptation also play a
vital role in str1 research. Martin Moynihan has completed a de-
tailed study, which has just appeared as a book of communication
in the Caribbean reef squid Sepioteuthis. Most animals have be-
tween ten and forty behavioral “displays.” This squid has many
more, mostly color changes, which are used in intricate combina-

160 / Smithsonian Year 1982
tions. Moynihan analyzed the function and the “linguistics” of
these displays and, since then, he has done briefer comparative
studies of squid at Palau and elsewhere in the tropics to test the
generality of his conclusions.

Leonard Freed, a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow, is comparing
southern housewrens with their northern counterparts, whose
ecology he studied earlier. The housewrens of Panama are bigger
and have a long breeding season. Few of the wrens in Panama
breed in a given year, but those that do seem not to be limited by
the availability of food. They nest in holes, as do wasps, which
may take up enough of the suitable nest-holes to limit the wren
population. Dr. Bao-Lai Zheng, from Kunming, China, has just
begun a two-year study of nesting habits and parental care in
trogons and motmots, which nest in burrows in the ground or in
great termite nests.

Mark Denny has been studying how a coral’s shape, the prop-
erties of the calcium carbonate in its skeleton, and its position
relative to other corals, enable it to resist destruction by the surf.
Urchins and parrotfish can also “erode” corals, as can animals that
bore into them. Harilaos Lessios is asking how these enemies con-
trol coral distribution, and what defenses corals have against them,
by way of shape, regenerative capacity of coral tissue (an effective
shield against many borers), and capacity to grow faster than their
enemies erode them. Peter Glynn has found that shrimps and crabs
that live inside the branching coral Pocillopora defend it against
crown-of-thorns starfish, which would otherwise devour it com-
pletely. Even in the absence of such enemies, the crustacean sym-
bionts seem essential to the health of their corals. Glynn and
Gerard Wellington have finished a book on the reefs of the
Galapagos.

Hermit crabs need snail shells as armor against predators, and
their numbers are sometimes limited by the availability of such
shells. This has led Thomas Spight, a Smithsonian postdoctoral
fellow, to study the factors governing the availability of snail
shells to hermit crabs, which has led him to study the variation in
the abundance, diversity, and species composition of intertidal
snails from place to place on the cobbly shores near the Pacific
mouth of the Panama Canal.

Neal Smith has just obtained the first evidence that migrating

Science / 161
hawks deliberately fly inside clouds. Hawks at the base of a cloud
receive a constant lift, like sailplanes, which can travel forty miles
along such a “cloud street’”’ without changing altitude. This habit
can save essential energy during migration, which is a strenuous
business.

George Bartholomew, of the University of California at Los
Angeles, and M. C. Barnhardt, his student, returned to Barro
Colorado to study insect physiology. On earlier trips, Bartholomew
studied large insects that had to warm up quite substantially before
flying. This time, he studied a large cicada that can fly away
immediately when disturbed, although it warms up substantially
while flying. He also showed that, when the cicada is flying, its
abdomen has to be actively ventilated to supply enough oxygen
for its metabolism; simple diffusion does not supply enough.

William Eberhard has continued his research on measuring the
prey available to orb-weaving spiders. Catherine Craig, a Smith-
sonian predoctoral fellow, has been comparing the types of webs
best suited to catching insects that fly in very irregular, jagged
paths, with those suited to catching insects that fly more directly
from one place to another.

The newly emerging leaves of many understory plants in the
mature forest of Barro Colorado are pink or white, while canopy
leaves are green from the beginning. Phyllis Coley and Thomas
Kursar, Smithsonian postdoctoral fellows, suspect that where there
is little light, it is undesirable to install much “machinery” in a
leaf until it is tough enough to deter herbivores. They are com-
paring changes in toughness, energy content, respiration rate,
chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity, and chance of being
eaten, in young leaves that have been green from the beginning
with those which start out pink or white.

How rapidly does a leaf increase photosynthesis in response to
a passing sunfleck? If light level changes more permanently, how
do old leaves adjust? How does the structure of new leaves reflect
the changed conditions? What are the characteristics of the plants
that invade? To find out, Alan Smith and his associates are using
the Hubbell plot, where both plants and openings in the canopy
are mapped, to learn whether different understory herbs are asso-
ciated with different light levels. They are also chopping down
trees on a mainland site to see how herbs adjust—in both the

162 / Smithsonian Year 1982
short and the long term—to the increased light load, and they are
simulating understory and “gap” light regimes in the growing
house to see how different species respond.

Most plants acquire carbon dioxide by opening the stomates in
their leaves during the daytime; water evaporates (transpires) from
the stomates, pulling up more nutrients-containing water from the
base of the tree, and carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the
open stomates. Desert plants, and epiphytic plants, which lack a
reliable source of water, open their stomates at night when they
can take in carbon dioxide without losing so much water. They
store the carbon dioxide as acid for daytime photosynthesis. Plants
with such “crassulacean acid metabolism” photosynthesize much
more slowly in full sunlight than most plants. Since it has been
thought that the process was more wasteful of light in general, it
was a stunning surprise when William Pfitsch, a short-term fellow
from the University of Washington, and Alan Smith discovered
that the “ground pineapple’ Aechmea magdalenae, which grows
in deep shade, photosynthesizes by crassulacean acid metabolism
even when plenty of water is available, just as does its epiphytic
congener in the forest canopy. Moreover, ground pineapples seem
to fix as much or more carbon per unit dry weight of leaf as
ordinary understory plants.

If their leaves do not transpire water, trees presumably must
expand energy to bring nutrients up to their leaves. Egbert Leigh
is trying to learn, from the forms of its trees, the extent to which
“elfin forest” on fogbound, windy mountaintops—where the
weather can prevent transpiration for weeks at a time—are stunted
by shortage of mineral nutrients. In October 1981, Leigh visited
the Nilgiri Hills in south India to compare the shapes, branching
patterns, and leaf arrangements of trees in a forest that is usually
below the cloudbelt with trees of fogbound forests in Malaysia
and Costa Rica.

A surprising amount of stri research has focused on sexual
selection and related topics. Sexual selection is interesting because
the manners in which males compete for mates can harm the
species. In her study of reproduction and demography of electric
fish in the streams near Gamboa, Mary Hagedorn finds that the
males signal the females electrically, and these signals also seem
to attract the catfish which eat them. Michael Ryan has investi-

Science / 163
gated what characteristics of a male frog’s call most attracts
females, and he and Merlin Tuttle have found that these attractive
characteristics also attract predatory bats. In March 1981, Ryan
and Tuttle assisted the British Broadcasting Corporation in making
a movie of the depredations of bats on frogs.

Robert Warner, of the University of California at Santa Barbara,
and his students have continued their studies of sexual selection
in the blue-headed wrasse, a coral reef fish. Most of these fish are
born female but become male, assuming bright colors, when they
are big enough to compete effectively for mates. The males hold
mating territories side-by-side at one end of the reef, and females
go there to choose their mates. Warner is trying to learn how the
females decide which male to choose.

Before his death in January 1982, Robert Silberglied had shown
that the bright colors and displays of male butterflies—like the
striking signs of male songbirds—serve primarily as warning
signals to rival males, rather than to charm females into mating.

Leslie Johnson has been studying sexual selection in brentid
weevils, where mature males of the species show a fivefold varia-
tion in length. Is absolute size, or size relative to immediate neigh-
bors, more important to a male beetle’s behavior and sexual
success?

Michael Robinson is studying courtship and mating patterns in
preying mantises and in predatory fish, both freshwater and
marine. He wants to learn how each species mates without one
partner being stimulated to eat the other. This is a sequel to his
study of courtship among spiders.

Mary Jane West-Eberhard has revived Darwin’s ideas on the
important role of sexual selection in the origin of species and finds
that those groups whose social system or mating pattern enhances
the effect of sexual selection speciate more rapidly. At the moment,
conservationists are rightly worried about maintaining the existing
diversity of plants and animals, but it will also become essential
to know how new diversity might most easily be generated. It is
strange to consider that characters normally considered harmful to
the species may play an essential role in generating diversity.

When the Isthmus of Panama sundered the oceans three million
years ago, it provided a superb opportunity for studying the origin
of species. The isthmus divided several urchin populations in two;

164 / Smithsonian Year 1982
judging from electrophoresis, Harilaos Lessios believes that the
resulting halves of some populations diverged only very slightly.
He is now checking to see whether the two halves of an ancestral
species now spawn at different times. If so, they have evolved
barriers to interbreeding and have become separate species “quite
by accident.” Some Caribbean urchins, of species whose larvae
must feed in the ocean, have larger eggs than their Pacific counter-
parts. Lessios is seeking to learn whether the lower productivity
of Caribbean waters means larvae need a better head start there.

On November 21, 1981, str1 signed an agreement with the Insti-
tuto de Investigacion Agropecuaria de Panama (1p1apP), the Minis-
terio de Desarrollo Agropecuario (mina), the Direccion Nacional de
Recursos Naturales Renovables (rENARE), and the Centro Agrono-
mico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza, Costa Rica (caTIE) to
promote research in the watershed of the Panama Canal. Str1
scientists will attempt to apply their knowledge obtained from
years of fundamental research to the development of a pilot project
of alternative agricultural techniques, compatible with the mainte-
nance of forest cover.

In a meeting held June 14, 1982, which was attended by Adela
Gomez and David Roubik, stri closed its Cali field station after
more than ten years. Under the terms of a new agreement with the
Instituto Vallecauno de Investigaciones Cientificas (INCIVA), STRI
will have reserved laboratory and dormitory facilities in the re-
cently renovated Museum of Natural Sciences. Stri-sponsored
investigators and students wishing to conduct studies in the Cauca
Valley of Colombia will be able to continue to do so under this
new agreement.

In June, renovation of a building in the Naos Island Marine
laboratory complex was completed for use by the University of
Panama. The official inauguration of the joint STRI/University of
Panama (Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia) Marine
Laboratory at Naos Island took place on June 24. In attendance
were high officials of the Panama government, the University of
Panama, and stri. Opening remarks were given by Dr. Ceferino
Sanchez, Rector of the University of Panama.

CHARLES BLITZER,
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HISTORY AND ART

Archives of American Art

Of the many forms of historical records, a well-written diary
is among the most sought-after by researchers. Unfortunately,
diaries of superior quality are all too rare, and when one with
significant subject matter and enlightening observations on per-
sons and events does turn up, it is an occasion for celebration.
This year the Archives of American Art (AAA) acquired four, all
of substantial merit, and one a truly distinguished example of
the genre.

The most extensive diary was kept by the nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century painter and printmaker James D. Smillie. It
consists of forty-five small, leather-bound volumes whose entries
describe Smillie’s daily life in an unbroken sequence from 1865
to 1909. Since each page represents a single day, the substantive
material is necessarily spare, but the accumulation of detail, the
sheer span of time covered, and the innumerable references to
New York’s artists, art activities, and art organizations make this
journal an invaluable source of information. It is especially useful
for determining or confirming dates and the makeup of the various
circles and factions in which Smillie moved. There are also some
unflattering comments on contemporary notable figures: ‘“Decem-
ber 1, 1882—Went to Wallach’s and saw Mrs. Langtry in Honey-
moon by Tobin—a tolerably well written play with intolerably
stupid plot. Mrs. L. is not a particularly good looking woman—had

Of the four diaries acquired by the aaa during the past year, the most extensive was
kept by James D. Smillie, a painter and printmaker in the 19th and early 20th cen-
turies. This is a self-portrait dated 1900. (Photographer, Joseph Klima, Jr.)
not a good form, is not graceful, does not dress well, and is a
very commonplace actress.”

We usually think of diaries, at least those available for research,
as documents of the more-or-less distant past, but the latest addi-
tion to Charles Seliger’s continuing record of our time brings his
account up to 1981. A New York painter since the early postwar
years, Seliger gives full treatment to his own work and methods,
as well as informative notes on the artists, dealers, and collectors
with whom he is associated. He is a more introspective and more
expansive diarist than Smillie and, writing with the conscious
knowledge that his journal will be consulted by scholars, he offers
occasional recollections of the past and has developed a talent for
setting a scene and filling in the details of conversations and
impressions. As an uninhibited record of the trials, defeats, and
triumphs of an artist in our time, Seliger’s diary is an important
contribution to our awareness of the New York art world over the
past quarter century.

Mrs. Walter Gropius’s diary is rather farther afield. It covers the
mid-1920s when the Bauhaus was already well established as an
international influence in architecture and design under Gropius’s
leadership. The writer is intelligent and cultivated and has a sharp
eye for character. She also has a stong consciousness of the
Bauhaus’s significance, and her descriptions of its difficulties and
achievements are filled with useful insights on its administration
and on some of the major artists associated with it, especially
Feininger, Klee, Kandinsky, Moholy-Nagy, and Albers. The ver-
sion received by the aaa is a typescript translation with accom-
panying notes made many years later.

The diary kept by A. Hyatt Mayor during a three-year sojourn
in England and on the Continent also covers the mid-1920s. Later
a distinguished art historian and authority on prints, Mayor was
then a young, impressionable Rhodes Scholar, whose high spirits,
intellectual curiosity, good connections, and talent for vivid writing
make his diary—more technically a long series of letters written
in journal form to his grandmother—a model of its kind. The
Oxford setting and the personalities encountered there bear a
remarkable resemblance to those of Brideshead Revisited, and
some of his subsequently famous acquaintances—Harold Acton,
W. H. Auden, Kenneth Clark, and Peter Quennell—are dissected

History and Art / 169
with merciless accuracy. He calls on the legendary Lady Ottoline
Morrell and in two brilliantly written passages analyzes the for-
midable charm she exerted on so many personages of the time.
His descriptions of two lengthy visits to I Tatti offer a fully
rounded portrait of Bernard Berenson as a fascinating, overwhelm-
ing, and ultimately wearisome presence.

“He is more than learned, he is wise,” Mayor writes in 1925.
But a year later he offers a more seasoned judgment: “B. B. is
really and truly a wonderful old man but only when he disremem-
bers just what a wonderful old man he is. Mrs. B. B. forever holds
an enlarging mirror before him, as do all the stupid rich people
he has too easily bamboozled to get money.”

One of the chief virtues of the diary as a historical source is
its direct immediacy, a quality shared by personal, professional,
and business letters. Correspondence usually forms a major part
of any collection of records, and although some of it is routine or
perfunctory, much of it is of great value to the scholar. Especially
noteworthy series of letters acquired this year are Clement Green-
berg’s to the Washington painter Gene Davis, Marcel Duchamp’s
to his brother-in-law Jean Crotti, Rockwell Kent’s to Harry Gott-
lieb, and those of Charles Burchfield, Stuart Davis, and Charles
Sheeler to the art collector Edward Wales Root.

The working notes and manuscripts of critics and art historians
are another welcome addition to the aaa. Rich background mate-
rial on American art during the entire postwar period was acquired
this year with the papers of the writers Dore Ashton, John Gruen,
Lucy Lippard, and Irving Sandler. These collections also include a
substantial number of taped interviews with contemporary artists.
Fairfield Porter, best known as a painter, was a perceptive critic
as well, and the final installment of his records reflect that aspect
of his career.

The records of art organizations and institutions are necessary
for institutional histories, and they often throw light on other
subjects as well. Several important groups of such records were
microfilmed by the aaa this year, including the official correspon-
dence of the office of the director of the Cincinnati Art Museum
from 1882 to 1929; seventy-seven scrapbooks covering the activi-
ties of the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, from

170 / Smithsonian Year 1982
the 1890s through the 1960s; the correspondence files of the Hay-
stack Mountain School of Crafts; a portion of the archives of the
San Francisco Art Association; papers relating to the history of
the McNay Art Institute in San Antonio; and a compilation of
material on the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. An
unusually contemporary collection of correspondence, statements,
questionnaires, and papers represents the records of the Wright
State University Visiting Artists Program at Dayton, Ohio, from
1978 to 1982.

In the field of oral history, the Archives of American Art con-
tinued several projects that had been funded in the previous year.
In New York, under a Mark Rothko Foundation grant to pursue
a taping project on Mark Rothko and his times, a number of indi-
viduals who knew Rothko well were interviewed at length, among
them Katherine Kuh, Mrs. Milton Avery, and James Brooks.

Several important grants provided support for a broad inter-
viewing program on contemporary artists in California, including
Billy Al Bengston, Joyce Treiman, Marguerite Wildenhain, and
Helen Lundenburg. The subjects were selected with the help of
the Northern and Southern California Archives Advisory Com-
mittees. Through the efforts of the Detroit office, a grant of thirty-
six thousand dollars was awarded to the aaa by the Warner Com-
munications Corporation to undertake a national video and oral
history program. This fund will be administered over a period of
two years and will focus on individuals critical to contemporary
American art.

The Boston office concentrated this year on notable crafts. Faith
Andrews on Shaker furniture, Tage Frid, a furniture designer, and
the influential silversmith Arthur J. Pulos gave extended interviews
on their respective fields. Leslie Cheek, retired director of the
Virginia Museum, and Marcella Comes, an important figure in the
Washington art community, were taped by the Washington Center.

Only through the use of, and demand for, its holdings can the
AAA determine its success in providing support for scholarly
research. In fiscal year 1982, the bureau’s five regional research
facilities were used 2,900 times by visiting scholars, who consulted
8,600 rolls of microfilm, examined thousands of original manu-
scripts, and read 400 oral-history transcripts. The Archives’ inter-

History and Art / 171
library loan service handled 450 requests for 1,250 rolls of micro-
film. Copies of 480 photographs from the Archives’ collections
were provided to researchers for lectures and publications.

Having received strong encouragement from previous involve-
ment in the organization of symposia, the aaa collaborated this
year with the National Academy of Design and the American
Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a two-day confer-
ence on “Still Life Painting in America.” In addition to papers
given by several authorities in the field, a panel of noted con-
temporary still life painters held a lively discussion on the subject.
In Washington, D.C., the aaa conducted a symposium entitled
“Hidden Virtues Revealed: Some Enquiries into Patterns of Recog-
nition,” which addressed itself to such recently active fields of
inquiry as folk art, nineteenth-century painting in the South, and
documentary photography.

The Archives lent a variety of documents from its holdings to
museum exhibitions: the Institute for Architecture and Urban
Studies in New York borrowed a group of sketches from the col-
lection of Raymond Matheson Hood; Smith College exhibited an
Edwin Ramanzo Elmer sketchbook; the Morris Museum of Arts
and Sciences in Morristown, New Jersey, borrowed sketches and
a manuscript autobiography of Worthington Whittredge; and the
Essex Institute in Salem, Massachusetts used several William
Morris Hunt letters. The Washington Center mounted small exhi-
bitions at its own quarters of art-exhibition-award medals and
selected documents on Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and on John
Reed and Louise Bryant.

The aaa continued the quarterly publication of its Journal, this
year featuring articles on Adelheid Lange Roosevelt, Alfred H.
Barr, Jr., Albert Bierstadt, and Ilya Bolotowsky, and reporting on
the collecting activities of the regional centers.

A substantial quantity of books, articles, and exhibition cata-
logues published in 1982 were based on research at the Archives
of American Art. A few of the more notable ones were on the
Hudson River School painter Worthington Whittredge, Ellen Day
Hale, Childe Hassam, William Morris Hunt, J. Francis Murphy,
Konrad Cramer, Alfred Jacob Miller, Winslow Homer, Mary
Cassatt, Alma Thomas, and the silversmith Arthur J. Stone.

172 / Smithsonian Year 1982
Cooper-Hewitt Museum

Celebrating its fifth year as the National Museum of Design,
Cooper-Hewitt (c-H) continued to offer an ever-growing public a
diversified range of design-related exhibitions.

The major fall exhibition, Writing and Reading, addressed
aspects of the design evolution of the written word, surveying
printing, writing, and the book arts, and included an enormous
variety of objects: papyrus documents, stone inscriptions, stamps,
cylinders, pens, quills, writing sticks, felt-tip markers, typewriters,
a word-processor, wax tablets, skins, desks, examples of callig-
raphy, illuminated manuscripts, bindings, and end papers. The
New York Times art critic, Hilton Kramer, commented, “. . . I
know of few exhibitions that leave the visitor with such a vivid
and revivifying sense of the esthetic component in the life of
civilization. . . .”

Documenting a remarkable achievement in urban design, The
Suburb examined the evolution of this familiar phenomenon from
its sixteenth-century prototypes to the twentieth-century concept
of a “city village.” The exhibition allowed visitors to view the
work and ideas of major architects, H. H. Richardson, Frank Lloyd
Wright, and M. H. Baillie Scott, as well as relatively unknown
architects such as Grosvenor Atterbury, Ernest Flagg, and Electus
Litchfield.

Focused on what is one of the most public of all forms of
graphic art, Magazine Covers: Art for the People surveyed the
graphic, artistic, and social sensibilities of the past century by
presenting a variety of original covers that documented works by
artists, illustrators, and photographers from the mid-nineteenth
century to the present.

Filling the museum with 230 puppets and marionettes, which
spanned 800 years and included everything from pre-Columbian
antiquities to the Muppets, Puppet: Art and Entertainment, a
traveling exhibition sponsored by Exxon Corporation, delighted
over 60,000 visitors during the holiday season. Complementing the
traveling show was a special, smaller exhibition, In Small Stages:
Puppets from the Cooper-Hewitt Collection, which included both

antique and contemporary puppets and marionettes, some of which
were on display for the first time.

As part of a continuing program to document and exhibit the
vast Cooper-Hewitt collections, the following exhibitions were
presented: English Majolica; Button-Button; The American Land-
scape; The Column: Structure and Ornament; Fashion Prints: 125
Years of Style; and Lace. Never before has the museum’s superb
lace collection been viewed so comprehensively; Lace provided the
public with a survey of more than five centuries of Western Euro-
pean lace history.

Americans in Glass, organized by the Leigh Yawkey Woodson
Art Museum, presented contemporary work by seventy-five artists,
suggesting some of the new directions in art glass in the coming
decade.

Hawai'i: The Royal Isles, organized by the Bishop Museum of
Honolulu, opened at the museum in March. This popular show
examined the traditions native to Hawaiian culture as it evolved
over five hundred years without outside influences, and followed
the development that took place after the introduction of Western
culture. Among the ceremonial objects included were feather capes
worn by Hawaiian kings, hand-carved bowls, images, calabashes,
tapa cloths, and shell and ivory ornaments.

Two architectural shows, Architectural Fantasy and Reality:
Drawings from the Architectural Competitions of the Academia
di San Luca in Rome and City Dwellings and Country Houses:
Robert Adam and His Style, were held concurrently during the
winter months. The former was composed of seventy ideal and
exuberant drawings for projects for Rome and included such
artists as Filippo Juvarra, Bernardo Antonio Vittone, Carlo Fon-
tana, and Carlo Marchionni. Robert Adam and His Style was
the first major American exhibition of the work of architect-
designer Adam and his circle. Selected from public and private
collections in Scotland, England, and the United States, this impor-
tant exhibition surveyed Adam’s extraordinary accomplishment
through a selection of more than one hundred drawings, furniture,
silver, ceramics, and decorative objects.

Two summer exhibitions of fiber arts included The Jacquard
Loom: Recent Experiments and Basketry: Tradition in New Form.
The Jacquard Loom, organized by the Rhode Island School of

History and Art / 175
Design, provided an enlightening review of divergent trends in
contemporary weaving as well as insight into textile structure,
design, and production. Basketry included forty examples of work
by ten American artists offering an array of highly individual
pieces, the latest work being done in this medium.

A series of video-taped interviews by Barbaralee Diamonstein,
“Interior Design: The New Freedom,” were shown at the c-H
during the installation of Scandinavian Modern: 1880-1980.
Twelve designers and architects—including Massimo Vignelli,
Angelo Donghia, and Ward Bennett—discussed their approaches
to the problems of contemporary interior design.

Scandinavian Modern: 1880-1980 provided a landmark retro-
spective of design from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and
Sweden. Over 330 examples of ceramics, glass, metalwork, furni-
ture, and textiles were selected from private and public collections
in Scandinavia and the United States, documenting the continuity
and changes that distinguish the Scandinavian tradition in design
and the decorative arts.

In 1982, the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Ser-
vice (SITES) continued to circulate nationwide both Urban Open
Spaces and The Shopping Bag: Portable Graphic Art, and this
year included an exhibition of Matchsafes from the Cooper-Hewitt
Collection. Subways was circulated by the Cooper-Hewitt.

PUBLICATIONS

The on-going Cooper-Hewitt collection handbook series was en-
larged by six volumes: Nineteenth Century American Landscape
Drawings; Buttons; Columns; Fashion Prints; Lace; and Archi-
tectural Drawings. Three more volumes have been commissioned
for the Smithsonian Illustrated Library of Antiques prepared by
the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. Rizzoli published Cities in tabloid
format, and Harry N. Abrams, Inc., published Scandinavian Mod-
ern 1880-1980 in conjunction with the exhibition.

The English publication Architectural Design printed a special
magazine edition on “Suburbs” to coinside with the Cooper-
Hewitt exhibition, and four articles which originally appeared in
The Connoisseur were reprinted as a catalogue to accompany City
Dwellings and Country Houses: Robert Adam and His Style.

An Alphabet Book in the museum’s collection was reprinted for

176 / Smithsonian Year 1982
the occasion of Writing and Reading, and for the museum’s Con-
servation Consultancy Program, a series of bulletins were issued
dealing with specific conservation issues and practices.

COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT

The museum accessioned 2,074 works of art from 61 donors. The
collections were enlarged by 26 purchases from restricted acquisi-
tion funds. Of particular importance were: an eighteenth-century
etching by Piranesi; an “Argenta” bowl by Wilhelm Kage; a 4-
piece silver tea service by Jean Puiforcat; and 2 vitrines by the
early twentieth-century, Italian designer, Carlo Bugatti. The c-H
borrowed 2,821 objects from 321 public and private collections
and lent 140 objects to 42 museums, galleries, and institutions.
Since 1979, 175,000 articles have been inventoried and put on
computer.

Several construction projects were undertaken to provide more
efficient storage for the decorative arts collection. Extra alarm
systems were installed in the first-floor exhibition areas to insure
greater security, and a new boiler was installed. A new reception
area was constructed, and renovations were made in the Registrar’s
Office. The Design Gallery was renovated as were both classrooms.

The New York Horticultural Society has offered its expertise
for the maintenance of the Conservatory. This has insured the
museum of a seasonal variety of flowers and plants.

PROGRAMS/MEMBERSHIP

During four semesters beginning in the fall of 1981, almost 6,000
students and adults participated in the museum’s extensive educa-
tional programs. Nearly 4,000 others participated in tours and
special events. Total programs attendance was equal to that of the
previous year.

The department offered a selection of special events and courses
relating to the design field, architecture, and the decorative arts.
Three credit classes dealing with European and American Decora-
tive Arts were offered for undergraduates of the Parsons School
of Design. The children and adult workshops and special programs
were extremely well attended by over 9,000 individuals.

More than ninety volunteers and forty interns offered their

History and Art / 177
valuable services in all departments. The Sidney and Celia Siegel
Fellowship Program this year provided stipends for four excep-
tionally qualified summer interns.

Membership support in the form of renewals remained constant.
A membership drive at the end of the summer boosted the number
of new applicants.

As one of ten member institutions of Museum Mile, initiated
by the Cooper-Hewitt four years ago, the museum again partici-
pated in the annual street festival.

Along with nine other cultural institutions in New York City,
the c-H involved itself in a unique museum education project
entitled the “Cultural Voucher Program.” This program was con-
ceived by Museums Collaborative, Inc., for the purpose of promot-
ing broader public understanding and use of cultural institutions.
The Cooper-Hewitt was chosen to participate because of its ability
to present educational opportunities that relate to design and the
decorative arts. The Cultural Voucher Program provides a strong
incentive to develop new educational programs, and the c-H re-
sponded with a wide variety of model projects involving nearly
3,000 students—more than any other cultural institution involved
in the program.

In September, the museum welcomed the first class of twenty-
five students accepted into a new graduate program in the history
of European decorative arts. The two-year program, leading to a
Master of Arts degree, is a collaboration between the Cooper-
Hewitt and the Parsons School of Design/The New School and is
