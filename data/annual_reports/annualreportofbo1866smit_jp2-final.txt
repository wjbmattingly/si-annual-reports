PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan
of Organization.

1. Witt or Smiruson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.”’

2.The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government
of the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of
the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

_ 4, The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and 2d, t
diffuse knowledge among men. :

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths ; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced eitl-er
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally ; can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or
be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION,

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the
construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be
benefited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expen-
diture on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the Soregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I.. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all *
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of vol-
umes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for
publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5, The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and\the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a farorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the Trans-
actiois of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to
all th» colleges and principal libraries, in this country. One part of
the renaining copies may be offered for sale ; and the other carefully
preseived, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand
from nw institutions.

7. Aa abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be gwen to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congres.

II. By ajypropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The \bjects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counselors of the Institution. 5

2. Re oe in different years to different objects ; so that
in course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The reults cbtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the menoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contrbutions to Knowledge.

4, Exampl6 of objects for which appropriations may be made.

- (1.) System'of extended meteorological observations for solving
the problem ofAmerican storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, andtopographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Fyysical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution 0 experimental problems, such as a new determina-
tion of the weighiof the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of
light ; chemical alalyses of soils and plants ; collection and publica-
tion of scientific fists, accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution ¢ statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and politicasubjects. :

(5.) Historical regarches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in American history.

(6.) Ethnological esearches, particularly with reference to the
different races of menin North America; also, explorations and ac-
curate surveys of the tounds and other remains of the ancient people
of our country. \

\

10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports, .giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year im
all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally in-
teresting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Scme
of the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals,
as the income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of
knowledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent ia the
different branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publi-
cations, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his
report ; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be naned on
the title-page of the report.

4, The reports to be published in separate parts, so thatpersons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partal distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scentific in-
stitutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be enbraced in
the reports :*

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geolosy, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4. Application of science to arts.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, compaative philology,
antiquities, &. '

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world ‘penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE AJIS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to theuseful arts.
11. Bibliography. |
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individals.

II. By the publication of separate treatises on sujects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consit of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of artiles prepared under the

*This part of the plan has been but partiay carried out.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. a i

direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges, previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing jor the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation
of a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be re-
quired, consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the transactions
and proceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the
more important current periodical publications, and other works
necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

‘T. With reference to the collection of books, other than those
mentioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the
United States should be procured, in order that the valuable books
first purchased may be such as are not to be found in the United
States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art
casts of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

12 PROGRAMME OF CRGANIZATION.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of
expense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also be invited
to give lectures on subjects of general interest. .

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15,
1855, viz:

Resolved, That the 7th resolution passed by the Board of Regents,
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the
income between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT

OF THE

SECRETARY, PROFESSOR HENRY, FOR 1866.

GENTLEMEN: It again becomes my duty to preseut to your honorable
board the history of another year of the Institution founded on the be-
quest of James Smithson, and intrusted by the Congress of the United
States to yourcare. In presenting the following account of the events
of the year 1866 I am gratified in being able to state that the fire
which occurred at the beginning of the previous year, and which, at
the time, appeared so disastrous, has, in reality, led to the adoption
of measures for the increase and better security of the funds, and of
changes of importance to the future efficiency of the means of carry-
ing out the intentions of the benevolent testator.

It will be seen by the report of the executive committee that, by
judicious investments and the sale of coin received from England as
the residuary legacy of Smithson, as well as that of the aznuai
interest from the United States, not only have the operations of the
Institution been maintained, and the reconstruction of the building
carried on without any aid from government, but the finances have
been improved and are now in a better condition than at any former
period. If the petition to Congress to permit additions to be made
to the principal on the same terms as those on which the original be-
quest was received into the treasury of the United States be granted, *
then the extra fund, at the present market value of the stocks in
which it is invested, will be sufficient to increase the endowment from
$515,169 to $650,000, and still leave enough to complete the general
restoration of the building, provided the cost of the restoration be
limited to $150,000. For these results the Institution is much in-
debted to the personal exertions and influence of the Chancellor,
Chief Justice Chase, to whom constant reference has been had during
the past year in the management of the finances of the establishment.

Although the present condition of the fund is a matter of congrat-
ulation, yet there is another fact belonging to the history of 1866 of

* Congress passed an act February 8, 1867, in accordance with the above, aliowing the
Regents to increase the capital by savings, donations, and otherwise, to a million dollars.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

equal if not greater importance, in regard to the future efficiency of
the Institution. TI allude to the transfer of the Smithson library for
safe-keeping and support to the library of Congress. To those who
have not fully considered the subject, it might, at first sight, appear
that this transfer of a large number of rare and valuable books from
the building of the Institution would be attended with serious
inconveniences, and be a virtual relinquishment of the control of
property procured at the expense of the Smithsonian fund. But it
will be evident, on a statement of the facts, that the advantages ac-
cruing to the Institution and the public from the transfer far outweigh
any inconvenience which may arise on account of it ; and that it will
tend to increase the efficiency of the funds. while it adds to the
security and even facilitates the general use of the library.
Although the removal of the books renders them somewhat less
accessible to those engaged in study and researches at the Institution,
yet all the current transactions of the scientific Societies of the world,
which constitute the principal part of the library, will be still received
at the Institution. An opportunity will thus be afforded of noting their
contents before they are sent to the Capitol, and such books will per-
manently be retained as are of most constant reference. In addition
to this, the Institution is to have, at all times, the free use of the books of
the congressional library as well as those of its own, and for this pur-
pose, and the better accommodation of the public, the library of Congress
is to be open throughout the year, with the exception of a month for
cleaning and examination. Hence the general student, instead of being
debarred any important privilege, will find increased facility for re-
search in having access, in the same building, to both libraries. Again,
the east wing of the Smithsonian building, in which the books were
deposited, is not fire-proof, and is liable to destruction by accident or
the torch of the incendiary, while the rooms of the Capitol are of in-
combustible materials. This wing was, moreover, filled to overflowing,
and a more extended and secure depository could not be obtained,
except by another large draught on the accumulated funds intended to
form part of the permanent capital. Besides this, by the terms of
the transfer, the cost of the care, binding, and cataloguing of the
Smithsonian books is provided for by government, and an important
part of the annual: income of the Institution is thus saved for other
purposes. ;
But the advantages of the transfer are not confined to the Institu-
tion. The library of Congress has secured such an addition as van-
not be obtained by purchase, since many of the books are presents
from the duplicates of the old libraries of Europe, consisting of trans-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

actions and other publications of the learned societies of the world,
forming a special collection, not only ranking as first in this country,
but one of the best anywhere in existence. Neither is it alone the value
of the books that have actually been transferred which is to be con-
sidered, but also the means which are offered, through our system of
exchange, for the perpetual increase of the several series of works
which contain the record of the actual progress of the world in all
that essentially pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family. The transfer of the Smithson library has fur-
thermore tended to awaken an interest in the Jibrary of Congress,
which cannot fail, under the energetic superintendence of the pres-
ent librarian, Mr. Spofford, in a few years to render it worthy of the
national Capital. An appropriation of $100.000 has been recommends
ed* by the Joint Committee of the two houses of Congress for the pur-
chase of the library of Mr. Peter Force, consisting of books relative
to America. With these additions the library of Congress will be
the largest in the United States, and the necessity of a separate
building is even already foreshadowed.

But above all, the act authorizing the reception, care, and support
of the Smithson library may be considered as an approval by Con-
gress of the general policy adopted and the course pursued by the
Institution. It will be recollected that at the commencement a num-
ber of influential literary men warmly advocated the expenditxre of
the larger portion of the income of the Smithson fund in the establish-
ment and support of a library. This plan was opposed on the ground
that the Institution by the terms of the bequest should be of a cosmo-
politan character, and produce results, the benefits of which would
not be confined to one city, nor even one country, and which could
not be accomplished bya library. The act of organization, however,
was so expressed as to give color to the idea that a large library was
intended by Congress, and much complaint was at one time made be-
cause more of the income was not expended in the purchase of books.
The late legislation of Congress will leave no ground for further cavil
in regard to this point, and while the Institution will be relieved
from a large expenditure on account of the library, a national collec-
tion of books will be formed far more extensive than could possibly be
supported by the Smithson fund.

Moreover, while thus relieving the Institution from a charge which
has borne so heavily on its resources, Congress has afforded most en-
couraging evidence of an important advance in public opinion regard-

* An act has been passed in accordance with this recommendation, and the library of Mr.
Force is now the pioperty of the government.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ing the right interpretation of the terms of the Smithson bequest. It
is substantially a recognition by the national legislature of the fact that
the Smithson fund ought not to be burdened with the support of objects
which, while they absorb the income, are locally restricted in their
influence, and neither essentially connected with the design, nor au-
thorized by the language of the trust. Since Congress has eventually
thought proper to assume the care of the library we may cherish the
hope that in due time it will also make provision for the separate
maintenance of a collection of objects of ‘‘nature and art,’’ not un-
worthy of the National Capital; and that the proceeds of a fund, now
generally recognized as having been intended by the testator for ob-
jects of a higher order than those confined to local or even national
benefit, will be entirely devoted to the system of operations which
an experience of nearly twenty years has abundantly shown to be
the best and most practical means of realizing the design of the tes-
tator.
It is much to be regretted that views of this kind did not prevail
at the time of the organization of the Institution, for had this been
the case no small amount of the funds would have been saved, and un-
pleasant discusssion been averted, the tendency of which could only.
be to obstruct and retard the full development of a system which now
constitutes the distinctive and approved policy of the establishment.
It is, however, scarcely a matter of surprise that Congress was not, at
the time mentioned, prepared to appreciate the significance of the
terms of the Smithson bequest, since the world generally has failed to
recognize the importance of abstract scientific truths. Although these
truths constitute the most important elements of modern civilization,
since they give man power and control over the inherent forcesof nature,
and enable him to render these the obedient slaves of his will; yet,
there is even at this time no country, however intelligent it may ap-
pear in other respects, that has made adequate provision for the dis-
covery and development of these important principles. Our own
legislators can give no better evidence of enlightened views and wise
policy than a free acknowledgement of the claims of science, and a
liberal provision for its encouragement and support.

The propriety of making provision for the separate maintenance of
a national museum, and of relieving the Smithson fund from the
burden imposed upon it in this way, will be evident when the fact
is recalled that the plan of the present expensive building was
adopted to accommodate the museum of the Wilkes’ exploring expe-
dition, the care of which had been devolved upon the Institution by
the law of Congress. But the Board of Regents, after the building
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. x

was completed, decided that the keeping of this museum ought not
to be a charge on the Smithson fund, and before assuming the care
of it asked an appropriation, at least equal to the cost of keeping the
articles while in the Patent Office. Congress recognized the pro-
priety of this position, complied with the request, and has appro-
propriated since the transfer, annually, $4,000. This sum, however,
has not sufficed to defray the cost of attendance, even during the
period of low prices previous to the war, without allowing for any
increase in the number of articles, or for the interest of the money
expended on the building.

It is highly gratifying to observe that a more liberal sohidt at
present exists. Congress has recently made provision, on an
ample scale, for the accommodation of an Army Anatomical Museum,
and for a Museum connected with the Agricultural Department, and
it can scarcely be doubted, that on a proper presentation of the sub-
ject, the same enlightened consideration which prompted the appro-
priations for these kindred objects, will also induce Congress either
to appropriate the Smithsonian building to the use of a National
museum, under a separate organization and endowment, or else to
make an annual grant of money, which, expended under the direction
ef the Board of Regents, shall be sufficient properly to support an
estaulishment of this kind.

The reconstruction of the building has been carried on during the
past year as rapidly as the funds at command and a due regard to the
character of the work would allow. The considerations which have
governed the building committee have been to render the work en-
tirely stable in regard to materials and construction and thoroughly
fire-proof, first completing such parts as were necessary for the safety of
the structure, and next those most wanted for use in the operations of
the establishment.

One of the most important points to be determined during the year
was the kind of roof to be adopted for the main building, and, after
full inquiry, the preference was given to one consisting of an iron
frame with slate covering. The contract for the iron work was made
with the Phoenix Iron Company of Philadelphia, but owing to unex-
pected delays the frame was not received in time before the setting
in of frost to complete the covering with slate. The walls of the
large south tower were found in a worse condition than wasat first
supposed, thirty feet of the height having to be removed and en-
tirely rebuilt, the facing of cut stone being of new material. To se-
cure the front towers and furnish supports for the iron beams and

brick arches for the floors, a lining of brick, laid in cement, has been
constructed from the bottom to the top. The inner lining of the
walls of the upper story of the main building, which was exposed iS
the fire, has also been entirely renewed with similar materials. The
masonry of the whole building is now completed, and it is expected
during the next season to finish all the rooms except the main hall
over the museum. The future use of this room, which is 200 feet
long by 50 feet wide, has not yet been settled. It will not be wan-
ted for the uses of the Institution, and unless devoted to a National
Museum or to some other purpose, it will probably remain for an in-
definite time, unfinished. The reconstruction of the building, exclu-
sive of this room, will cost about $150,000, and if to this be added
the sum previously expended on the erection of the building, we shall
have a total of $475,000, of which, atleast, $400,000 might have been
added to the principal, or expended in the promotion of knowledge.

The superintendence of the work is still under the direction of the
architect, Mr. Adolf Cluss, and every part of the construction and ~
all the plans have been critically examined and discussed by General
Delafield, chairman of the building committee, who has taken great
interest, since his appointment, not only in the restoration of the
building, but in all the operations of the Institution.

Publications. —The amount expended for printing during 1866 has
been fully equal to that in any previous year, although the number
of new works which have been issued is less. This has been occa-
sioned by the high price of paper and printing, and by the necessity
of issuing new editions of works for which the demand was more
pressing.

The following is a list of the works in quarto, forming part of the
series entitled ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,’’ published
during the year 1866:

1. An Investigation of the Orbit of Neptune, with general tables of
its motion, by Professor Simon Newcomb, U. 8S. navy, pp. 110.
(Published January, 1866.)

2. Geological Researches in China, Mongolia, and Japan during
the years 1862 to 1865, by Raphael Pumpelly, esq., pp. 161, 9 plates,
18 wood-cuts. (Published August, 1866.)

3. On the Fresh-water Glacial Drift of the Northwestern States,
by Charles Whittlesey, esq., pp. 32, 2 maps, 11 wood-cuts. (Pub-
lished December, 1866.)

Of other quarto works in press the following are nearly ready for
distribution:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

1. Astronomical, Magnetic, Tidal, and Meteorological Observations
within the Arctic Circle, by Isaac I. Hayes, M. D.

2. Meteorological Observations made at Brunswick, Maine, for
fifty-two years, by Professor P. Cleaveland, from 1807 to 1859.

The memoirs of Newcomb, Pumpelly, and Hayes were fully de-
scribed in the report for 1865. It therefore remains to give the ac-
count of that of Mr. Whittlesey on the Fresh-water Glacial Drift of
the Northern States, which will be found at the end of this report.

The following works in ocfavo were also published in 1866:

1. Catalogue of publications of societies and of periodical works
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution, (January, ) 596 pp.

2. Monograph of American Corbiculade, recent and fossil, by
Temple Prime, (January,) 91 pp.

3. List of works published by the Smithsonian Institution, (Jan.
uary,) 11 pp.

4. New species of North American Coleoptera, by Jno. L. Lo-
Conte, pages 87 to 177, of part I, (April,) 90 pp.

5. List of the Coleoptera of North America, by Jno. L. LeConte,
pages 50 to 78, (April,) 30 pp.

6. Check-list of the Invertebrate Fossils of North America, Eocene
and Oligocene, by T. A. Conrad, (May,) 45 pp.

7. Review of American birds in the collection of the Smithsonian
2s a a By Prof. 8S. F. Baird. Pp. 321-450; (May and June,)
130 pp.

The memoirs actually completed and issued in the year therefore
embraced 303 quarto pages and 993 octavo pages, which, with the
annual report, 496 pages, makes an aggregate of 1,792 pages printed
within the year. ; '

New editions of the following works have been issued during the
same period: Allen’s Bats; Binney’s Land and Fresh-water Shells, parts
II and III; Instructions for collecting specimens of Natural History;
circular relative to nests and eggs; check-list of shells; comparative
vocabulary; ethnological instructions; catalogue of minerals; check-
list of fossils ; Draper on the Telescope.

The most expensive octavo publication during the past year has
been the catalogue of the transactions of learned Societies and other
public bodies, as well as of encyclopedias and other serial works in the
library of the Institution. The printing of this work was begun in
1863 and completed in 1866. During its passage through the press
proof-sheets were sent to the principal Societies abroad, for the pur-
pose, first, of securing accuracy in the titles; second, of showing the defi-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ciencies in our series, and thus enabling the Societies, as far as possi-
ble, to supply them. This work forms a large octavo volume of 596
pages. It has been stereotyped, and copies have been distributed to
the principal libraries in this country and Europe, with a view mainly
10 obtain from them such duplicates as they may possess which may
serve to render more complete the Smithson collection of transac-
tions. The catalogue of the works thus obtained will be printed in
an appendix, accompanied by proper indexes, when the whole will be
issued and more generally distributed as one of the series of volumes
of Smithsonian miscellaneous collections. From the stereotype plates
an edition of this work has been struck off at the government print-
ing office for the use of the library of Congress. This catalogue is
.. considered the most complete work on the bibliography of publica-
tions of learned societies which has yet appeared in the English lan-
guage.

Another article belonging to the octavo series is a catalogue of the
eocene fossils belonging to the series of check-lists of invertebrate
fossils of North America, prepared at the request of the Institution by
Mr. T. A. Conrad, of Philadelphia. It contains an enumeration of all
the species described from the eocene formation up to the date of
publication, and is intended to facilitate the labelling of collections
and the distribution of duplicate specimens.

The publication of two other parts of this series, prepared by Mr.
F. B. Meek, namely, on the miocene, and on the cretaceous and ju-
rassic species, were mentioned in a previous report.

The different series of check-lists published by the Institution have
fully answered the purpose intended, in supplying a want long felt by
students of natural history; and successive editions from the stereo-
type plates are required, the cost of which has formed a large item of
the expenditure for printing during the past year.

Besides the foregoing articles 92 pages of an addition to the descrip-
tion of new species, and 30 pages of an addition to the list of coleop-
tera of North America, by Dr. John LeConte, have been printed
during the year. These additions bring the works mentioned to the
same point in regard to completeness as the first part of the classifi-
cation of coleoptera by the same author, published by the Institution

several years ago.
_ Another article, which will form a part cf the miscellaneous collec-
tions, and printed during the year, is a list of all the works published
by the Institution up to the beginning of the year 1866, enumerating
203 distinct titles, arranged under the following heads: »

Of many of the earlier of the separate publications the edition has
been exhausted. Of those that remain copies can be procured, at the
prices mentioned in the list, by institutions and individuals who do not
come within the following rules of gratuitous distribution:

1. They are presented to all learned Societies of the first class
which publish transactions, and give copies of these, in exchange, to
the Institution.

2. To all foreign libraries of the first class, provided they give in
exchange their catalogues and other publications, or an equivalent,
from their duplicate volumes.

3. To permanently endowed colleges in actual operation in this
country, provided they furnish in return meteorological observations,
catalogues of their libraries and of their students, and all other pub-
lications issued by them relative to their organization and history.

4. To all States and Territories, provided they give in return
copies of ail documents published under their authority.

5. To all incorporated public libraries in this country, not included
in any of the foregoing classes. now containing 10,000 volumes; and
Oy De REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to smaller libraries, where a whole State or large district would be
otherwise unsupplied. ;

_ Institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular
branches of knowledge receive such articles published by the Insti-
tution as relate to their objects. Portions of the series are also given
. to institutions of lesser grade not entitled, under the above rules, to
the full series; and also to the meteorological correspondents of the
Institution.

The Reports are of a more popular character, and are presented—

1. To all the meteorological observers and other collaborators of
the Institution.

2. To donors to its library or museum.

3. To colleges and other educational establishments.

4. To public libraries and literary and scientific societies.

5. To teachers or individuals who are engaged in special studies,
and who make direct application for them.

In consideration of the growing expenses of the Institution, and the
increasing demand for its publications, it may become necessary to
restrict the gratuitous distribution, and to take measures to secure a
larger sale by the usual methods adopted by publishers.

Reports. —The usual number of extra copies of the Report for 1865
was ordered by Congress, and, as has been the case for several years
past, was stereotyped, so that future editions may be printed if re-
quired.

This volume contains, in addition to the report of the Secretary
and the proceedings of the Board, the following articles:

A eulogy on General Joseph G. Totten, late Chief Engineer of the
United States army, and a Regext of the Smithsonian Institution from
its organization, delivered by Major General J. G. Barnard before
the National Academy of Sciences; a Memoir of De Blainville, by
Flourens, translated from memoirs of the the French Academy of Sci-
ences; a report of the transactions of the Society of Physics and Natural
History of Geneva for 1863 and 1864; an original article on the aurora
borealis, with illustrations, by Professor E. Loomis; a translation from
the German of an article on the senses of feeling and smell; a translation
of a course of lectures by Professor Matteuci on electro-physiology;
an essay on the palafittes or lacustrian constructions of the Lake of Neu-
chatel, by Professor EH. Desor, of Switzerland, with notes and illus-
trations furnished by the author; a continuation of Plateau’s re-
searches on the figures of equilibrium of a liquid mass withdrawn
from the action of gravity; an outline by Professor W. Lilljeburg, of
Upsala, of the latest views of ornithologists in reference to the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

classification and arrangement of the higher divisions of birds, and
such as has been adopted in the museum of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion; prize questions proposed by various scieutific societies in
Europe; and an article on the metric system of weights and measures.
with tables intended especially for the use of teachers and authors of
arithmetics, prepared for the Institution by Professor H. A. Newton.

The translations are from French, German, and Italian scientific
publications, not generally accessible to readers in this country, and
most of them have been made by C. A. Alexander, esq., of this city,
who has devoted much of his time, almost gratuitously, fo. a number
of years, to this part of the literary work of the Institution.

We have found from experience that to obtain proper scientific
translations is a very difficult matter. It is rare to find an individual
having so critical a knowledge of languages, united with other requi-
site qualifications,as to render with fidelity and spirit such discursive
popular explanations as are conveyed in the articles in the appendix
to the Report for 186 on the Senses. In this respect Mr. Alexan-
der has evinced much ability. The meaning of the original is not
only rendered with great accuracy, but with reference to peculiari-
ties of expression on the part of the authors, and with a critical re-
gard to the precision and correctness of the English. ,

It is proper to mention in this connection that we are indebted to
the Superintendent of Public Printing for greater facilities than usual
in the publication of the report, which, on account of the character
of the articles, and their translation from foreign languages, requires
more than ordinary time and care in revision.

Meteorology.—The system of meteorological observations inaugu-
rated by the Institution, which was much interrupted by the war, is
gradually being re-estabtished, and as soon as the expenses for the
restoration of the building are diminished we hope to carry it on more
efficiently on an improved basis. The meteorological system under
the direction of the Surgeon General is also in process of reorgani-
zation, and as soon as the military posts are permanently established it
will be recommenced with improved instruments, and in harmonious
relations with that of the Institution.

The following is an exhibit of the number of observers during 1866,
as derived from the list given in the appendix: British America, 6;
Mexico, 1; Central America, 3; Bermuda, 1 ; Alabama, 5 ; Arkansas,
2; California, 4; Colorado, 1; Connecticut, 5; Delaware, 1 ; Florida,
4; Georgia, 1; Illinois, 32; Indiana, 12; lowa, 28; Kansas, 9; Kentucky,
5; Maine, 11: Maryland, 6; Massachusetts, 17; Michigan, 13; Minne-
D4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sota, 9; Mississippi, 5; Missouri, 9; Montana, 1; Nebraska, 3; New
Hampshire, 7; New Jersey, 14; New York, 35; North Carolina, 4;
Ohio, 32 ; Oregon, 2; Pennsylvania, 23; Rhode Island, 2; South Caro-
lina, 1 ; Tennessee, 3; Texas, 3; Utah, 5; Vermont, 7; Virginia, 2;
Washington, 1; West Virginia, 2; Wisconsin, 18.

The whole number of observers is 352; of these 67 are furnished
with complete sets of instruments. including barometer, thermometer,
psychrometer, and rain gauge ; 331 with thermometers, 137 with ba-
rometers, 72 with psychrometers, and 227 with rain gauges, while ten
report the face of the sky, direction of the wind, and casual phenomena
without instruments.

The income of the Institution has not been sufficient to furnish in-
struments to observers, aud hence from many of the stations the re-
sults are not strictly comparable with one another. There are, how-
ever, in almost every part of the country, one or more stations fur-
nished with standard instruments, constructed by James Green. of
New York, the observa tions with which may serve to determine the
absolute variations of temperature, pressure and moisture at different
localities, while the observations from the remainder give results
comparable with themselves, and serve to determine the relative
character of different seasons, as well as the data necessary for tra-
cing the transmission of waves, as it were, of atmospheric disturb-
ance with regard to wind, pressure and temperature. -

The Institution has endeavored to collect the records of all meteoro-
logical observations which have been made on this continent, and has
succeeded in obtaining a large amount of material, which will serve
as the basis of an isothermal map of the country, as well as that of
the peculiarities of climate of different sections. A portion of this,
that, namely, which relates to the mean temperatures of years and sea-
sons, was to have been published as the second part of tue second
volume of ‘‘ Meteorological Results,’’ issued some years ago by order
of Congress, but the pressure of business on the public printing
office in consequence of the war has as yet prevented the completion
of the work. It will probably be published during the next year,
either by Congress or the Institution. :

Another portion of the material relates to long series of observa-
tions made at particular places. Of these we may mention the fol-
lowing : Those made by Prof. Caswell, at Providence, Rhode Island.
for twenty-eight and a half years; Dr. N. D. Smith, at Washington, |
Arkansas, for twenty years ; Prof. Cleaveland, at Brunswick, Maine,
for fifty-two years; Dr. S. P. Hildreth, at Marietta, Ohio, for forty-.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

one years; Prof. Z. Thompson, at Burlington, Vermont, for twen-
ty-six years; Samuel Rodman, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, for
thirty-six years.

Of the series, those of Caswell and Smith have been published in fuil,
and those of Cleaveland and Hildreth are now in the hands of the prin-
ter, and will form a part of the sixteenth volume of the Contribu-
tions to Knowledge.

The ‘‘ Monthly Bulletin of the Agricultural Department’? still con-
tinues to contain a large amount of meteorological information derived
from the reports of the Smithsonian observers. In preparing the
materials for this a part of the time of Mr. Force, the assistant in
charge of meteorology, has been occupied every month. This publica-
tion still continues to be of value to the farmer, and of interest to
our observers, since it gives them a ready means of comparing their
observations with those made in other parts of the country.

The anemometer, which for many years recorded the direction and
intensity of the wind on the top of the high tower of the Institution,
was destroyed with other instruments in the fire. As soon as the re-
construction of this tower is completed, one of Osler’s anemometers
will be erected in the same place. The use of one of these instru-
ments, belonging to the National Observatory, has been kindly granted
to us by the Secretary of the Navy. A standard barometer, by New-
man, belonging to the Institution, now in the possession of Professor
Guyot, will also be placed, with other instruments, in the same tower,
and the full series of observations resumed. >

The break in our series, however, is not of so much importance as
at first sight it might appear, since a similar series has been kept up
continually at the Observatory, which is a mile west of the Institution.

Exchanges. —The extensive system of international, scientific and
literary exchanges, so long carried on by the Institution, has been
fully maintained during the year. Eighty-three boxes, containing
1,170 packages, were sent to our foreign agents in 1866, and over
8,000 parcels received from them. ‘These packages, as in former
years, contain the publications of the Institution, public documents,
transactions of societies and scientific works by individuals, besides
specimens of natural history.

Acknowledgments are again due to the various steamship, railroad
and express companies mentioned in the last report who have for a
number of years contributed materially to the advance of science by
the free freights and important privileges granted by them to ee
Institution in carrying on its system of exchange.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The agents of the Institution still continue to be Dr. Fetrx Fives,
Leipsic, Gustave Bossance, Paris, Wm. Westey, London, FREDERIC
Mu.tuer, Amsterdam.

Besides these gentlemen, Mr. James Swarm, now residing in Paris,
has been appointed a special scientific agent for the purchase of phi-
losopbical apparatus and the transaction of other business, the duties
of which he discharges gratuitously and to the great advantage of
the Institution. We regret that notice of this fact was inadvertent-
ly omitted in the last annual report.

Fiplorations and collections. —As has been stated in previous reports,
it is an important part of the operations of the Institution to en-
courage, assist and organize exploratious for such portions of North
aud South America as have not been thoroughly investigated in re-
gard to physical geography, climate and natural history. During the
past year this part of the operations has been prosecuted with un-
abated energy, principally under the immediate supervision of Prof.
Baird.

Those which have been made directly or indirectly under the guid-
ance of the Institution, and more or less at its expense, are as fol-
lows:

British America.—Explorations and collections of specimens by
officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company in continuation of those of
former years, especially those of Mr. Robert MacFarlane on the An-
derson river, and of Mr. W. Brass. at Fort Halkett; Jas. Flett, at
La Pierre’s House; C. P. Gaudet, at Fort Good Hope; William L.
Hardisty, at Fort Simpson; Strachan Jones, at Fort Rae; Jas. Lock-
hart, at Resolution; John Reed, at Big Island; Jas. Sibbiston and
Rev. Jas. MacDonald, at Fort Yukon, and Donald Gunn, west of Lake
Winnipeg; also in Labrador by Messrs. Henry Connolly and Donald A.
Smith.

Russian America.—The explorations of the Collins extension of the
Western Union Telegraph Company under Col. Charles L. Bulkley
have been continued, and a large amount of interesting matter in re-
gard to the ethnology, topography, and natural history of the country,
collected principally by the following gentlemen has been received:

Colonel Bulkley, Captain Scammon, Dr. Fisher, Captain Sands,
R. Kennicott, W. H. Dall, H. M. Bannister, J. T. Rothrock, Charles
Pease, F. Bischoff, Lt. Davison, &c. Some of the collections in
natural history were made by the members of this company in
Kamtschatka and the western side of Behring straits.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

Pacific Coast of the United States.—The explorations of J. G.
Swan at Neeah bay, Puget sound, have also been continued with in-
teresting results, as also those of Dr. C. A. Canfield at Monterey.
Other explorations have been those of W. F. Schwartz, San Luis
Obispo, Dr. Elliot Coues, San Pedro, and W. H. Dall, at Monterey.

Rocky Mountain Region of the United States.—The explorations of
Dr. Coues and Dr. E. Palmer, in Arizona, mentioned in the last re-
port, have been continued and completed. Dr.J. R. McKee, in New
Mexico, Dr. Wernigk, in Colorado, have also made collections.

Eastern United States.—The explorations by Dr. H. B. Butcher on
the lower Rio Grande, at Laredo, Texas, and by Dr. Redfield Sharp,
at San Antonio; J. T. Cleu, at the Louisiana Salt Mines of Petit Anse
island; in Illinois, by Joel Reeves, Robert Ridgway and Professor
Henry Shimer, have all furnished interesting results.

West Indies.—The explorations here have been those of Charles
Wright, in Cuba; A. E. Younglove, in Hayti; Mr. Geo. Latimerand Dr.
Henry Bryant, in Porto Rico; Dr. Bryant, in the Bahamas; W. T.
March, in Jamaica, and Mr. Allen, in Bermuda.

Mexico.—The explorations in this country have been those of Col.
A. J. Grayson about Mazatlan and on the west coast; Dr. Charles
Sartorius and Mr. Floretin Sartorius, at Mirador; Professor Sumichrast
and M. Botteri, at Orizaba; Dr. Strebel, at Vera Cruz.

Yucatan.—The explorations in Yucatan of Governor Salazar, under
direction of Dr. Arthur Schott, have been continued and completed.

Explorations have been made in Honduras by Dr. H. Berendt and
D. B. Parsons; in Guatemala, by Mr. Henry Hague, about San Ge-
ronimo; in Nicaragua, by Dr. Earl Flint; in Costa Rica, by Dr. A.
Von Frantzius, Hon. C. N. Riotte, Julian Carmiol, Juan Cooper and
A. Zeledon; in Panama, by Captain J. M. Dow, J. and T. Rhoads,
Dr. Totten and Dr. J. P. Kluge; in the Sandwich Islands, by Mr.
Valdimar Knudsen. In South America, explorations have been made
and collections transmitted by Mr. W. H. Hudson, in Buenos Ayres;
Mr. A. De Lacerda, at Babia, and Hon. A. A. Burton, at Bogota,

It shouid be stated in this connection that the expenses of the ex-
ploration in Honduras of Dr. Berendt have been principally met by
contribution from the Chicago Academy of Sciences, Philadelphia
Academy of Sciences, Dr. Henry Bryant, and Messrs. Geo. W. Riggs,
W. A. Haines, H. Van Nostrand, C. M. Wheatly, R. L. Stuart, Prof.
B. Silliman, Robt. L. Swift, J. H. Redfield and Thos. Bland.

For a more particular account of the nature of the contributions in
natural history and ethnology reference may be made to the lists
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and tables furnished by Prof. Baird in the Appendix. From these it
appears that the number of entries during the year in the catalogues
of specimens received is 7,254, which is about the usual annual aver-
age. Of these, nearly 4,500 were of birds. .

As has frequently been stated in previous reports, the collections
which are the result of the explorations made by the Institution or
by the voluntary contributions of individuals, are not, primarily, in-
tended to enlarge its museum, but for distribution to all the principal
museums in the world and to furnish the materials for special re-
searches. In accordance with this policy a distribution of over one
hundred thousand labelled specimens, including 53,166 species, has
been made during the year 1866 to museums and colleges where they
were required for comparative investigation or as materials for in-
struction. Besides these distributions a large number of specimens
have been intrusted to individuals for special study, viz: the insects
to Baron Ostensacken, Dr. G. H. Horn, Edw. Norton, esq., W. H.
Edwards, esq.. and H. Ulke, esq.; the shells to P. P. Carpenter,
esq., Thomas Bland, esq., Isaac Lea, esq., and George W. Tryon,
esq.; the minerals to Prof. T. Egleston; the plants to Dr. John Tor-
ry; the bats to Dr. H. Allen; infusorial earths to S. A. Bailey, esq. ;
birds to Jno. Cassin, esq.. Geo. N. Lawrence, esq., and D. G. Elliot,
esq.; nests and eggs to Dr. T. M. Brewer; reptiles to Prof. H. D.
Cope; fossils to Dr. Jos. Leidy and F. B. Meek, esq.

In all cases in which specimens are presented to institutions or to
individuals for investigation, full credit is required to be given to
the name of Smithson for the benefits thus conferred.

From the Royal Library of Dresden we have received a series of
232 original discourses or theses and tracts, most of which were writ-
ten by Luther, and the remainder by his contemporaries, and nearly
all of which were published during the lifetime of the great reformer.

These tracts were referred to Rev. Dr. Morris, librarian of the
Peabody Institute of Baltimore, for a translation of the catalogue, to
whom we are indebted for the following remarks in regard to them:

‘*The majority of these brief treatises can be found in almost any
entire edition of Luther’s works, and are therefore not rare; but
what renders this collection interesting to the bibliographer is, that
they are all first impressions, and not reprints. The proofs were
doubtless revised and corrected by his owa hand, as most of them

were printed at places where he resided. They present specimens
of paper and printing which are very creditable to the artisans of
that day, ranging as they do from 1518, the year after the Reforma-
tion began, to 1546, the year of Luther’s death. These writings have
come to us in the same type and paper in which they were distributed
by thousands over the land at the dawn of the Reformation. While
the language in which they are written, both German and Latin, is
not as refined as that employed by scholars of the present day, and
while the pictorial illustrations are coarse, yet these productions show
the extraordinary progress which the typographic art had already
made in the early part of the 16th century. Many of them have the
title pages ornamented with a broad margin of wood-cut figures, most
of them mythological and grotesque, and all curious. They are speci-
mens of the engraving of that day. exceedingly interesting to the
student of the history of art, for these are undoubted originals, which
collectors of ancient prints prize so highly. A few of them are un-
skilfully illuminated, probably executed by some incipient artist, who
tried his hand on these coarse and cheap wood-cuts. The subjects of
the pamphlets are diverse and curious, and the titles of many of those
which are controversial, as was the general custom of that day, are
expressed in language more forcible than refined.’’ »

Under the act of Congress mentioned in the last report, previously
alluded to, the Smithsonian books have been transferréd to one of the
fire-proof rooms in the extension of the library of Congress, where they
will be catalogued under the direction of Mr. Spofford, the librarian, and
the large number of volumes in sheets will be bound at the government
bindery. The continued new accessions to the library from foreign
exchanges and otherwise are received and recorded at the Institution
as formerly. The accessions from abroad do not alone consist of
transactions of societies, but also, as has been shown in this and pre-
vious reports, of some of the most costly publications of foreign gov-
ernments, and rare duplicates in the older libraries of Europe.

Correspondence.—A large amount of labor connected with the ope-
rations of the Institution is devoted to correspondence. Besides
those relating to official business, hundreds of letters are received in
the course of a year, containing inquiries relative to the various sub-
jects on which the writers desire information. If these cannot be
forthwith answered, without much research in the Smithsonian library,
they are referred to our collaborators, who are experts in the differ-
ent branches of knowledge, and who can readily supply trustworthy
information in regard to the subjects within the range of their special —
studies.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. on

During the past vear we have made references of this kind to the
following gentlemen, viz: Dr. Torrey, of New York; Prof. Agassiz,
Dr. Gray, and Prof. Wyman, of Cambridge; Dr. Leidy and Mr. Isaac
Lea, of Philadelphia; Professors Dana, Whitney, Brush, and Newton,
of New Haven; Drs. Woodward and Craig, of the Surgeon General’s
office; Prof. Schaffer and Mr. W. B. Taylor, of the Patent office; Ad-
miral Davis and Prof. 8. Newcomb of the Naval Observatory: and
Mr. George Gibbs, and Mr. J. H. Lane of Washington.

Investigations. —During the past year a considerable portion of my
own time has been devoted to investigations connected with the rev-
enue service, light-house board, and other branches of the govern-
ment. These services, as well as those of a similar character in
former years, have been entirely gratuitous, and may be considered
in some degree as having tended to repay the care bestowed on the
Smithson trust by the government in its character of guardian and
trustee.

Lectures.—Since the burning of the upper story of the building in
which the lecture room was situated, the public lectures have been
discontinued. I have given, however, a course on electricity to the
telegraphic association of this city, and also accepted, last autumn, an
invitation to deliver the opening course of lectures at the Peabody
Institute, in Baltimore. I was induced to accept this invitation con-
trary to my general habit, in order to present, from the experience
gained in the management of the Smithsonian Institution, some sug-
gestions which might be of importance in organizing the interesting
establishment so liberally endowed by our distinguished countryman.
The endowment of the Peabody Institute is $1,000,000, nearly double
the original Smithson fund, and sufficient, if thé trust be wisely ad-
ministered, to render the favored city celebrated throughout the
world as a centre of literature and science. But I trust I shall be
pardoned for saying, that in the case of the organization of a new in-
stitution, of which the purposes are not clearly defined, and which is
entrusted to a board of trustees, it can scarcely be possible that the
best course can be adopted at once. There will always be honest
differences of opinion, and these will lead to compromises incom-
patible with a unity of plan, giving rise to difficulties in the
future. The wisest course, therefore,in such cases. is to proceed
cautiously, and on no account to adopt a plan which cannot be modi-
fied, or which shall call for any considerable expenditure of the prin-
cipal of the endowment. I may, perhaps be allowed to say, that the
publication of the remarks in full would probably be of importance in
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

diffusing information derived from the experience of the Smithsonian
Institution, especially wanted at this time, when so many new institu-
tions are about to be organized ; but they would be out of place in
this report, though they may be given in the appendix or elsewhere.

Whittlesey on the Drift.—The following is an account of the paper
on the drift before mentioned which has not yet been described.

The term drift, as employed in geology, includes the collection of
gravel, sand, clay, and stones occurring over portions of the conti-
nent without stratification or order of arrangement, and which have
evidently been transported and distributed without the agency of
rivers. For the study of this formation in the territory north of the
Ohio river and east of the Mississippi to the national boundary, Mr.
Whittlesey claims to have had special opportunities during the past
twenty-five years. The length north and south of this area is about
eleven degrees of latitude, from the 38° to the 49°, its breadth being
quite irregular. Its eastern boundary isa line passing through the mid-
dle of the system of North American lakes, and to the west it extends at
least to the Lake of the Woods. Over this space he has found what he
considers but one formation, belonging to the post-tertiary, whoily of
fresh-water origin, no remains as yet having been found of a salt water
character, while to the eastward of Lake Erie, in the valleys of Lakes
Ontario and Champlain, and the River St. Lawrence, the shells which oc- |
cur are wholly marine. Further examination he supposes will show that
the fresh-water formation overlaps the marine, and is consequently more
recent. The thickness of the fresh-water drift is variable, in some
places from 600 to 1,000 feet, though it seldom exceeds 200 or 300
feet. The author uses the term glacial drift to describe this forma-
tion as expressing what he conceives to be its origin in accordance
with the theory originally proposed by Professor Agassiz, viz., an im-
mense sheet of ice, at first principally confined to the pole of
greatest cold, but gradually increasing its area by accumulations of
snow in winter on its central part, and by the thawing in summer of
the surface, the subsequent freezing and expansion of the infiltered
water producing a slow but almost resistless motion outward in
every direction from the centre. This sheet of ice, like the modern
glacier, having fragments of hard stone imbedded in its lower sur-
face, would furrow and grind the rocks underneath—would bear on
its upper surface, and within its interior, boulders and fragments of
rocks which fell on it in its passage through mountain gorges, or
which it tore from their sides, and, in addition to these, would carry
with it the materials eroded in its passage; and finally, on melting,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oa

would leave the whole in a condition identical with that in which the
drift formation is found. This formation, according to the author,
may be divided into three members, in the order of superposition,
from the surface downward, composed as follows: The first of coarse
sand, gravel, loam, and hard-pan, with large boulders from northern —
rocks, exhibiting little stratification. The second of sand and gravel,
less coarse than the preceding, with irregular bands of clay some-
what laminated, and smaller boulders. The third of fine laminated
sand, of marly clay of great thickness, of various colors, witb few
boulders and little gravel. Wherever a sufficient thickness of drift
occurs these divisions can be readily traced, and always in the same
order. The first occupies the highest points of land, and frequently
lies upon the rock formation without the intervention of the other
beds, and in it occur moraine hillocks and depressions intermingled
with the underlying strata at different points, indicating the move-
ment of ice, which, while it brought materials from a distance,
ploughed up and pulverized the previously existing surface.

This upper member of the drift contains the coarsest material and
the largest and most numerous boulders, a fact inexplicable on any
other theory excepting that of their deposit by the melting of glaciers
carrying on their surface the heavier masses. The surface is pitted
with cavities extending below the general level ten, fifteen, and even
a hundred feet, their outline being rudely circular, and their sides as
steep as is compatible with the stability of the soil. In travelling
through this region the explorer frequently finds these hollows so
near together that he no sooner rises out of ove than he is obliged to
descend into another. They seldom contain water, but boulders are
found at the bottom, on the sides, andon the surface around. In the -
prairie regions of southern Wisconsin, timber grows within the cavi-
ties, as well as on the adjacent surface, in clumps, known as oak
orchards. The formation of such a system of depressions of so uni-
form a character, and over so large an extent of country, while the
rocks beneath, wherever uncovered, are found polished and grooved,
also indicates the movements and subsequent melting of large masses
of ice. In various places there occur patches of boulders from among
which the finer materials have been washed away. Near Twin Falls,
on the Menomonee river, in Michigan, on the ‘northern slope of a
mountain, such a collection occurs nearly a mile across, covering the
surface like a pavement with large masses smoothed and polished by
attrition. Along the heights of land collections of boulders also fre-

quently occur. After passing northward, above Lake Winnebago.
38 66
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the portion of sand increases, and also the size and number of the
boulders, which are mostly of igneous origin.

The second member of the glacier drift is not as readily made out
as the other two. In general it is thin, passing into the first member
above, and into the third below. Its characteristics are the finer
condition of the material and more distinct stratification in the alter-
nate layers of clay and sand. It is seen in its greatest development
at the Grand Sable of Lake Superior, east of Grand island, where the
coarse sand forms a stratum of from three to four hundred feet in
thickness, overlying a thin stratum of clay. The prominent moun-
tains and dunes along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan belong to
this member of the drift formation.

The third member consists of the ash-colored, the red, and the blue
laminated clays, the difference of color being probably caused by
varying portions of oxide of iron. These strata are not, strictly
speaking, formed of clay, but of finely comminuted sand, marl, and
oxide of iron, with alumina enough to cause adhesion. On the sum-
mit of the land whence the streams flow northwardly into Hudson’s
bay, southerly into the gulf of Mexico, and southeasterly into Lake
Superior, the three members of the drift period are conspicuously ex-
hibited—the third occupying the lower level. On Lake Superior the
_ lower member attains its greatest thickness. The rocks on which the
glacial drift rests, wherever uncovered, exhibit markings and indica-
tions of scouring and strie with variablé distinctness, depending upon
the capability of the rock to retain the impressions. In some cases
the movement was parallel, or nearly so, to the strike of the strata,
and in such instances sandstone beds have been carried away to &
considerable depth, leaving long, narrow ridges of material better
able to resist the grinding action. The general movement, as indi-
cated by the striz, was from the northeast to the southwest, the same
as that observed in the northern part of Europe. In New England,
markings of this kind on the rocks have been observed at 3,000 feet
elevation, in Ohio at from 1,300 to 1,400 feet, and at Point Keewenaw,
in Lake Superior, at from 1,400 to 1,600 feet. These elevations indi-
cate the great thickness which the glacial ice must have attained.
In various parts of the drift, boulders and muggets of copper occur,
which, in some cases, have been transported a long distance south-
-ward. Those found near Lake Superior, which have not been carried
far from their origin, are of great size, and not as much rounded by
attrition as those found at a greater distance. One of the former,
from the clay on the west fork of the Ontonagon river, now in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

museum of the Smithsonian Institution, weighs 3,000 pounds, pre-
senting angular points.

One of the characteristics which denotes the unity of the drift
is the presence of wood, leaves and other vegetable matter. The im-

bedded timber is the same throughout the formation and is similar to
that of the present growth of a more northern latitude, consisting of
pine, spruce, willow, and white cedar, the latter being most abundant.
“At Cleveland, Ohio, the entire trunk of a white cedar, twenty feet in
length, filled with proto-sulphide of iron, was found imbedded in the
drift eighteen feet below the surface, and many wells in that city are
rendered unfit for use by the layer of vegetation through which the
water passes.

Animal remains, such as those of the elephant, mastodon, and horse
are fonnd in the same formation, in addition to various varieties of
fresh-water shells.

Through the western country there are bluffs and terraces com-
posed of solid rock, but besides these there are others composed of
boulders, gravel, hard-pan, clay, or sand. The former were the re-
sult of geological causes more ancient than the drift, while the latter
are contemporaneous with this formation, and are probably due to
parallel currents. What are commonly known as lake ridges, accord-
ing to the author, are not ancient beaches, but the result of lateral
currents distributing the drift. All the rivers and streams cut through
these ridges and exhibit the drift clay frequently down to the rock
below, while the beaches evidently belong to the alluvial period.
Ancient lake ridges must not, therefore, be confounded with lake
beaches. The distinctive feature of the latter is that they are narrow
and steepest on the lake side, resembling terraces.

In the prairie region of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa,and Missouri, the
general surface is very uniform, but little elevated above the north-
ern lakes. A rise of only twenty-six feet in Lake Michigan would
turn its surplus waters across the summit into the Illinois river. Over
a territory embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and part of Ken-
tucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Canada West,
-there are no considerable elevations. This space is an extended
basic with a rolling surface, in which glacial action, unobstructed in
its movements, would tend to produce but little change in the general
topography, and therefore the position of valleys, rivers, and lakes
is about the same at present as it was before the glacial period.
The motion of theice, however, must have removed a large portion
of the broken fragments of the northern rocks to positions further
south. The appearance would indicate that, as the glacial period
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

drew towards its close,the transporting material changed from one in
which ice predominated to a modified one of ice and water.

Remarks are also made in this paper on the encroachment of the
water upon the land, as indicating the slow but constant changes to
which the surface of our earth is subjected. The clay bluffs of the
lakes are continually worn away by the action of springs, rains, winds,
and waves. They are attacked at the base, partially undermined,
and finally precipitated into the water with the trees and whatever
may be resting upon them. In due time they are spread over the
bottom of the lake, forming new strata to be, perhaps, investigated
by future geologists. Lake Erie and Michigan, the shores of which
are composed of drift clay, are filling up more rapidly than Lakes
Huron and Superior, the coasts of which are more rocky.

Another phenomenon noticed, is that of lines of boulders within
and parallel to the shores of shallow lakes, presenting, in some cases,
the appearance of arude wall or fence of large stones. For example,
in Mille lake, Minnesota, there are lines of this kind rising five and .
six feet above the water level, and formed of stones far too heavy to
have been moved by the actionor the waves. More than fifty years
azo a similar appearance was described by President Dwight, of Yale
College, as observed at Salisbury, Connecticut. The movement of
the stones towards the shore was in this case clearly indicated by the
troughs left in the bottom of the lake visible-in clear water. The
phenomenon is now satisfactorily referred to the expansion of ice in
which the boulders are imbedded in winter. This ‘takes place in
every direction from the centre of the lake outward, and is exerted
in the case of ice of considerable thickness with almost irresistible
energy. The stones are carried forward, and on the thawing of the
ice are left in their new position.

The last section of the paper refers to paunplee of erosions, also
referable to the movement of the ice of the glacial period. These
are particularly exhibited in the great projection into Lake Superior
from the southern shore called Point Keweenaw, in which are scooped
out depressions, forming the basins of lakes, inlets, and harbors, ex-
hibiting evidence of the direction and intensity of the transforming
force,and it is probable that the shore line,and form of the bottom of
the great lakes must have been modified by. the action of the same
eause. This work is illustrated by a map of north America, a pro-
file of the deposits from Lake Hrie to the Lake of the Woods, and
eleven wood cuts.

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS OF THE INSTITUTION IN 1866.

The total number of distinct donations in 1866 amounts to 220; the number
of donors being 168. This exhibits a considerable increase over ‘the figures of
1865, which are 155 and 102, respectively. ‘The number of different packages
received was 318, as compared with 257 of 1865.

The precise character of the collections received will be best gathered from
the list of donations given further on. As will be seen they come from many
different localities throughout the continent of America; the most important,
however, being those from the officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, in Arctic
America.

WORK DONE IN MUSEUM AND COLLECTIONS IN 1866.

Much labor has been expended during the year in cleaning the specimens on
exhibition, and otherwise repairing the damage of the fire of 1865. ‘The diffi-
culty of preventing the rain and melted snow from coming through the tempo-
rary roof has caused great trouble from mould, requiring energetic measures of |
relief No mounted specimens have been added to the collection.

As usual the collections received have been regularly entered and catalogued.
The following table:shows what has been done im this respect :

amounted to nearly as much as in all previous years put together, the number

bution of shells of the United States exploring expedition, &e.

This is due to the extensive and final distri-

The foregoing statement is an actual exhibit of the Smithsonian funds, irre-
spective of credits and payments which have been made in behalf of other
parties. For example, the Institution during the past year has paid several bills
for work done on account of the government, the amount of which has been re-
funded and credited to the appropriations from which the expenditure was made.

The Commissioner of Agriculture has continued to pay one-half of the salary
of the meteorological clerk, who has been engaged during the year in preparing
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 67

the abstracts from the reports of the observers for the Monthly Bulletin of the
Agricultural Department.

The appropriation received for the preservation of the collections of the
exploring expeditions of the United States has been expended as heretofore,
under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in assisting to pay the
expenses of employés in the museum, and the cost of arranging and preserving
the articles. ‘This appropriation is $4,000 annually, but during the last year an
additional sum ot $2,000 was received, due for the year 1865, which had not.
been paid on account of the failure of the appropriation bill to pass Congress at.
the usual time.

The specimens intrusted to the care of the Institution are in a good condition,
although on account of the unfinished state of the building much care and labor
have been required to preserve them from the effects of dampness.

The committee have examined three hundred and cighty-two vouchers, em-
bracing several thousand items, for payments during the year, amounting col-
lectively to $75,211 35. All these vouchers are for moneys actually expended,
and for legitimate purposes of the Institution, and are in the form which has
heretofore been in use. The committee, however, would advise that in future
the following rules, similar to those in use by government, be adopted:

1. Vouchers to be made out on blanks furnished by the Institution.

2. All receipts for money paid to be signed by a principal, and not by an
agent unless lega'ly authorized.

3. Each voucher to be complete in itself; no payments to be made on a run-
ning account.

During the year the State of Tennessee made arrangements to issue six per
cent. coupon bonds to pay off the arrearage of interest which had accumulated
during the war. ‘The claims for interest to be converted into these new bonds:
were limited to amounts of not less than $1,000. As the interest due the Institu-
tion was $3,600, Mr. Riggs was instructed to sell the odd $600 worth of coupons:
and convert the remaining $3,000 into stock. The sale of these coupons yielded:
$402, which sum has been credited in the receipts of the Institution for the
year, and three bonds of one thousand dollars each, added to the permanent in-
vestment.

It is impossible, until it is known what further action the board wil take in
regard to the disposition of the stocks, to give a definite estimate of the receipts
and expenditures during the present year. The following, however, may be
considered as an approximation sufficiently exact for the general appropriations
for the operations of the Institution, and the continuance of the work upon the
building :

The income of $78,363 74 above stated does not include any interest on the
Virginia and Georgia stocks. Their value at the present time is about $32,000,
being the amount of the unproductive funds of the Institution.

The Indiana stock yields but five per cent. on the par value. It can now be
sold and lent to the United States at six per cent., which will increase the an-
nual income from this source af least $300.

The Georgia and Washington stocks can now be sold at par, and the proceeds
lent to the United States will increase the annual income from this source at
least $30. .

The Tennessce stock at present is worth about 62 per cent. on its par value.
-It pays 6 per cent. on the par value, and about 9.6 per cent. on the market
value.

The Virginia stock is worth at the present time about 59 per cent. on the
par value, and pays no interest. A large amount of the debt of this State is
‘ secured by stocks in the railroads and other internal improvements amounting
to many millions, and it is therefore considered most advantageous to retain this
stock until it commands a more favorable price.

The committee, in conclusion, have the satisfaction of reporting to the regents
the fact that the entire bequest of Smithson remains undiminished in the trea-
sury of the United States; that all the expenditures from the organization of
the establishment to the present time, including nearly $400,000 on the build-
ing, have been made exclusively from the income derived from the bequest,
while at the same time the efficiency of the Institution has been increased by an
extra fund of upwards of $100,000.

Executive Committee.

NoTr.—Since the presentation and adopticn of this report, by authority of the Board, the
United States 7.30’s, the Indiana, Georgia, and Tennessee stocks have been sold, and the —
proceeds added to the permanent capital, increasing it from $515,169 to $650,000.
REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE.

The restoration of the building has been prosecuted during the last year as
rapidly as the funds at the disposal of the committee and the character of the
work would permit.

It will be recollected that the damage occasioned by the fire consisted princi-
pally in the destruction of the roof and upper story of the main building, the
interior of the large north and south central projections, and the howtabe” con-
nected with them.

It will be further recollected that in the reconstruction of the building, as
stated in the last report, the committee were governed by the following consid-
erations :

1. To render the work entirely stable, both as to material and mode of eon-
struction.

2. 'l’o render it thoroughly fire-proof.

3. In view of the great cost at present of material and workmanship, and
the means at the disposal of the committee; to do first, such work as would be
necessary to preserve the stability of the several parts of the building, and pre-
vent injury by the weather.

Immediately after the fire, a temporary covering was placed over the main
building in such a position as not to interfere with the subsequent erection of the
permanent roof. ‘I’o secure the northern towers, a 9-inch lining of brick was
laid in cement from the bottom to the top, and firmly united to the original wall.
In this and all the other parts of the building reconstructed, wrought-iron gird-
ers and brick arches were substituted for wooden beams and floors.

The large south tower was so much injured that thirty feet of the upper por-
tion.had to be taken down and rebuilt, the cost of which was much enhanced
by the necessity of recutting a large amount of new stone for the facing. ‘This
tower has been divided into six stories, affording as many large rooms, the
lower for an extension of the museum, an upper one for the meetings of the
Regents, and the others for storage, &c. The offices for the accommodation of the
Seeretary and assistants will be in the northern towers and connecting space.

The principal access to the second story of the main building is by two iarge
iron staircases, one on cither side of the northern entrance. These have been
completed.

All the towers and connections with the main building have been covered with
substantial roofs. After much inquiry and personal investigation it was con-
cluded to adopt the plan for the roof of the main building of wrought-iron
framing, and slate covering, the latter secured in place by wire to iron purlines,
and pointed underneath by a coating of cement.

A contract was made for the roof in July with the Phenix Iron Company, of
Philadelphia, the proposals from which were the lowest; but owing to unex-
70 REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE.

pected delays the iron frame was not received until too late in the season for
putting on the slate, without injury to the cement by frost. The work will,
however, be prosecuted as early in the spring as the condition of the weather
will permit.

The inside lining of the walls of the second story of the building, which had
been much injured by the fire, has been removed and its place supplied by anew

9 inch brick wall laid in cement, securely tied and clamped to the outer stone-

work.

The chairman of the committee has given personal attention to the work in
its progress, and can state from actual knowledge that the plans, material and
workmanship are of a satisfactory character, alike creditable to the talents and
careful supervision of Mr. Cluss, the architect.

The following is an exhibit of the whole amount expended up to the end of
the year 1866, on the reconstruction of the building:

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

OF

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, January 16, 1867
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, fixing the time of beginning of their annual session on the third
Wednesday of January in each year, a meeting was called for this day.
No quorum being present, the Board adjourned to meet on Monday, January 28.

’

WASHINGTON, January 28, 1867.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 8 p. m., in the laboratory of
the Institution.

Present: Chief Justice Chase, Chancellor of the Institution; Hon. Garret
Davis, Hon. J. W. Patterson, Hon. J. A. Garfield, General Richard Dela-
field, Professor Louis Agassiz, Hon. Richard Wallach, Mr. William B. Astor,
and the Seeretary, Professor Henry.

The Chancellor took the chair.

Professor Henry presented a general statement of the operations of the In-
stitution during the year, and of the present condition of the funds.

He also stated that, on account of the advanced state of the session of Con-
gress at the time of the passage of the resolution by the Board directing a me-
morial to be presented in regard to increasing the amount of the Smithsonian
capital in the treasury of the United States, and also on account of the appre-
hension that a larger sum would be required for the completion of the building
than was at first expected, he had deferred action until the present session of
the Regents, when further instructions could be given in regard to the matter.

After remarks by the Chancellor and other members of the Board relative te
the desirableness of increasing the amount in the treasury as the best means of
permanently securing the capital of the Institution, and of exhibiting to the
world the care and judgment with which the finances have been managed,

On motion of Mr. Wallach, the following resolution was adopted :

Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to present a memorial to
Congress in behalf of the Board of Regents,.requesting the passage of an act
authorizing the Treasurer of the United States to receive into. the treasury, on
the same terms as the original bequest, the residuary legacy of James Smith-
son, now in United States bonds in the hands of said Treasurer, namely,
$26,210 63, together with such other sums as the Regents may from time to
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS 73

time see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of
one million dollars; and that the income which has accrued or which may
accrue from said residuary legacy be applied i in the same manner as the interest
on the original bequest.

The Chancellor appointed Messrs. Davis, Patterson, and Garfield as the com-
mittee.

General Delafield, from the Building Committee, made a report relative to.
the work done and the expenditures on the reconstruction of the building during
the past year.

On motion of General Garfield, the report was accepted and the committee
continued.

Professor Agassiz remarked that he had just read the report of the Librarian
of Congress, in which it was stated that the addition of volumes from the Smith-
sonian Institution had increased the library of Congress one-third, and he wished
to call attention to the source of the accumulation of so large and valuable a
library as that of the Smithsonian, one of the best of the kind in the world.
He attributed it to the policy which had been proposed by the Secretary, and
so long sustained by the Regents, of publishing original contributions to sci-
ence, and sending these, with the greatest liberality, to every part of the world,
in return for which so many volumes of the transactions of learned societies
‘had been received, and without which system of publication and exchange
the present reputation of the Institution and such a library could not have been
acquired.

The Secretary stated that, since the last meeting, the death had occurred of
Mr. W. W. Seaton, Treasurer of the Institution and one of the original Re-

Mr. Seaton was for many years mayor of the city of Washington, and in
several of his messages recommended the councils to urge Congress to take
measures for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, and it was, finally,
through his personal influence and that of others interested in the cause of
science, that the law of 1846, authorizing its establishment, was passed. The
mayor of Washington is ex-officio, a Regent, a provision chiefly due to the
zealous interest which Mr. Seaton had manifested in the advocacy of the measure.
At the first session of the Board of Regents he was appointed Chairman of the
Executive Committee, a member of the Building Committee, and Disbursing
Officer. At the close of his term as Regent he was elected Treasurer, which
office he retained until his death, rendering gratuitous service during the whole
period.

On motion of Mr. Wallach, the following resolutions were adopted :

Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have learned with
deep regret the decease of WILLIAM W. SEATON, late Treasurer of the In-
stitution, who has been connected with it from its organization, and was one of the
original members of the Board. His long and gratuitous services to the Insti-
tution entitled him to our thanks, and his losa, in common with the citizens of
Washington and of the whole country, we deplore.
74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the family of the
deceased.

On motion of General Garfield, the Secretary was directed to have these
resolutions, and a suitable notice of the late Mr. Seaton, inserted in the next
annual report.

The Secretary stated that it would be necessary to make provision for sup-
plying the place of Mr. Seaton, and perhaps some new arrangements in regard
to the method of keeping the accounts, paying bills, &c.

The Chancellor suggested that the income of the Institution should be placed
in the treasury of the United States, or in a government depository ; and,

On motion, it was

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to consider the subject of the proper
deposit of the income, and of any change which might be necessary in regard
to the system of accounts, and repost at the next meeting.

The Chancellor appointel General Delafield, General Garfield, and the Sec-
retary as the committee.

The Board then adjourned to meet on Friday evening, at 7% o’clock.

WASHINGTON, February 1, 1867.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution was held
this day at 8 o’clock p. m. in the laboratory of the Institution.

Present : Chief Justice Ghase, Chancellor ; Hon. L. F. 8S. Foster, President of
the Senate; Hon. L. Trumbull, Hon. J. W. Patterson, Hon. J. A. Garfield, »
Hon. J. F. Farnsworth, General R. Delafield, Professor Louis Agassiz, Hon.
R. Wallach, and the Secretary, Professor Henry.

The Chancellor took the chair.

The minutes were read and approved.

The Secretary presented a petition from William De Beust, asking for remu-
neration for losses by the fire at the Institution.

On motion of Mr. Foster, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to settle with William De Beust
at a fair valuation for his tools lost during the fire at the Institution in Janu-
ary, 1865, in full payment of his claims, the amount not to exceed five hun-
dred dollars.

The Secretary presented the following memorial which had been offered to
Congress by the special committee :

MEMORIAL OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITU-
3 TION. :

To the honorable the Senute and House of Representatives in Congress assembled :
The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have directed the un-
dersigned to transmit to your honorable body the resolution herewith appended,
and to solicit the passage of an act in accordance therewith.
It is known to your honorable body that the original sum received into the
United States treasury from the bequest of James Smithson, of England, was
PRCCEED:NGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS 75

$515,169, which was considered a trust fund, the interest alone to be applied to
carrying out the purpese of the testator, viz: ‘The increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.”

This, however, was not the whole of the Smithsonian bequest, the sum of
£5,015 sterling having been left by Hon. R. Rush, the agent of the United
States, as the principal of an annuity to the mother of the nephew of Smithson.

The aunuitant having died, the sum of $26,210 63 has been received from
this source, and is now in charge of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States ; and no provision having been made in the act of August 10, 1846, es-
tablishing the Institution, for the disposition of this remainder of the legacy,
your memorialists, in behalf of the Board of Regents, now ask that it be added to
the original bequest on the same terms; and that the increase which has arisen
from in‘erest or otherwise on the sum before mentioned, also in the hands of
the Treasury Department of the United States, be transferred to the Board of
Regents for assisting to defray the expense of the reconstruction of the building,
and for other objects of the Institution.

And your memorialists would further ask that the Board of Regents be allowed
to place in the treasury of the United States, on the same terms as the original
bequest, such sums of money as may accrue from savings of income and from
other sources, provided the whole amount thus received into the treasury shall
not exceed one million dollars

The sole object of this request is the permanent investment and perpetual se-
eurity of the entire Smithsonian bequest and such other sams as may be accu-
mulated from savings of accrued interest, Jegacies, &c.

And your memorialists will ever pray, &c.

S. P. CHASE,
Chancellor.
JOSEPH HENRY,

Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

Resolved, by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, That an ap-
plication be made to Congress for an act authorizing the Treasurer of the United
States to receive into the treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest,
the residuary legacy of James Smithson, now in United States bonds in the
hands of said ‘lreasurer, namely, $26,210 63, together with such other sums as
the Regents may from time to time see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the ori-
ginal bequest, the sum of $1,000,000; and that the income which has accrued
or may accrue from said residuary legacy be applied in the same manner as the
interest on the original bequest.

Mr. Patterson stated that in behalf of the committee he had presented the
memorial to the House of Representatives, with a bill in accordance therewith,
which had passed unanimously that day, and been transmitted to the Senate.

Mr. Trumbull stated that this bill had also unanimously passed the Senate,
and only awaited the signature of the President to become a law.

The subject of the future policy of the Institution in regard to the museuin
and the appropriation of the large hall in the second story of the building,
was brought before the board by the Secretary, and remarks were made by
Professor Agassiz, Mr. Patterson, General Garfield, General Delafield, the Chan-
cellor, and the Secretary. .

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to consider what will be the best
use for the large room in the second story of the main building of the Inatitu-

tion.
76 _ PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The Chancellor appointed Messrs. Trumbull, Patterson, Agassiz, and the
Secretary as the committee.

General Delafield, from the special committee appointed at the last meeting
in regard to the depository of the funds, reported in part, and asked for further
time, which was granted.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.

; FEBRUARY 22, 1867.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 7 p. m., in the room of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, United States Capitol.

Present: Chief Justice Chase, Chancellor, Hon. W. P. Fessenden, Hon. J.
W. Patterson, Hon. J. A. Garfield, Hon. J. F. Farnsworth, Hon. R. Wallach,
General R. Delafield, and Professor Henry, Secretary. :

The Chancellor took the chair and the minutes were read and approved.

The Secretary stated that it had become his painful duty at this time to
announce the departure from life of another and one of the most important and
highly esteemed members of the Board. Since the last ‘meeting Professor
Alexander Dallas Bache, head of the United States Coast Survey and Regent
of the Smithsonian Institution, had, after a protracted illness, died, on the 17th
February, at Newport, Rhode Island, in the sixty-first year of his age; that
though this occurrence must be felt as a sad calamity by all familiar with the
progress of art, science, and education in this country for the last forty years,
and by all who had been favored with a personal acquaintance with the deceased,
yet he begged to be permitted to say that none, save his bereaved widow, could
feel the loss more deeply than himself. He had been on terms of brotherly
association with him for more than thirty years. It had been principally
through the influence of Professor Bache that he had been induced to venture
to accept the appointment of Seerctary of this Institution, and that with the
sympathy, counsel and support of the deceased, he had been enabled, through
all the eventful changes which had since taken place, to continue the discharge
of the responsible duties of the office.

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was

Resolved, That the highest honor is due to the memory of our respected and
beloved associate, Professor ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE, who, through
so many years of active life, has devoted, unselfishly and with untiring energy,
ereat talents, profound acquirements, and undeviating integrity to the advance of
art, science, education, and philanthropy.

Resolved, That inthe death of our lamented Dincic: this Institution, of which
he was a Regent and one of the executive committee from its first organization
to the time of his death, has lost an efficient collaborator, a sagacious counsellor,
and zealous supporter.

Resolved, 'That the members of the Board, in common with the Secretary,
lament in his departure the loss of a warm and tried personal friend, and that they
will always cherish the memory of his genial and sympathetic disposition, his
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS Ig

gentle and prepossessing manners, his refined taste, high moral perceptions, and
unswerving advocacy of the right.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of
the deceased, and that the Secretary prepare a suitable eulogy for insertion in
the next Annual Report.

General Delafield presented the annual report of the Executive Committee,
which was read and adopted.

The Secretary presented the following copy of the act of Congress relative
to the increase of the trust fund, referred to at the last meeting of the Board,
and a statement of what had been done in accordance with it.

[PusLtic—No 20.]

AN ACT authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to receive into the treasury the residuary
legacy of James Smithson, to authorize the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to apply
the income of the said legacy, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to receive into the treasury, on the
same terms as the original bequest, the residuary legacy of James Smithson,
now in United States bonds in the hands of said Secretary, namely, twenty-
six thousand two hundred and ten dollars and sixty-three cents, together with
such other sums as the Regents may from time to time see fit to deposit, not
exceeding with the original bequest the sum of one million dollars.

Sec.2 And be tt further enacted, That the increase which has accrued, or
which may hereafter accrue, from said residuary legacy, shall be applied by the
Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in the same manner as the in-
terest on the original bequest, in accordance with the provisions of the act of
August tenth, eighteen hundred and forty-six, establishing said Institution.

Approved, February 8, 1867.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the directions of the Board of
Regents, and the authority conferred by the above act, he had increased the
amount -of the Smithsonian fund in the treasury of the United States on the 19th
of February, 1867, to $550,000, in the following manner :

The interest, at 7 3-10 per cent., due for two years, to Feb-

18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

After discussion as to the further increase of the permanent capital,

On motion of Mr. Wallach, it was :

Resolved, That the Chancellor and Secretary be directed to dispose imme-

diately of the remaining United States 7-30 bonds, and the Indiana, Georgia,

and Washington bonds, now held by the Institution, and, if possible, from the
proceeds to place an additional hundred thousand dollars in the treasury of the
United States.

Mr. Patterson requested further time for the committee on the future use of
the large hall in the main building of the Institution, which was granted.

General Delafield presented the following report from the special committee :

REPORT ON ACCOUNTS, ETC.

The committee to whom was referred the subject of the deposit of the income,
and any changes which may be advisable in the system of accounts, respectfully
report that they have carefully considered the matters referred to them, and
recommend as fellows:

1. That the income being collected according to law, under the authority of
the Chancellor and Secretary, be deposited in a national bank, which is also an
authorized government depository, subject to draft, as hereinafter provided.

2. That no money be drawn from the depository except for the payment of
accounts which have been examined and approved by the Secretary of the In-
stitution, and which are in accordance with appropriations made by the Regents.

3. That all payments for bills exceeding twenty dollars, be made by separate
checks, drawn by the Secretary on the depository, and that for bills of less
amount, a check may be drawn for a number, as exhibited in a single statement.

4, That there be rendered quarterly to the Executive Committee, by the Secre-
tary, an account current, accompanied by abstracts of disbursements, supported
by receipted vouchers, for the expenditure of all money drawn from the deposi-

tory. ‘These vouchers to be made, as far as practicable, in accordance with the

forms hereto annexed, each voucher being complete in itself, and to contain the
facts and information thereon indicated.

5. That a check-book, ledger, and such other books of record as may be ne-
cessary, be kept in the office of the Secretary, so as to exhibit at any time the
financial condition of the Institution. The check-book shall indicate not only
the sums deposited, and drawn, but also the sources whence they were derived,.
ie the appropriation under which they were paid.

. That there be obtained from the depository, quarterly, an account current
receipts and expenditures, to be compared by the Executive Committee with
the accounts of the Secretary.

7. That the Executive Committee make a quarterly examination of the books

and accounts of the Institution, and, as usual, an Annual Report of the Board of

Regents.

On motion, the report was adopted.

Professor Henry announced the death of two gentlemen who had long been
identified with the Institution in connection with explorations and collections in
natural history, Robert Kennicott, esq , of simi in and Dr. Henry Bryant, of
Massachusetts.

On motion of Mr. Wallach, iis following resolutions were adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents have heard with deep regret of the death
of Mr. Ropert Kennicorr and Dr. Henry Bryant, gentlemen so long asso-
ciated with the Institution in its system of explorations and collections relative
to natural history, and that it tenders to the families and friends of the deceased
their heartfelt condolence in their loss.’

The Secretary presented the usual account of the operations of the Institution
for the year 1866, which was accepted, and, on motion of Mr. Wallach, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary communicate the annuel report of the Board
of Regents to Congress.

The Board then adjourned sine die.
4 SKETCH OF THE SERVICES OF THE LATE HON. W. W. |

SEATON IN CONNECTION WITH THE SMITHSONIAN INSTT —
TUTION, AND SOME NOTICES OF HIS LIFE AND PERSONAL

CHARACTER.

Amone the many friends and enlightened advocates of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, as at present established, none has been more constant and more efli-
cient than the distinguished and lamented citizen to whose memory the following
brief and imperfect notices are dedicated. ‘These notices are designed, in the first
place, to convey some idea of the character and value of his services in connec-
tion with the above-named establishment, as well by his co-operation in securing
for it as prompt and suitable a commencement as the circumstances of the time
permitted, as by sustaining eventually that plan of organization which corre-
sponded most nearly with the terms and spiril. of the bequest to which it owes
its existence. He is to be remembered also as a benefactor of the Institution by
his gratuitous and faithful discharge, for a series of years, of one of its most
responsible executive offices.

As is well known, the Smithson fund, paid into the treasury of the United
States in 1838, had been, with other moneys, lent by the government to the State
of Arkansas, and remained for eight years without appropriation to any object
contemplated by the donor. In 1846 Mr. Seaton, being then mayor of Wash-
ington, and surpassed by no one in zeal for the public good and in the influence
due to his rare social qualities, his known integrity, and peculiarly winning and

unaffected eloquence, united with other gentlemen of like feelings in urging

upon Congress the organization of an establishment which should at length do
justice to the benevolent and far-sighted views which had dictated the bequest.
Their labors, after much opposition, were finally crowned with success; the
good faith of the country was redeemed by an unconditional assumption of the
debt incurred by the improper disposition of the fund, which was now declared
to be a permanent deposit in the treasury of the United States for the objects of
the trust, while interest also was allowed upon the money from the time of its
receipt in this country. The Institution, organized in accordance with these
resolutions, was placed under the guardianship of fifteen regents, among whom
was included the mayor of the city of Washington, a provision chiefly due to the
zealous interest which had been manifested by Mr. Seaton in his enlightened
advocacy of the enterprise.

At the first meeting of the Board of Regents he was elected treasurer, and sub-
sequently one of the building committee. The former office he continued to hold
until the time of his death, and during the whole of this period, nearly twenty

years, discharged its duties without other compensation than the pleasure he .

derived from an association with the Institution and the laudable pride he felt in
MEMOIR OF HON. W. W. SEATON. 81

contributing to its prosperity and usefulness. It is well known that at the time
of the organization of the Institution a wide diversity of opinion existed as to
the practical means which would be most suitable for realizing the objects of the
legacy. Mr. Seaton, on mature reflection, finally gave his cordial support to the
policy which sought to impress upon the Institution a truly cosmopolitan char-
acter. He strenuously advocated the plan which the Secretary, then recently
elected, had been invited to submit to the Board of Regents, and which looked
to the advancement of knowledge chiefly through the encouragement and pub-
lication of original researches, a system which, without neglecting other available
means for the promotion and diffusion of scientific enlightenment, may be claimed,
without undue pretension, to have made the Institution favorably known, and
to have exerted a well-recognized influence wherever men occupy themselves
with intellectual pursuits.

The relation borne by Mr. Seaton to the city of Washington, the delight with
which he watched and aided its progress, a certain native taste also for artistic
embellishment, led him to take special interest in the architectural character of
the Smithsonian building and the ornamentation of the public grounds around it.

Mr. Seaton was a constant attendant at the meetings of the Board of Regents,
and from his familiarity with the early history of the Institution and the state
of the funds, as well as from his long experience in public office, was enabled
to offer suggestions, always marked by clearness of conception and soundness
of judgment. The social attentions which he was accustomed to extend to the
regents, especially those who were called from abroad to attend the annual
meetings, and to gentlemen invited to lecture before the Institution, were but
the expression of his characteristic hospitality ; but by thus adding to the plea-
sure of their sojourn in Washington, he contributed largely to increase the num-
ber of its friends and supporters. The columns of the National Intelligencer,
under his direction, were always open to the defence of the policy adopted and
the course pursued by the Institution, and he rarely failed to soften by the cour-
tesy of his manner and the moderation of his expressions, any irritable feeling
which might arise in the discussion of conflicting opinions. It would, indeed,
be difficult to say in how many and in what various ways he contributed to
the popularity as well as to the true interests of the Institution. The Secretary,
who was in the habit of conferring with him on all points requiring mature de-
liberation, may with justice acknowledge that he never failed to derive import-
ant assistance from the wisdom of his counsels.

Of a man so highly honored and, what in his case isa more distinctive phrase,
so greatly beloved by his fellow-citizens, the following biographical account,
gethered from a communication kindly furnished us by an esteemed correspond-
ent, will prove, we are confident, neither uninteresting nor uninstructive. It
will evince that his eminence was won not less by diligence in the pursuit of
a useful and laborious profession than by the graces of his personal character;
not less by his unwavering adhesion to principle and duty, than by the flexi-
bility with which he knew how to adapt himself to all the classes of men with
whom his varied life brought him into contact.

32 MEMOIR OF HON. W. W. SEATON.

He was a descendant in the direct line of a family of no little note in the
annals of Scotland. But however famed for wisdom in council and valor in the
field, the Seatons had for centuries been scarcely less distinguished for an un-
faltering attachment to the royal house. Hence, when the government of the
revolution of 1688 was finally established, Mr. Henry Seaton, with a number
of other Scotch gentlemen, despairing of any retrieval of the fallen cause of
the Stuarts, was led to cross the ocean and seek a new home and new fortunes
on the hospitable soil of colonial Virginia. It was in King William county,
Virginia, that William Winston Seaton, a lineal descendant of Henry Sea-
ton, first saw the light, January 11, 1785. His mother bore the name of
Winston, a family originally from Yorkshire, in England, but long settled
in Virginia, where it has always enjoyed great social consideration and in-
fluence. Mr. Seaton’s early training was under the roof of his father, Mr.
Augustine Seaton, at a time when the state of society may be said to have been
peculiarly conducive to the formation of habits of self-reliance, independent
thought, and a scrupulous regard for the feelings of others. ‘To the love of
study he added the love of the chase, a taste which accompanied him through
life, and which, exacting robust exercise and steadiness of aim, seemed to have
left its impress on his figure and action when he had reached the age of more
than fourscore years. In the days to which we now refer, schools and colleges
were not always at hand; books were not strewn broadcast through the coun-
try ; the library, which existed as an heirloom of some old family, was such
as they had brought with them from the Old World, received only rare acces-
sions, and afforded none-of those helps to easy knowledge which have perhaps
extenuated our mental culture in the same proportion that they have extended
it. If any special source of the love of letters, the refined taste, and varied ac-
quirements which so highly distinguished Mr. Seaton might be pointed out,
perhaps it would be found in the influence exerted on his opening mind by a
Scotch gentleman then living as a refugee in Virginia, the well known Ogilvie,
earl of Finlater, of whom few persons living at that day had not something to
tell, as well respecting his eccentricities as his diversified accomplishments.
But the mind on which these various influences acted was in itself well disposed
for vigorous and independent exertion. At the early age of seventeen young
Seaton was already prepared to enter on the business of life, and having adopted
political journalism as his future pursuit, he gave it his constant services to the
close ;. with how high and just a reputation for editorial equity, skilful manage-
ment, and fulness of information, is well known to all who have been observers
of the public events of our time.

After acting for some time as assistant editor of a Richmond. paper, he passed,
not without the prestige of early developed talent and force of character, to the
sole management of the Petersburg Republican, and subsequently to that of the
North Carolina Journal, of Halifax. Both Virginia and “ the Old North State”
were then peculiarly agitated by the passions and turbulence of political parti-
sanship ; the position of editor was not only environed with difficulties, but at-
tended with danger. Mr. Seaton, with a diffidence which was always charac-
MEMOIR OF HON. W. W. SEATON.. 83

teristic, had at first hesitated to accept a post on which so much depended for
his party, but every one who knew him will believe that when he had consented
to lead the attack on the stronghold of federalism at Halifax, he brought to the
service precisely those qualities which were requisite for its suecess—firmness
of purpose, consistency of principle, courtesy to opponents, fairness as well as
force in discussion. ‘It is claimed for him in fact that mainly through his well
directed exertions the reign of federalism was subverted in that part of the State
where he labored, and the ascendency fully transferred to those rules of consti-
tutional construction which were then known alike by the name of democratic
and republican.

We next find Mr. Seaton, scarcely twenty years of age, established at
Raleigh, and associated with Joseph Gales, senior, in the editorship of the
Register, the most influential journal of the State. It was in the family of Mr.
Gales that two incidents bearing with the most important results on the future
career and welfare of Mr. Seaton occurred. It was here that he met with the
late Joseph Gales, junior, som of the former, with whom he was destined to
maintain in the sequel an editorial connection of nearly fifty years, a connec-
tion which has inseparably associated their names, and whose fruits, as em-
bodied in the columns of the Nationa! Intelligencer, will ever constitute an
invaluable monument of the history and policy of their times. It was in the
bosom of the same family also that the crowning happiness of his life was real-
ized, in his union with Miss Sarah Gales, daughter of his editorial chief, and sis-
ter, therefore, of his future associate. ‘To refrain on this oecasion from drawing
aside for a moment the veil which covers the sanctity of domestic life, would be
to omit the most interesting and graceful chapter of Mr. Seaton’s personal his-

‘tory. His union with the honored partner of his life was marked by a mutual
tenderness so seldom paralleled, by a devotion so chiyalrous on the one part, a
reliance so trustful and unhesitating on the other, that it must ever be referred
to as the crown and complement of his earthly existence. The loveliness and
good report of this conjugal example were treasured, it may be said, as a per-
sonal pride and possession by the community in which, for fifty-four years, the
virtues, the talents, the ineffable grace of true womanhood, as exhibited in the
person of Mrs. Seaton, sustained and cheered the toils of her husband in his ar-
duous career.”

In the mean time, Joseph Gales the younger had been forming himself, under
the skilful guidance of his father, for the duties of a profession in which he was
destined to attain an eminence that few have approached, and eventually be-
came the proprietor of the National Intelligencer, then established at Washing-
ton. ‘In this enterprise he was subsequently joined by his brother-in-law, Mr.
Seaton, nor at the time of his accession did their united talents want for oceupa-
tion in the exasperated state of party feeling and the imperilled condition of the
country. It was in 1812, and hostilities had already been declared against
Great Britain. Without entering into the questions which then convulsed the
public mind, it is sufficient to say that the Intelligencer gave its earnest and able
support to the party which regarded the declaration of war necessary to maintain
84 MEMOIR OF HON. W. W. SEATON.

the power and secure the rights of the United States. In this state of things it
was not likely that either of our editors would confine his efforts in behalf of the
cause he had espoused to the labors of the pen and press; they were both mem-
bers of volunteer corps, and shared in the expeditions which were organized,
from time to time, to repress the predatory incursions of the enemy. But the
labors of the pen and press were, in their case, felt.to be of too much national
importance to be dispensed with, and a furlough granted alternately to one and
the other editor, provided for the uninterrupted appearance of the sheet to which
the public chiefly looked for authentic information and the vindication of gov-
ernmental measures. Mr. Seaton was at the editorial post on the morning of the
memorable 24th of August, 1814, when the report of the distant gun told too
surely that the enemy was advancing in force on the ill-prepared metropolis.
Hastily despatching his workmen to their respective corps, Mr. Seaton himself
hurried to the front and arrived in time to take part in the sharp initiative con-
flict which preceded the disasters brought on the American arms by incapacity
or want of concert on the part of the leaders and the consequent disorganization .
of an untrained and badly armed militia. The rout of Bladensburg led the
enemy directly into the city, and the results of the occupation, as regards the
destruction of the public buildings, are matters of familiar history. It is not
perhaps so generally known that a singular attestation was, at the same time, un-
intentionally afforded by Admiral Cockburn to the widespread fame and com-
manding influence of the National Intelligencer. He caused the office of its
publication to be sacked and its valuable contents to be destroyed ; too many in-
citations to patriotic effort had issued from that sanctuary to escape an ignoble
vengeance.

It has been seen that the course of Mr. Seaton’s life, from a period little ad-
vanced beyond boyhood, was such as to insure, indeed to necessitate, an inti-
mate familiarity with the men and events of his time, with all changes of public
opinion, with all discussions of constitutional law, with all the movements of
interest, prejudice and affection by which the affairs of the world are governed.
The thoughts, the passions, the motives of his fellow-men were necessarily with ©
him subjects of scrutinizing observation and intelligent reflection. When he .
removed to Washington the sphere of his observation and influence was of
course greatly widened. 'The trusted friend and counsellor of the earlier ad-
ministrations, there can be no doubt that, as he was the depositary of their
confidence, he often contributed in no small degree to shape their measures.
The intimate and honored associate afterwards of such men as Adams, Web-
ster, Clay, Calhoun, Berrien, and all the eminent statesmen of the past age, he
could scarcely fail, with his quick and penetrating intelligence, to gain such
insight into public affairs and to gather such stores of varied information as are
rarely within reach of a single mind. To him, therefore, would naturally resort
politicians and statesmen of every cast; for it was instinctively felt that in con-
sultation with him there was a candor which knew no disguise, a courtesy which
never failed, a fulness of information and clearness of judgment which his in-
trinsic goodness of heart placed at the service of all who needed them. The

same would be the case with the representatives of foreign governments, and
with all enlightened strangers, and thus his influence was often propagated to
other countries than hisown. But this subject has been so graphically, if quaint-
ly, touched by a contemporary journalist that we cannot do better than use his
words: “ There is a-parlorin Colonel Seaton’s old house at Washington,” says
this writer, ‘“‘ which, could its walls speak, would be more eloquent than the
walls of any other apartment in America. In that well-known room it was not
uncommon—we should rather say it was for years a weekly custom—for the
greatest men in the country, and the representatives of other nations, to gather
in the freedom of social intercourse. And this may be said with undoubted
truth, that in those free social conversations and exchanges of thought were
born many of the great measures of government which added lustre to the
American name, so that that room may be regarded as the birthplace of much
of our national glory.” —
_ After having filled successive municipal offices, Mr. Seaton, in 1840, yielded
to solicitations which had been often resisted, and accepted from the citizens of
Washington the dignity of the mayoralty, the highest which, wader the public
law, it has ever been in their power to confer. During the succeeding ten years,
in which he was uninterruptedly recalled with unprecedented unanimity to pre-
side over the affairs of the city, it is superfluous to say that he brought to the
discharge of his duties a fidelity and energy which distinguished him in all
situations, and which have stamped his administration as a model worthy of
imitation by all civic dignitaries. It would seem indeed to have rested only with
himself to fill the office to perpetuity, for when, at the end of the above period,
he peremptorily declined a re-election on the score of advancing years, his re-
tirement was regarded by all with undissembled regret. Nor is this matter of
surprise ; for if, in the unswerving discharge of duty, he had evinced an impar-
tiality and firmness worthy of honor, he had still more won the popular heart
by personal qualities which appealed to the sensibilities of all the good and all
the suffering. Accessible to all classes, listening with patient sympathy to the
story of need or wrong, which was ever promptly relieved or redressed, tender-
ly considerate of the humble and poor, his charity a household word wherever
he was known, he called forth a respect and love not accorded to the many,
and at last descended to the grave crowned by the blessings of those to whom
the withdrawal of his earthly presence seemed little less than a domestic
calamity. ‘

One point only in Mr. Seaton’s municipal adminisiration is it thought needful
here to particularize ; his persistent efforts in the establishment of the present
admirable system of public schools in Washington. A just tribute to his im-
portant work in behalf of education has been thus rendered by a municipal
colleague: “When Mr. Seaton entered upon the duties of the mayoralty there
were only two public schools in the city ; but justly estimating the value of a
new and improved system, he continued from year to year to press the subject
on the attention of the legislative branches of the government, until it was
adopted in the fourth year of his administration, from which time the number
86 MEMOIR OF HON. W. W. SEATON.

of schools has increased until their scholars now amount to twice a8 many thou-
sands as there were hundreds at the time of his inauguration. Among the
many beneficent acts of his official life this will stand pre-eminent ; and among
the many friends in whose hearts his memory will be longest cherished, there
vill be thousands who, but for his efforts, would have been denied the blessings
f education, and the manifold benefits resulting from that mental and moral
vulture which the children of all classes of our fellow-citizens nave since en-
_oyed by means of the liberal and enlightened system he so opportunely intro-
duced and established.”

This rapid sketch would be culpably deficient did we not endeavor to convey
some idea of the rare personal gifts and virtues of Mr. Seaton, in the sphere
where they naturally shone with a more benign lustre—his home; and this we
prefer to do in the words of one who knew and loved him well: “The centre of
all household thought ; obeyed by his inferiors with a service of love recalling a
patriarchal age; it was at home, in the daily amenities of domestic and social life,
that hewas supreme. Who can forget Mr. Seaton as host? In the gatherings about
his generous board mingled the cordial welcome and that air of an older and
better school which constantly distinguished him—the kindly and reassuring at-
tention, unaffectedly bestowed on the least distinguished guest, the colloquial
charm, which extended the fame of his hospitality far beyond the sphere of its
exercise. His conversation was indeed of an exalted character, lighted up by a
quaint humor and ready wit, enriched with varied and solid information derived
alike from men and books, marked also by originality of thought, by an utter
absence of self-assertion or dogmatism, by a delicate tact in shielding others
from the wound which a thoughtless or unkind word might inflict, and in drawing
forth to the best advantage the talents and attainments of each. Doubtless, no
unimportant part of the charm exercised by Mr. Seaton resided in his engaging
presence—in the winning smile, the bright eye, the gentle voice, the benignity
of a countenance upon which a long life of manly effort and kindly purpose had
left its impress.. In recalling these characteristics some idea may be conveyed
of an attractiveness which was not only widely recognized among ourselves, but
acknowledged by foreigners, especially the diplomatic representatives of other
governments, solicitous of obtaining from his lips an explanation of our involved
politics and those views of public measures which have been known on several
noted occasions to have materially influenced the deliberations of foreign eabi-
nets and determined their international policy.”

We know not how we can better close this account of the life and character
of a lamented colleague than by quoting the following passage from a discourse
delivered on the occasion of his death: ‘One of the finest intellects of this
country, and of the most devout, almost austere, evangelical faith, has repeat-
edly said, ‘that of all the men he had ever known Mr. Seaton was nearest
perfection and most ready to enter God’s presence.’ One of the texts on
which the deceased sometimes dwelt as being to him exceedingly suggestive
was, ‘As aman thinketh so zs he;’ and this might be termed the key-note to
his own character; without guile, trusting all, believing in all, his wide mantle
MEMOIR OF HON. W W. SEATON. 87

of charity and love covering all creeds, all humanity, his was truly ‘the spirit
which thinketh no evil.’ One of his most striking characteristies was the indomi-
table courage which, through life and to its extremest verge, led him to brave diffi-
culties and adversities with the same calm, unflinching decision with which he con-
fronted personal danger, and which enabled him to endure, with unsurpassed forti-
tude, the sufferings of mortal illness. Self-reliant, self-poised, upheld by his con-
sciousness of right and just endeavor, firm in his grasp of the immutable prin-
ciples of truth, and in his reliance upon a gracious and superintending Provi-
dence, his life was guided by a sense of responsibility as a free moral agent,
from whom a strict account of the talents committed to his charge was hereafter
to be exacted. He was constant and fervent in prayer. Often, months be-
fore, and during his illness, his voice was heard in the stillness of night raised
in petition to God. His last words on earth, the last tones of his voice vibrated
with the name of the Saviour. He was a ‘devout Christian; exalted honor his
instinct, Christianity his guide.’ ”

MEMOIR

OF

MAGENDIE.

BY M. FLOURENS, PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY C; A. ALEXANDER,

“WHEN one has otherwise a great deal of merit,’ says Fontenelle, “a general
conformity with other men is an added merit.” In the truth or value of this
maxim the eminent academician of whom I am about to speak was so far from
acquiescing that, in speculation as well as practice, he was generally prone to
assert a perhaps undue independence of the opinions and contempt for the
observances of others.

Of a spirit firm but sceptical, upright but aggressive, if his quick penetration
enabled him to discover truth, if he knew how to exhibit it with simplicity and
clearness, he was just as capable of putting forth a rough energy in combating
it whenever it did not come to him of its own accord. We might imagine him
armed with the lantern of Diogenes, and concentrating its light to see only the
results which he himself obtained; results, indeed, which elucidate one of the
most delicate points in the human organism, and will insure the duration of a
name for which he has earned honor and consideration. ‘That name had been
transmitted to him by a surgeon, originally of Béarn, who exercised his profes-
sion at Bordeaux when Frangois Magendie was born, October 15, 1783. In the
case of this infant, the pious solicitude, the tender affection which nature reserves
for the first stage of life, were sadly abridged; he was deprived, by an acute
malady, of his mother, almost before he could know the happiness of being loved
by one.

To the pleasing unconcern and confidence of infancy succeeded a precocious
and rude apprenticeship. Transplanted, as early as 1792, to Paris, he heard
nothing spoken of but the superlative work of Social Regeneration. His father,
a man of upright purpose, but incapable of allowing a folly to pass without
taking his share in it, conceived that, in order to endow his son with a civic en-
ergy corresponding to the elevation of his own principles, it was necessary to
educate him according to the precepts delivered by Jean Jacques. The new
Emilius, left to his own devices, wandered at will, with a liberty which strongly
resembled absolute abandonment. In order to preserve him from instructions
which might warp his judgment, he was left, on a principle of education, in com-
plete ignorance. His only resource as regarded the world of intelligence was ob-
servation, which alone (so said his guide) could secure to him entire endependence.

Finding, perhaps with reason, less difficulty in reforming abuses than in com-
bating maladies, the enthusiastic patriot had abandoned a practice which annoyed
him for the more congenial pursuit of unproductive civic appointments. With
the practice went the comforts of the household ; but what imported such a sac-
rifice as this? The exaggeration of patriotism and the reality of discomfort
proceeded to such lengths that he would have constrained his pupil, while seeking
to persuade him that this would be a further step towards independence, to make
gz MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

his own shoes. At this point, the good sense of the young man revolted; he
protested against all these follies; declared that he preferred to be dependent
and well-shod, and concluded by asking to be sent to school.

The primary school had no pupil more ardent; admitted late, and endowed
with an energetic will, the young Magendie quickly outstripped all competitors.
His father was not at all shocked at the inequality which his son found the
means of establishing from the first; but very generously pardoned him for it,
and clapped his hands at hearing the great prize adjudged to this neophyte of
fourteen years for an exercise ‘‘ On the knowledge of the rights of man and the
Constitution.” The Journal des Hommes Libres soon atterwards announced
‘(that there was still hope for the most tender age, when the corrupting poisons
of the reaction had not blasted it in its first bloom, since the son of citizen
Magendie, municipal officer, elector, member of the commune, &c., having met
with a child who was weeping and dared not appear in the presence of his father,
had comforted, encouraged, and carried him back to the bosom of his family,” a
tender asylum which had often been wanting to this extemporized protector
himself. A prize of virtue, ostentatiously awarded on this occasion, completed
the glorification of the young republican. It was with reference to this incident

that, in later life, M. Magendie, when the liberty was taken by any one of pro- —

testing against the too real asperities of his temper, would pleasantly reply that
before his fifteenth year he had obtained the proud triumph just spoken of
under the regime of equality, which must not be supposed to mean equality of
temper ; but that few certainly could boast of so precocious a virtue as himself.

According to the nearly constant practice of those who preach liberty, the
father of M. Magendie reserved the exclusive use of it for himself. He an-
nounced to’his son that, not to derogate from the family dignity, he must pre-
pare to invest himself with the robe and bonnet of the doctor. It had been well
if at the same time he could have inculcated the unhesitating faith and placid
self-importance, essential qualifications, from which the acute and discriminating
genius of the young man was soon to claim perpetual dispensation.

Introduced into the hospitals, the future adept there commenced his studies.
The judicious Boyer chose him for his prosector, and in a few months this pro-
sector transformed himself into a professor of anatomy.* Having obtained by
competition the position of house-surgeon, (znterne,) at the age of eighteen M.
Magendie was competent to his own support. He distributed his time into three

parts: the larger share was devoted to study ;f a second portion was reserved —

for instruction, which, practiced from the outset, extende] to all that he himself
had learned, and formed at once the delight and resource of his youth;t then,
poor but self-reliant, although the impressions received from his father had
‘imbued him with a republican roughness, yet by a sort of instinct, the lively and
last spark of the social distinction of his mother, he loved and courted the re-
finements of good society ; aristocratic and culpable refinements, which however
educate the character, mould the taste and invigorate the intellect ; these had for
him something of the prestige of forbidden fruit. A third part of his time, there-
fore, was consecrated to the intercourse of those saloons which, after the revo-
lutionary tempest, had opened at the first return of tranquillity, and in which,

* It was about this time that he contracted his intimacy with Dr. Ferrus, who is known
for his ingenious investigations and just views regarding the maladies of the mind.

+t With his medical he combined literary studies. Although he had been reared at an
epoch when it was the custom to swear only by Athens and Rome, when habits, manners,
and principles were all borrowed from those two republics, he had been taught nothing of
the ancient languages. Desirous of supplying this deficiency, he found the means of doing
‘so through the excellent courses of M. Lemare, which were attended also by some of his
most distinguished cotemporaries. He always felicitated himself in after life for having had
courage for this undertaking.

{ He thereby formed a talent which was peculiarly his own, that, namely, of teaching
forthwith whatever he had learned, and at the moment of learning it. This communicated
an indelible stamp to his instructions, which was particularly pleasing to the young.
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 93

through a memory of the common calamity, all were friends. Here he was
received as a young man of elegance and worth, and here he dissembled, with
truly Roman stoicism, the distresses of his situation. ‘“ Yet,’ as he himself
would jocosely say in after times, “during a period which seemed no short one,
there remained for me, all deductions made, not more than five sous a day to live
upon; and still I had a dog. We shared with one another; and if he was not
fat, neither was I.”

This energetic labor, this patient poverty, this aspiration for distinction, fortify
and elevate the spirit. Honor to the poor student'who sustains them! If, with
his scanty appointments, in his bare apartment, he cheers his vigils and animates
his ceaseless labors by a dream of success and glory, he does not deceive him-
self; it is at this price that they are purchased.

M. Magendie became assistant, and then prosector to the Faculty. This scho-
lastic apprenticeship opened for him a career; his dexterity as an anatomist, his
coolness, his hardihood, gave presage of a superior surgeon. But the life of
compelled fellowship, of equality reduced to practice, the contact of rivalships
never divested of means of offence, proved an intolerable ordeal for this austere
and imperious nature. From this ordeal sprang an invincible repugnance to all
acknowledged competition, and in order to escape this contingency he renounced
surgery.

To find in this world a path where one’s elbows shall be free is no easy matter.
Our difficult youth brooded with so melancholy a spirit over the obstacles before
him that his retreat was invaded by that bitter discouragement whieh long suf-
fering entails, and which the youth, especiaily the young physician, never fails

_to attribute to some malady, assumed to be incurable, but which invariably
vanishes before a gleam of good fortune. Magendie wished no longer to live;
in fact he asserted that he could not. But one morning a man of the law pre-
sents himself at the asylum of the student, who, having neither process nor
business, asks with natural surprise, what was wanted with him? “Nothing,”
replied the stranger, ‘that can be disagreeable to you. You have become the
heir of a sum of twenty thousand frances, and I am here to place it at your
disposal.”

The invalid found himself at once in a state of convalescence. Accepting this

- unexpected supply as but a temporary remission of the severity of his life, he
immediately made arrangements for the acquisition of showy horses and sportive
dogs, all placed in the care cf a sprightly and fashionable groom, who was
charged, besides, with the duty of keeping a light equipage always in readiness
for the use of the improvident but joyous owner of these superflnities. And that
not a moment of this transient prosperity might be lost, and at the same time no
encroachment be allowed on his conscientious studies, the whole of this appa-
ratus of luxury was lodged as near as possible to the hospital. ‘ Thither,” said

M. Magendie afterwards, “I used to ru when I had an instant to spare, so that

my whole recreation was literally centred in the stable.” ‘The twenty thousand
franes were, of course, soon spent, but a little relaxation does much good ; it had
renewed the elasticity of his spirit.

Independence, the golden dream of youth, seemed to withdraw itself for M.
Magendie within a circle which left him no choice but to be a physician, if iz
spite of himself: Such he was in effect, but he indemnified himself by main-
taining a state of permanent revolt by obstinately refusing to yield his faith and
homage to what he called the grand ide? of human credulity. This conflict, in
which he displayed infinite address and good sense, discovers to us the sceptic
disentangling from prejudices the art which he respects, and thus giving himself
the right to make his acquisition a somewhat costly one to the profession—a
profession which must still honor the superiority of his views and the austere

probity of his character.
_ The physicians of antiquity, beginning with Hippocrates, were at once phy-
94 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

sicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. “In the sequel,” says Fontenelle, “the
physician was divided into three; not, however, that one of the ancients was
worth three of modern times.” Three might suffice for the days of Fontenelle;
at present it would be necessary to divide into four. Under a vigorous impulse,
which is not yet spent, a new science.had established its right of naturalization
in our schools. Physiology, full of promise, lending itself readily to doubt and
controversy, captivated the enterprising genius of Magendie, and opened for him
a path to independent distinction.

“We anatomists,” said the old academician, Mery, “are like the porters of
Paris, who know all the streets, even to the smallest and most obscure, but who
know nothing of what is passing within the dwellings.” Physiology is precisely
the knowledge of what is passing within the human dwelling.

The study of the forces by which life is nourished and maintained was cultivated
in antiquity only by Galen, whose genius cast upon it some admirable gleams
of intelligence. A long silence followed ; more philosophic than practical, more
inquisitive than indispensable, at least in the beaten routine of human culture,
this science was transmitted without progress to modern times. In the seven-
teenth century, an English physician, guided by some confused lights derived from
a school of Italy, and protected by an enlightened sovereign, ventured, in spite
of popular prejudice, to practice upon living animals experiments which had be-
come indispensable for the solution of the problem he had proposed for investi-
gation. In this way Harvey detected the secret mechanism hy which heat and
life are maintained in the animal organism, and demonstrated the cireulation of
the blood. This discovery was a catastrophe for our old Faculties,* accustomed
to enjoy in peace all the sweets of time-honored ignorance; they protested, they
conspired, but in vain; the day of their ascendency was at an end.

-Fyom the identical school in which Rabelais had taken his degrees before
going forth to scourge fools and false knowledge with the lash of his caustie
genius, proceeded, in 1648, a young man who, applying himself to persistent
research, succeeded, like Harvey, in demonstrating a grand phenomenon, the
course of the chyle, thereby completing the explanation of our vivifying forces.
The admirable discovery of Peequet has scarcely availed, however, to save his
name from oblivion.t

Expelled by the vindictive thunders of our medical councils, physiology fled
for refuge to a German university, to Gittingen. There, under the imspiration
of Haller, was opened a series of delicate and profound investigations,{ ascending
from the study of the organs to that of the springs by which they are set in ac-
tion, a progression which leads to the loftiest summits of philosophy.

+ No eloge of Pecquet has been read in ouracademy. Astruc barely names him in his His-
toire de la Faculié de Medicine de Montpellier ; and 1 have nowhere been able to find the date
of his birth. Condorcet, in his Liste des Membres de V Ancienne Academie, contents himself
with saying: ‘‘He made in his youth, while at Montpellier, the discovery of the thoracic
duct and of the reservoir of the chyle.”” Now, Peequet did not make the discovery of the
thoracic duct, made nearly a century before by Eustachins. He made that of the reservour
of the chyle. He traced-—and this was the capital point--ail the (acieal or chyliferous vessels
(which Aselli, whe had discovered them, still supposed to proceed to the liver) to that reser-
voir, by that reservoir to the thoracic duct, qnd by the thoracie duct to the heart, thus

‘changing the whole doctrine on the course of the chyis. {See my Histoire de la Decouverte
de la Circulation du Sang.) Sprengel very properly says: “Certainly the discovery of Pec-
quet shines not less in the history of our art than the truth for the first time demonstrated by
Harvey.” (Histoire de la Medicine.) Thetruth would be, the discovery of Pecquet yields,
in physiology, only to that of Harvey.

iology in France. Bichat combined with the experimental method of Haller
bold and judicious views, drawn from a source where prejudice had been accus-
tomed to look only for style; he threw into technical language the ideas of
Buffon ;* invested them with the forms of the school, and supported them by
anatomical demonstrations. By the energetic cast of his genius Bichat swayed
his cotemporaries to the study of a science for which his own ardor extended
even to the sacrifice of his life. One of his school-fellows, Le Gallois, died also
in the same task ; but invested neither with the prestige of easy eloquence, nor
with the facilities of success afforded by comradeship, this modest precursor of
modern studies on the nervous system obtained from renown nothing but the
scantiest justice.t

Le Gallois was still living when M. Magendie presented himself in the arena
as a champion of undoubted pretensions. In his own person a strange but fayor-
able result of a training conducted on the principles of Jean Jacques, completed
by the severest teachings of our first republic, he had proceeded to frame for
himself a code of duties ; a code which did not save him from the eccentricity of
manifesting by turns the most inflexible selfishness and admirable disinterested-
ness; a rigid probity in the statement of his own labors, a culpable injustice or
contempt for those of others; a hard and intolerant humor towards every one
who seemed to stand in his way ; a kindness and generosity without bounds for
the feeble or afflicted.

It was by criticism that M. Magendie first made himself known.t In 1808
he reproached Bichat with having abandoned himself to hypotheses, and declares
that, for his own part, he shall admit no facts which do not find their confirma-
tion in experiments competent for himself to repeat. In 1809 he presented to
the Academy of Sciences a memoir on one of the most important phenomena of
the animal economy, that of absorption. If an active substance, a poison or
virus, is introduced into any part of the body, that substance is immediately ab-
sorbed—that is to say, is carried from the more superficial parts to the deeper
and more essential. By what organs is this transfer effected? Is it by the
veins, or by the lymphatic vessels? Haller thought that it was by the former;
John Hunter, by the latter; other physiologists hesitated. By a bold experi-
ment, M. Magendie suppresses the lymphatic vessels ;§ he leaves ouly the veins;

Celui des Mouvements du Ceur et sur te Siége de ce Principe. Paris, 1812. It is from this
book, a conscientious and profound labor, that dates, in France, the physiological study of
the nervous system.

{ See his memoir entitled Quelques Idées (énerales sur les Phénomenes particuliers aux
Corps vivants, ( Bulletin des Sciences Medicales, 1809, p. 145.) M. Bernard, the distinguished
disciple and friend of M. Magendie, has given a good summary of his little tract, which is
essentially but a criticism of the vital properties of Bichat. ‘‘ Why invent,” asks M. Ma-
gendie, “on occasion of each phenomenon of living bodies, a particular and special vital
force? Might we not content ourselves with a single force which we should call vital force
in a general manner, in admitting that it gives rise to different phenomena according to the
structure of the organs and tissues which operate under its influence? But is not even this
single vital function too much? Is there not here a simple hypothesis, since we cannot de-
tect it? It would be of greater advantage if physiology only commenced at the instant when
the phenomena of living bodies become appreciable by our senses.” (Notice sur M. Magen-
dic; Legon d Ouverture du Cours de Medicine au College de France, 1856, pits)

§ “‘M. Delille and I separated from the body the thigh of a dog previously comatized with
opium; we left untouched only the crural artery and vein, which preserved the communica-
tion between the thigh and the trunk. These two vessels were dissected with the greatest
care; their cellular tunic was removed, for fear that it might contain some lymphatic ves-

sels. Two grains of a very subtle poison (upas ticuté) were then injected into the paw;
the effects of this poison were as prompt and intense as if the thigh had not been separated
from the body. It might be objected that, in spite of all the precautions taken, the walls of
the crural artery and vein still contained lymphatics, and that these vessels sufficed to «ive

he even substitutes for the veins a quill, since the walls of the veins might pos-
sibly still conta some lymphatic branches; absorption takes place as rapidly
as usual, and thus absorption by the veins is demonstrated.

At all times there have been useful dissidents who have seemed charged with
the function of keeping our learned corporations awake. Such an one, amon
the predecessors of Magendie, was the physician Chirac, who had heretofore
maintained before the assembled faculty that the stomach remains inactive in
vomiting. Death had overtaken Chirac before he could conclusively verify the
fact. So favorable an opportunity could not escape M. Magendie; he proved,
by a decisive experiment, that Chirac was right, and that in the act of vomiting
the stomach does in fact remain inactive.* f

In a multiplied series of labors,t one of the most ingenious is that which he
"made public, in 1817, on the elasticity of the arteries. Doubts were still enter-
tained respecting the precise faculty by which the arteries co-operate in the
movement of the blood. By some it was maintained that they were z77ztable
or contractile like the muscles; by others that they were altogether passive. M.
Magendie proved that they are active, but in a manner which is peculiar to

passage to the poison. In order to remove this difficulty, I repeated on another dog the pre-
ceding experiment, with this modification, that I introduced into the crural artery a small
quill, on which I secured this vessel by two ligatures; the artery was then cut circularly be-
tween the two ligatures; the same thing was done for the crural vein: by this means there
was no longer communication between the thigh and the rest of the body, if not by the
arterial blood which flowed to the thigh and the venous which returned to the trunk. The
poison, afterwards introduced into the paw, produced its effects in the usual time—that is, at
the end of about four minutes.’’ (Magendie, Precis Elementaire de Physiologic, t. 1, p. 265,
third edition. )

* “Tt had been long thought that vomiting depended on the sudden and. convulsive con-
traction of the stomach; but I have shown that this viscus is nearly passive in the act, and

that the true agents in vomiting are, on the one hand, the diaphragm, and, en the other, the.

large muscles of the abdomen; I have even succeeded in producing it when, in a living dog,
I substituted for the stomach the bladder of a hog which I afterwards filled with a colored
liquid.” (Magendie, Precis Elem. de Physiologic, t. 11, p. 154.)

+ It will not be out of place to give herea summary account of a few among the numerous
works of Magendie not alluded to in the text.—Memoire sur l’usage de Vepiglotte dans la de-
glutition, 1813. Fyrom the experiments of this memoir, the author concludes: Ist, that the
epiglottis is not indispensable to the integrity of deglutition; 2dly, that it is especially the
movement by which the glottis is closed that guards the larynx during the passage of ali-
ments swallowed.—_Memozre sur les xmages qui se forment au fond de Veil et sur un moyen
tres-simple de les apercevoir, 1813. This means consists in making use, for the examination
of the images formed at the bottom of the eye, of the eyes of albino animals, (rabbits,
pigeons, &c.,) in which the sclerotic coat is transparent.—De l%nfluence de UVemetique sur

@azote, 1816. The result of this investigation is that substances which do not contain azote
(sugar, gum, &c.) are improper for nutrition. Although the animals submitted to experi-
ment were allowed these substances at discretion, and even consumed much of them, they

did not the less certainly die of inanition at the end of some days. Still further, it is shown —

that whatever the aliments employed, whether azotized or not, it is necessary to vary them.
‘‘ A rabbit and a Guinea pig, nourished with a single substance, such as wheat, oats, barley,
cabbage, carrots, d&c., die, says M. Magendie, with all the appearances of inanition, usually
in a fortnight, but sometimes mneh sooner. Nourished with the same substances given con-
currently, or successively at short intervals, these animals live and thrive. The most gen-
eral and essential consequence to be deduced from these facts is that diversity of aliments is
a most important rule of hygiene.” (Precis element. de physiologic, t. 11, p. 504, 505.)—

‘The persons attacked by gout and gravel,” says M. Magendie, ‘‘ are ordinarily great eaters
of flesh, fish, cheese and other substances abounding in azote, (nitrogen.) Most of the
urinary gravels, a part of the urinary calculi, arthritic tophus, are formed by uric acid—a
principle which contains much azote. By diminishing in the regimen the proportion of
azotized aliments, we succeed in preventing and even curing gout and gravel.” (Precis

of the active principle of ipecacuanha or emetine.

them.* Their action depends on their elasticity, an elasticity which is very
decided, but yet purely physical. ‘Lhe first object of experiments in physiology
is the distinction of forces ; M. Magendie already recognized this great aim, and
attains it here by a skilful discrimination. ‘The circulation of the blood com-
mences through the contractility of the heart, a vital force, and is continued
through the elasticity of the arteries, a physical force.

It is well known by how profound an aversion for all conjecture, by how
exact an observation of facts, the researches of M. de Laplace were marked, and
how much they contributed to maintain in the academy the severe spirit of the
experimental method. Laplace desired that all science should be but an assem-
blage of facts rigorously concatenated; and after having, according to the feli-
citous expression of M. Cuvier, subjected the heavens to geometry, he did not
despair probably of establishing the same order of things upon earth. The
decisive and absolute manner in which the young physiologist was accustomed
to draw his conclusions, not always safe, however, from subsequent retraction,
appeared to Laplace well suited to the style of a geometer. And if it be an
essential quality of the latter to yield deference to no one, few certainly could,
in this respect, be better qualified for the function than our colleague.

M.’ Magendie, confident in his own strength, held himself aloof with a dis-
dainful pride, eluding every ordinary encouragement. But it came to pass that
one day the illustrious, the rigid, the judicious Marquis de Laplace volunteered
the first advances towards him. Electricity is less potent, for this acts not on the
spirit, than are the few words of encouragement which fall from the lips of a
great man. Our sceptic thought himself secure from all enthusiasm, and was
only the more hurried away by it. It was not long after this that M. de Laplace
said to his old friend M. de Montyon: “ It is greatly to be regretted that learned

* The conclusions at which he arrived are: ‘‘ Ist, that the arteries, great and small, pre-
sent no trace of irritability.”” This we now know to be too absolute ; the arteries, especially
the small ones, are irritable. This does not hinder, however, their function in the circula-
tion from being principally due, as Magendie says, to their elasticity—to the elasticity of
their middle membrane, their yellow tissue. ‘‘2dly, that the contraction of the left ventricle
and the elasticity of the arteries supply a sufficient mechanical reason for the movement of
the blood in these vessels.” (Magendie, Journal de physiologie experimentale, t. 1, p. 114.)

Long afterwards, in one of his best lectures at the college of France, he recurred to the
part borne by the elasticity of the arteries in the circulation, and with a development well
worth remarking: ‘‘The part which elasticity bears in the great act of circulation is too im-
portant not to detain us fora moment. The heart—a central organ which may be compared
to an hydraulic pump—is intended to force continually, but by alternating impulsions, biood
into the system of tubes, which goes on subdividing itself, and constitutes what we call arte-
ries. These become reduced into extremely slender ducts which, under the name of capillary
vessels, proceed to inosculate with another system of tubes—the veins—which convey the
blood back from the periphery to the common centre whence it flowed. Such, on a large
scale, is the phenomenon of circulation. It is readily conceived that the contraction of the
left ventricle may be sufficiently energetic to drive the liquid into the arterial system, but is
its action propagated even into the capillary and venous conduits? This problem must now
be resolved in the affirmative.” [See on this point the researches of M. Poiscuiile, one of
his pupils, whem Magendie regarded as doing him most honor.] ‘‘ A first phenomenon is
this: the heart, each time that it contracts, throws into the arterial system a wave of blood,
and as each contraction is alternate, it follows that the blood must be projected by inter-
rupted jets. ‘This consequence is plain; yet observe now what passes in the vessels where
it circulates. If we open an artery near the heart the blood escapes in distinct jets; if the
vessel is distant from the heart the flow is uniform and continuous; and if we open finally
one of the small arterial ramifications which form the capillary net-work, the biood spreads
itself uniformly in a sheet. How comes it that an alternating pressure, like that of the con-
traction of the ventricle, can in the end produce a continuous efflux? By what process of
nature is this remarkable result accomplished? By the elasticity of the walls of the arterial
vessels. If I be not mistaken, I was myself the first to insist on this wholly mechanical
explanation, the only one which renders an exact account of this singular phenomenon. In
effect, the jet of blood which the ventricle projects into the aorta makes itself felt in all the
arteries whose walls it distends; the impulsion ceases, but the sanguineous current is not on
that account interrupted, for these walls contract upon themseives in virtue of their elastic
property, and exert on the contained liquid an energetic compression.”’ (Legons sur des
phénomenes physiques de lavie, t. 1, p 171-183.

bodies have not at their disposal the means of sustaining the zeal of inquirers
who have established themselves in the right method of procedure; the young
Magendie, for instance, who gives to physiological labors the invariable basis of
experiment, would deserve to be encouraged.” ‘“ Are not your own exhorta-
tions the most powerful of encouragements/”’ ‘They are not sufficient,” re-
plied Laplace; “for those who aspire to reach our academies there should be
graduated approaches, which would consist in competitions and prizes.” “Yours,
then,” rejoined the unostentatious benefactor, “be all the honor of the concep-
tion : dispose of whatever you think necessary ; I desire for myself nothing more _
than to have satisfied one of your enlightened wishes.’ The prize of experi- _
mental physiology was thereupon established, and on Magendie was conferred
the first distinction.*

His reputation attracted numerous auditors to the courses which he had long
before opened. In experimenting before them, he initiated them in his researches,
brought into play their sagacious curiosity, inspired them with the pleasure of
refutation. ‘Truth was what he sought with all his energy; to attain it, no surer
means, he held, could be found than to borrow nothing from either ancients or
moderns. Starting with the principle which he had established for himself, that
in science everything was to be reconstructed, he called everything in question,
allowing nothing to stand but what was capable of resisting his incessant con-
troversy.

The novelty of this instruction had its charms for the young; but the professor
was reproached for the sacrifices to which it condemned him. He held, however,
the transient sufferings of the victim a consideration of little moment in view of
the high and useful aim, the welfare of his species. As the practitioner, to save
a life, hesitates not to provoke a pain, so M. Magendie’s persistence in experi- —
menting on the living animal was no proof of want of sensibility. Let us re-
member that he shared with his dog when he had but five sous to live on, and
judge whether it is likely that he would be needlessly cruel.

In 1816 M. Magendie had published an Elementary Compend of Physiology.t
The science which, a century before, was ouly accessible to a few savants, is, in
this work, condensed and definitely circumscribed, so as to present to youth a

‘lucid and practical manual. In 1820 he founded a Journal of Physiology,
which, in a duration of ten years, collected the labors of diligent inquirers, pro-
moted the progress of the science, and extended the reputation of its editor.

About this time, impelled by an insatiable curiosity of observing and of -
knowing all that was being done in analogy with his own researches, he crossed
the channel. His presence in London was scarcely known before he was called
upon, at the solicitation of the principal physiologists whom the country of
Harvey then numbered, to repeat, with a ekill which seemed to pertain to
prodigy, the experiments by which he was enabled at will to suspend, accele-
rate, or reduce the forces of lifet So ardent was the admiration excited that it

* In 1814, M. Magendie, who had been twice before designated by the conscription, was
again summoned. On this occasion the academy interposed ; in view of his prospective ser-
vices, it requested his exemption, which was accorded by a special decree. ‘‘ You owe this
favor,” wrote the minister, ‘‘ to the success which you have achieved in the sciences.”

+ The date of the first edition was 1816; of the fourth and last, 1836.

{ ‘‘I was in the laboratory of Wollaston, engaged in repeating before this illustrious ob-
server some of my experiments on the nervous system. He was especially desirous of veri-
fying by his own inspection the effects of the section of the filth pair. I opened the
cavernous sinus or carotid artery, and a profuse hemorrhage ensued around the brain. The
animal was at once seized with convulsive trembling, and fell as if dead. Wollaston con-
sidered it to be so, and requested me to’repeat the experimenton another. I would prefer to
recall this one to life, said I, and, what is more, cause it to run as far as you please. He
thought that I was jesting. I then cut a certain point of the brain, and the animal darted
off like an arrow. Wollaston, of a spirit as judicious as exact, and habituated to reflection,
was vividly struck with the certainty and novelty of these results.” (Lecons sur le systeme
nerveux, t. 1, p. 198.) ;
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 99

gave rise to a counter-party. A prudish memorial was even laid before the
House of Commons, denunciatory of “ this stranger whose offensive temerity had
broken through all the humanitarian barriers established by English zoophilism.”

The institute had been the supreme ambition of M. Magendic; to reach it he
had combined both efforts and studies. It was a distinction which suited his
instincts of independence, of recognized superiority, of noble disinterestedness ;
not so the free test of the ballot; this suited him very little. The decisive day
having arrived, two of his pupils were commissioned to bring him news of the
result, which he awaited at home with lively anxiety. At length one of his con-
fidants hurries to him with tidings of his success. “This,” he exclaimed, “ re-
pays all my labor; my object in life is attained !””

From this epoch dates the special application of M. Magendie to the study of the
nervous system. “The inner man,” said Van Helmont, “is all nerve’’—Homo
interior totus nervus. It is, in effect, through the nervous system that man feels,
moves, wills, perceives, that he has intellectual life; all other parts exist only for
the service and support of this system.

“If we admire,” said, two centuries ago, the great anatomist Stenon,* ‘the
artifice of the fibres in each muscle, how much more must we admire it in the
brain, where these fibres, included in so small a space, perform each its operation
without confusion and without disorder!’? Stenon was right. What strikes us
most in the nervous system is the marvellous artifice with which all is there
arranged. The fibres, springing from the brain, in their prolongation form the
spinal marrow ; in detaching themselves, by distinct fascicles, from each side of
the trunk, they furnish suecessively all the nerves of the body; twenty times
they become associated, as often separated ; some run parallel with, others cross
one another; all is united and all distinct; everything touches, and nothing is
confounded; each fibre preserves its special play, its proper function; nowhere
is there disorder; and from the most intimate connection of the constituent
elements of the organ results the free exercise of all the faculties. How abysmal
a depth! and, in man himself, what subject more worthy of the meditations of
man !

Hence the first and perhaps the most ingenious, the most inventive of physi-
ologists, Galen, seems to have concentrated for this great study all that he pos-
sessed of penetration, of ardor, of critical discrimination. He blames Hippocrates
for having confounded the zerves with the tendons; Aristotle for having taken
the heart as the origin of the nerves, an error which he seems to impute to him
as a crime, (crimint dandum.) Aristotle had founded his opinion of the heart,
thus assumed to be the origin of the nerves, on the appearance of certain parts.
“But how long, oh, excellent Aristotle,’ exclaims Galen, “has it been the rule
to judge of the parts by their appearance? It is by their uses, their properties,
their functions, and by these alone, that we must judge of them.” Galen was
the first to distinguish clearly the nerves from the tendons; the first to see the
true origin of the nerves; it was he who first proposed the problem of the sepa-
rate loss of sensation and of movement :} a fundamental problem which it was
reserved for our own age to propound anew and to solve.

* I quote the entire passage: ‘‘ We are sure that wherever there are fibres in the body,
they maintain a certain correspondence with one another. If the substance of the brain be
everywhere fibrous, as in effect it appears to be in several parts, it must needs be admitted
that the disposition of these fibres is arranged with great art, since the diversity of all our
sensations and all our movements depends on them. We admire the artifice of the fibres in
each muscle; how much more must we admire it in the brain, where these fibres, enclosed
in so small a space, perform each its own operation without confusion and without disorder!”

+ Ubi vero pars aliqua convulsa est, &c. ‘*‘ When any part is convulsed, it’ must needs be
that the nerve appropriated for its movement, or the muscle, is affected. Hence if we found
our practice on the anatomy of the nerves, proceeding to the several parts, we shall more

100 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

In 1811 an English physiologist, a man of profound sagacity, after having
long meditated on this vast network of nerves, whose complication seems znex-
tricable, published a pamphlet of a few pages, in which, according to his own
expression, he submitted to his friends his views and ideas.

The principle with which everything in this tractate connects itself is, that
whenever two or more nerves proceed to the same part, it is not for the purpose
of repeating, of reduplicating therein the same action, but to indue it respect-
ively with a different function. For example, two nerves proceed to the face;
the one is for the voluntary movement, the other for the respiratory movement.
The tongue receives three nerves: one for the movement of deglutition, another
for the voluntary movement, a third for the sense of taste. ach nerve, there-
fore, has its determinate office, its precise mission. But it remained to clear up
a point still more difficult. ‘Tbe greater part of the nerves, all those, for instance, ©
of the spinal marrow, are at the same time motive and sensitive. Now, how can
this be? How shall two functions coexist in a single organ? It was-at this
point that, by an inspiration of genius, C. Bell conceived the idea of the duality
of each nerve, each being composed of two, the one for sensation, the other for
movement; in this we have the explanation why each nerve has two 7voots, and
in each root, taken separately, is seen the primitive, the simple, the distinct
nerve. M. Bell, therefore, submits each root to experiment; he obtains, as re-
pods one of the two, a clear and precise result, and from the property manifested

y this one he infers the property which resides in the other. |

This experiment, an ever-memorable though incomplete one, was the first step.
Ten years later, M. Magendie read to the Academy a memoir, in which he an-
nounced that having divided the anterior woot of a nerve he had abolished only
movement, and-that having divided the posterior root he had abolished onl
sensation. In this he had simply completed the experiment of M. Bell, but this
completion was in itself a new and important advance ; for here nothing was left
to deduction, but all was positive; the experimental demonstration was perfect.
It seems that, in England, all the import of the discovery to which the name of
Bell had been first attached, was only comprehended when it became known
there how much admiration was excited on this side of the channel by the subtle
investigations of Magendiec.

The impression produced by the rare sagacity of our dexterous experimentalist
was still in the ascendant when: he himself, by one of those abrupt changes to
which he was but too subject, gave a complete denial to his previous results.
On this occasion the vacillation was not without excuse; in an inquiry so deli-
cate, the further the exploration was carried the more complex became the
enigma. ;

M. Magendie, an experimentalist far more practiced than M. Bell, could not
multiply his researches without perceiving that the root recognized as motive,
that is to say, the anterior one, yielded signs of sensibility. Whence did it derive
that sensibility ? Unsparing towards himeelf, fully as much as towards others,
M. Magendie passed twenty years of his life in seeking the solution of this new
problem; and we may say to-day, to the honor of his memory, and before this
Academy which so greatly applauded it, that he found that solution. :

criminated by Herophilus and Eudemus, the first, after Hippocrates, who accurately de-
scribed the anatomy of the nerves, and who thus have left no slight occasion of perplexity
to physicians in icgard to the fact that, through palsy of the nerves, sometimes the sense
only, sometimes the motion, and sometimes both together, are abolished. Wherefore, when
motion is lost, this we mostly call palsy (resolutio) of the nerves; but where the sense of
certain parts has perished, we are accustomed to say rather that such part is devoid of sensa-
tion, although there are some who call this affection a palsy of the sense. We leave to cach,
however, to apply these names at his pleasure. Physicians lose sight of the fact that
the nerves distributed through the skin of the hand, and by which the faculty of sensa-
tion is conveyed to it, have theirappropriate roots, and that there are other roots of the
nerves by which the muscles are put in motion.” Galen, De Loc. Affect. p. 21, apud Juntas,
Venice 1597
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE . : 101

The sensibility of the anterior root, of the motive root, pertains not to that
root, is not its own, is in fact but a derivative from the posterior root. This
derived or reversionary sensibility, which M. Magendie afterward denominated
recurrent sensibility, constitutes his discovery. And by this discovery, so deli-
eate and so difficult to achieve, he has restored to the principle of eaclusiveness
of action all its purity, for he has shown that, considered apart and in itself, the
anterior root is solely motive, as the posterior root is solely sensitive. As long
as M. Magendie lived these striking results were contested; nay, they are still
contested, but they are not the less incontestable. The recognition which co-
temporaries evade, is compensated by the admiration of posterity.

M. Magendie was admitted to the Institute in 1821. Having had sufficient
addre&s to secure his acceptance without dissembling his original humor, without
subjecting his ineradicable spirit of sarcasm to constraint, he was quite sure to
discard neither the one nor the other when he had attained his object. His
colleagues—the practitioners—had admitted him into their Academy from its
foundation, inasmuch as till then he had shown himself a sufficiently respectful
disciple of Hippocrates, although he believed in nothing, and in medicine less
than anything else. With a future conspiring to that end, convictions might
have reached him; but a future like his, embellished by the sympathies which
his scientific success assured him, could but conduct this intractable associate to
open revolt.

In our own ranks he fulfilled conscientiously the duties imposed on him; in
the labor of the committees he showed himself as active as he was judicious and
clear-sighted ; several reports of his were real studies, But he held in reserve,
at the service of certain of his privileges, those abrupt sallies whose suddenness
disconcerted prevision and set at naught all academic tradition. He never
insinuated that an opinion was erroneous or a fact misstated; he plainly said
so. When a professional colleague—a physician—aspired to the Institute, his
suffrage was, of course, to be solicited; but unless the impulses of affection
tended that way, he defended the position as one who did not believe in the
necessity of sharing it, and opposed to the ‘foibles of the candidate a frankness
which left nothing to be guessed at. When substantial titles to success ap-
pealed to his probity, he would content himself with saying, as he turned away:
“ Well, well! you shall have my voice, but not my hand.”

A still more serious danger beset our academician: having dedicated himsclf
without reserve to physiology, he had arrogated that department of science to
himself as a domain which belonged to him in his own right. No point of it
could be touched upon without arousing his jealousy: either he had treated of
it, or he held it mentally in reserve with a view to inquiring what new aspect
could be given to it by experiment.’ In this state of things an aspirant who
stepped from the ranks became an enemy. ‘Transported beyond all self-posses-
sion, M. Magendie would on such occasions reappear before us as the man who had
been reared in a complete exercise of the privileges of democracy, until reflection
and the intrinsic probity of his character admonished him how much, by such
injustice, he had descended below his proper level.

. Sarcastic, self-confident, and intellectual, there was here more than enough to
insure a good position in the world. Accordingly a select body of patients
awaited him without his seeking; but it was necessary that these patients should
renounce the comfort of being consoled for imaginary complaints ; that, con-
formed to his humor, they should accept plain truths, and submit to reprimands
and caprices. In spite of all, as Sganarelle expresses it, “they were so be-
witched with an idea of the man’s skill,” that, on the noise of the reputation
which they created for him, he was sometimes approached by those unhesitating
advocates of medical infallibility who venerate the yoke and would think all was
lost if their faith did not increase in proportion to the obscurity of the doctzine.
In laying before such persons the scanty inventory of his own crecd, M. Ma-

-gendie would throw their frankness into ludicrous perplexity, and finish by
assuring them that all they needed was to be cured of their tendency to credulity.

To the ardor of young practitioners vaunting the success of their prescrip-
_tions he opposed his own experience, saying to them with pleasant irony: “It
is plainly to be seen that you have never tried the plan of doing nothing.” If
the extreme simplicity of this mode of treatment elicited not unreasonable ob-
jections, ‘‘ Be assured,” he would add, “that, for the most part, when disturb-
ance manifests itself, we cannot discover the causes; we can, at most, only
verify the effects. Our usefulness, in presence of the efforts of nature, which,
in general, tends to the normal condition, consists in not interrupting them; it
is only now and then that we can aspire to be sufficiently skilful to aid them.”

On a certain occasion, when quitting a young person whose condition pre-
sented alarming symptoms, he said: “ Let him do just what he pleases; that is
all I prescribe.’ Usually sparing of his time and visits, in behalf of this child
he lavishes both, but adds nothing to his medication. On the evening of the
third day, all at once his brow clears up, and, taking the invalid by the ear, he
exclaims: “ Little rogue, you have not allowed me a moment’s rest; go now
and walk about.’ The delighted father asks: “ What, then, was the matter
with the child?’ ‘What was the matter? upon my word I don’t know;
neither I, nor the whole faculty, if they were sincere, could tell you; what is
certain is, that everything has returned to its normal state.” And with this he
disappeared.

The greater portion of the medical career of M. Magendie was devoted to the
unfortunate; he preferred the hospital to other practice. ‘Twenty years of ser-
vice as physician in the wards showed us this rigid and wayward man, gentle
‘and patient on approaching the bedside of the indigent ; the earnest thinker,
the inflexible censor listening to and consoling the poor women of the Salpé-
triere ; receiving with emotion the humble testimonial which they offered him ;
and not quitting that establishment for the H6tel-Dieu, in 1830, without stipu-
lating for himself the right of continuing to extend to the former his disinterested
benefactions. .

A chair of medicine having become vacant at the College of France, the
minister, desirous of reconciling public opinion with the tendencies of the gov-
ernment, thought proper to require some concessions from the rigid candidate
whom that opinion indicated. Conducted by a friend to M. Frayssinous, and
surprised at having allowed himself to be thus entrapped, the strange candidate
maintained so stately and formal a reserve, that the eloquent minister—a great
master in point of conferences—saw this one come to an end without having
produced any relaxation of the jealous rigidity of his interlocutor. On retiring,
our humorist shook his head and remarked: He is not yet strong enough for me.
M. Recamier received the nomination.

Three years later, in 1830, M. Magendie was put in possession of the chair.
It was then that he gave free course to his ardor for experimental art, and it is
surprising to what an extent he lavished his experiments. Yet for this who
can justly blame him? It was from these extemporized experiments that often
sprung the boldest and most happy results. He had the gift of seizing phe--
nomena in passing, and, as it were, on the wing. Endowed with keen curiosity,
prompt and impulsive by nature, improvisation was of the essence of his genius.

The success of hap-hazard experiments, however, is not art. Art demands,
first. of all, combination, reflection. It is not the experiment which investigates :
it is the mind which investigates through the experiment; it is the mind: which
discovers, which invents the means by which the discovery is made. Buffon
has said with a profound sense: “The best crucible is the understanding.”

The lessons of M. Magendie at the College of France have been collected in
two separate works: one on the Nervous System; the other on the Physical
Phenomena of Life. 'The latter presents the professor under a new aspect. ©

_ Bichat had exaggerated the part played by the vital properties ; M. Magendie
exaggerates, in turn, the part played by the physical properties.* Their oppo-
sition has rendered both more useful ; it is only by multiplying special points
of view that we arrive at a view of the whole.
Through a profound alliance, which forma the zodus of life, everything in our
organism concurs: the physical forces like the vital. And even these two
orders of forces do not represent the man in his completeness; above the vital

forces preside the psychical or intellectual forces. Sensibility is not a physical
force, nor is thought a vital force.

As there is a superior philosophy, so there are commodious philosophies. I
eall commodious—and without allusion to M. Magendie, who belonged to nonet—
all philosophy which breaks its subject to pieces and takes a fragment for the
whole. The superior and true philosophy embraces the complex being, and,
in that complex being, arrives at unity, not by the arbitrary exclusion of such
or such parts, but by a clear and distinct view of the precise function of each.

M. Magendie would, for his part, have said with Pascal, though with less
profound meaning: “ We do not think the whole of philosophy worth an hour’s
trouble.” His vocation did not lie therein, but was that of a great experiment-
alist. Having received from Bichat the torch of experimental art, he bore it
with a steady hand for forty years; indefatigable in labor, bold in exploration,
making no account of any sect, neither of materialism nor of vitalism, incapable
of the spirit of sectarism, he sought truth with entire independence. This
emancipated reason of his was his distinctive stamp, securing him the esteem

* One of the points, of this kind, in which he has indulged the greatest exaggeration, is
that which regards absorption ; this he reduces to imbibition ; but even here fhe exaggeration
consists rather in the expressions than in the fundamental idea. He calls absorption a
wholly physical phenomenon, and in this he is mistaken; there is but one thing purely physi-
cal about it, namely, the imbibition.

He very properly says: ‘‘ Now, we all know that every substance, whether acid or alka-
line, wholesome or deleterious, is absorbed as soon as it is placed in contact with our tissues.
There is herein nothing but a phenomenon of imbibition, and all that has been said of the
intelligence of the pores is only a romance at present out of date.”” What he adds touching
the different functions of the veins and lymphatic vessels in absorption is also very just:
“*No doubt the lymphatic vessels can absorb, since their walls, like those of the veins, are
porous and susceptible of being imbibed with the liquids with which they happen to be in
contact. Recall now the division which we have established in the mechanism of absorption.
We there see two phenomena entirely distinct: on one hand, a local imbibition of the liquid;
on the other, a transfer of the liquid imbibed into the current of the circulation. The former
property is common to the two orders of vessels; but, as regards the second, do we find
united in each the conditions necessary for its being effected? I have satisfied myself that,
in most circumstances, the lymphatic vessels are not filled with liquid, nor traversed by an
interior current ; hence, most frequently they are not, they cannot be agents of absorption.
The veins, on the contrary, destined to convey without cessation the blood from the periphery
to the centre, must, by just right, be considered as the habitual channels by which the liquids
are absorhed.”” (Legons sur les phenomen. physig. de la vie, t. 1.)

t It is very true that he would willingly have explained everything by physical forces, if
he could; but he clearly distinguished in the living organism the physical from the vital.
And who could confound them? The art is in separating them. ‘‘ Begin always,” he says,
‘“by analyzing the phenomena, by isolating what is physical from what is vital.” (Lecons
sur le syst. nerv., 1, p. 4.) ‘‘ I distinguish, in vitality, two great classes of phenomena: the
one comprises physical phenomena, the other vital phenomena.”’ (Leg. surles phen. phys. dela
vie, t. 1, p. 14.) ‘* Far be it from me,” he further says, ‘‘ to exaggerate the importance of
physical explanations. Thus, why is it that, under the influence of a moral emotion, more
or less vivid, we see the face redden or grow pale? There is here something peculiar,
something which belongs not to the domain of physics.” (Jbid., t. 1, p. 202.) Elsewhere
he says: ‘‘ To seek to explain a physical phenomenon by vital laws, only because that phe-
nomenon occurs in a living body, is an idea quite as irrational as to speak of vitality in ref-
erence to an inorganic body.” (Lec. sur le syst. nerv., 1, p.3.) Finally, his conclusion
thereupon is that ‘‘Physical laws lose nothing of their authority for being exercised in
organized bodies. Observers only have been wanting to follow them into this living world,
this microcosm of the ancients. Each function, each organ would easily furnish us the proof
of it; and is it not, of itself, exhibited in the senses, the movements, the voice, the circulation’
of the blood, &c.?”” (Leg. sur les phen. phys. de la vie, t. 1, p. 310.)

of thinkers, who know how little intellectual partisanship is worth, and the
sympathy of the young, who delight to owe their convictions only to themselves.

“‘Men pass,” says the philosophic Bacon, “and knowledge is increased ;”’
mults pertransibunt et augebitur scientia. Taller, Bichat, Magendie, had
scarcely constituted physiology, properly so called, the human physiology, when
a much wider horizon was disclosed. Thanks to comparative anatomy, that
antique study restored to our age, the view of the physiologist has been enabled
to embrace the total assemblage of living beings. To observation, to experi-
ment, it has become possible to add the art, not less subtle and prolific, of unin-
terrupted comparisons; comparisons have brought to view relations; relations
have guided us to laws. ‘ Laws,” says Montesquieu, “are the necessary rela-
tions of things.”

A new philosophic spirit, born of science and superior to science itself, pro-
pounds all the great questions of life, no longer studied only in each particular
being, but considered as a constituent element of the universe: its origin, its
antiquity, its gradations, its successive variations; it is a spirit which shrinks
not from disentangling, from following up the profound relations which connect
the history of life with the history of the globe; it sees the globe and life’ de-
veloped by a common evolution ; concerted progress reveals the unity of design ;
and to recall an eloquent phrase of the Roman orator, “it almost lays hold upon
Him who governs and controls everything—ipsum cuncta moderantem et regen-
tem pene prehenderit.” Mitt

Towards the commencement of 1832 the ordinary course of M. Magendie’s
life was turned aside. Vague and ill-boding reports were spread abroad, nor
was the phantom, though distant at first, slow in disengaging itself from its
shadows and presenting to our excited imaginations the assurance of a comin
pestilence. ‘hen, when under the pressure of fear personal susceptibilities had
become acute even to cruelty, the noblest of purposes formed itself in the mind
of our colleague. Coming one day to our ordinary session he said to us: “I
am a physician, and that vocation summons me to the focus of the evil. I go
to Sunderland ; hoping that I shall be able to bring you thence, by studying
the cholera in the place of its appearance, some useful indications! Invest me,
by delegation from your body, with more authority.” Everywhere he was
received with interest and respect. Having reached the seaport, the centre of
contagion, he is informed that in a population of fishermen scattered along the
neighboring coast had occurred the outbreak of the disease. Proceeding directly
thither he finds collections of individuals exposed under miserable huts to all
the rigors of humidity, uncleanness, and vice, living, sleeping, eating between
the dead and the dying, and with instincts so brutal as to forbid the hope of any
helpful intervention.*

Ordinary contagion was not an admissible theory. When anxiously asked, |

on his return, “ What is it? what shall we do?” the only answer which could
be drawn from him in his dejection was: “I do not clearly know.”

Paris was still throbbing under the dread presentiment when the pestilence,
clearing the interval at a single bound, burst upon us like an explosion. Who
does not remember that at the outbreak, the extreme violence of which had till
then been unexampled on our continent, a man stricken was a man dead?
Summoned on the first attack, from that moment M. Magendie was no longer
at his own disposal; “it was towards the hospital that he directed his steps.
“The rich,” he said, “ will not want for physicians ;” and traversing the ranks
of a deluded and infuriated crowd from which issued the ery: “ Vengeance,
death to the physicians, death to the poisoners !” he ascended the steps of the
Hotel Dieu, renewing his self-forgetfulness on a thousand occasions in behalf of

most distinguished members of our Faculty.

wretches reduced to the state of an inert mass, fecling no pain but that of in- -

spiring distrust, and finding his recompense in the liberality with which his
purse was emptied for the succor of such as were saved and restored to their
families.

The duration, the rigor of the pestilence found the forces of M. Magendie at
their own level. Calm having been somewhat re-established, the cross of the
legion of honor was sent to him. “TI think it very well awarded,” he remarked.

Having satisfied his conscience, he returned to his labors, occupied himself
anew with inquiries respecting the nervous system, resumed his instruction ;
but his lectures on the cholera, and still more his bearing, evinced that this man,
who was accused of insensibility, had not passed with impunity through an
interval of heart-rending emotions. Impelled by a secret preoccupation, he ap-
plied himself to an investigation of the agents under the influence of which epi-
demic maladies may be generated.

Being shut up one day in his laboratory, he was giving his whole attention
to an experiment, when lifting his eyes they met those of a sedate and portly
personage who, in abrupt tones, asked to speak with Magendie. From the first
glance at the broad-brimmed hat scrupulously kept on the head, the short
breeches, the peculiar cut of the vesture, the experimenter comprehended the
quality of his visitor. ‘I had heard speak of thee,” said the Quaker, “ and was
not misinformed; I come to say to thee that thou shouldst desist from these
experiments. Who has permitted thee to dispose of the life of these animals ?””
« Your countryman Harvey,” replied M. Magendie, “ would not have discovered
the circulation of the blood if he could not have sacrificed the deer in the park
of Charles I. Here science contends against the maladies inflicted on humanity,
as elsewhere war contends against the incursions of barbarism. Perhaps,” he
added with complaisant deference, “you would condemn the chase.” “ Cer-
tainly,” replied the inflexible Quaker; ‘I condemn the chase, I condemn war,
and experiments upon animals; man therein assumes rights which do not belong
to him: I mean to prove it, and I shall travel until I have made those wrongs
disappear from the world.” Probably this reformer is still on his travels.

A sojourn in the country came very opportunely to diversify our savant’s
course of life. Under'the influence of a smoother existence this heretofore un-
manageable nature was led to unbend itself. He had married ; he saw that he
was understood even in the foibles of his character, and, like a man of sense,
took the part of laughing at them. “I agree,” he said resignedly, “that I am
nothing but a real bull-dog.” Happy days were ushered in by this frankness ;
friendly neighbors came around him to applaud his experiments on vegetation,
on agricultural ameliorations, attempts which, he said, might enrich science and
the country, but whose immediate result was to diminish his own fortune. ‘To
fire-side happiness, to the charms of a lively society, he joined the pleasure of
doing good. For the suffering in his neighborhood, dispensing with a part of
his medical principles, he had established in his house a small, but very small
pharmacy. Of all remedies that which he oftenest put in practice was to pay
the invalid for the consultation which the invalid received.

No trace of the republican recklessness and rudeness remained, except per-
haps in the malign pleasure which from time to time M. Magendie still allowed
himself, of demolishing all our governments ; and that with so hearty a denun-
ciation that a judicious friend once said to him: “If to-day a government were
created to your mind, in six weeks you would find it the most detestable in the
world.” “Very possibly,” he replied. “It is certain, however, that not one
of them can boast of having received a solicitation from me.”

Tt was, in effect, without solicitation that in 1848, on the establishment of the
consultative commission of public hygiene, he was nominated its president.
The firmness with which he interdicted the admission of all charlatanism into
this institution, the clearness and justness of his views, rendered his influence
106 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE,

there of great utility ; there, as everywhere else, he commanded general esteem,
and more than elsewhere showed himself accessible to friendship. He had
eight years before been called by the ministry of war to the presidency of the
commission of hippiatric hygiene. Here the information which he conveyed
became the source of ameliorations of which our cavalry still enjoys the benefit.
In 1851 the cross of commander of the legion of honor was sent to him; at
this, however, he took umbrage, fearing that the services which he had rendered.
would thus lose the merit of disinterestedness.

A grave alteration which manifested itself in the health of M. Magendie
revealed that one of the organs essential to life was attacked. 'Thenceforth he
came but rarely to our meetings ; thenceforth there survived for us, in place of
the capricious and difficult colleague, only the man of uncontested eminence.
Nothing was remembered but that undeviating rectitude which gave so much
strength to the personal attachments of which he was the object ; and when,
still later, it was known that the malady had become more serious, devoted dis-
ciples, grateful pupils, relations, friends, colleagues felt a common alarm ; asperi-
ties were forgotten. It was said by Fontenelle of an academician of his time :
“Those who might have had something to complain of in regard to his blunt-
ness, all went to see him ; he was touched by the expression of sentiments which
he had merited more than he had attracted.” M.Magendie also received with
cordiality and acknowledgment the expression of the sentiments he had merited.
“Know,” said he to his old competitors, “that my asperity increased in pro-
portion to the worth which I recognized in those towards whom I exercised it.”
So ingenious is self-love that each found in this strange mode of appreciation
wherewith to be satisfied.

It was impossible to enter the room of the invalid without being struck with
the grief which impressed the countenance of a servant whom thirty years’ con-
tact had rendered the grotesque but faithful copy of his master. Watching
anxiously by his pillow this attendant heard him announce, with calmness, the
hour of separation. ‘Courage, my good master,’ he exclaimed, carried away
by a pious attachment, “courage, 1 beseech you; we shall still grumble on
together.”

The moral force which this upright man had so studiously cultivated was
respected by the malady. His sufferings did not distract him; he studied them
as phenomena. “You see me here completing my experiments,” were his
parting words to a colleague; “never has the science to which I have devoted
all my strength appeared to me environed with more grandeur; the springs of
life, so marvellously combined, are quickened in order to make of each of us an
instrument of passage, which in perishing is regenerated. In my restricted
course may I but have succeeded in planting some way-marks along the route
which leads to Trutu, the sole power to which I have subordinated my
reason !”’

M. Magendie died the 7th of October, 1855

APPHRRDIX’ I,

ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS OF THE
NERVES.

I.—M. Bell published, in 1811, a pamphlet, under the following title : Idea of
a New Anatomy of the Brain, submitted for the observations of his friends. In
this he first announces his ingenious idea that each nerve, which is both motive
and sensitive, is a double nerve, and secondly describes his experiment. In re-
gard to his idea of dowdle nerves, or, as the author calls them, mixed nerves, he
says: “I have to offer reasons for believing that * * the nerves which we
trace in the body are not single nerves possessing various powers, but bundles
of different nerves, whose filaments are united for the convenience of distribu-
tion, but which are distinct in office as they are in their origin from the brain.”
(Bell: The Nervous System of the Human Body, &c.; 3d edition, Edinburgh, 1836,
p- 442.) He adds: “ Considering that the spinal nerves have a double root, and
being of opinion that the properties of the nerves are derived from their connec-
tions with the parts of the brain, I thought that I had an opportunity of putting
my opinion to the test of experiment, and of proving at the same time that nerves
of different endowments were in the same cord and held together by the same
sheath.” (Jbid, p. 443.) In stating his experiment, M. Bell says: “ On laying
bare the roots of the spinal nerves, I found that I could cut across the posterior
fasciculus of nerves which took its origin from the posterior portion of the spinal
marrow without convulsing the muscles of the back; but that on touching the
anterior fasciculus with the point of the knife, the muscles of the back were im-
mediately convulsed.” (Jdcd, p. 443.)

We thus see what was done by Bell: first, it was he who first conceived that
each nerve might be double, or composed of two; secondly, it was he who, be-
fore all other physiologists, directed experiment to the roots of the nerves ; thirdly,
from his experiment, however incomplete, he arrived at the conclusion of a dis-
tinct function for each root. All this was accomplished by M. Bell ten years
before the researches of M. Magendie.

I1.—The titles of Magendie to the important discovery are distributable into
two series: by the first he completed the labors of Bell; by the second he dis-
covered the recurrent sensibility. I shall begin by reproducing entire the first
“Note ” of M. Magendie, and it will be seen how felicitous was his insight on
this first attempt. His first introspection was in fact always the surest.

Experiments on the functions of the roots of the rachidian nerves, by M. Ma-
gendie ; 22d July, 1822: “TI had long desired to make an experiment in cutting,
in some animal, the posterior roots of the nerves which spring from the spinal
marrow. I had several times attempted it without succeeding, on account of the
difficulty of opening the vertebral canal without injuring the medulla, and con-
sequently destroying or at least sorely wounding the animal. Last month, a
litter of eight pups, six weeks old, was brought to my laboratory, and these
seemed well suited for a renewal of the attempt to open the vertebral canal. In
effect, I was able, by the use of a very sharp scalpel, and so to say at a single
stroke, to lay bare the posterior half of the spinal marrow surrounded by its
envelopes. T’o have this organ almost naked, it only remained for me to cut the
dura-mater which encloses it, and this was done with facility ; I had then before
my eyes the posterior roots of the lumbar and the sacral pairs, and by raising
them successively with the blades of the small scissors I could cut them on one
side, while the marrow remained untouched. I knew not what would be the re-
sult of this attempt; but I reunited the wound by a suture of the skin and ob-
served the animal. [I at first thought the member corresponding to the nerves
108 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

entirely paralyzed ; it was insensible to punctures and to the strongest pressure ;
it seemed also to be immovable. But presently, to my great surprise, I saw it
move very apparently, although the sensibility was all the time wholly extinct.
A second, a third experiment gave me exactly the same result ; I began to regard
it as probable that the posterior roots of the rachidian nerves might well have
different functions from the anterior roots, and that they were more particularly
destined for sensibility.

“Tt naturally occurred to my mind to cut the anterior roots, leaving the pos-
terior ones undisturbed; but such an undertaking was more easy to conceive
than to execute; how could it be possible to uncover the anterior part of the
medulla without injuring the posterior roots? I confess that at first the thing
appeared to me impracticable ; yet for two days I never ceased thinking about
it, and finally decided to attempt to pass before the posterior roots a sort of knife
for cataract, whose very narrow blade would allow of cutting the roots by press-
ing them with the edge of the instrument on the posterior face of the body of
the vertebra ; but I was obliged to renounce this expedient on account of the
large veins which the canal contains on that side, and which were opened at every
movement in advance. In making these essays, I perceived that by pulling
upon the vertebral dura mater I could discern the anterior roots united in fasci-
cles, just when they are about to penetrate that membrane. I wanted nothing
more, and in a few moments I had cut all the pairs which I wished to divide.
As in the preceding experiments, I made the section only on one side, in order
to have a term of comparison. It may readily be conceived with what curiosity
{ followed the effects of this section, nor were they ambiguous ; the member was
completely motionless and lax, while it preserved a sensibility not at all equivo-
cal. Finally, to neglect nothing, I have cut at once the anterior and posterior
roots ; there was then an absolute loss both of sensibility and movement.

“T have repeated and varied these experiments on several species of animals;
the results just announced were confirmed in the most complete manner, whether
as regards the anterior or posterior members. I am prosecuting the researches,
and will give a more detailed account in the coming number; it suffices that at
present I am enabled to assert that the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves
which issue from the spinal marrow have different functions ; that the posterior
appear more particularly destined for sensibility, while the anterior seem more
, Specially connected with movement.”

Having seen the first note of M. Magendie, let us pass to the second; the
retrograde step cannot fail to occasion surprise :

Note on the functions of the roots of the nerves which spring from the spinal
marrow ; October 22,1822: ‘The facts which I announced in the preceding
number are too important not to have ied me to seek to elucidate them by new
researches. I wished first to ascertain if the anterior or the posterior roots of the
spinal nerves might not be cut without opening the great canal of the vertebral
dura mater ; for, by exposing the spinal marrow to the air and to a cold temperature,
the nervous action is sensibly enfeebled, and consequently the results sought
for are obtained in a manner but little apparent.

“‘ The anatomical disposition of the parts rendered this not impossible, for each
fasciculus of a spinal root proceeds for some time in a particular canal before
uniting and being confounded with the other fasciculus. In effect, I have found
that by means of scis8ors blunted at the point, enough of the films and lateral
parts of the vertebra might be removed to expose to view the ganglion of
each lumbar pair; and then with a small stylet the canal containing the pos-
terior roots may be separated without any insurmountable difficulty, and there.
is no further impediment to the accomplishment of the section. This mode of
making the experiment has yielded me the same results with those I had already
observed; but as the experiment is much longer and more laborious than by
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE 109

following the process in which the great canals of the spinal dura mater is
opened, I do not think that this method of making the experiment should be
ursued in preference to the former.

“JT desired afterwards to submit to a particular proof the results of which I
have previously spoken. Every one knows that the xwx vomica causes in man and
animals general and very violent convulsions. It was a matter of curiosity to
know whether these convulsions would still take place in a member whose
nerves of motion had been cut, and whether they would show themselves as
strong as usual when the section of the nerves of sensation had been made.
The result has proved altogether accordant with those preceding that is to say, ©
that in an animal in which the posterior roots were cut, the tetanus was com-
pleted and as intense asif the spinal roots had been all intact; on the contrary,
in an animal in which I had cut the nerves of movement of one of the
posterior members, that member has remained supple and motionless at the
moment when, under the influence of the poison, all the other muscles of the
body underwent tetanic convulsions of the most decided kind.

“ By directly irritating the nerves of sensation or the posterior spinal roots,
would contractions be produced? Would direct irritation of the nerves of
motion excite pain? Such are the questions which I proposed to myself, and
which experiment alone could resolve.

“TI commenced by examining under this aspect the posterior roots or nerves
of sensation. What I have observed is this: on pinching, pulling, pricking
these roots, the animal evinces pain, but not to be compared, for intensity, with
that which is developed if the spinal marrow be touched, even lightly, at the
place whence these roots spring. Nearly every time that the posterior roots
are thus excited, contractions are produced in the muscles where the nervers are
distributed ; these contractions are, however, but slightly marked, and vastly
more feeble than when the medulla itself is touched; when at the same time a
fasciculus of the posterior roots is cut, a movement of the whole is produced in
the member to which the fasciculus proceeds. ¥

“The same trials were made upon the anterior fasciculi, and analogous results
obtained, but in an inverse sense; for the contractions excited by pinching,
pricking, &c., are very strong and even convulsive, while the signs of sensibility
are scarcely visible. ‘These facts, then, are confirmative of those which I have
announced ; only, they seem to establish that sensation resides not exclusively
in the posterior roots, any more than movement in the anterior. Yet one difli-
culty may be raised. When, in the experiments which precede, the roots have
been cut, they were continuous with the spinal marrow: might not the shock
communicated to this be the real origin both of the contractions and of the pain
experienced by the animals? 'To resolve this doubt, I have repeated the experi-
ments after having separated the roots from the medulla, and would say that
except in two animals in which I observed contractions when I pinched or pulled
the anterior and posterior fasciculi, I perceived in all the other cases no sensi-
ble effect from the irritation of the anterior or posterior roots thus separated
from the medulla.

“T had still another kind of test to which to submit the spinal roots: this was
galvanism. I have, consequently, excited those parts by this means; first
while leaving them in their ordinary state, and then by cutting them at their
spinal extremity, so as to place them on an isolating body. In these different
cases I have obtained contractions with the two kinds of roots, but the con-
tractions which followed the excitation of the anterior roots were, in general,
much stronger and more complete than those produced when the electric current
was established by the posterior ones. The same phenomena took place whether
the zinc or copper pole were applied on the nerve.

“Tt would now remain to render an account of the researches which I have
made in attempting to follow the isolated sensation and movement beyond the

roots of the nerves—that is to. say, in the spinal marrow ; with this I shall by and
by be occupied. Before terminating this article I should offer some explanations
respecting the novelty of the results which I have announced.

«When I wrote the note contained in the preceding number I believed myself
the first to have thought of cutting the root of the spinal nerves; but I was un-
deceived by a communication from M. Schaw, a young and studious physician,
on receiving the last number of my journal. He informs me that M. Ch. Bell
had made this section thirteen years before, and had ascertained that the section
of the posterior roots did not prevent the movements from continuing. M.
Schaw adds that M. Bell had recorded this result in a small pamphlet, printed
solely for his friends, not for publication. Having requested of M. Schaw to
send me this pamphlet, if possible, in order that I might render full justice to
the author, I received it a few days after; its title is, Idea of a new anatomy
of the brain, submitted for the observations of his friends, by Ch. Bell, F. A.5.¥.
It is curious, certainly, to remark therein the germ of the recent discoveries of

_the author on the nervous system, and I transcribe entire the passage indicated
by Dr. Schaw :

“« Considering that the spinal nerves have a double root, and being of opinion
that the properties of the nerves are derived from their connections with the parts
of the brain, I thought that I had an opportunity of putting my opinion to the
test of experiment, and of proving at the same time that nerves of different en-
dowments were in the same cord and held together by the same sheath. On
laying bare the roots of the spinal nerves I found that I could cut across the
posterior fasciculus of nerves which took its origin from the posterior portion of
the spinal marrow without convulsing the muscles of the back, but that on touching

the anterior fasciculus with the point of the knife the muscles of the back were

immediately convulsed.’

“Tt will be seen by this citation from a work which I could not know, since
it was not made public, that M. Bell, guided by his ingenious ideas on the
nervous system, very nearly arrived at a discovery of the functions of the spinal
roots ; yet, the fact that the anterior are destined for motion, while the posterior
pertain more particularly to sensation, appears to have escaped him; it is to the
having established this fact in a positive manner, therefore, that I must limit my
pretensions.”

Reply of M. Bell to M. Magendie. Yor the convenience of the discussion
M. Bell attributes this reply to a pupil, but this pupil may well haye been M.
Bell himself: *

“ Although the original experiments (those, namely, of M. Bell) have much
more value in all their results than those which have been reported by M.
Magendie, yet it is noticeable that the latter, when he found himself compelled
shortly after to abandon his pretensions to novelty, had the assurance’to affirm
that the experiments made by himself were the most careful. It was really
amusing to see M. Magendie make a parade of superior exactness, when, in the
same memoir, instead of persisting in his first decision, he changes in the most
essential manner what he had established respecting the functions of the nerves

in question. In this second publication on the subject, he gives a relation ©

altogether different from that which he had offered in his previous memoir.
“The results derived by M. Magendie from his first experiments were alto-
gether accordant with those which our author had announced in 1811. Con-
sequently, when an account of them arrived in this country, and it was seen that
he gave this discovery as original, measures were taken to make known to the

* Tam indebted for the communication of this paper to M. Benjamin Brodie, a highly
competent judge in the matter. M. Brodie knew M. Magendie well, and, in writing to me,
justly places him not far from Haller and Bichat: from Haller, of whom he had not the

erudition ; from Bichat, of whom he had not the expansive views; but equal to both, and per-

haps superior, for industry in the invention of experiments and skill in their execution.

_
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 111

profession to whom it was that the merit of the discovery really pertained. In

this there was no difficulty; but M. Magendie having abandoned the opinions set
forth in his first memoir, and adopted views diametrically opposite to those of
Sir Ch. Bell, there was no further question of priority between them; the ques-
tion then presented was not to determine who had first seen, but who had seen
aright.*

“Tt is proper to say that if the views given by M. Magendie in his second
memoir on the functions of the roots of the spinal nerves had been exact, they
would have left us no hope of ameliorating our knowledge respecting the nervous
system by reasonings founded on anatomy. The fundamental part of the
original doctrine was that the nervous root yielding the sensation is altogether
distinct from that which supplies movement ;f that these properties are so different
in their nature that they cannot both pertainto the same nerve; that when a
nerve, in its passage, possesses at once movement and sensation, it is a sign that
itis a double nerve, composed at its origin of two roots, one the source of sen-
sation, the other the source of movement; that it is not reasonable to suppose
that a nerve can conduct the nervous influence in two opposite directions at once,
as would be necessary if a nerve transmitted at the same time the motive power
and received the sensations. Now, what M. Magendie presents in his second
memoir,t as being of such remarkable exactness, tends directly to overthrow all
this. Each of the two roots, as he views it, can at the same time transmit move-
ment and sensation ; it is not true that the anterior root is exclusively for move-
ment, and the posterior for sensation ; the former partakes to a certain degree the
function of the latter, and the latter that of the former; all that can be alleged
respecting the distinction between the two roots is that the anterior has more
influence as a nerve of movement than the posterior, and the posterior more in-
fluence as a nerve of sensation than the anterior; that the anterior may confer
sensation, and the posterior movement,” &c.

Remarks of M. Magendie on the occasion of a note of M. Fiourens, March 1,

-1847: “I must thank M. Flourens for having given before the academy the ex-
planations which I asked of him in the preceding session. ‘The greater part of
the facts which he cites seem to me exact; only he interprets them in a manner
which I cannot admit.

« And first, if I have maintained silence in the circumstance recalled by my
colleague, no one is authorized to regard it as a sort of abandonment of my right;
for the report made to the academy for the prize of physiology of 1841 says, in
so many words, that I had thought right to excuse myself as not competent to
be judge and party in questions in which I was so much concerned. I pass
now to the researches of Ch. Bell.

“Tt was I who first made these researches known in France. I analyzed
them in my Journal de Physiologie. I even signalized their originality at a
public sitting of the Academy of Sciences; and if the discovery that is now
sought to he attributed to the English physiologist had been announced, or even
indicated in his memoirs, I had certainly not failed to give it the greatest promi-
nence and to point out all its importance. He was himself well satisfied with
the reception which I gave to his labors. The proof that he recognized my
having rendered him full justice, is the fact that, the 10th of June, 1822, he

* All this is well enough said and very true, as long as abstraction is made of the recurrent
sensibility, or the latter is not known, as was the case with M. Bell.

t Agreed: such is in effect of the fundamental part of the original doctrine—exclusiveness of
action. But intruth there is something more ; there is the mobile sensibility of the anterior root.
M. Bell did not see it, but some physiologist would in the end have seen it, and so long as
some physiologist, as skilful as M. Magendie, should not have discovered the character of
reversion, of derivation, the fine principle of exclusiveness could not have been admissible.

¢ In this second memoir, M. Magendie is mistaken; but how fortunate the mistake (felix
culpa) which leads us to the discovery of recurrent sensibility! (See further on what'l say
under the title of Conclusion.)
112 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

wrote in his journal: ‘My discoveries have made more impression in France
than here; I have received a second letter from Magendie, where he says that
if I would send hima short analysis of my experiments, I would receive the
medal decreed by the institute.’ (Biography of Sir Charles Bell, British
Review, October, 1846.) Whoever knows the susceptibility and jealous character
of Charles Bell will readily agree that he would not have expressed himself in
this manner regarding a stranger who had omitted in an appreciative account of
his labors the finest of his discoveries.

“On the occasion of my first publications respecting the functions of the roots,
M. Schaw wrote to me that Ch. Bell had formerly made some experiments
analogous to mine. He sent me a small pamphlet, dated 1811, and which had
been communicated only to the author’s friends, with a view, as he said, to have
their opinion touching his new but still undecided ideas on the anatomy of the
brain. I lost no time in transcribing word for word, in my Journal of Physiology,
the passages which had reference to the roots, and I took care to add that neither
myself nor any one else in France had the least suspicion of the existence of
this tract. Fortunately for my own researches, it contained nothing which
touched upon the capital fact, the distinction, namely, between the two rachidian
roots—these as nerves of sensation, those as nerves of movement.

“In effect, Ch. Bell, preoccupied with his ideas on irritability, simply says
that in cutting the posterior root, he had produced no contraction im the muscles,
while the muscles were contracted when he touched with the point of the mstrument
the anterior root. Such is the experiment as he describes it. We see that not
only had he not distinguished the roots into sensitive and motive, but that even
the word sensibility had not been pronounced. How could it be otherwise,
since he operated only on animals recently dead ?

“Jn fine, Ch. Bell had had before me, but without my knowledge, the idea
of separately cutting the rachidian roots ; he had also had the merit of discovering
that the anterior influences the muscular contractility more than the posterior.
As regards priority in this, I have, from the first, done him entire justice; but
when the question relates to having established that these roots have distinct
properties and functions—that the anterior preside over movement, and the
posterior over sensation—this discovery I must claim as my own. Ch. Bell had
not indicated, nor even. caught a glimpse of it, since it in no wise results from
the experiment which he relates. It is therefore my own work, and must
remain as one of the columns of the monument reared by French physiology
since the commencement of the present century.”

Of recurrent sensibility—The discovery of recurrent sensibility was the
result of the second series of M. Magendie’s researches. On this interesting
subject, which he alone had yet ventured to attempt, the following is his first
Note, (May 20, 1839,) containing the summary of his new experiments on the
nervous system:

“The sensitive nerves and the rachidian motors are equally sensible when
they are both intact.* If we cut the sensitive nerves, the motor nerves imme-
diately lose their sensibility.t If the motor nerves are cut in the middle, the
end which remains attached to the spinal marrow is wholly insensible; the op-
posite end preserves, on the contrary, an extreme sensibility.{ In that case,
the sensibility proceeds from the circumference to the centre.§ If the sensitive
nerves be cut at their middle part, the end which attaches to the marrow is
highly sensible; the end which attaches to the ganglion has, on the contrary,
lost all sensibility.”’||

We come now to the last Note of M. Magendie on the recurrent sensibility,
which is also the most important, June 28, 1847:

“Scientific discoveries have very different destinies. Some, accepted with
enthusiasm from their very origin, traverse the world, everywhere exciting ad-
miration. So vast and facile is their success that we are tempted to assign them
to that class of brilliant errors which spring up at periods only too frequent to
satisfy an imperious necessity of the human mind, that, namely, of being de-
ceived. Other discoveries remain in the obscurity in which they are produced,
until some fortunate circumstance occurs to throw light upon them and confer
renown on their authors. Others still, which at first enjoy a certain lustre, fail
to surmount the ill-will of cotemporaries, and after having striven for recognition,
eventually vanish and sink into oblivion, if they do not meet in time with some
efficacious succor. A remark of some importance which I had the honor of
presenting to the academy in 1839, and which may be regarded, I think, as a
discovery, happens unfortunately to fall at this time within the last category.

“T shall not here recount its vicissitudes; I shall only say that it has been
twice condemned by committees of the academy, since these committees have
conferred a prize on two works in which my discovery is qualified as erroneous.
Sustained by such respectable authority, it is the right of every one to think
that I have labored under an illusion, (a thing in itself quite possible, for who-
ever investigates is liable to err.)

“ Another ground may have existed for the same conclusion. I was a member
of the two committees; I abstained from co-operating with them, as it was proper
that I should; but it was in my power to have protested, and yet I have main-
tained a silence which has been doubtless construed as a tacit acknowledgment
of my error, although, in truth, it had a wholly different signification. Prob-
ably my honorable colleagues acted on this occasion upon the maxim, Amicus
Plato, sed magis amica veritas. I am myself a strong partisan of this wise
maxim, and I have more than once put it in practice, taking care, however, to
prefer to Plato nothing but truth.

“Why did my honorable colleagues not consult me? Why not ask to see
my experiments, which I should have been only too ready to repeat before
them? I can only explain it by a sentiment of benevolent discretion towards
a colleague whose position might appear to them embarrassing. However this
may be, to foreclose all discussion, I concede that those who have not seen my
experiments might well regard my discovery as seriously compromised; for un-
fortunately the physiologists who have thought proper to reproduce them have.
done so'in such a manner that it was impossible for them to verify the results.
Yet the fact in question is one which I regard as opening a new way to experi-
mental researches on the functions, still so obscure, of the nervous system.
There rests, then, on me an obligation to recur to this point of physiology, and
to put it in the power of every one to verify the exactness of the results which
I made known in 1839.

“Let us first state in what consists the phenomenon which in the year just:
mentioned I denominated sensibility en retour, but which at present I think it
preferable to call recurrent sensibility. ,

“Tf we lay bare, with suitable precautions, a pair of the rachidian nerves, we
shall recognize that the two roots are sensitive, but that they are so by very
different titles. In the posterior, the source of the sensibility is at the centre
and diffuses itself to the circumference; in the anterior, on the contrary, the
origin of the sensibility is at the periphery and is propagated towards the centre.
It is for this reason that I give to the latter the name of recurrent sensibility.

“To prove that the sensibility of the anterior root really proceeds from the
periphery, I divide it transversely towards the middle of its length, and of the
two ends which result from its section, that at the periphery remains sensitive, while.
the central is zxsensible. 'T'o demonstrate that this sensibility of the anterior ra-.
chidian root is acquired and that it takes its source in the corresponding poste-
rior root, I divide likewise this last, and instantly the anterior root loses all its

sensibility. Of the two ends which result from the section of this posterior
root, that which adheres to the ganglion has become insensible, while that
attached to the medulla still possesses an acute sensibility. Hence this root di-
rectly receives its sensibility from the spinal marrow.

«T shall dwell no further on these results, which are literally the same that I
announced to the academy in 1839, and which I have demonstrated in my
lectures at the College of France; I will only add that I maintain them to
be rigorously exact, and that I am now, as then, always ready to exhibit them
to those who signify a desire that I should do so. At present I proceed to
report certain facts which are of a nature to throw new light on the phenomenon
of the recurrent sensibility of the anterior roots. }

“Differing in this from the posterior roots, which are constantly sensible, it
sometimes happens that on interrogating the anterior root we find it deprived of
sensibility. This is particularly observable when, the opening of the rachis and
the separation of the root having been laborious, the animals are weakened by
pain and loss of blood. But this insensibility is only temporary; it sulfices to
wait a few instants, and the phenomenon reappears and subsists as long as the
state of the wound and of the environing parts allows of its being observed.

“This momentary disappearance of sensibility in the nerve is a very singular
phenomenon which pertains to the recurrent sensibility, and which distinguishes
it essentially from the direct sensibility of the posterior root, a sensibility which
I have never known completely to disappear. When, however, the experiment
is suitably made, we recognize immediately, on the opening of the rachis, the
recurrent sensibility of the anterior root, and I have realized that, to succeed,
the best process is that in which the spinal marrow is laid bare only on one side
and to the extent of one ortwo vertebre. I have moreover remarked that, when
the experiment has been as well performed as possible, if the animal has lost a
certain quantity of blood, the phenomenon is not manifested; and I add that, at
the moment when it is most apparent, it may be made to disappear by the opera-
tion of blood-letting.

“Tn my first experiments, before I knew the influence of the causes just pointed
out, it had happened that I had found the anterior roots sometimes sensible,
sometimes insensible. This result, which might then have appeared contra
dictory, is, however, but the rigorous expression of the facts, and depends on
that remarkable peculiarity, that a sensitive nerve may, under certain influences,
temporarily lose it sensibility and afterwards recover it.

“The sensibility which I call recurrent does not pertain exclusively to the
anterior roots of the rachidian nerves; I have found it also in the facial nerve,
and it exists probably in still other nerves. I am now occupied with researches
in this respect, and shall probably have the honor of communicating them to
the academy. I shall merely add to this note the recital of some experiments
which I have made with my habitual collaborator, Dr. Bernard, well known to the
academy, and who has taken the trouble to describe them. First experiment: In
a living and healthy dog, three to four months old, the lumbar medulla was laid
bare on the right side to the extent of two vertebre; the nervous roots ex-
posed were the fourth and fifth lumbar. Immediately after the experiment, by
which the animal was somewhat distressed, the anterior root of the fourth lumbar
pair was pinched and yielded no manifest signs of sensibility; neither did the
anterior root of the fifth lumbar pair. Those two roots were then cut in such a
way that there might result from the section peripheric ends and ends adjoining
the marrow. The animal evinced no pain at the moment of the section of the an-
terior nervous roots, and the pressure upon these two ends of nerves, resulting
from the section of the root, produced no evident signs of sensibility. Afterwards
the facial nerve on the jaw was laid bare andits branches were transversely divided,
when again the peripheric ends, on being pricked, manifested no signs of sensibility.
After these first trials the animal was left for some moments at rest from the general
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 115

disturbance caused by the experiment. It then became possible to verify in the
clearest manner the sensibility of the peripheric ends of the anterior roots of the
fourth and fifth lumbars. The peripheric ends of the branches of the facial nerve
also evinced sensibility in the most distinct manner. This recurrent sensibility
of the anterior lumbar roots and of the facial nerve was prolonged with equal
intensity during the whole day. Four hours after the experiment, the acute
sensibility of the peripheric ends of the lumbar roots and of the facial nerve was
still found to exist in the most lively activity, and continued to do so even the
next day, (twenty-four hours after the experiment,) notwithstanding the com-
mencement of swelling and suppuration of the wounds. Second experiment :
In a lively and healthy dog, of medium size and from four to five months old,
the lumbar medulla was laid bare on the right side to the extent of a single
vertebra, the pair exposed being the fifth lumbar nerves. The anterior root of
this nervous pair being lightly disengaged, was pricked and found to be evidently
sensible. After this sensibility had been verified at several intervals, the anterior
root was cut, and the peripheric end found to retain its sensibility, while the end
adjoining the marrow had become completely insensible. The wound of the
back was then sewed up. On being examined anew five hours afterwards,
nothing had changed; the sensibility of the peripheric end of the anterior root
remained in full activity, and the complete insensibility of the central end was
persistent. The corresponding posterior root was now cut, and pain and agita-
tion were apparent. But the recurrent sensibility of the anterior root immediately
disappeared ; so that of the four nervous extremities resulting from the division
of the anterior and posterior roots, there was but one, the central end of the
posterior root, in which sensibility continued to be lively. Twenty-two hours
after the experiment the wound had become fetid, suppuration having com-
menced; yet the exquisite sensibility of the central end of the posterior root,
ard the complete insensibility of the three other ends, could be distinctly verified.
‘Third and fourth expcriments: From these, made on animals from four to six
months old, the same facts result, namely: sensibility ex retour of the anterior
roots, and of the facial. Sometimes at the very moment of the experiment this
recurrent sensibility is not quite evident, and it is then necessary to wait some
instants for the animal to recover a little from the disturbance caused by the
pain of the experiment. It was then ascertained that the section of the posterior
root caused the recurrent sensibility of the anterior root constantly to disappear,
and this even eighteen hours after the operation. It was seen also that the
sensibility ex retour of the anterior root having been once destroyed reappeared
no more, however long a time it might be waited for. Fifth experiment: Made
on an adult dog, with the same constant results of the recurrent sensibility persist-
ing till the next day; (the root was attached with a thread.) Sixth experiment :
Two lumbar vertebrze of an adult dog were laid bare, and it was found, after
the animal had been left at rest for some ten minutes, that the anterior roots
were sensible; the animal was then bled, and this sensibility en retour disap-
peared, while the sensibility of the posterior roots was always persistent.”
Conclusion—I have repeated all the experiments of M. Magendie on the
recurrent sensibility, as well alone as in company with M. Bernard, and have
caused them to be repeated perhaps twenty times in my laboratory by my aide-
naturaliste, Dr. Philipeaux, whose skilful and practiced hand may justly be re-
‘garded as an additional guarantee. I have thus verified, even to the smallest
details, all that M. Magendie had observed, and all that he has recounted in his
Note of 1847. To reproduce these experiments with success, care must be taken
to practice them under the requisite conditions: First, to open the rachis but on
one side. Second, to expose the roots of but one or, at most, of two nerves.
Third, not to explore the roots until the lapse of five or six hours after the first
operation, in order that the animal may have recovered from the disturbance at!

first experienced from the blood lost, and that the wound which has become cold »
may have regained a certain degree of heat and reaction. .

These experiments prove: First, that the posterior root is exclusively and.
essentially sensitive; I say essentially, because if we divide the anterior root
the posterior remains not the less sensitive. Secondly, that the anterior root is
essentially motive; essentially, because if we divide the posterior root the an-
terior does not the less remain motive. And, on the contrary, the latter (the
anterior) is essentially sensitive; for if we cut the posterior root it immediately
ceases to be so. It is not so, then, in itself~it is only so through the other;
and so exclusively through the other that if, leaving this other (that is, the pos-
terior root) intact, it be itself cut, it is that one only of its two ends which is
attached to the other (to the posterior root) that remains senszdive.

There remained a final experiment, and this M. Magendie proceeded to make.
The sensibility of the anterior root flows to it, is derived from the posterior root,
but how and by what means? What route does it pursue? Is this derivation
accomplished immediately on the junction or union of the two roots, or afterwards ?
«This extinction,” says M. Magendie, “of the sensibility of the anterior root
by the section of the posterior root is a constant fact, and suggests the experi-
ment of cutting the nerve beyond the junction of the roots, leaving these latter
intact. I isolate the trunk of a rachidian pair at nearly six lines from the gang-
lion. You see plainly that the roots of this nerve are sensitive; I irritate them
one after the other, and the animal appears to feel almost as acutely when I
touch the anterior as when I touch the posterior root. J now cut the trunk of
the nerve at about four lines from the junction of the roots. Let us try whether
these roots remain sensitive: I pinch the posterior root and the sensibility is
the same—it has neither diminished nor augmented. I pinch the anterior root
and find that this is no longer sensible. I conclude, then, that the sensibility
furnished by the posterior root to the anterior is transmitted at a point still more
remote than that on which I have operated. New researches must be made be-
fore the place of the nerve can be determined at which this transmission oceurs.
Can we suppose that it is at the very extremity of the nervous divisions, and
that the fibres of termination inosculate with one another?” (Lectures on the
Nervous System, &c., t. ii, p. 344.)

I have also repeated this experiment many times and with a uniform result;
the section of the two roots, immediately after their junction, abolishes the sensz- -
bility of the anterior root just as it is abolished by the section of the posterror
root itself.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE FIFTH AND SEVENTH PAIRS.

1. One of the finest experiments of M. Magendie was that which he per-
formed on the fifth pair. M. Bell had ‘already made this experiment, but by
another procedure. He had contented himself with cutting the sub-orbital and
frontal nerves, and the nerves of the chin at their exit from the canals of which
they bear the name. M. Magendie was the first who cut the fifth pair within
the. cranium. |

«The nerve which presides over the sensibility of the whole face,” he says,
“is the fifth pair. You will see that, by cutting it in the cranium, we abolish
not only the tactile sensibility of the skin and soft parts, but even the special
sensibility of the senses in the whole side of the face corresponding to the sec-
tion. Thus the vision, the smell, the hearing, the taste, will be lost from the
fact alone that the fifth pair has been cut; and yet the nerves that it is agreed
to regard as presiding over the exercise of each of these senses shall have suf-
fered no injury.” (Lectures on the Nervous System, II, p. 27.) This is what
he first said; he afterwards stated more exactly: “The section of the fifth pair
acts on the nutrition of the organ of smell as on that of the eye; the disorders
are secondary.” (Idid., p. 43.) The section of the /fth pair is limited, in effect,
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. Pi7

to the immediate, the direct destruction of the tactile sensibility. It destroys
vision, smell, hearing, only by the consecutive disorder. M. Magendie himself
verified this as regards vision, or the sensibility of the retina. “I cut the optic
nerve at its entrance into the eye; if the nerve of the fifth pair or any other could
perceive light, the section thus made could not prevent it. But it is quite other-
wise; the sight is completely abolished, as well as all sensibility, to the strongest
light, even that of the sun concentrated by a lens. Wishing to submit to this
last proof an animal whose fifth pair alone was divided, I easily recognized that
on causing the eye to pass suddenly from shade to the direct light of the sun,
there was an impression, for the eyelids closed. All sensibility, therefore, is not
lost in the retina by the section of the fifth pair, though there is but a feeble
portion which remains.” (Precis Elementaire de Physiologie, t. i, p. 100.)
M. Magendie had thus formed a just idea as regards vision ; and the same would
have been the result as regards audition and olfaction if he had made on the
acoustic and olfactory nerves the experiment which he performed on the optic
nerve.

2. It was known from the admirable experiments of M. Bell that the senszbility
of the face proceeds from the fifth pair, and the respiratory movement from the’
seventh. A very fine experiment of M. Eschricht, of Copenhagen, suggested
to M. Magendie an inquiry in order to determine the action of the fifth pair on
the seventh. (See Journal de Physiologie, t. viii, p. 228 and 339.) In his
Lectures we follow, step by step, the progression by which he passes from the
idea of a recurrent sensibility by nervous anastomosis to the idea of a simple
association of the fibres of one pair with those of another.

“The sensibility of the facial nerve,” he says, (Legons sur le Systeme Ner-
veux, t. ii, p. 166,) “is communicated to it by its anastomosis with the fifth
pair. This expression of azxastomosis will cease to represent a just idea if, by
anastomosis, we understand the fusion of two nerves into a single one; there
is no true fusion in the case. I had heretofore thought the contrary, but my
last experiments force me to modify my views. The branches of the fifth
pair, and of the seventh, which we find united, have their fibres associated
in such a manner that each fibre preserves the respective properties of the
nerve from which it emanates. Thus the fibres of the fifth pair remain sensitive
fibres; the fibres of the seventh pair remain motive fibres. The trunk which
they constitute by their association is thus a trunk composed of motive and of
sensitive fibres, and not of a single order of fibres sensitive and motive at the
same time. Cut the nerve of the fifth pair; there remain only motive fibres,
and all sensibility disappears. If then I avail myself indiscriminately of the
words association, anastomosis, you will know what signification I give them.
(Lecons, Sc., t. ii, p. 185.) We know now what is to be understood by anasto-
mosis between a nerve of sensibility and a nerve of movement. ‘The sensitive
fibres associate themselves with the motive fibres, and wherever the former exist
you meet with sensibility. The association of two nerves is attended with no
confusion of their properties; they are exercised conjointly in the same nervous
trunk, but they remain independent, since we can isolate them. (Tid, p. 191.)
The seventh pair receives from the fifth, not sensibility, but sensitive fibres. Its
own fibres form a nerve exclusively motive. (Jdzd, p. 209.)

Cerebro-spinal liquid.—As early as 1825 M. Magendie had read to the acad-
emy a memoir on this subject; he read a second in 1826, a third in 1828.
Long before, however, in 1769, the celebrated Italian physician Cotugno had
recognized and described this liquid; but what Cotugno had said was altogether
forgotten when M. Magendie in turn occupied himself with this important sub-
ject.* .

118 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

What the Italian did not see or saw but incompletely, and M. Magendie has
placed beyond doubt, is: Ist, that this liquid exists in all ages: 2dly, in the
normal as well as disordered state; 3dly, that it is deposited not in the cavity
of the arachnoid, but below that membrane, around the encephalon and the me-
dulla; 4thly, that the pia mater is its secreting organ; dthly, that there is a
particular point, called by M. Magendie the entrance of the ventricles, by which
the liquid penetrates from the exterior of the brain into the cavities, into the
am ~tricles, the conduits of that organ.

“Ts it not remarkable,” he says on this occasion, “ that the parts of the brain
named by the ancient anatomists valvula, aque-ductus, pons, have precisely the
use which their name indicates? The valvula of Viensses, or the great valve
of the brain, fulfils, beyond doubt, the functions of a valve, since it resists the
egress of the liquid which traverses or which fills the fourth ventricle. No part
could better merit its name than the agueduct of Sylvius, since, according to the
experiments which I have reported, this canal conveys sometimes the water of
the ventricles towards the spine, and’ sometimes from the spine towards the head.
Lastly, what is called the pons is, in effect, a great medullary arcade, inverted
and placed below the current of the liquid which traverses the aqueduct.”—
(Journal de Physiologie, t. vii, p. 29.)

A great anatomist of recent times, Scemmering, even places the seat of the
soul in the liquid of the ventricles of the brain: “If it be permitted us to assign

a peculiar organ to the common sensorium, or if there be a proper seat for the
- common sensorium in the brain, it is not without some show of reason to be
sought for in this liquid.”*

ANALYSIS OF THE RESEARCHES OF SIR CHARLES BELL ON THE NER-
VOUS SYSTEM.t+

Tn order to convey a clear idea of the merits of M. Bell, and the particular
character of his new views on the nervous system, it is necessary to say a word
respecting the doctrines which prevailed, previous to his time, on that important
subject.

“If we pass in review,” says M. Bell himself, “the opinions respecting the
brain and nerves which have been held at different times, we find one theory
which had been maintained from the Greek authors down to the age of Willis,
and which has been transmitted, with few changes, to modern authors.” Now,
this theory which had passed from the Greeks to Willis, and from Willis to

ital foramen, encloses the spinal marrow, like a sheath, to the termination of the os sacrum.
Yet this tube of the dura mater is not so wide as to reach everywhere the circuit of the cavity
of the spine, nor so narrow as to embrace closely the included medulla; but is somewhat
distant trom the cavity of the spine, chiefly behind and at the place of the apophysis, and is
at the same time separated by a considerable space from the periphery of the medulla which
it encloses. Now, this space between the vagina furnished by the dura mater and the mar-
row, is always full, not with medullary matter, nor, as some learned men in so obscure a
subject have conjectured, with a vaporous exhalation, but with water, similar to that which
the pericardium confines around the heart, which fills the hollow spaces of the ventricles of
the brain, the labyrinth of the ear, and, in short, all the cavities of the body from which the
_ free air is to be excluded, &c. (Dominici Cotunni: De Ischiade Nervosa Commentarius, Vi-
enna, 1770.)

* Peculiare organum sensorii communis si ponere fas est, vel si propria sedes sensorio com-
muni in cerebro est, haud sine veri quadam specie hoc in humore queeri debet.—(De Corporis
Humani Fabrica, vol. iv, p. 69, 1798.) ‘

t In this analysis of the researches of Bell there will doubtless be some repetition of what
has been said in the Memoir or Notes, but it is not the less needed in order to present the
complete filiation of ideas.

ve,

modern authors, was the theory of spirits derived from Galen. Galen, that
great theoretical cultivator of ancient physiology, had imagined spirits of three
kinds: the natural, which were formed in the liver; the vital, which were
formec. in the left ventricle of the heart; and the animal or cerebral, which
were furmed in the brain. Willis very much simplifies matters; with him, all
the spirits are formed in the brain: Statuimus'hos spiritus solummodo in cere-
bro et cerebello procreari; all, it seems, are formed in the brain, and with not
much difficulty, as we shall see. It is, in fact, merely a chemical operation:
velut in opus chimicum.* 'The blood is carried into the brain and the cerebel-
lum by the narrow vessels of the plexus, as by the flexuous tubes of an alembie,
veluti per serpentinos alembici canales; and then, in the substance of these two
organs, ¢vtra utriusque substantiam, the finest, most volatile and most subtle
particles are evolved from the blood ; these particles are the spirits.

But do these spirits really exist? This is the only question which Willis
forgets to propound; for, in other respects, there are not a few which he pro-
ceeds to ask. He inquires why it is that these spirits, being so thin, so subtle,
so fitted for escaping—particule ad avolandum apte—do not in effect escape ;
and he answers that they are confined or cohibited, to use his own expression,
by the membranes of the brain, as by the cap of an alembic—velut alembici
obductione. He even asks what they are—quid sint?—and he avows that he
cannot venture to compare them too closely with the spirits of wine or of tere-
binth, seeing that these may be poured from one vessel into another, or even be
distilled, without being lost; while, as for the animal spirits, they are so subtle
that after the death of the animal no traces of them are to be found.

These dnximal spirits were the mysterious resource of all modern physiology,
from Descartes to Borden.t Borden having skilfully turned them into ridicule,
less use was made of them. Eventually, in the latter years of the last century,
a new term was substituted for the old one; the animal spirits became the nervous
fluid. M. Cuvier still wrote in 1817: “It seems to us that an explanation may
be rendered of all the phenomena of physical life by the simple admission of a
fluid such as we have just defined; ”i that is to say, the nervous fluid.

Things were at this point, or nearly so, at the time when M. Bell began to
think for himself on the nervous system. “It was supposed,” he says, “ that
the brain secreted a nervous fluid, that the nerves were the channels which con-
veyed it, and that all were endowed with the same properties. With this appa-
rent simplicity of doctrine,” he adds, ‘‘ never has there been presented so great
a number of errors in the history of any science.”

The basis of this doctrine, so simple, as M. Bell justly remarks—for the
whole is here reduced to a single fluid—was the uniformity, the homogeneous-
ness of action. For homogeneousness of action M. Bell substituted speciality
of action, and this was the first, the fundamental feature which separates his
theory from the old one. ‘The key,” he says, “of my whole system will be
found in this single proposition: each filament of nervous matter is endowed
with a peculiar property independent of that of other filaments which o¢ecur along
with it, and this it preserves throughout its whole extent.” (Natural System
of the Nerves of the Human Body.)

The whole work of M. Bell is an analysis. From the date of his first essay,
in 1811,§ he separates and distinguishes the functions of the posterior roots of
the nerves from the functions of the anterior roots. This essay, too far in
advance of the physiologists of that day, attracted little or no notice; the author,
through discouragement, maintained silence for ten years. In 1821 he resumed

the subject, and presented to the Royal Society of London his Natural System
of the Nerves, a new analysis, almost as ingenious and subtle as the first, and —
which gives him his three classes of distinct nerves: the nerves of sensation,
those of voluntary movement, and those of the respiratory movement.

I shall divide the labors of M. Bell as he has divided them himself; I shall
distribute them into two epochs. The first will be that in which he distinguishes
the functions of the roots of the nerves; the second, that in which he diserimi-
nates the different classes of nerves from one another. I shall afterwards say
sumething of his discussion with M. Magendie.

First sP0cH.—Distinct functions of the roots of the nerves—How did M.
Bell arrive at this great and fundamental distinction? He has himself told us; -
“T owe my first ideas to the inductions which I drew from the anatomical
structure, and the small number of my experiments had for their object only
the verification of these first ideas.” He adds: “ When, in making researches
on a subject of this nature, we follow the natural order of ideas and a philo-
sophical method, when we examine with care the facts which anatomy presents,
every experiment is decisive, and truth shows itself so evident and simple that
nothing can be more satisfactory to the observer.’ This is well said, and dis-
closes the process of the author; he proceeds from anatomy to experiment, but
to experiment only in his own defence. What, then, did anatomy yield him?

In observing with close and constant attention the disposition, distribution,
origin, in a word, the anatomy of the nerves of the spinal marrow and of the
encephalon, what especially struck him—and the more forcibly the more he
considered it—was the perfect regularity of the former and the extreme irregu-
larity of the latter. All the nerves of the spinal marrow are perfectly regular;
they all spring from two series of roots pertaining, these to the posterior region,
those to the anterior region of this medullary column. The nerves of the
encephalon, on the other hand, are all of a surprising irregularity ; some spring
from a single anterior root; others from a single posterior root; others, again,
from a single lateral root. One only, that of the fifth pair, springs from two dis-
tinct roots—one posterior and the other anterior—like the nerves of the spine.

Whence this diversity of origin of the nerves of the encephalon? Wherefore
two sources for the nerves of the spinal marrow? Would not this diversity of
origin indicate a diversity of functions? Thus the leading idea—the idea of
diversity of function suggested by diversity of origin—was grasped; and thus
far the genius of the discoverer stood as the sole intermediary between the idea
and anatomy. But it remained to retrieve this idea, so novel and withal so true,
from the category of mere supposition or conjecture, and for this anatomy did
not suffice. When Harvey—that perpetual model for all who propose to study
the obscure mechanism of living beings—had satisfied himself of the arrange-
ment of the valves of the veins, disposed in such a manner as to favor the course
of the blood from the members to the heart, and obstruct it from the heart to the
members, he made a very simple but decisive experiment. He tied a vein, and
saw it swell on the side of the members, and not on the side of the heart. The
blood therefore flowed, in the veins, from the members to the heart, and not
from the heart to the members, and the circulation of the blood was demon-
strated.*

M. Bell did as Harvey had done. After having long meditated on the ana-
tomical disposition of the origin or roots of the nerves, he devised an experiment
which should likewise be decisive, and executed it. “It was first necessary,”
he says, “to ascertain whether the phenomena, developed after the lesion of the
different roots of the nerves of the spine, were found to correspond with what
anatomy would indicate. Hesitating for some time on account of the nature of

* See 7 Histoire de la Decouverte de la Circulation du Sang, by M. Flourens, p- 41, (second
edition.
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 121

the operation, I at length proceeded to open the cavity of the spine in a rabbit,
and I cut the posterior roots of the nerves of the inferior extremity ; the animal
could still move itself, but the cruelty of this dissection prevented me from re-
peating the experiment. I thought it would suffice to make it on an animal
newly stunned and insensible. I therefore struck a rabbit behind the ear, so as
to deprive it of sensibility by the shock, and then laid bare the marrow of the
spine. On irritating the posterior roots of the nerve, I could perceive no con-
sequent movement in the muscular tissue ; but when I proceeded to irritate the
anterior roots, there ensued, whenever the instrument touched them, a corre-
sponding movement in the muscles to which the nerve was distributed. These
experiments proved that the different roots, and the different columns whence
those roots proceed, are destined to different functions, aud that the indications
furnished by anatomy were correct.’

It would be puerile and unworthy to dwell too much upon the faults of this
experiment, ever memorable as it is, as being the first. The author says that
“ the cruelty of the experiment prevented him from repeating it.” If he had
observed more closely what took place when he cut the posterior root, (and he
might have confined himself to irritating it, which would have been still less
cruel than cutting it,) he would have seen the animal give signs of distress ;
the indications of sensibility, of pain, would have manifested themselves, as they
always do in such cases, and, in this respect, everything would have been de-
termined. In the second place, to begin by stupefying the animal, by render-
ing it tmsensible, when sensibility was precisely one of the phenomena to be
verified, was no doubt the way to render the experiment less painful, but it was
also, with deliberate purpose, to render it insufficient and incomplete. It was
to instigate more complete ones, which would be made by others, and in effect
to multiply the chances of cruelty in place of diminishing them.

And this was, in fact, what happened. The experiments of M. Bell were
everywhere repeated, and no one was more gratified thereat than himself. “I
have only to add,” said he in 1825, (fifteen years after his first Hssay,) “that
it has redounded to the satisfaction of all Europe, that these opinions and ex-
periments have been followed up. It has been recognized that the anterior
roots of the nerves of the spine excite muscular movement, and the posterior
roots sensibility. When, in an experiment, the anterior roots of the nerves of
the leg are cut, the animal loses all power over the leg, although the member
preserves its sensibility. But if, on the other hand, the posterior roots are cut,
the faculty of movement will still exist, although the sensibility be lost. If the
posterior column of the spinal marrow in an animal be irritated, it appears sen-
sitive to the pain, but no similar effect is observed when the anterior column is
touched.’

SECOND EpOcH.—System or classification of the nerves—In 1821 M. Bell
read to the Royal Society his first memoir on what he calls the xatural system
of the nerves. His Essay of 1811 had passed almost without notice, as has
been just said. 'The present memoir produced a profound impression. It was
because the author at last addressed himself to the true judges, to a learned
company, aud because by the very reading of his work he stimulated it to re-
flection. It was, besides, the first time that the light of physiology had pene-
trated into the study, until then purely anatomical, and until then wholly sterile
also, of the nerves properly so called. What had the anatomists of all countries
been doing, before M. Bell, in their researches on the different nerves? They
had been emulously striving who should find some new ganglion or some un-
known nervous filament, without, however, attaching the least idea to that
ganglion or that filament.

“As long as it is supposed,” says M. Bell, “that the nerves proceed from a.
common centre, that they have the same structure and the same functions, that they
are all sensitive, and that they all contribute to convey what is vaguely called
122 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

lat

the nervous current, these discoveries of new nerves and new ganglions will not

only be useless, but prejudicial; they will serve only to increase the confusion.”

A single philosophical, but just and precise idea sufficed M. Bell for the re-

moval of this confusion. He sees two distinct nerves distribute their branches
to all parts of the face; three nerves of different origin proceeding to the tongue,

four to the throat; the nerves of the neck presenting a most complicated ar~
rangement; and he inquires why is this? Why this multiplication of nerves—

why different nerves for the same part? Why, for example, two nerves for
the face? “Here,” says M. Bell, “we naturally ask, whether these nerves fulfil
the same function—whether they contribute a double contingent of the same
property or faculty, or whether they do not fulfil different functions? After
having called to our aid,” he continues, “all the information furnished by the

structure of the human body and by comparative anatomy, we proceed to de-—

cide the question by experiments.” Thus we see, it is always anatomy which
proposes the question, which suggests the idea; but, as we further see, it is al-
ways experiment, and experiment inevitably, which gives the answer.*

M. Bell therefore divides, in an animal, the seventh pair, that is to say one
of the two pairs between which a decision is to be pronounced, and the animal

loses only the respiratory movement of the face, simply the dilatation of the

nostrils. He divides the fifth pair in another animal; this loses the movement
of the lips which serves for manducation, a voluntary movement; but it preserves
the movement of the nostrils, a respiratory movement.. The former no longer
respires by its mostrz/s, yet uses its lips to collect its food; the latter respires by
its nostrils as usual, but can no longer use its lips to collect its food and eat.
Nor is this all: when the seventh pair is cut, the animal does not suffer; and
when the fifth pair is cut, it experiences acute pain. Again, the seventh pair
being cut, the face preserves all its sensibility, while, the fifth pair being cut,
all the sensibility of the face is lost. A difference of properties, then, of the
most express nature separates the seventh pair from the fifth. The former is

imsensible, is purely motive, and serves ouly for the respiratory movement of the -

face; the latter is at once sensible and motive, and serves at the same time for
the sensibility of the face and its voluntary movement.

There are nerves, therefore, which are only motors, like the seventh pair;
others which are at once motors and sensitive, like the fifth; and others still
which are only sensitive, like all the nerves, for example, of the special senses.
And, as regards each nerve, its property, its function depends on its origin.
The nerve of the fifth pair springs from two roots, the one anterior, the other
posterior ; it derives from the former its motive faculty, and from the latter its
sensitive faculty ; itis a double nerve, a nerve composed of two nerves, one
anterior, the other posterior—one for movement, the other for sensation. Though
springing from the encephalon, it is, from its two-fold origin and its two-fold
function, a true nerve of the spine The nerve of the seventh pair, on the
contrary, is a semgle nerve; it has but one origin, and that is anterior; it is
purely motive. Lastly, the nerves of the senses have also but one origin, but
this is posterior, and they are purely sensitive.

Upon this principle cf their radication, then, (and the great result of the re-
searches of M. Bell is to have taught us that it is by their radicles that we must

* ‘* Experiments,” says M. Bell, ‘‘have never led to discoveries.” (Natural System, &c., p.
251.) This is not wisely said; it is to make experimental art bear the whole burden of the
ill-humor entertained towards the experiments of M. Magendie. ‘‘ Let the physiologists of
France,” M. Bell further says, ‘‘ borrow from us and fellow up our opinions with experiments,”
(p. 257.) This troublesome M. Magendie has cost us many a sarcasm.

t Add to this that, like the nerves of the spine, the posterior root, that namely of sensation,
is provided with a ganglion. It was supposed, previous to M. Bell, that the office of the
ganglions was to arrest sensibility. It has been found, by experiment, that the posterior,
that is the sensitive nerves are precisely those which have a ganglion, and they are the only
ones which have it.
MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE. 123

be guided,) there are three classes of nerves; nerves purely motive, nerves purely
sensitive, and nerves at once motive and sensitive: the first with a single and
anterior root, the second with a single and posterior root, the third with roots
both anterior and posterior. Never had a more vivid light been shed upon a
subject more obscure, confused, and, tu use the received term, more inextricable.

The nerves, then, are at length classified, and their classification may be called,
as M. Bell in fact calls it, a natural classification ; for it is given at once by the
origin and the function—that is to say, by the two characters which are the
most sure, whether regarded in the light of anatomy or physiology.

I have counted but three classes of nerves; M. Bell makes four: it is because
I deliberately omit the great sympathetic, upon which he has bestowed too
little attention to make it worth mentioning here.* It has been seen, moreover,
that, besides the two columns of the spinal marrow, the anterior and posterior,
M. Bell admits a third, which he calls the lateral column. This third column,
which appeared to him so important, is at present, and with reason, regarded as
being at least very problematical. Of the five nerves which M. Bell considers
as springing from it, and which are the five respiratory nerves—the pathetic,
the facial, the spinal, the pneumogastric and the glaso-pharyngian—the first
three spring from the anterior column and are exclusively motors ; the fourth
springs from two roots and is motive and sensitive ; the fifth springs from the
‘posterior column and is exclusively sensitive.

To consider, then, only what is clear, established, and will be permanent in
the researches of M. Bell: the spinal marrow (and I do not here separate from
it the medulla oblongata) is composed of two columns, the one sensitive, the .
other motive. All the nerves which spring from the sensitive column are sensitive ;
all those which spring from the motive column are motors. From the origin
may always be inferred the function ; from the function may always be inferred
the origin; and M. Bell was not deceived when, from the simple anatomical
diversity of origin, he had foreseen the physiological diversity of function.

THIRD EPOCH.— Discussion of M. Bell with M. Magendie —TVhis discussion
relates to two points: first, the discovery of the proper functions of the roots ot
‘the nerves; and, secondly, the discrimination of the special functions of the

seventh and fifth pairs.

In reference to the first point, M. Magendie read to the Academy, July, 1822,
a memoir in which he announced that having cut the posterior root of a nerve
in an animal, he had only abolished sensation, and that having cut the anterior
root, he had only abolished movement. This result was received with the ad-
‘mmiration merited ; but some months later M. Magendie read a second memoir,
in which he retracted all that he had said and discredited all that he had done.
Each root was no longer exclusively sensitive or motive; each was both one and
the other: only, the anterior root was more motive than sensitive, and the pos-
terior more sensitive than motive.

There could scarcely have been a greater advantage offered to M. Bell.
Hence, in a note which he attributes to a pupil, a pretence which could not but
render recrimination more easy and acrimonious, M. Bell incessantly presses his
adversary with this dilemma: Hither, he says to him, you adhere to your former
memoir, and then I have over you a priority of at least ten years ; or you abide
by the second, and there is then nothing in common between us, no longer any
subject of debate; I maintain the exclusiveness of action of each root, and you
return to the old idea of the accumulation of two actions in each. What reply
could there be to this reasoning? As a man of sense, M. Magendie did not
reply at all; he did much better; he made a new discovery, and one fully as
difficult at least as the first: he discovered the recurrent sensibility.

* He regarded it as the lien ‘‘ which seems to unite the three other orders of nerves (those
of sensation, those of voluntary movement, and those of the respiratory movement) and the
body itself in one whole.” (Natural System, &c., p. 5.)
124 MEMOIR OF MAGENDIE.

I preceed to the second point of the discussion: the special functions of th
fifth and seventh pair. M. Bell had contented himself with cutting the fifth
pair at its exit from the foramina of the face; M. Magendie boldly divided it
within the skull. The result, from this cireumstance alone, was more striking ;
but from this result, imposing as it was, how many inadmissible consequences did
he draw? He pronounced the fifth pair to be not only the nerve of general serisid
bility, of the cactile sensibility of the face, but also the nerve of all the proper
organs of the senses. It was the nerve of olfaction, of audition, of vision; he took
certain simple effects of a subsequent alteration for direct and immediate effects.

M. Bell, more practiced than he in analysis, pointed out to him that the
phenomena in question are more complicated than he supposed. In the phenom-
enon of olfaction, for instance, there is the sense of smell, the act of scenting,
and the tactile sensibility ; the first depends on the olfactory nerve, the second
on the seventh pair, and the last on the fifth pair. “Having caused a dog,”
says M. Bell, “to respire ammonia, after the seventh pair had been cut, it
experienced at first no effects of irritation of the pituitary membrane. This was
because it no longer possessed the power of snufting up, or drawing in with force,
the ammoniacal vapor. * * * If I had not paid attention to these circum-
stances, I might have believed, in view of what I saw, that the nerve of the
seventh pair was the nerve of smell, as a well-known French physiologist has
done, who has concluded too precipitately that he had discovered the nerve of
vision and of smell in the fifth pair.” ;

It is not difficult to see the different turns of mind in the two men whom I
compare: the one was more meditative, more thoughtful—the other more a man
of action than of thought ; the one might be said to have placed no sufficient value:
on experiments, the other no sufficient value on ideas; the one would never prob-
ably have made experiments had he not begun by having ideas ; the other might
perhaps have had but few ideas had he not begun by multiplying experiments.

Charles Bell (born 1774, died 1842) was the fourth son of a poor Presbyterian _
minister of Scotland. The second of his brothers, John Bell, having become
professor of surgery in the University of Edinburgh, invited him thither, and _
initiated him in anatomical studies and instruction. First impressions are
strongest; a single good indication given in time furnishes sometimes the open.
ing for a career. Mr. John Shaw, in a prefatory account of Mr. Bell, * tells us
that “he commenced his public labors as assistant of his brother, John Bell,
who relinquished to him the part of the course of anatomy which treats of the
nerves, and counselled him to study the brain by its base, by its relations with
the spinal marrow, instead of cutting it by horizontal sections. The i al

student soon perceived many things which he has developed in this volume, and
which might perhaps have always escaped him, had he not then formed the '
habit of constantly considering, under this point of view, the relations of the
brain with the rest of the nervous system.”

Arrived at the age of thirty years, Charles Bell felt ill at ease in a depend- —
ent situation. (Quitting his brother, and removing to London, he there long
endured isolation and poverty. In 1805 appeared his first work, the Anatomy
of Expression. In 1811 he produced his Sketch of a New Anatomy of the Brain, —
the small success of which was the source, as has been already said, of much
discouragement. Having been appointed surgeon of the hospital of Middlesex, —
he seemed wholly devoted to instruction and practice; yet we find, in one of ©
his letters of that date, this passage: “Under a semblance of forgetfulness I :
am always brooding over my grand idea; it occupies me unceasingly.”

Some years later, on quitting a session of the Royal Society, in which he had
read his first and successful memoir, he remarked: “At last I may assure my- —
self that I am no visionary. My discovery will place me by the side of Har-*

vey. This affair of the nerves may require much time to become what it ought
to be, but I indulge myself with the idea that I have made a discovery not
surpassed by any in anatomy; nor am I yet at the end of it.”” This, however,
was but a passing gleam of satisfaction; ambitious and delicate minds are al-
ways vacillating between exaltation and distrust. He wrote shortly afterwards:
“The satisfaction which I have enjoyed in my researches has been very great;
the reception which science has given them has been the reverse of what I ex-
pected. The earliest announcement of my discoveries obtained from profes-
sional men not a word of encouragement. When, subsequently, the publica-

tion of my memoirs by the Royal Society rendered it impossible that some at-

tention should not be paid to them, the interest which they excited inured only
to the advantage of those who contradicted them, or those who pretended to
have anticipated me. It has become for me an affair of but little importance.’’
He was mistaken; it was to him the important affair; he would have pre-
ferred, however, that it should have been a little more so that of all the world,
and that the attention at first bestowed should not so soon have grown languid.
He did not recollect Fontenelle’s saying: “The admiration of mankind is a
sentiment which only craves leave to terminate.”

The memorials of our savant have been collected, as I said just now, by his
brother-in-law, John Shaw. The warm controversy raised by the new views
which he had introduced into science was distasteful to his meditative and se-
rious temper, as well as to his sense of personal dignity. He stood aloof from
it, and returned into Scotland, almost disgusted with ambition. “My dear
friend,’’ said to him the aged Professor Lynn, “you will never change. If you
live to be old, you will be the same child, but with crutches.” After his poet-
ical manner, he writes in his private journal, at his departure from London:
“JT find myself to-day like a bird whose nest is in the cap of a school-boy.”

A sojourn in his country wrought in him no change of mood. After filling
for some years, at Edinburgh, the chair which his brother had occupied, he
travelled on the continent. Artistic Italy atracted the greatest share of his ad-
miration. The following is his judgment, evincing at least profound feeling,
respecting Michael Angelo. It should not be forgotten that he himself possessed
a superior, an exquisite talent, as designer and painter, and that he has written
a book, equally esteemed by the man of science and the artist, on the anatomy
of expression.

“In these statues,” he says, speaking of two statues of Day and Night at
Florence, “ Michael Angelo has displayed great perception of art and a genius
of the first order: the combination of anatomical science and of ideal beauty,
or, rather, grandeur. It has been often related of him that he studied the torso
of the Belvedere, and had it constantly before his eyes. This fine model of
antique art may well have been the authority on which he relied for his great
development of the human muscles; but the torso could not have taught him
the effects which he produced by the magnificent and gigantic members of these
statues. Who is the artist, modern or ancient, that would have voluntarily
consented thus to demonstrate the difficulties of the art, and to place the human
body in this position? Who that would have thrown the shoulder into this
violent contraction, and have preserved, nevertheless, with so learned an exact-
ness, the relations of the parts among themselves, the harmony of the bones and
muscles? ‘This great man shows us how genius submits to labor in order to
attain perfection. It was necessary to have passed through the severe labors
of the anatomist to acquire that power of designing which it was scarcely to be
hoped would meet with appreciation either then or afterwards.’’

On his return from Italy, Mr. Bell, having gone to pass some days at the
country seat of one of his friends in the neighborhood of Worcester, was there
overtaken by sudden death.*

ON THE SENSES.

3.—THE SENSE OF TASTE

Translated by C. A. Alexander for the Smithsonian Institution from the German periodical
4 ** Aus der Natur, u. s. w.”—Leipzig.

“ De gustibus non est disputandum”’ is an old and well known commonplace,
to which, while prefixing it as a motto, we might give a rendering somewhat
different from the usual one, and say: “ About taste there is little to be said.”’
No doubt upon such a theme many pages might be easily filled, were we minded
to enter the arena of xsthetics and to pursue the chameleon-like idea into all its
ramifications; but a sober exposition of the physiological conditions of the sense
is so unpromising a subject that we could not help fearing an exposure of the
poverty of science, if we did not here, as in our consideration of the sense of
smell, propose rather to clear up some of the inveterate errors prevalent among
the uninformed than to furnish as thorough an investigation as might be desira-
ble. We reckon herein but little on the interest of the gourmands who may
suppose that physiology can be advanced by their manifold experiences in re-
gard to this their favorite sense, and who will, therefore, learn with the deeper
indignation that physiology has not only not known how to profit by their re-
searches, but even regards them as the chief sources of the common and wide-
spread errors just alluded to. The fleshy and wonderful member which, as such
persons would seem to opine, has been placed at the very inlet of the alimentary
canal with scarcely any other view than to preside over gustatory pleasures,
offers to. our keenest inquiries just as profound an enigma as the organ of smell.
Very far are we from being able to explain how that specific sensation, which,
without any further power of description, we denominate taste, arises ; what is
the essential difference between a sensation of sweet and sour; what the real
principle which resides in any substance so as to occasion our applying to it one
or the other epithet, to say nothing of any possible explication, by the aid of
science, of the different shadings, as it were, of sapidity cognizable by a nice
palate, or of the jargon by which we attempt to characterize them. Here com-
mon nerve fibres, between which and those of other organs of sense the closest
inspection fails to detect the least difference, serve to interpret to the sensorium,
by means of their extremities in the mucous coat of the tongue, the endless va-
riety of so-called flavors of sapid substances ; but we seek in vain, either at the
outer or inner extremities of these conducting fibres, for any specific apparatus
which might enlighten us as to their operations. However indispensable it be,
as was shown in our introductory discussion on the sense of feeling, to suppose
such an apparatus, yet has all endeavor hitherto to deteet it by means of the
microscope been baffled; nor, indeed, in the present state of knowledge, were
successful research to disclose to us the ends of the nerves of taste provided
with minute vesicles or filaments, or any other elementary form, should we un-
derstand them any more than we do the already discovered cells at the cerebral
termination of all nerves or the small bulbs at the outer extremity of the nerves
128 ON THE SENSES.

of touch. It would probably fare with us as with some ancient Roman raised
from the grave and suddenly placed in presence of a telegraphic apparatus or
steam engine. In the mean time it would seem the next most important prob-
lem of science in this connection to study, with more exactness than heretofore,
the terminal points of the nerves of taste in the mucous membrane, in order to
discover here, as has very recently been effected in the nerves of the other
senses, the elementary form of the nerve ends by which the sensation in ques-
tion is communicated ; whereby we may hope to approach, in the future, some-
what nearer to a solution of the mysterious relation which exists between the
contact of sapid substances with the tongue and the peculiar sensations which
they are destined to excite. .

If we bring into contact with the nerves of sight or of feeling a solution of
sugar, or of some intensely bitter substance, such as quinine, they remain un-
disturbed; neither class of nerves is roused to that state of activity by. virtue
of which a “current” is hurried to the brain, there to call forth an appropriate
sensation. We may conclude then with absolute certainty that there is present
in the tongue a mechanism, a contrivance which sugar and quinine excite into
different specific kinds of action; that this action is suited to evoke in the nerve
filaments peculiar modifications of the beforementioned current; and that this
current again must find at the cerebral end of the nerves of taste a special ap-
paratus which so operates upon what we call the soul that, as the final result,
perception of sweetness or bitterness arises. These successive preliminaries
to a sensation of taste are at present beyond our scrutiny ; it will be well if
means are at our disposal to resolve, step by step, with clear physiological facts
and inductions, the questions which present themselves in connection with each
of them. Nor shall we repine that such problems lie before us. The novice
errs if he thinks that a science affords to its votaries a higher satisfaction ; the
greater the completeness with which it presents itself, the more exactly finished
the edifice into which it introduces them. A satisfaction of a different and per-
haps superior kind is afforded by science through its very gaps and obscure
spaces, but only to him who loyally loves it for its own sake; to accompany
a science in its development, to contribute, though it were but a small, incon-
spicuous stone, to the growing structure, affords a more vivid pleasure than being

admitted to a participation in what is already accomplished. ‘There are, it is true,

self-styled savants to whom also the deficiencies in a science are more welcome
than the completed structure, because those deficiencies are regarded not in a
spirit of earnest inquiry, but as affording opportunities for the acquisition of easy
notoriety and applause. Shunning the toils of research, they find it more con-
venient to guess at the future revelations of science than acknowledge their own
ignorance, and, overweaving all chasms with flimsy theories, they vauut the
result as knowledge converted into luxury and amusement. With these self-
satisfied sciolists, who but too often and easily gain access to the public ear, the
detail of facts and laws is derided as pedantry; the slow and cautious processes
of inquiry as unworthy drudgery; the reserve and modesty of true science as
tame mediocrity or affected obscurity. Let the judicious reader be warned
against their empty pretensions. [f we once more mark with our reprobation
this form of charlatanism, it is because no, occasion seemed more proper than
when attempting to adapt to popular comprehension, without dissembling diffi-
culties or courting effect, one of the most obscure departments of physiology.
We return to our subject.

It is not improbable that the first inquiry we have to propose will at the first
glance appear to our readers superfluous, and surprise will scarcely fail to be
awakened when it is shown how much obscurity really rests upon the seemingly
simple question, What is the seat of taste, and what organs produce the sensa-
ton? With the common and general answer, the tongue, unfortunately we
cannot rest satisfied, for it remains further to be asked, first, what part of the
THE SENSE OF TASTE. . 129

tongue receives the peculiar impression which we call taste ; seemdly, whether,
besides the tongue, other parts of the cavity of the mouth are endowed with this
- faculty ; thirdly, to what structural arrangements isit due? Strangely enough
the answers to the three questions are still in dispute, and in part at least are ex-
tremely defective. -It would seem, on the whole, highly probable that to a very
small tract has been assigned the sense of taste, for with more exact exploration
its boundaries have been found to be more and more circumscribed. While the
older physiologists acquiesced in the popular notion that the tongue is the organ
of taste, and ascribed to the whole mucous coat of the mouth, and even of the
jaws and pharynx, the faculty of exciting impressions of taste, most of the modern
school are unanimous in the opinion that only a small portion of the dorsum of
the tongue, and that indeed the hindmost and nearest to the throat, exercises the
prerogative of deciding on the sapid properties of transmitted substances. It is
true that there are those even now who regard the whole surface of the tongue,
including its under side, and even the mucous membranes which line the orifice of
the throat, as embraced within the province of this sense, but in our opinion im-
properly. No one, however, disputes that the hinder part of the dorsum of the
tongue is endowed with at least a finer sense of taste ; a conclusion which re-
ceives countenance from the commonly observed fact that whenever ft is proposed
to submit any substance to a closer scrutiny of the sense in question, we in-
stinctively transfer it to that portion of the mouth, where the hard palate also
lends its mechanical aid to the investigation ; while it never occurs to any one -
to test the properties of taste with the point of the tongue, or to introduce the
object under the lower surface of that member. If it be difficult to preve con-
clusively that the rest of the mucous regions under review do not possess a sense
‘of taste, it certainly exists there in a much weaker and more obtuse degree. The
discrimination is not so easily made as might be. supposed ; in such inquiries
there are not a few incidental sources of error. In the first place, care must be
taken for trials of this sort, to choose substances which excite a pure and simple
sensation of taste, and not simultaneously a sensation of touch, which may readily
be confounded with the former. We ought not, for example, to select substances
_ having what is called a sharp, hot, or rough flavor, for those are qualities of a
sensation of touch, as are the pungent odors spoken of in our previous article on
the sense of smell. [See Smiths. Report for 1865.] Now, as the sense of touch
is unquestionably spread over the entire cavity of the mouth, it will be granted
that such substances as the above may readily lead to false conclusions respecting
the extent of the gustatory area. In the second place, it is of importance to the
proposed investigation that the substance submitted to proof should not be con-
veyed through the medium of the saliva, in which it is of course dissolved, (for
only soluble substances are capable of being tasted,) to other regions of the ora:
cavity, and so be carried to that hinder part of the tongue, whose especial sus-
ceptibility to such impressions is admitted. Nor, for this, is any movement of
the saliva necessary ; as a lump of sugar placed at the bottom of a vessel of
water will, in dissolving, gradually diffuse itself through the whole mass and
reach the surface, so may the solution of a similar substance introduced beneath
the tongue penetrate the salivary stratum which overlies every part of the cavity,
and attain the nerves of taste situated elsewhere. If this be the case, it will of
course be difficult to determine the exact seat of the sensation. On the other
hand, we are always prone to refer the sensation of taste to the point to which,
by virtue of the sense of place, (Ortssinn,) we refer the impression of touch pro-
duced by the contact of the substance with the ends of the nerves of feeling. In
what way this perception of place which connects itself with the sensation of
touch arises, has been discussed at large in our previous essay on the seuse of
feeling. [Smithsonian Report, 1865.|

If the proposed inquiry be conducted with scrupulous regard to the precau-
tions indicated, the conclusion, we think, can scarcely fail to be reacked that

9s 66
130 ON THE SENSES.

only the hinder surface of the tongue is qualified to communicate sensations of
taste. The trial may readily be made by every one for himself. Let a small
piece of sugar, for instance, be laid on the end of the outstretched tongue, or, as
rubbing will tend greatly to promote the sensation of taste, be rubbed thereon,
and no perception of the property of sweetness willensue. Still more convincing
will be the result if an intensely bitter substance be employed. ‘The same nega-
tive result is obtained if we make the experiment upon other parts of the cavity
of the mouth, and with this view the parts to be examined may be touched with.
a small and delicate brush dipped in the concentrated solution of a sweet or
bitter substance. If, in this way, a litile drop of melted sugar be conveyed to
‘the uvula which overhangs the orifice of the throat, no taste of sweetness is per-
ceived, provided we take care, in the first place, that the tongue be not brought,
by the involuntary retching which is apt to ensue from touching this part, into
contact with the uvula, and, in the second place, wait not so long that the solu-
tion shall have time to be diffused gradually with the saliva to the underlying
surface of the tongue. If the solution be rubbed in with the brush, the sweet
taste will be more quickly produced; but even then it unquestionably arises,
not from the uvula, but from the back of the tongue, and the more quickly be-
cause diffusion is promoted by the rubbing. We think, in short, that we pro-
pose nothing unreasonable to our readers, when we invite them to admit with us
the circumscription of the sense of taste to the small tract of surface to which
we are disposed to assign it.

The question next occurs, to what arrangements does this region owe its
adaptation as an organ of sense? Were there here an apparatus as distinctly
destined for the service of the sense as we find for that of sight in the eye, we
shou!d be absolved from the necessity of so nice an investigation respecting the
local extent of the sense of taste as that just described. But this is not the case; *
on the contrary, we know not a single peculiarity of the region of the tongue
empirically assumed as the province of the sense ia question; none at least
which can be assigned to it with any such manifest certainty as that with which
the dioptrical apparatus of the eye, and the auditory apparatus of the ear, may
be assigned to their respective functions. Unfortunately, after long debate, it
is not yet quite agreed to which of the special nerves of sense is appropriated
the function of taste. No less than three distinct pairs are directed to the
tongue, each a fasciculus of those minute fibres which we have heretofore com-
pared to the wires of the telegraph, and each springing right and left from dif-
ferent parts of the brain; these are the lingual branches of the widely distributed
fifth pair, the glosso-pharyngeal and the hypo-glossal nerves. From our remarks
elsewhere, it is sufficiently clear that neither by microscopic observation nor from
any. peculiarity can we conjecture the distinctive operation of such a nerve; just
as it is impossible for us to infer whether a conducting wire, when we observe it
at any intermediate point, is destined to set in motion the hands of a clock or
the index of a telegraph. Anatomical research, however carefully it may explore
the divarications of each nerve in the tongue, leads us here to no definite de-
cision ; as well because the local boundaries of the sense of taste are not estab-
lished beyond doubt, as because many parts are at the same time supplied by
more than one nerve, and because, moreover, that nerve which is directed pre- —
ferably to the hinder part of the dorsum of the tongue, and therefore has the
greater probability in’ its favor, is distributed also to the entrance and neck of
the thruat, surfaces to which we know the sense of taste is denied. ‘There
remains, then, only the physiological experiment from which to await a decision ;
and this also has its difficulties, though less in the realization than the interpre-
tation of its results. It consists in dividing one of the three nerves, and in this
manner intercepting all communication between its two extremities in the per-
iphery and the brain, thus, of course, as effectually preventing the transmission
of any current by which a sensible image may be formed, as the communication
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 131

between two telegraphic stations would be intercepted by a rupture of the wires.
After the division of either of the three nerves in a living animal, it remains to
try whether the latter still possesses the power of tasting, for should it appear
that, upon the division of any particular nerve, the faculty of the tongue to
communicate impressions of taste on being touched with some intensely flavored
substance is wholly lost, we shall be justified in concluding that the nerve on
which we have operated was the vehicle of those impressions. But here lies the
difficulty, for how are we to verify the absence or presence of the sensation in
the animal? The animal wants speech to indicate it, and an impression furnishes
us with no direct objective token of its existence ; resort must, therefore, be had
to circuitous procedures, in using which much circumspection is requisite. We
should infer the loss of taste, if, after the operation, the animal devours, without
signs of repugnance, ill-fiavored aliments which in its normal state were con-
stantly refused. On the other hand, if sugh substances are rejected, we shall be
authorized to infer with more certainty the persistence of the sense of taste, when
due care has been taken that the nature of the substance is not recalled to the
animal by its effects upon some other sense than that which we are investigating,
We should, therefore, employ in the trial no substance which, through its char-
acteristic form is familiar to the animal’s eye, and as little one which is readily
known by its peculiar smell ; nor is a substance to be chosen which, through the
medium of the nerves of touch in the tongue, produces a sensation of smarting
or roughness, so commonly confounded with impressions of taste; finally, we
would, in this inquiry, discard anything to which the animal is altogether indif-
ferent. Only such articles, therefore, are free from objection and suitable for a
decision of the question as those whose properties can be made sensible to the
animal through the sense of taste alone; and none better answers the purpose
than a decoction of so bitter and repulsive a substance as colocynth presented
in milk. If this mixture be offered to the unwounded dog, allured by the sight
of the milk and without suspicion of the foreign substance, he will greedily apply
himself to what he supposes to be a well-known dainty ; but let a drop once pass
the seat of taste, and no sign of disgust will be wanting which a dog can mani-
fest. If, now, we divide one of the three nerves, the glosso-pharyngeal for
instance, which chiefly supplies the hinder part of the tongue’s surface, and find
that the dog devours the milk, notwithstanding its bitter ingredient, with accus-
tomed avidity, we may safely infer that the divided nerve was the channel of
the sensation of taste, especially when, after a division of the two other nerves,
persistent refusal on the part of the animal has testified a perception of the
nauseous admixture.

Now, this has been tried with seemingly decisive results: the most careful
experiments have uniformly led to the conclusion that the true impressions of
taste can only exist when the glosso-pharyngeal nerves are intact; while on the
other hand it has been shown with great certainty that the filaments of the
hypo-glossal nerve pass to the muscular fibres of the tongue, and by conveying
to these the motive current from the seats of the will in the brain, communicate
to the organ the power of motion ; that, further, the lingual branch of the fifth
pair furnishes to the tongue its sensations of touch, thus notifying us of the form,
size, weight, softness, or solidity, as well as the temperature, of whatever is intro-
duced into the mouth, and sometimes, too, giving occasion to those perceptions
of mordacity or roughness which we are apt to confound with the genuine im-
pressions of taste. We shall not here enter into a discussion of the importance
of the service rendered by the two last nerves; our good readers will, perhaps,
take the trouble of reflecting for themselves upon the manifold disadvantages
under which we should lie in the affair of eating and drinking; nay, how im-
possible in some cases it might prove, if our tongue possessed not the faculty of
moving voluntarily in all directions, nor its exquisite delicacy as an instrument
for examining the quality of all substances introduced into the mouth. We must
132 ON THE SENSES.

also be excused for not attempting to give a detailed anatomical description of
the true nerves of taste, convinced, as we are, that to the generality of readers
such information would be of little avail. We might, indeed, have contented our-
selves with assuring them that to a certain nerve, called the glosso-pharyngeal
nerve, we owe the sensations of taste, but thought best to present to them an
explicit statement of the manner in which this fact has been arrived at, because
our object in these essays is rather to interest the laity in the learning of scientific
methods than in unprofitable details. The result of these methods in evincing
the glosso-pharyngeal nerve to be the vehicle of the impressions of taste, besides
the experiments on animals above described, rests also on some scanty observa-
tions made upon man himself; for which, but with extreme rarity, a morbid de-
generation or even destruction of the nerve in question has afforded opportunity.

The reader will no doubt willingly dispense with a critical discussion of the
dissenting opinions of certain physiologists who regard the lingual branches of
‘the fifth pair as partially, if not exclusively, invested with the functions of taste.
The fact above mentioned that the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, as its name im-
plies, sends filaments to the pharynx as well as the tongue, neither furnishes
an objection to the results obtained,by experiment, nor affords a ground for the
conclusion that the parts of the mucous membrane of the throat in which its
fibres terminate possess also the sense of taste. It may easily be conceived that
only those fibres of the nerve passing to the tongue are provided at their inner
and terminal extremities with the indispensable apparatus for the reception of
the impressions and their conversion into the sensations of taste, while the rest
are simply adapted to the transmission of the sensations of touch. We must
content ourselves with this as a conjecture, for, unfortunately, it has not been
found possible to trace with distinctness the filaments of either of the three nerves
to their utmost extremities, and to discover there any special structural arrange-
ment. We shall point out only the following peculiarities of the mucous coat of the
tongue. Every one must have observed either in himself or others, or else in
the tongue of the ox when it has been prepared for food, that the upper sur-
face is not smooth, but rough; though, in man, the unevenness is so slight, that
to the unaided eye this surface presents a velvety appearance, while in the ox
it is so rough, both to sight and touch, as to resemble a rasp. ach of the little
projections which occupy it appears under the microscope as a very composite
organ, on the whole of a quite regular form. We distinguish, according to their
outline, three sorts of these projections: the fungiform, the filiform, and the
circumvallate, to all of which the general name of papille is given. The first
are found especially on the upper surface on the point of the tongue; the second
are distributed over the whole of the member; the third occur only towards
its base, where they are arranged upon its surface to the number of from
ten to twelve in the shape of a V. If the tongue be stretched as far as possible
out of the mouth this V and the flattened eminences which form it, placed at
intervals and surrounded by a sort of foss, may readily be seen. A more exact
description of these three sorts of projections will not, we think, be without
interest.

As they are merely elevations of the outer coat of the tongue they consist
of the same two membranes with that coat, viz: an outer covering, called the
epithelium, and the proper mucous membrane. The epithelium consists of cells
multifariously superposed on one another, the uppermost layers of which become
dried into flat and angular little scales, while the lower are moist and roundish.
By the use of the tongue the former are continually worn off, and may be ob
served with the microscope as a constant ingredient of the saliva, which they
render turbid; to’repair this loss new cells are always forming below. Th:
layers thus constituted are destined undoubtedly to furnish protection to the
underlying mucous tissue which contains the fine and easily wounded vessels
and nerves, just as in the external skin the epidermis, which is similarly composed,
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 133

serves as a protective covering to the cutis. The accompanying figures, repre-
senting a section of three sorts of papillae magnified, may serve as the ground-

IL

work of a more exact deseription of each. In figure I is presented the section of a
filiform; in figure II that of a fungiform ; and in figure III that of a circumvallate.
In all of them the part designated by a represents the epithelium, consisting of
squamous and cellular layers; that marked } the underlying mucous membrane.
It will be seen at first sight that the epithelium in neither form invests the sub-
jacent mucous membrane as a glove does the finger, so that the outer surface
of the former shall present an exact impression of that of the latter. In the
filiform papille it will be observed that the epithelium has a number of long
antenna-like excrescences, giving the papilla the appearance of a brush, while in
the others this covering is externally smooth, notwithstanding the inequalities
of the underlying membrane 4, whose surface exhibits in each example a num-
ber of successive and rather narrow eminences of a sugar-loaf or conical form.
What purpoze the antenne of the first form subserve it is impossible to con-
jecture; but, as regards the regular elevation of the proper mucous membrane,
their presence alike in each of the three kinds of papille, as well as the cireum-
stance of their existence likewise in the outer skin, leads to the conclusion that
wherever they occur, whatever otherwise their diversity, the physiological
- signification which they bear must be the same. Now, as the microscope shows
us, that, as regards the outer skin and in part, at least, the mucous membrane of
the tongue, the finest branches of the blood vessels and the terminal extremities
of the nerves are found in these little eminences, the ‘inference is obvious that
this peculiar formation of the surface is imposed on account of the organic con-
tents of the eminences, providing, as it does, suitable receptacles in the periphery
for the ends of the vessels, and especially the nerves, and securing their regular
distribution over the surface. We may conceive that it behooved that the
ends of vessels and nerves should closely approach the outer surface at a regu-
lated distance from one another, which purpose indeed might have been attained
had these minute organs peneirated at certain intervals from the mucous es.
brane into the loose strata of the epithelium; but then they must have wante
a sufficiently stable involuecrum to protect them against the pressure and con-
tinual wasting of the shifting elements of that covering. Now, such protection
134 © ON THE SENSES.

is supplied by the enveloping projections of the mucous membrane which enter
into corresponding cavities of the epithelium. We are aware that this. teleo-
logical mode of considering anatomical arrangements as directed to a pre-deter-
mined end, and contrived with a view to attaining that end, will at present be
received in many quarters with entire repugnance; wherefore we shall not here
further insist upon it. Enough, if the preceding example should serve to show
how well this manner of viewing the subject is adapted to lead us to an under-
standing of such arrangements. ‘The clearest method of explaining natural as
well as artificial mechanism is, in our opinion, that which bases itself upon teleo-
logical principles ; how far the employment of teleology for purposes of demon-
stration may be justified is another question.

Returning to a consideration of the papillae we remark that, for.a proper con-
ception of them, attention should be especially directed to the delicate structure
of the small secondary projections of the mucous membrane, with a view to
seeking therein the ends of tbe nerves and apparatus of sensation. But hitherto
all efforts have been fruitless, nor has research in this. direction been rewarded
with the slightest degree of certainty. Neither in the filiform, nor fungiform,
nor circumvallate papillze has success attended the attempt to explore the ulti-
mate destination of the nerves which direct their minute filaments with extreme
intricacy towards the surface, to follow them into the interior of the superficial
projections of the mucous membrane, and there detect a difference of arrange-
ments which might guide us to a decision respecting a difference of functions.
However probable the supposition that the filiform and fungiform papilla con-
tain the ends and apparatus of the nerves of touch; that the circumvallate, on
the other hand, which occupy the centre of the seat of taste, and are outwardly
so. strikingly distinguished, contain those of the nerves of taste; yet we are
unable to furnish anatomical evidence for that supposition, or indeed to establish
it conclusively through physiological experiments. Even the peculiarity of ex-
ternal form of these latter papillz is a riddle; we cannot explain what purpose
is subserved by their division into a roundish central elevation A, and an annular
periphery B, separated from one another by a distinct foss C. If we ventured
to assert that this foss furnishes a sort of reservoir in which the solutions of
sapid objects are received in order, by longer contact with the sensitive surface,
to take more full effect on the extremities of the nerves, while the passage of
those solutions over a free surface might be too rapid for distinct perception, we
should only be advancing an empty conjecture for which no proof could be alleged.
Nothing remains for us, therefore, but to wait until, by persevering and patient
observation, some deeper insight into the secret mechanism of the organs in ques-
tion shall be vouchsafed, and material be thereby furnished for physiological inter-
pretation.

While it fares so unsatisfactorily with our knowledge of the organs of taste, we
are, unfortunately, not much better off as regards our knowledge of the nature and
conditions of the external influences which call forth a sensation of taste of whiat-
ever quality. We know well what substances produce such sensations, and bear
in mind a correct idea of the kind of impression connected with their use, so that
we again recognize the substances by that impression, or, even without their pres-
ence, easily recall, in imagination, the sour, or sweet, or bitter qualities which dis-
tinguish them. But this knowledge, in which the epicures must be recognized as
graduates, though the basis of our practical use of the sense of taste, avails us little
or nothing to a mastery of the physiological theory. We know even more: we
know accurately the physical and chemical properties of the greater number of
sapid substances, and are dumb notwithstanding to the capital question, what

property is it which makes a substance sapid, and qualifies it for the excitement of
such or such asensation? We know no single property common to all sapid mat-
ters which can be even remotely identified as the cause of their operation on the
nerves of taste, and in which we can seek the source of their peculiar action. ‘To
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 135

illustrate ourincapacity of arriving by physical or chemical analysis at any decisive
results on this subject, we shall cite one or two examples. Sugar may serve as the
representative of sweet substances ; we know that it is composed of twelve atoms
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and how it is affected by all chemical agents ; we
know, also, its physical properties, such as solubility in equivalent proportions,
requiring here no further discrimination. How is it now that this substance, on
its contact, in solution, with the mucous membrane of the tongue, produces an
excitation, whether chemical, thermal, electrical, or mechanical, which gives rise,
by its action on the ends of the nerves, to that specific modification of the
nervous current to which an appropriate sensation of taste instantly 1esponds
in the brain? We may well suppose that the sugar does not take effect on the
nerves’ hidden under the epithelium until imbibed by the latter, and thus brought
into proximity with their extremities; but even if it penetrated into immediate
contact with them, in what respect is the solution of the question advanced? If
we bring dissolved sugar into contact with the nerves of the muscles not a fibre
stirs; a sufficient proof that sugar is in itself no “ adequate” irritant of the
nerves. What, then, qualifies the sugar for excitation of the nerves of taste ?
The obvious answer is, the presence of some special arrangement at the ends of
these nerves. But of what sort is it? How and by what means does the sugar
operate upon it? How, through those means, is a nervous excitation produced ?
This is the riddle to be solved, but it offers at present so much resistance to the
sharpest powers of divination that we decline any attempt to meddle with it.
The matter becomes still more inexplicable when we consider that, in the first
place, sugar is not the only substance that tastes sweet, but that a multitude of
other substances, in no respect resembling it either physically or chemically, pro-
duces the same sensation in the organs of taste ; and, in the second place, that
still other substances, which are most nearly rélated to sugar, having even the
same composition, generate either no sensation at all or produce one of a wholly
different character. What, for instance, have sugar and a combination of lead
with acetic acid in common that both should taste sweet? What sulphate of
magnesia and quinine that both should taste bitter? What distinguishes sugar.
from starch that the former should produce a sweet taste, the latter no taste at
all? No answer can be given, and we should but freight our page with useless
verbiage did we give a list of all the substances having properties thus compara-
ble. As regards other senses, that of sight, for example, we are in a better posi-
tion. T'rue, that even here we do not know in what consists the operation of
light on the extremities of the optic nerve, whence result their excitation and
mediately the sensation of light. But we do know, in the first place, that at
those extremities there exists a wonderfully complicated apparatus in which we
can recognize the intermediary between light and nerve, through whose agency
the former becomes an adequate irritant of the latter ; and we know, in the second
place, by what momentum of the outward agent, light, the quality of the sen-
sation is determined ; it is practicable to state mathematically the degree of mo-
mentum adapted to each sensation. The undulatory movements of the luminous
ether produce the excitation of the nerves of sight; the velocity of those movements
qualifies the sensation so as to produce the colors which we see. A definite
amount of this velocity is universally necessary for the production of the excita-
tion; we are able to specify the smallest number of oscillations in a second of
. time which cannot be diminished, the largest number which cannot be increased,
without producing in either case an extinction of the effect of the waves of light
on the visual nerves; we are able, also, to state with entire certainty the unal-
terable number of oscillations respectively pertaining to the perceptions to which
we give such names as red, green, yellow, or blue. So it is, also, with regard to
the sense of hearing ; what has just been said of the waves of light and their
relations to the organs of vision and impressions of color may be transferred,
with only verbal changes. to the waves of sound which produce the excitation
136 ON THE SENSES.

of the auditory nerves. Both these latter senses we propose to examine as exactly
as possible hereafter, when the advantages which we possess for their analytical
study in comparison with the sense of taste, and which are here only intimated,
will be more thoroughly considered, and, we hope, more clearly evinced.

However unknown to us the properties which give to substances the power of
producing sensations of taste and the way in which they operate on the nerves
of that sense, it is, at least, some compensation that we know tu a certain ex-
tent the conditions under which a substance empirically recognized as an object
of taste exerts its specific power, and the circumstances on which the intensity
of the impression depends. First stands the fact that a substance can produce
no such impression unless it reaches the seat of this sense in a fluid form ; if of
a solid nature it must at least be first dissolved in the saliva. This condition
results from the necessity, which was above provisionally assumed, that the
sapid substance shall penetrate through the coat of epithelium to the mucous
membrane. A solid body, even reduced to the finest powder, could not make
its way through the closely compacted cells of which the covering of the tongue
consists; but in solution it will be imbibed first by one and then by another
stratum of these cells, until it finally reaches the underlying and sensitive sur-
face. Now these successive imbibitions may be supposed to imply the lapse of
a sensible interval of time, and yet experience teaches us that no interval can
be appreciated between the monient of contact with the tongue and that of the
ensuing sensation. Still, and in spite of this apparent contradiction, we must
insist that no alternative remains for us but to accept this theory of a gradual
transmission, seeing that it is supported by the admitted necessity of solution
for producing sensations of taste, and no other supposition is possible. More-
over, we have no knowledge.of the rapidity with which such transmission is
accomplished, so that there is at least no proof that it may not be sufficiently
great to render the interval in question quite inappreciable.

From what has been said it results that a body which is insolible in water,
and cannot therefore fulfil the above condition, is incapable of yielding a sensa-
tion of taste. We must take care, however, not to reason conversely that solu-
bility in water is the actual quality which in itself fits a substance for the ex-
citation of the gustatory nerves. That this is not the case. obviously follows
from the fact that many substances readily soluble in water are tasteless—nay,
that water itself is so. Were solubility as directly the condition of taste as the
undulations of the luminous ether arc the condition of sight, a substance to be
more sapid—that is, capable in smaller quantity of conveying a more intense sen-
sation—should be the more soluble; but this common experience refutes. Ex-
tremely soluble bodies sometimes couvey a very faint taste; others, soluble only
with difficulty, an intense one. ‘The degree of concentration of the solution re-
quisite in general to produce a sensation of taste is very different with different sub-
stances ; while some act in a very diluted state, others require a concentration
nearly equivalent to saturation. 1t has been elsewhere stated that as regards
odorous substances, a seale has been established by experiment showing the de-
gree of impregnation of inhaled air, requisite in the case of different articles
for the production of a sensation of smell; and in like manner it has been at-
tempted experimentally to assign values to the different degrees of dilution
which different objects of taste will bear, without thereby losing their property
of gustatory excitation: The numbers thus found afford of course no absolutely
exact valuation, but as a general appreciation they furnish in this respect a suf-
ficiently accurate comparison of the different substances submitted to trial. We
will not withhold from our readers some of the results. It would perhaps be
scarcely supposed that sugar rates unfavorably in this scale of values—indeed,
the most unfavorably of the compared substances as regards their relative ca-
pacity for dilution without loss of taste. Solutions of sugar which contain less
than one part of sugar to 99 parts of water, no longer excite any perceptible
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 137

taste of sweetness. Common salt bears a somewhat greater degree of dilution ;
the universal remedy for intermittent fever, quinine, remains perceptible under a
much greater degree, while sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) takes rank before all ;
water, in which only ;9)55 part of sulphuric acid is dissolved, still tastes
perceptibly sour. Acid substances, as many readers both male and female will
be able to certify from experiences gained in cookery, most readily impart their
sapid qualities. On what conditions these surprising diversities depend, it is
beyond our power to explain.

With one and the same body, the zntensity of the sensation of taste which it
excites increases with the progressive concentration of the solution; a law
which needs no other proof than daily experience. As regards the comparison
of intensities, it will be well to remember what was elsewhere said on sensations
in general, and especially on those of touch; we have no measure by which we
can estimate an impression of taste, so as to give it an exact numerical expres-
sion. If we test, one after the other, two solutions of sugar of different concen-
tration, we cannot, if the difference is slight, decide which is the sweeter; we
cannot say that one tastes half, twice, thrice, or tenfold as sweet as another
with which it is compared. ‘Though this by the way: the intensity of the sen-
sation depends not alone on the degree of concentration of the solution, but on
several other circumstances, whose agency is in part susceptible of explana-
tion, in part not so. It is easily understood that the strength of the sensation
increases in proportion as the surface is larger on which the solution operates,
and the time longer during which it is in contact with that surface. Just as of
two bodies of equal weight that seems to us to be heavier which presses on a
larger surface of the skin, and thus gives excitation to a larger number of the
nerves of touch, so the same solution of sugar will seem sweeter, if diffused over
the whole area endowed with the sense of taste, than when merely a drop of it
touches a circumscribed part of the mucous membrane. Thus the intensity of
the sensation increases with the sum of the nerve fibres simultaneously excited,
because the single impressions seem, in conception at least, to be in some meas-
ure combined with one another. The more intense effect produced by prolonged
contact of the object with the tongue may be inferred to result from the pene-
tration of greater quantities of the substance to the nerve extremities of the
mucous membrane; and for this, too, an analogy may be found in the operations
of the sense of touch. A hot surface seems less hot on transient than prolonged
contact with the skin, from the circumstance, in the first instance at least, that
time is wanting to conduct the particles of caloric in sufficient quantity through
the cuticle to the ends of the underlying nerves. One of the most essential
conditions for increasing the intensity of a sensation of taste consists in the
friction of the solution against the surface of the tongue, or of the latter with
the solution against the hard palate. This resource comes into play habitually
in the act of taking either solid or liquid food, but we more particularly avail
-ourselves of it in tasting, with a view to a more accurate judgment of the flavor
of any substance. In this case we do not content ourselves with laying the
object of which we would form a judgment upon the tongue and quietly await-
ing the sensation, but bring it by an incipient movement of deglutition to the
hinder part of the tongue, and press this in turn against the hard palate. It is
at the moment of this contact, produced by a movement which is indispensable
in the act of swallowing, that the most vivid sensation arises, as every one may
convince himself who pays attention to what oecurs during the process of taking
food. For further confirmation of the fact the following experiment may be
practiced: Let the tongue be stretched out, with the mouth widely opened, so
that the former can no where strike against the roof of the cawity, and a drop of
dissolved sugar or vinegar be placed upon its surface, only a very weak sensa-
tion will ensue, with an instinctive effort to press the tongue against the palate,
because we are unaccustomed, except by this means, to conduct the operation
138 ON THE SENSES.

of tasting. The sensation will instantly become stronger if, with the finger or

a brush, we rub the solution upon the mucous surface of the tongue. Here,

also, we are at a loss for any certain explanation; we can only remotely con-

jecture how the means spoken of serve to promote and intensify the excitation

of the nerves of taste. It may be that the pressure and rubbing facilitate the
intermixture of the solution with the salivary stratum which covers the mem-
crane and its penetration among the cells of the epithelium, or that the pres-
sure applied to the extremities of the nerves renders these more sensitive and
excitable. This latter conjecture, we confess, though received with favor by
some, has, in cur opinion, little probability. So long as we know nothing of
the means or the mode by which substances communicate sensations to the
nerves of taste, all hypotheses on this subject must be air-built speculations.
How a mechanical force, a compression of the nerves, can heighten their excita-
bility, must be mere matter of conjecture, and finds for its support no analogy
in the action of other nerves. We must be content, therefore, to consign this,
with the many other questions which we have been obliged to leave unan-

_swered, to the category of riddles, for whose exact solution we can only look to
a perhaps distant future.

We know from experience that the sense of taste not only possesses a very
different degree of delicacy in different individuals, but that, even in the same
individual, its delicacy is some/imes more, sometimes less exquisite. The causes
of this difference are not, in all cases, easily shown. It cannot. be denied that
a different degree of functional activity of the organs of taste may be innate;
but to what parts of the organ the difference is attributable and what properties
adapt this or that part to the reception of a keener impression, and its conver-
sion into a more distinct sensation of taste, cannot in the present state of our
knowledge be determined. It is but seldom that we observe in the organ ot
taste, the tongue, those gross and obvious defects which might lead us before-
hand to infer an obtuseness of the sense, such, for instance, as a thick and
corncous condition of the epithelium, perceptible rugosities, &c. In most cases
of difference of fineness of taste in different persons, the cause is to be sought,
not so much in congenital or casual deviations of the apparatus, as in diversities
of cultivation, of education of the sense. It is a remarkable fact that, through
judicious practice directed to that end, the operations of all our senses may be
improved to an extraordinary extent, and the way in which this refinement is
brought-about by diligent and heedful usage, presents one of the most interest-
ing questions of physiology. Is the mechanism of the organs of sense im-
proved by use, or is it only that, with an unchanged condition of the original
mechanism, more facility is acquired in understanding their operations? In
other words, are material changes produced by use in the apparatus of the
senses, or is it the immaterial principle of our nature which derives advantage
from that use? Probably, both suppositions are, in a certain degree, true. It
would be difficult to adduce direct proof of the improvement of the proper ap-
paratus of the senses, but analogies, drawn from other physiological apparatus,
give countenance to its possibility, A muscle becomes so changed through
strenuous use, that not only are its powers of performance increased, but a
higher activity of nutrition supervenes, and the number of its fibres, on which
depends its strength, is also increased. 'The blood secretes more material ap-
plicable to the formation of such fibres in employed than in unemployed mus- —
cles; a muscle, indeed, precluded from all activity, ceases to receive nourish-
ment and perishes through inanition. Perhaps also the quality of the nutri-
ment supplied is improved by the exercise of the muscle, so that, without actual
increase of the fibres, those already existing may be qualified for greater mani-
festation of power. Daily experience affords proof of the above. It needs but
to compare the firm and prominent muscle in the arm of a smith with the flac-
cid, scarcely developed muscle in that of a recluse, the muscular leg of a cha-
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 139

mois hunter with that of a sedentary artisan. But there is often to be seen
also, in individuals of spare habit, in whom there is outwardly no striking mus-
cular development, a surprising strength and energy of the muscles, which would
indicate the enhanced nutrition of those organs arising from continued use.
The muscles, then, being susceptible of this improvement by use, what should
forbid our inferring that the working capacity of the apparatus of the senses
may, in like manner, be nourished to a higher degree of perfection by habitual
exercise? But whether the whole result should be referred to habitual use and
exercise, is extremely doubtful; for those, at least, to whom soul and nerve ap-
paratus are not identical. While it may well be believed that an organ of
sense may be improved to such a point by material treatment as to be more
sensitive to related impressions, it would seem impossible to explain by a sim-
ply improved mechanism the vastly increased delicacy of discrimination ac-
quired by practice in distinguishing different impressions or different degrees of
the same quality of impressions. If we consider the soul as an immaterial
principle, which is indeed consigned to the material organs for all its intercourse
with the outward world, and yet is so far independent as to be capable of a
different cultivation through the employment of the same unchanged organs,
we may also assume that it first gradually learns to interpret and discriminate
the permanent processes in the sensitive apparatus, and will of course make the
greater progress therein, the greater its practice. We are here venturing, how-
ever, into a province where no ordinary sagacity is requisite to find a sure
route, and to pursue it without stumbling upon prejudices or deviating into by-
paths. We return, therefore, to our immediate subject.

Examples of the degree of delicacy to which the sense of taste may be trained
by use need not detain us. Every one may find them among his acquaintances,
and few probably of my readers are without a knowledge of some connoisseur in

_wines, who, from the taste of the precious juice, will undertake to pronounce the
year and vineyard which were privileged with its production. Though in such
_ cases there may be often pretence or self-deception, yet it is certain that the sense
of smell and even that of touch afford, for these trials, a degree of succor to the
sense of taste; even common parlance recognizes the “ bloom,’ the ‘‘ bouquet,”
or again the “ harshness,” of certain objects submitted to the serutiny of the latter ;
still there remains for the share of the sense in question enough to secure respect
for its educational capacity. It is not, however, in different individuals only that
striking differences in the delicacy of the sense of taste occur ; they present them-
selves from time to time in one and the same individual, as the experience of every
one will testify. Thus it happens, not unfrequently, that a severe catarrh migrates
from the pituitary tunic of the nose to the mucous membrane of the mouth, and
occupies the latter to such an extent that, in a scarcely exaggerated sense, all taste
may be said to be lost. In this uncomfortable state, food excites only the im-
pressions of touch, often improperly confounded with what is called a “ clammy
taste,” though in truth no genuine sensation of taste exists ; with the exception,
perhaps, of that generated by intensely sour or bitter objects, which still is searcely
thore than a counterfeit of the sensation excited by the same objects in a healthy
condition of the organ. In the same way loss or depravation of taste is a very
regular concomitant of many disorders of the stomach and bowels, manifested in
some cases by hebetation of the organ, in others by perverted sensations, as when,
for instance, all substances leave a bitter after-taste. We may remark, finally,
that very intense impressions of taste blunt the susceptibility for succeeding and
weaker impressions of the same quality, whence after partaking of a sour salad,
the wine bibber may smack his lips over the sourest products from the vineyards
of Griineberg ; while, on the other hand, the sensibility to impressions of another
quality seems to be exalted, so that after the enjoyment of a sweet confection, the
least acidity causes the best wine to taste like vinegar. For these facts we can
propose only superticial and fragmentary explanations. As regards the bodily
TAQ Ce - ON THE SENSES.

ailments above spoken of, it is safe to make of the more or less thickened
and furred envelope of the tongue a scape-goat on which we may cast, in the
first instance, the blame of the defective or vitiated sensibility to objects of taste.
We may suppose, moreover, that in catarrh, exudations from the mucous mem-
brane clog its tissues, and thus impair the irritability of the extremities of the
nerves, or in some way embarrass the yet unexplained action of sapid substances
on those nerves. But such an explanation or supposition does not carry us far.
What really gives rise to the incidental perversion of the sensations in question,
can scarcely be the subject of even plausible conjecture, so long as we know not
the nature of that excitation which different substances produce in the nerves, so
long as we are ignorant how a sweet or bitter taste comes to be generated. That
after a sour substance, a sweet one tastes doubly sweet, the reader may be dis-
posed to explain by the effect of contrast. This explanation we shall not in general
contest, but most earnestly protest against the commonly received notion that a
sweet and a sour taste are opposites of one another. Between two sensations of
different quality, whether they belong to the same or different spheres of sense,
there exists no ¢ertium comparationis, and so nothing which will authorize us to
regard them as opposites. It is just as unreasonable to consider a sour taste the
opposite of a sweet one, as to attribute opposition to the sensations of a red and
green color, or a shrill and a deep tone, as if the one stood in diametric relation
to the other as a north or south pole. Could the two sensations be even assigned
toexternal causes essentially antithetical, weshould not be justified in transferring
this character to the sensations themselves. ‘These are incapable of all deserip-
tion; they admit not of measurement or division, and can as little be brought into
the relationship of opposition as of numerical value.

We must not pass without at least a brief notice the after-taste or tang,
although in truth its nature and causes are as obscure as those of tlhe proper
sensations of taste. This after-taste exists in a twofold manner. With some
substances, the original sensation which they create continues of the same un-
changed quality for a long time after they have been swallowed and been dis-
placed on the tongue by other substances. With others, again, after the retreat
of the sensation originally excited, another supervenes of quite different quality.
Thus there are bitter substances whose taste is not to be got rid of, as it is
commonly expressed ; and on the other hand, sweet substances which create a bit-
ter after-taste. When this after-taste is of like quality with the original sensa-
tion, it is not easy to decide whether it is of a purely objective nature, or in
part, at least, subjective; that is to say. whether the action of the substance
which generates the primary sensation itself persists as long as the after-taste
endures, or whether, for some reason, the excitation of the nerves, or the activity
of that central apparatus which operates directly on the sensorium and deter-
mines the nature of the sensation, continues even after the disappearance of the

substance from the environs of the nerve extremities. Of the last there is no

existing proof; the objective nature of the after-taste is, on the other hand,
readily conceivable and capable of explanation in different ways. It is very
possible that certain substances, having once penetrated into the mucous mem-
brane, cling more pertinaciously than others to its structural tissues, without
being removed, by absorption or chemical decomposition, from the vicinity of

the nerve extremities on which, therefore, they continue to operate. ‘The prob- —

abilities in favor of this origin of the after-taste are greater, the smaller the
quantities of the substance necessary to produce the sensation. In the second
place, it may well be supposed that there are substances capable of affecting
the nerves of taste through the blood; indeed, it is certain that many ‘‘ sub-
jective”’ sensations of taste, which, from time to time, present themselves with-
out any external cause, are in reality objective in the sense that substances

conveyed from the bowels into the blood have been in such cases carried by —

the latter to the mucous membrane of the tongue, and thus reach the sensitive
THE SENSE OF TASTE. 141

extremities of the nerves of taste. The proof of this lies in the ofteu-observed
fact that, when intensely bitter substances have been swallowed in the shape
of pills so well enveloped that they pass over the tongue without exciting the
characteristic taste, that taste will nevertheless arise in the mouth after a cer-
tain time? As regards the second sort of after-taste, where its quality differs
from that of the primary taste, we are again left in doubt how far it is objective,
how far subjective. It is very possible that certain objects of taste suffer, within
the mucous tissues, a rapid change or chemical decomposition, and in this al-
tered condition affect the nerves of taste in a different manner than at first.
But it is also conceivable that the different after-taste results from a spontane-
ous reaction of the nerve apparatus; a supposition, however, which admits
neither of proof nor.closer examination. ;

In like manner with the impressions of touch and smell, of which we have
elsewhere treated, those of taste are regularly and unavoidably associated with
ideas which mankind in general are apt erroneously to identify with the im-
pressions themselves. On this head, our previous discussions authorize us to be
brief. With the impressions of taste is immediately connected the idea of an
external object as cause of the sensation, and with so little consciousness of the
distinction between the sensation and the idea that we believe ourselves to be
directly tasting the object as such, and impute to it the qualities of the  sensa-
tion as a property. Thus every one speaks of sweet and sour substances as if
the sweetness or sourness were a property of the -substance itself, just as we
speak of red and blue objects in the meaning that the color is a property of the
object. Most probably we arrive at the idea of an external object as cause of
the sensation of taste not through this sensation itself, but through the accom-
panying impressions of touch, which simultaneously enable us to form the idea
of the place at which the gustatory impression takes effect. With sensations of
taste are also connected ideas of pleasantness, unpleasantness, nauseousness, &c.,
which are in like manner erroneously confounded with the sensations. An im-
pression on the organs of sense canuot in itself be pleasant or unpleasant.
Further, it is often not the immediate gustatory impression which calls up the
idea, for this idea may take its shape from mental associations previously estab-
lished, or in part from simultaneous sensations of taste or smell.

The above is all that we have felt authorized by the present state of our
knowledge respecting the physiology of the sense of taste to impart to the reader
as worthy of his confidence. We might here desist, but it is, perhaps, proper
to offer a few remarks in regard to the practical uses to which the sense of taste
is adapted, even if the first considerations which present themselves, as was the
case when we formerly treated of the sense of smell, may seem calculated to dis-
parage its value as an endowment of the human or animal economy. In this
point of view, it is a matter of indifference whether we ask, of what advantage
is the sense of taste ? or what was the design in endowing the erganism with that
sense? The answer to both forms of inquiry rests essentially on the same prin-
ciples. Itis customary to regard the sense in question as a sentinel, so to speak,
of the digestion, stationed at the portal of the alimentary passages, to challenge
the various articles which present themselves for admission, and to enable us to
discriminate the hurtful from the wholesome. Nor is this view incorrect, only it
is necessary, first, to assign the limits within which this sentinel may be trusted;
and, secondly, to inquire how far its function is an independent one. It would
certainly be disastrous for nutrition and health if we committed ourselves blindly
to such a monitor as this; death from inanition or poison must lie everywhere in
wait for us, if we resigned ourselves without reserve to its indications. ‘The
sense of taste is itself indeed no sentinel ; the quality of a sensation of taste can,
of itself, in nowise disclose to us whether a substance is wholesome or unwhole-
some, seeing that there are many tasteless substances which are the former, and
not a few of the latter which are well flavored. The sense of taste is in this
142 ON THE SENSES

respect only like the indications furnished by a clock; we must understand the
signification of the numbers of the dial plate and the movement of the hands if
we would derive from the clock information as to time; so we must learn by
circuitous experiences to interpret the different qualities of the sensations of
taste, if we would avail ourselves of them in the diagnosis of food and poison.
It is difficult to say how we are determined to the choice of our first nourish-
ment; an impulse wholly enigmatical urges the new-born child to its mother’s
breast, nor must we imagine that we make any progress towards an explanation
when we call this impulse an instinct; that is only a word by which we supply
our want of a clear idea. But whatever the nature of the impulse, a sensation
of peculiar quality is imparted by the milk of which we are thus led to partake,
and this quality, impressed upon the memory, serves us ever after for the recog-
nition of that particular nutriment. And so with all other means of nutrition, —
whether instinct or experience may have taught us to recognize them as such ;
the sensations excited by them impress themselves upon us, and, with each, au
idea of the nature of the corresponding object. Thus we learn by the sensation
to distinguish the objects, but in nowise do we learn from the sensations the sig-
nificancy of those objects as regards life and health. When we partake of food,
the previously instructed sense informs us of the kind and quantity of its sapid
ingredients; it is upon our own experience or that of others that we found our
judgment of their nutritious or noxious character. Unfortunately for the epicure,
the antagonist ideas of pleasant and distasteful can in no manner be brought to
conform absolutely with the two categories of food and poison; many a culinary
preparation of simplest flavor is an excellent nutriment ; many a delicacy, which
tickles the palate to an exquisite degree, is either innutritious or positively
hurtful. Finally, it is to be remembered that among the safest viands as the sub-
tlest poisons there are some which are quite insipid, to which, therefore, the
vigilance of the sentinel palate can by no possibility extend. These patent
truths it is unnecessary to re-enforce by multiplied examples. What would it
avail, indeed, to prove that a plain milk-porridge as much surpasses a truffle-
pastry in nutritious properties as it falls behind it in savoriness? We should
make thereby as few proselytes as did the barbarous reformer who once set a
whole community in ferment with the words, “ Beer is poison.”

IV.—THE SENSE OF HEARING.

We enter now upon a sphere of sensation in which we feel that we have a surer
footing than when dealing with the enigmatical senses of smell-and taste, be-
cause here we encounter an external excitant accurately known as regards its
nature and laws, and this nature and these laws are already more or less famil-
iar to the contemplation of a large number of readers. What perception of the
senses is there which takes a deeper and stronger hold upon our inmost being
than sound in its endless modifications and harmonious combinations, which, in
its inexhaustible interchange of tones, is capable, if we may be allowed the ex-
pression, of more delicate and diversified shadings, especially when it reaches”
us in the living form of speech? Even that small and unhappy number of hu-
man’ beings in whose inelastic natures music “finds no echo, strikes no respon-
sive string ’—even these are the willing slaves of sound, without whose availa-
bility’as speech the intellectual commerce of mankind would indeed be reduced
to narrow bounds and wretched expedients. If we consider the animal world,
we recognize the same wonderful force, the same essential office of sound in
hundreds of instances. The tones produced by the small fibrous tendons of the
throat thrown into vibration by the breath, whether it be in the unmodulated -
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 1438

neigh of the horse or the resonant song of the nightingale—these tones, which,
in some respects analogous to the speech of man, afford means for a certain de-
gree of intelligent intercourse between animals, are utterances to which we often
assign no meaning, or, in our narrow prejudice, altogether disregard as the ex-
pression of a psychical emotion. We are very far from intending to write a
panegyric on the power of sounds, or to analyze with poetic cireumstantiality
the susceptibility of sensitive minds to the language of music; there needs but
brief exposition to secure for the sense of hearing that high interest which natu-
rally pertains to it. For without the sense of hearing, there is no sound, as with-
out the sense of sight, no color.

We may safely assume that at least every educated individual has formed for
himself some idea, however superficial, of the causes of sound ; has learned, for
instance, to consider the mighty tones of the organ as proceeding from the reg-
ular and tremulous pulsations of the air-columns enclosed in the pipes, which
pulsations arise when the air compressed in the bellows is directed in a current
towards the openings of the pipes; that the penetrating tones of the violin re-
sult from the vibrations communicated to the stretched strings by the bow, as
similar vibrations are produced in the strings of the piano when struck by the
hammer ; that the tuning-fork resounds when its elastic branches of steel are
thrown into vibratory motion by a blow against some resisting surface, &c.
These visible vibrations, as the source of sound, are too obvious to allow us to
suppose that there is any one not familiar with the fundamental facts of the
generation of sounds. But though our task of exposition as regards the object-
ive excitant of the nerves of hearing be on that account materially lightened,
and we may limit ourselves to a discussion of the special relations of certain
’ properties and modifications of this excitant to the auditory organ, yet we be-
lieve we do not err in imputing to many and perhaps most of the laity * a radical
misconception in which they are only the more fortified by the received expla-
nations on the nature and causes of sounds. This is a misconception so nearly
anavoidable, so entwined with all our ideas, and, indeed, so much sanctioned by
the language even of science, that it is a difficult matter for physiology to evince
it to be such and to establish right conceptions in its place. Many will be able
to surmise what misconception we mean, since we have already had occasion, in
treating of other senses, to enter the lists against it; but, at the risk of being
counted tedious, we must here combat it anew, and much fear that when -we
come to consider the sense of sight we shall not be able to spare our readers a
repetition of our efforts to eradicate it. Every one says, and most believe, that
the vibrating string of the violin or the pulsating air-column of the organ pipe
itself resounds; this is a radical error. When we said above that without the
sense of hearing there could be no sound, we did not mean that if no ear were
present an externally existing sound would not be perceived, but, in the strict-
est sense of the word, that without the ear, without the excitable nerves of
hearing, no sound at all would exist. The string only vibrates, it sounds not; the
sound is not conveyed through the air from the string to our ear, and through
this to our consciousness; the sound originates in ourselves, is the sensation, and
hence an action of our own soul, which is the result of the vibrations of the
string, but has nothing whatever in common with them. The string, by its os-
cillations, throws the adjacent particles of air into a corresponding oscillatory
movement, this movement is propagated in the form of a wave from particle to
particle, and when the particles next to the ear receive the tndulatory impulse
and are set in motion, they communicate that motion to what is called the tym-
panum of the ear, which is thus in turn made to vibrate; the vibrations of the
membrane just mentioned are now transmitted through certain bones of the ear

to a small reservoir of fluid, in which fluid again the undulatory movement ig
reproduced, and that peculiar excitation of the extremities of the auditory nerve
bathed by this fluid is exerted, which hurries to the brain the mysterious cur-
rent so often spoken of, and there, through the terminal apparatus of the nerve.
gives rise to the phenomenon recognized as a perception of sound. Thus long
is the chain of successive movements between their origin in the vibration of
the string and their termination in the inscrutable process by which the result
is communicated to the mind. As far as the nerves we*can analyze these move-
ments through their entire course: up to the tympantm with great exactness,
inside of the ear with less precision; but the movement within the nerve and
its result, the sensation, are two riddles, of which only the first affords some
glimpses towards a solution, the second is, perhaps for all time, shrouded for us
in impenetrable obscurity. We are just as little in a position to define the na-
ture of a sensation of hearing, or any intrinsic and essential characteristic per-
taining to it, as we are in regard to an impression of any of the senses; the
utmost we can do is to designate by commonly received names the qualities
of the sensations generated by certain causes, upon the supposition that the
sensation itself is known to every one from experience and an idea of its quality
impressed upon the memory. If we would more exactly describe the sort of
sensation which we call “high” or “shrill,” instead of any distinctive token
of the sensation itself, we assign the nature and specific properties of the exter-
nal cause which excites it; we designate a sound, as of certain “ pitch,” accord-
ing to the number of vibrations of the body producing it, or as of a certain tone,
according to the kind and peculiarities of the object or instrument from which
it proceeds, because we are, for. the most part, incapable of giving an accurate
physical account of the forms of the undulations on which the modifications of
the sound are conditioned. The same holds good respecting the “strength” of
the sensation; the sensation itself admits not of measurement, but we can meas-
ure the magnitude of the vibrations or the force of a mechanical arrangement
for producing them. In general, and in relation to each of these qualities, the
sound evades every attempt to analyze it, however distinctly the sensation may
present itself to our consciousness, however vividly we may be able to represent
it to ourselves without the presence of its exciting objective cause, however ac-
curately a practiced ear may seize the finest shadings of the height, the tone
and the strength of different sounds. It was necessary to premise these expla-
nations in order to reduce what is proposed by of the following exposition to a
proper standard. It is undoubtedly a legitimate problem for physiology to inves-
tigate the nature and origin of soun/s in the exact sense which we have indicated,
but, for the solution of this problem, it is wholly unprepared; the physiology
of the sense of hearing, of which we shall endeavor to give a brief and intelli-

gible sketch, can teach us at present nothing further than the ways by which,

and the: forms in which, those motions of matter, which physical science has
shown to be the cause of the perception of sound, penetrate to the auditory
nerves; the acoustical significancy of the complicated apparatus with which
nature has endowed our organism for receiving the impressions corresponding
to those motions; and, lastly, the relation between the qualities of these exter-
nal movements and the qualities of the sensations as indicated by certain epi-
thets applied to them. We proceed to our task.

Deep within the skull, enclosed on each side by the so-called petrous bone,

the auditory nerve spreads its peripheral extremities, secluded from all immediate —

contact with the air, which brings to us, in propagated waves, the sound-pro-
ducing vibrations of bodies whether near or distant. Of possible ways in which

pulsations of the surrounding air might be conveyed to the auditory nerve there.

are many; but one is suited beyond all others to this office, and alone affords,
by an arrangement pre-eminently adapted to the conveyance of sound, an
adequate guarantee for the arrival of even very weak undulations at the per-

cipient apparatus of the ear Air-waves may communicate their impulse to all

bodies, whether solid or fluid, on which they strike, produc'ng in these bodies

vibratory movements more or less intense according to the degree of their elas-
fo) D3

ticity and other properties. hey communicate themselves therefore to the
external skin of the body, and might be transmitted from this to the underlying
soft parts; thence again to the bones, and through these be finally propagated
to the extremities of the nerves of hearing But this mode is so imperfect that,

. were the air-waves to reach their destination only in this way, our perceptions

of sound would he limited to cases of violent atmospheric concussion. ‘These
waves are not only transmitted with difficulty and greatly enfeebled in solid
bodies not rendered elastic through tension, but, if not of such excessive in-
tensity as to overcome all hindrances, their progression, in such bad conductors
as the soft parts of the body, would gradually fail, like that of water in sand,
before reaching the hidden recesses of the nerves. It would be otherwise, in-
deed, if we lived in water instead of air. The waves of sound propagated in
water are much more easily transmitted to solid bodies, and must, in fact, pass
through the corporeal integument cf all aquatic animals endowed with the sense
of hearing. It would also be quite otherwise if the vibrations of sound-producing
bodies were conveyed to us through the medium of solid substances instead of
the air. If we stop our ears closely, so as to obstruct in a great degree the
passage, and thus oppose to the air-waves a resistance like that which would
proceed from a corporeal surface similarly interposed, we shall hear no sound
from a tuning-fork thrown into vibration at some little distance, even when the
force of the undulations is increased by placing it on a resonant support. On
the other hand, if we apply the vibrating tuning-fork to one of our teeth, we
hear the sound in its full intensity, as probably most of our readers have ex-
perienced. . The reason of this is clear: while in the former case the vibrations
communicated by the tuning-fork to the air lose so much of their force by after-
wards striking against a badly conducting surface as to be unable to reach the
sensorium, in the latter,-being communicated immediately to the tooth, they
are readily transmitted by this to the surrounding elastic solids and bones of the
head, by which last they are directly conveyed to the nerves of hearing. This °
transmission of sound through the solids and bones of the head even surpasses,
under certain conditions, that which takes place in the ordinary:manner by air-
waves entering the ear, but only in the case when the distance between the ear
and the vibrating object exceeds a certain magnitude, not, as some physiologists
assert, under all cireumstances. We hear a vibrating tuning-fork more forcibly
if applied to the teeth than if held in the air at the distance of a yard from the
ear, but the result is different if the instrument be held immediately before the
entrance of the ear, as is strikingly shown by the following very simple and
easily repeated experiment: If, after striking the tuning-fork, we bring it into.
contact with one of the incisors and wait until the sound, growing constantly
weaker, is no longer perceptible, we shall hear it again if we remove the instru-

ment from the tooth and hold it close beside the ear. But, apart from this, it is

apparent that the transmission of vibrations through the bones of the head to.
the auditory nerve, would, of necessity, labor under so many embarrassments:
and be so limited in its employment, that, were this the only instrumentality
through which we received the sensations of sound, our sense of hearing would

lose all its importance as a means of intercourse between the mind and the out-

ward world. Let us reflect how seldom it would be practicable, and in these
rare cases how awkward, if we were obliged to place ourselves in immediate
connection with any vibrating body by means of some solid conductor, a metallic:
rod or other ; if, in order to convey the sounds of a violin, or the human voice,
to our auditory nerve, a conducting apparatus must first be interposed between
the sounding-board of the one or organs of the other and the solid parts of our
own cranium. That we are almost exclusively limited to the air-waves as a

conducting vehicle between distant sounds and the nerve needs no special proof; _

: : |
wherefore we conclude that, of all conceivable passages by which sound-pro- —

ducing vibrations penetrate to the sensorium, that alone deserves physiological
consideration through which undulations of slight intensity, or proceeding from —
distant objects, attain with facility the nerve of hearing.

It is this one passage, therefore—the passage through the outer ear or auricle, —
the auditory canal, the tympanum, the ossicles or small movable bones, the laby- —

rinth, both osseous and membranous—to which we shall turn our special attention,

5

while we accompany the vibratory movement communicated by the air-waves :
through all these several stations in the order in which we have named them. —
We trust that it may be in our power to convey a clear comprehension of the —
apparatus, in part so greatly complicated, which the vibrations have thus to .
}

traverse. In beginning, however, we are somewhat embarrassed by the doubt —

as to how far we may venture to presume our readers already acquainted with

the nature and laws of those periodic movements outside of our organs of hear- *
ing, designated as vibrations and waves—an embarrassment which recurs in a ~
different form with the popular exposition of each of our physiological divisions, —

since physiology in all its parts presupposes a knowledge of physics and chem-
istry as its basis. We have before expressed our belief that, of all departments
of physics, acoustics is that respecting which some degree of information is most
widely diffused ; in declining, therefore, the long digression which any adequate

acoustical introduction would render necessary, and confining ourselves to the —

physiological view of our subject, we shall hope to be excused if we refer any
reader who may happen to be little familiarized with it to some popular treatise

for the doctrine of sounds. For the sake of simplicity and clearness in our state- —

ment, we shall substitute, in place of an analysis of all possible sources of sound,
.a single concrete example of a string vibrating under conditions which give rise

to the undulations whose destination in the organ of hearing it is our purpose to —

follow. We take for this purpose a stretched string, supposed to be at a distance

of some feet from the ear and of such a degree of tension that, when made to
vibrate by a smart blow, it executes in a second four hundred entire vibrations— _

that is to say, four hundred forward and as many backward movements, with a
constantly diminishing magnitude of the path described by its several constituent
particles, until it returns to a state of rest. In such a string, the movement of
the individual particles lying behind one another in the direction of its length is
of very different magnitude; those at either end, a 4, by which the string is
fixed, are entirely motionless ; those next to them towards the middle
have a certain, but very small movement, being restrained by their

have no relation to our auditory organ, could yield no sound; we should
see, but not hear them. The sound, indeed, as we before remarked, pro-
ceeds not as such from the string, but is produced indirectly by the string

through the action of its vibrations upon the organism of the ear; and for this

mediate or indirect action there is needed a material medium with movable
particles, a conductor capable of propagating the vibrations of the string by
corresponding movements of its own constituent parts. How this propagation
is effected by the air is easily shown. We must conceive the air, surrounding
the string and filling the space between that and our ear, to be composed of in-
finitely small particles movable among one another, and we will suppose the ear
to be placed on the side next toc’. If the string, now, be supposed to oscillate
from the position a c”’ 6 towards ac’ d, it drives before it the particles of air next
to it; it is evident, too, that, were the air a firm and cohesive body, the string
could not execute its movement unless it propelled in a mass the whole of the
air lying in its passage. But as the air is an elastic compressible body, the string,
instead of driving before it at once the entire mass, presses upon and condenses
only the parts immediately next to it, these in turn press upon the neighboring
parts, and thus the impulse is progressively propagated from one portion of air
to another. When the string has arrived at its limitary position a c’ b, the dis-
placement of successive portions of air and the compression which attends it
have been propagated to a certain distance, so that the air to that extent is in a
compressed state, forming a ware of condensation. Did the string remain mo-
tionless at e c’ b, then, while the movement of propagation was still continued
among the particles at the further end of the wave, those nearest to the string
would come to a state of rest, then the next, and so on, till finally all the particles
in the first wave would cease to move, the last of them precisely at the moment
when the condensation on the further side has reached the limit to which it was
earried during the forward movement of the string—that is to say, when the
wave of condensation has reached its full length. But the string stops not at
its greatest convexity; it springs back by virtue of its elasticity, and again
passing the line of equilibrium, forms just such a curvature as before, occupying
the second limitary position a c’ 6 During this recoil there occurs in the
stratum of air lying to the left of the string, and which had been condensed by

its forward movement, the opposite condition of rarefaction, because a void space

is left behind the returning string which the air must occupy. The several
particles. of air follow the string, first, those immediately contiguous to it, then
in succession those more remote, so that, as is readily seen, the direction of the
movement which the particles now execute is the opposite of that which had
taken place on the advance of the string, while the direction in which this move-
ment is propagated from particle to particle is the same. When the string has
reached the position a c’’ b, the propagated displacement of the particles and the
rarefaction attending it have extended through a certain tract on the same side
with the previous condensation; the air within this tract is in a rarefied state,
forming a wave of rarefaction, which, succeeding the wave of condensation, ad-
vances, like that, from space to space, and to the same distance. In the mean
time, the string again springs forward, again compresses the particles of air
before it, and in this way the wave of rarefaction is replaced by a new wave of
condensation. Thus these waves proceed from the string to the ear in constani
succession and regular interchange, alternating as often in a definite time as the
string vibrates from side to side; and a particular particle of air, whatever its
distance from the string, continues, as long as the string vibrates, to oscillate
forward and backward according as it happens to be in a wave of condensation
or one of rarefaction. We shall only add that the velocity with which the dis-
placement of the partieles of air is propagated always remaius the same, no
matter how great the number of the vibrations of the string, or how wide its ex-
cursions ; and that the magnitude of the displacement of each several particle

depends on two circumstances : first, on the width of those excursions; and i
secondly, on the distance of the particle from the string,
The wider the vibrations of the string or the departure of c’ and c”’ from ¢, 80 ~
much greater, of course, is the displacement of the nearest particles of air, and —
consequently of those which follow in succession. As regards the diminution
of the displacement in proportion to the distance from the string, an example
drawn from a different quarter will afford a simple and intelligible illustration. —

If a stone be thrown into the water, there arises a circular wave, which con-
tinues to recede on all sides from the centre of disturbance, and in this wave the ©
elevation and depression follow one another in regular succession, like the con- ©
densation and rarefaction in the sound-producing waves of the air ; but whereas, ©
in the immediate neighborhood of the place where the stone fell, the elevations {
are high, the depressions deep, the former, though the width of the wave remains \
unchanged, lose their height, the latter their depth as they recede, until both —
are at length lost in the levelexpanse. Such is the case, too, with the air-waves;
the magnitude of the displacement of the several particles diminishes in definite —
proportion with the increasing distance from the source of the sound, and at a
certain distance, which is greater as the movement nearest the source, or, in the
present case, the excursion of the string is more considerable, the displacement
‘

wholly ceases. If our ear be beyond this limit, it is not reached by the air-—
wave, and can therefore not perceive the vibrations of the string as sound ;
probably, indeed. the perceptibility of the vibrations ceases within that limit, —
for it is little likely that, when the movement of the particles of air has become
very slight, it should any longer have sufficient intensity to excite the terminal
apparatus of the organ of hearing. At the distance of a few feet supposed, in }
our example, to intervene between the ear and the string, even weak vibrations —
reach the ear with sufficient intensity, the particles of air next the organ driven :
at the assumed rate of 400 forward and 400 backward oscillations in a second,
forming, with the requisite distinctness, the alternating waves of condensation —
and rarefaction. Let us now inquire the operation and destiny of these waves
in the organ itself.
The part of the ear which is first struck by the air-wave is the auricle or —
pinna, constituting the external organ, in regard to whose structure and arrange-
ment every one may easily satisfy himself. This external portion presents a
sort of hollow shell with several eminences and channel-like depressions, the
base of the shell containing a funnel-shaped cavity which opens immediately —
into the inner passages of the organ. In the lower animals the whole ear has, \
for the most part, more of the funnel, or, at least, spoon-shape, and is in general —
much more movable than in man. The human ear is, however, by no means ;
immovable; the reader will scarcely fail to have met, m the course of his life, f
-with some wonder-worker, who, with more or less skill, pretends to the power —
of wagging his ears. This egregious accomplishment, be it known, is cheap ; q
the ear of every one is provided with several muscles, which proceed in different y
directions from its base to the surface of the skull, and which, by their contrae- ;
tion, may change the position of the auricle; to these muscles are distributed
nerves, whose relations to the brain and the will are like those of the innume-
rable other nerves, and which are capable, therefore, of communicating motion
to the muscles. But just as the deaf-mute possesses the same muscles and the
same nerves of volition with him who articulates, and has only not learned to —
use them because for him the natural instructor, the sense of hearing, is deficient, 4
80 it is no absence of the original power but a neglect. to use the muscles of the {
ear in early life, which, in most men, leaves that member incapable of voluntary .
motion. It may sound strangely, but still is true, that for this neglect the blame |
lies in the tasteless as well as injudicious custom of muftling the heads of infants ;
in caps, by which the ears areso long kept immovably bound to the head, and |

precisely at the time when the soul is getting acquainted with its bodily machine, —

and learning to use it. Crying, speaking, handling, the child learns, not experi-
mentally and with any purpose of the will, by setting in motion the muscles of
the throat and thorax, the arm and the hand, to try the effect and benefit which
may result. The soul never arrives at a direct perception of these special mem-
bers, not to say that the knowledge of their existence and of the means of setting
them in motion would be the prerequisite incitement to their use. That primary
incitement consists much more in the activity of the muscles themselves; the
child cries at first mechanically—that is to say, its vocal muscles are thrown
into action in a reflex way, the muscular irritation being the effect of the: irrita-
tion of the nerves of sensation in the brain produced by an external object.
With this activity is connected a determinate, and for every muscle a specific
feeling, a so-called muscular feeling, of which the child becomes conscious, as it
does at the same time of the sensation of sound which is the result of the activity
of the vocal muscles. Thus the child first learns that this specific muscular

feeling always coincides with that sensation of sound, or, again, that with the

muscular feeling which the movement of the arm produces, is associated a sen-
sation of pressure when the limb encounters an external object, which object
may at the same time give rise to a visual sensation, &c. The education of the
soul thus proceeds step by step. and in this way it very gradually succeeds in
obtaining an indelible idea of all possible combinations of the muscular feelings,
and in understanding their signification from the consequences experienced, so
that it knows exactly what sort and degree of effort the will must make, in order
to call forth any definite muscular feeling, and attain the results known to be
associated with it. The same circuitous process would lead to the conscious use
of the muscles of the ear if their unconscious reflex activity were at first possi-
ble, for this would be our instructor by means of the associated muscular feeling
and the knowledge of its consequences. Respecting this, however, it is enough
to say that the detriment occasioned by the defect of motion is not great, since
the human head is in the highest degree movable in all directions, and hence we
can well dispense with any movement of the ears. The purposes connected
with a change of position of the ears will presently be noticed.

If we ask now what function the outer ear fulfils, in what acoustical relation
it stands to the air-wave, the common answer is at hand: to intercept and re-
ceive it; but this is by no means an exhaustive explanation. It is true, indeed,
that this member is an auxiliary but not an altogether indispensable part of the
auditory apparatus, since it is well known that, where it is wanting, not only
does the perception of sound exist, but that often it is not sensibly weakened
or affected. ‘The same is the case if the external ear be occluded by filling its
cavity with some pulpy inelastic substance, while the auditory canal, and that
alone, is kept open for the transmission of sound by the insertion of a small
tube. But although the auricle is not indispensable, it is not in vain that it oe-
cupies its place. Its design may be sought in a two-fold relation to the sound-
producing waves of the air: these may rebound against it, as the light is re-
flected from a mirror, and by means of its different eminences and depressions
be thrown in greater quantity into the interior passages; or it may serve as a
sort of sounding-board, or, more correctly, as the bridge of a violin—that is to
say, receiving the wave of sound and, being a rigid, elastic, outstretched carti-
lage, it may itself be thrown into vibration, and through the walls of the auditory
canal communicate that vibration to the tympanum, as the bridge of the violin
transmits the vibrations of the strings to the sounding-board. In both cases
the advantage would consist in economizing a part of the air-wave which would
otherwise be lost. It was usual, formerly, to seek in the action first mentioned,
the reflection, namely, of the wave into the auditory passage, the service of the
outer ear. By more careful consideration, however, of the directions in which,
according to physical laws, waves of sound, striking in different lines upon its
differently shaped parts, must be reflected, the auricle is shown to be very little
150 ON THE SENSES

ay nna Oi

fitted for this purpose, since it gives no direction to the incident waves by which —
any important portion of them can be thrown into the auditory channel. If we
would convert the auricle :ato a reflector, we must resort to a very usual means
of overcoming any difficulty of hearing by bending forward its free cartilage ©
with the hand, while at the same time the hollow palm of the latter is extended
to increase the capacity of the cavity. In this way the auricle with the hand —
acts as an ear-trumpet in collecting the waves of sound and throwing them thus
condensed into the ear. In its usual posture, on the other hand, the chief ser-_
vice of the auricle is to be sought in the second of the above-named relations :
on the impact of the air-waves, it is itself fitted to take up the vibrations and
convey them through the intermediate structures to the tympanum. ‘The com-
municated vibrations will, from physical laws, be stronger in proportion as the
direction in which the air-waves strike is more perpendicular, but as the auricle —
is not 2 level surface, and, at different points, is struck by the same air-wave in —
different directions, it is more exact to say that its conducting capacity will be —
greater, the larger the portion of its surface opposed perpendicularly to the air- —
wave. If the source of the sound is in front of us, so that the waves are di- —
rected perpendicularly towards the face, they will evidently strike the right and —
left ear under equal conditions. In this case it is plain that the ears are not in {
the most favorable position for the entry of the air-wave into the auditory pas-
sages, since, on each side, these cross the direction of the wave at right angles, .
and there i is, besides, a projecting lobe in front which forms a sort of screen to
the entrance; still the auricles are not unfavorably situated as regards the direc-
tion of the waves, since a large portion of their cavity is turned almost perpen-
dicularly to that direction, at least in persons whose ears stand out somewhat |
from the head and do not form too small an angle with its side-walls. In this
way we may account for the conclusion experimentally arrived at by one of the —
older physiologists, that the perception of sounds is most distinct if the auricle —
forms an angle of 40° with the lateral surface of the head; the most favorable
angle for all directions of sound there are no means of determining. If the —
source of sound, instead of being before, is on one side of us and in the direct
prolongation of one or other of the ear-passages, the conditions are of course
different. The ear of the corresponding side has then evidently the advantage, —
inasmuch as the entrance of the wave into the auditory canal is here direct, —
while on the averted side it is circuitous ; nor does the auricle, in this case, pre-

sent itself in a wholly disadvantageous position to the undulations, since no in-
considerable part of its surface, though a different one from the former, is now
more or less perpendicular to their direction. ‘That, on the whole, the conditions
for the access of the waves are more favorable when they strike the ear laterally
rather than directly in front, is evinced by the fact that, in earnest listening, we
unconsciously turn the head laterally, so as to bring the axis of one of the
auditory canals into the direction of the sound. The above is all that can be
said respecting the significancy of the outermost structure of the organ of hear-
ing, and is little enough, if we consider how freely it lies open to observation
and the exact knowledge we possess of the nature of the undulations.

The next part to be traversed by the sound-producing air-wave is the auditory
canal (meatus auditorius externus) which leads from the bottom of the concha
or cavity of the external ear to the seat of the finer apparatus of the organ.
This canal, which is about an inch long, is not straight, but somewhat bent, nor
is it everywhere of equal width; its walls are covered with the viscous secre-
tion called ear-wax, and, especially at the entrance, are overgrown with small —
hairs. The function of this part, in a general point of view, is clear, though — {
some obscurity rests upon certain special details—that is to say, we know that —
this external meatus, partly through the included air-column, partly through its —
own elastic environment, conducts the waves of sound to the interior of the —
organ; that on account of its curvature and varying width the waves must, in ©
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 151

their passage, strike against and rebound from its walls, so that none can reach
the tympanum in a quite direct and unbroken line; further, we may conjecture
that this reflection of the air-waves from the walls gives them additional force,
on the same principle that the rebound from a vaulted surface is known to
strengthen sounds; but we are not in a position to determine the course of each
wave in this tube with so much precision as physics might desire. The hairs
at the entrance are an important protection against the intrusion of foreign
bodies, especially particles of dust, which, at least to a certain extent, is thereby
prevented.. Respecting the true use of the ear-wax there is still a question;
the covering of the walls with a glutinous substance would be judged @ priori
to be detrimental to the conducting capacity of the tube, as too great a secre-
tion and accumulation of it are in fact found to be. A recital of the conjectures
which have been formed on this subject may well be spared.

We come now to a very important part of the apparatus for conveying sound,
the tympanum, and its connection with the reservoir of the nerves by means of
the ossicles of the tympanum, a chain of small movable bones. In order to give
the reader a correct idea of this mechanism, it is indispensable to convey as
clear a conception as possible of the anatomical arrangement, form, position, and
adjustment of its several parts; an undertaking which would be easy had we
before us, for the purposes of demonstration, either preparations from nature or
artificial models, but which presents no inconsiderable difficulty when it is to be
accomplished by means of description and mere delineations.

The tympanum is a delicate membrane, which is stretched like the head of a
drum over the inner extremity of the auditory canal, and forms a wall of separa-
tion between that passage and a small interior cavity, known as the cavity of
the tympanum. This membrane is not placed perpendicularly, but obliquely,
in such manner that its exterior surface next the canal looks obliquely down-
ward, and at the same time somewhat backward, to the floor of the canal, while
the interior surface, turned towards the tympanic cavity, looks upward and some-
what forward. The auditory canal is thus obliquely cut off at its inner extremity,
its floor or lower wall being longer than its roof or upper wall, the hinder wall
somewhat longer than the front one, the cavity of the tympanum lies more above
than behind that membrane. The annexed Fig. 2.
figure represents the outer ear O, the au-
ditory canal G, and tympanum T, of the
right side, seen directly in front. In order
to place the membrane of the tympanum
in open view, the ossicles connected with
it are left out, and for the same reason the
outline of the cavity is not given. But
the membrane of the tympanum forms not
a plane surface. It is arched in the di- F
rection of the cavity, so that its outer sur-
face is concave, its inner convex, while
between the two layers of which it is com-
posed the handle of the malleus, a small
bone, to be presently described, descends
from the upper edge as far down as the ss
middle, where it is firmly attached, and, by its position, gives to the whole mem-
brane the curvature which has been just mentioned. If we imagine a stick
firmly affixed to the centre of a drum-head, while the other end projects over
the rim, and that a force is applied to this outer and movable end, so that the
skin of the drum is at once stretched and pressed inward, we shall obtain some
idea of the arrangement of the malleus and the tympanum.

Let us examine now the action of the sound-producing undulations, the be-
fore-described waves of condensation and rarefaction on the membrane in ques-

tion. It is apparent that this will be thrown into vibration, ard that its vibra-
tions will exactly accord in intensity and number with those cf the air-waves,
and mediately also with those of the body by which the latter are set in motion.
Each wave of condensation, the several particles of which are pressing forward
in the direction of the wave, will communicate to the particles of the tympanum
the same movement, and therefore increase its inward curvature, and at the same
time its tension; and each wave of rarefaction—the direction of the particles
being now opposed to the general movement of the wave and away from the
ty mpanum—draws the latter, in a certain measure, after it, and the vaulted mem-
brane is correspondingly flattened towards the external air passages. It has
been a subject of controversy, in a physiological point of view, whether the
movement impressed on the tympanum by the waves of sound, be, like that of
the string before described, a normal, vibratory movement, or an undulatory
one like that produced by alternate impulsion and retrogression in any fluid, as,
for instance, the air. Without entering further into this question, the discussion
of which would involve an analytical inquiry into the doctrine of undulations,
we shall only remark that, in our own opinion, the tympanum of the ear can,
under no circumstances, execute any other movement than vibrations of the
former order. If we deliver a smart blow on the head of a real drum it is ev
ident that the elastic membrane will be driven inward in a convex or dome-
shaped curve, since here, as in the string, the middle particles are most movable;
those lying nearer to the rim are less so, while those immediately at the rim,
over which the skin is stretched, are immovable, like the points at which the
string is attached. By thus bending inwards, the tension of the membrane is
necessarily increased, wherefore the inward bending can only proceed to the
point at which the elastic force of the increasing tension finds itself in equi-
librium with the force which has been applied from without ; when the impulse
of the laiter gives way the elastic force drives the membrane back, as it does
the thread, not to its original plane, but with such velocity that it passes that
line and is now curved outwardly, until again arrested by the increasing ten-
sion and again driven inwardly. ‘Thus the membrane with which the drum —
is covered continues to oscillate inwards and outwards with diminishing curva-
tures, until the whole movement subsides to rest. Now, the membranous tym- —
panum of the ear is placed under precisely similar conditions, and must. there- —
fore execute the same sort of vibrations; its particles are not at all movable in
an equal degree, so that each, as is the case with the particles of the air, can, in
like degree, follow the impulse of the air-wave, the movement of each being ex-
clusively dependent on the direction and force of the impelling particles of that —
wave; on the contrary, in consequence of the adhesion of the membrane through- —
out its whole circuit to the walls of the auditory canal, the particles next to the —
adherent edge are, as in the artificial drum-head, immovable; those at the centre
the most movable; the intermediate, movable in a progressive ratio from the
periphery to the centre. The magnitude of the movement of each particle depends,
therefore, not merely on the impulsive force of the air-waves, but also on its po-
sition and consequent mobility. If we represent to ourselves an air-wave of
condensation as striking perpendicularly upon the tympanum and simultaneously
exerting an equal force upon every particle of the membrane, it is evident, from
the different degree of resistance opposed by the several particles—a resistance
which increases according to the distance of each particle from the centre—that
the result of the impulse will be a convex flexion of the membrane towards the ~
interior cavity. Upon the same principle the succeeding wave of rarefaction —
will be followed by a similar flexion in the opposite direction. If no wave of —
rarefaction followed the wave of condensation, the tympanum, when the impulse
of the latter was withdrawn, would still spring back through its own elasticity,
and undergo, like the drum skin, after one blow, a series of alternating vibrations
wound its line of equilibrium, the velocity of which would depend alone on the
THE SENSE OF HEARING 153

size and tension of the membrane. But with alternate waves of condensation
and rarefaction, the tympanum vibrates only under their influence, and as these
vibrations will be exactly synchronous with those of the string, which, in our
previous example, we supposed to be the source of sound, their number in a
second of time will, in like manner, be four hundred inwards and four hundred
outwards. The form of the vibrations remains the same; whether the magni-
tude of the displacements of the particles of air in contact with the tympanum
be great or small, nothing changes with that magnitude but the depth of the re-
sulting curvatures. If the air-wave does not strike the whole surface of the
tympanum perpendicularly and at the same time, but impinges obliquely by
striking first a part near the edge, a convex curvature ensues, but its form will
be somewhat different. Though this be commonly the case on account of the
oblique position of the tympanum to the auditory canal, we will not enter into
a closer analysis of the different forms of curvature which would result from this
circumstance, since nothing is thereby essentially changed, and the following
explanations will be rendered more generally intelligible by being made in ref-
erence only to the simplest form of vibrations.

If we’ask now to what end a tense and elastic membrane is interposed in the
passage of the waves of sound, why these are not propagated as air-waves to
the perceptive apparatus of the auditory nerves, the answer is simply as follows:
The ends of these nerves are suspended in a fiuid, and for obvious reasons must
be so; hence the question first concerns the communication of the waves to this
fluid. Did the air- wave immediately strike the fluid the transmitted impression
would be extremely feeble, so that weak or remote vibrations, which, under the
existing arrangement we hear distinctly, would be no longer perceptible. Be-
sides, it is not easy to see how such a direct transmission of the waves of sound
from the air to the fluid could be effected, since a free surface accessible to the
external air would be incompatible with the safety of the tender nerves. It is
imperative, therefore, that the fluid be enclosed within solid walls; but walls of
osseous structure take up the vibrations of air with as much difficulty as fluids,
and would transmit them in the same weakened condition; hence there was
needed some other and suitable medium between the air and the aqueous secre-
tion. Now this purpose is fulfilled in the most perfect manner by the system
of small bones appertaining to the tympanum. Air-waves are with difficulty
transmitted immediately to solid bodies, but easily and with intensity to stretched
membrane; and when, in this way, the membrane has been thrown into oscil-
latory movements, as above described, these movements are readily communi-
cable to solid bodies—a fact of which every one may satisfy himself by the fol-
lowing simple experiments: Over the opening of a glass or a tube let a dry
membrane be stretched, whether it be of bladder, leather, or mere paper, and let
this membrane be strewn with fine sand ; if a tuning fork, which has been made
to vibrate by a strong blow, be -held at a little distance above the membrane,
the lively vibrations into which the membrane is thrown by the air waves pro-
ceeding from the fork will be manifested by a saltatory movement of the grains
of sand as they continue to bound upwards and fall again on the vibrating sur-
face. ‘To show the facility with which vibrations of the membrane are trans-
mitted to solid bodies, iet a metallic ring, such, for instance, as is used for keys,
be clasped round with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, while, with the
right a strongly vibrating tuning fork is held close above it. With the simple
ring not the slightest motion will be felt, but if a membrane be previously
stretched upon it and the experiment be repeated in the same way, the ring will
be felt to vibrate in the most sensible manner as long as the vibrating fork con-
tinues in its vicinity.

We now know how the air-waves are received by the membrane of the
tympanum ; let us next see how this membrane communicates its vibrations to
the chain of small bones behind it, and in what way these in turn set 1n undu-

latory motion the fluid contained in the so-called labyrinth. It is no very easy
matter to make the structure, position and connections of the system of small
bony levers interposed between the tympanum and the labyrinth perfectly clear;
we shall endeavor first to exhibit the priuciple of the arrangement by means of

some illustrative delineations: Fig. 3 represents the simplified form of the appa-.

ratus seen in perspective; Fig. 4, an ideal vertical section thereof. A little rod
of some length a 6, which bears at its upper extremity a knob 8, is by its lower
half a c attached to the stretched
membrane of the tympanum T’7,
in such manner that it reaches
from the upper edge directly to
the middle of that membrane, thas
dividing the upper half of it into
two equal lateral portions, while
the upper half of the rod with the
knob projects freely into the cay-
ity of the tympanum. Through
= the middle c of the rod, and cross-
ing it at right angles, (in Fig. 4

Fig. 3.

the surface of the paper,) passes
a solid transverse rod d e, both
ends of which are so secured by
ligaments to the bony wall of the
cavity near the border of the tympanum, that this
transverse rod can turn upon its own longitudinal
axis, but not be otherwise displaced. We may
imagine both ends surrounded by annular liga-

the cavity. The lower end a of the longer rod
bears a short arm af, with which it forms aright
angle, and which is perpendicular to the surface
of the membrane of the tympanum. The free
end f of this arm bears finally a stirrup-shaped ap-

pendage g, firmly articulated with it, whose foot-
plate is fitted like the piston of a syringe into an oval window-like opening of
the reservoir L, (the labyrinth,) containing a fluid; with the edges of this reser-

voir the appendage g is united by a membranous and very elastic border. The —

action of the vibrations of the tympanic membrane on this apparatus must neces-
sarily be as follows: If the membrane be driven inwards by a wave of conden-
sation so that its curvature, as shown in Fig. 4, is increased and its centre a be
thus brought nearer to the reservoir L, the rod a 6 must fallow the movement
and turn around the transverse rod d e (which serves as its axis of revolution)
in such manner that the part c a below the fulerum c moves inwards and up-
wards with the tympanum, while the upper part c 4, projecting into the cavity,
moves outwards and downwards, as is indicated by the directions of the arrows
in Fig. 4._ The rod af, attached rectangularly to the former, will thus be lifted
up in the direction of the arrow proceeding from a, whereby its stirrup-like ap-
pendage g will be thrust deeper into the reservoir, and the elastic border by
which it is united to the edge of the opening will undergo extension. The fluid
in L receives this external pressure and is propelled before it. Were the walls
of this reservoir rigid and unyielding throughout its whole cireuit the fluid could
not give way, and, since a fluid is compressible only by strong force, while that
of the air-wave is relatively small, the resistance thus opposed would render the
entrance of the appendage impossible, and mediately also the whole movement
of the apparatus and the tympanum. In order, therefore, that the external

-_-

supposed to be perpendicular to —

ments which are tightly fastened to the wall of —
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 155

action may take effect, the reservoir is provided with a second opening , which
is clused with an elastic membrane, (membrana tympani secondaria.) In pro-
portion as the stirrup-plate is pressed deeper into its opening, the yielding fluid
drives the membrane / before it, bending and stretching it outwards. We shall
see hereafter that, in nature, this reservoir of fluid consists of a sac-shaped space
in which is the opening for the stirrup or stapes, and of a long spirally convolved
eanal; the other opening 4 lies at the extreme end of this canal, so that the
movement of the yielding fluid, propagated from particle to particle, must tra-
verse the whole canal before it arrives at the elastic membrane. This extensive
circuit is of the utmost importance, because the greatest part of the excitable
nerves have their extremities within this canal, by all of which extremities there-
fore the liquid waves must pass before they reach the membrane. If the con-
densed wave, whose effect we have been considering, is succeeded by a rarified
wave, all the movements will of course be reversed. The tympanum recoils and
- oscillates outwards, thus turning the rod @ 4 on the axis d so that the lower por-
tion a c moves outwards with the tympanum while its upper portion c 6 moves
inwards; the portion c a draws a f after it, and this in turn draws the stirrup
g in a corresponding degree out of the opening of the reservoir L; the fluid pur-
sues the withdrawing stirrup-plate and the membrane / becomes level or may
even be drawn inwards. If condensed and rarified air-waves now follow one
another in rapid succession, as in the case of our vibrating string, the little lever
a } turns with equal velocity on its axis and moves the foot plate of the stirrup
in its opening up and down, causing in the reservoir advancing and retreating
waves, equal in number to the vibrations of the sound-producing object.

After this general representation of the scheme and action of the mechanism,
it will not be difficult to comprehend that of the rather complex apparatus of
the ossicles of the tympanum in its actual state. This apparatus consists of
three members connected with one another—three small, peculiarly shaped
bones—the maileus, the incus, and the stapes. The malleus and incus (hammer
and anvil) together correspond to the system of levers a 6, d e, and a f of our
scheme, the stapes to our stirrup, which is the meaning of its Latin name. We

\ will first consider the form of the several bones. The
Fig. 5. malleus consists, as is shown by the annexed figure, of
F a handle a @ and of a spherical head ¢ at the upper end.
Beneath this head is found on one side a grooved de-
pression running obliquely around the neck from above
downwards, into which a corresponding surface of the
ineus is fitted; on the other side proceeds from about
the middle of the bone a long and slender outgrowth or
projection e f, running to a point, corresponding to the
portion dc of the transverse axis de in the previous
figure. The incus much resembles a bicuspid tooth with
widely separated roots. It consists of a short, thick
body a, whose upper surface b is of an oval shape and
is so channelled out as to be concave in a longitudinal and con-
vex in a transverse direction, fitting accurately into the depression
at the neck of the malleus. From the body a proceed, nearly at
a right angle with one another, two processes, one short and thick,
c, the other, d, long and somewhat bent towards its extremity, on
¢ which it bears a small lens-shaped bone e. With this terminal
bone of the incus articulates the head of the stapes, 4, g.7
whose form corresponds to its name; it consists of a “ate

head, two divergent branches unequally bowed, a 4, and /\

a flattened oval-shaped plate ¢ which forms the base or
foot of the stirrup. The position, ligatare, and connec-
tion of these bones with each other, the tympanum and ¢

the labyrinth, is as follows: If we imagine a human head vertically divided in
the middle from front to rear, and from the right half all the parts, both solid
and soft, to be removed until .we arrive at the cavity of the tympanum and thus
bring to view from within the apparatus of the right ear with the membrane of
the tympanum, the appearances presented to us, when we look a little obliquely
from above, will be those represented in the ae-
companying figure. ‘T'r indicates the tympa-
num, H the malleus, A thé incus, S ¢ the stapes.
The handle of the malleus is firmly united to
the membrane of the tympanum, being inserted
between the two soft layers of which the latter
consists and extending from the upper border
: to the centre, so that, like the rod @ ¢ in the
schematistic figure, it must necessarily follow
the movements of the membrane. The neck
and the heavy spherical head of the malleus
project freely over the border of the membrane
into the cavity of the tympanum ; the long pro-
jection, on the other hand, runs, at the height of
the upper border of the tympanum, forward,
and ishere tightly fastened, by one of the short,
elastic ligaments which spring from its point,
to the wall of the cavity. The neck of the malleus articulates with the summit
of the incus, the two surfaces being reciprocally adapted to one another, and
their edges secured by a capsular ligament which permits but slight displace-
ments. ‘lhrough this arrangement the short, thick process of the incus is in
such a position as to form a right line with the long projection of the malleus,
being directed transversely backward as the former forward, and is fastened to
the hinder wall of the cavity by a sort of capsule which allows of its turning
on its longitudinal axis. The long projection of the malleus and the short pro-
cess of the incus answer therefore together to the transverse axis marked d ein
the first delineation, around which turns the little rod marked a 6. The longer
process of the incus runs parallel to the handle (manubrium) of the malleus,
from which it is separated by a small interval, its course through the cavity be-
ing rather more inward and backward. As the membrane of the tympanum lies
obliquely this process is consequently placed obliquely ; but its lower end, which
corresponds to the rod a f of the first delineation, bends upwards, so that the
foot-plate of the stapes, which is united to it, looks in a certain degree in the
same direction. This foot-plate is introduced, like the piston of a syringe, but
more loosely, into an oval aperture (fenestra ovalis) of the bony wall of the so-
called labyrinth; around its edge there extends to the margin of the aperture a
small membranous border which renders the aperture water-tight, while, through
its elasticity, it permits the stapes to make slight excursions up and down in the
receptacle. The opposed opening, (fenestra rotunda, ) whose necessity was shown
above, exists in the labyrinth in the shape of a small round window, closed with
an elastic membrane.

It will not be difficult for the reader, with the aid of our previous representa-
tion of the general scheme, to conceive in what manner this apparatus, under its
actual conditions, must operate when the membrane of the tympanum is made
to oscillate by the impression of the air-waves. If the membrane of the tym-
panum be driven inwards, both malleus and incus move as if they were but one
piece, though, at first, it is true, only the handle of the malleus is directly moved ;
but the incus follows the impulse, the adjustment admitting of no counter action.

Both turn upon the common axis, which consists of the long projection of the
malleus, and the short process of the incus, so that the neck and head of the
malleus, and thus the part of the apparatus lying above the axis, describe an are

outwards and downwards, th handle of the malleus, on the other hand, and the
long process of the incus describe an arc inwards and upwards, and consequently
the stapes fixed at the end of this long process is pressed more deeply into the
oval window of the labyrinth If the membrane of the tympanum bends out-
wards with the receding wave, the preceding movements are reversed, the part
of the apparatus above the axis turns inwards and upwards, the part below the
axis outwards and downwards, so that the base of the stapes is proportionably
withdrawn from the oval opening. These changes of direction, alternating in
rapid succession, produce undulations in the fluid of the labyrinth, of which we
shall presently have occasion to speak.

We should by no means think of the described movements of this system of
ossicles as being of any considerable extent; on the contrary, the displacements
undergone by its several parts from the appulse of even the strongest waves upon
the tympanum are excessively slight ; indeed, we meet with certain arrangements
in the apparatus which are evidently calculated to restrict the extent of these
movements. ‘This end is subserved, especially, by the ligamentous fastenings of
the axis of movement and of the base of the stapes. Were it intended that the
malleus and incus should follow, freely and unimpeded, the most extreme flex-
ions, inwards and outwards, which the membrane of the tympanum might exe-
cute under the influence of the air-waves, the ends of the axis must have been
inserted, like those of an axletree, in sockets which oppose no resistance except
that arising from friction. But the ends of the axis in question are tightly secured
by tense ligatures, which are twisted by every turn of the axis, and by virtue of
their elasticity offer the more resistance the greater the torsion. In like manner
a resistance is opposed to the movements of the apparatus by the nature of the
ligature which unites the base of the stapes with the fenestral opening ; the small
membranous border, before described, very quickly arrests by its tension the intro-
mission and retreat of the foot-plate. It is apparent, also, that the resistance

‘thus offered restricts the oscillations of the tympanum itself, causing them to be
of less extent than they would be, under an equal force of the air-waves, were
the membrane not united with the ossicles. ‘The object of this restriction is
easily conjectured. Though we know not what force of the atmospheric undu-
lations can be borne by the extremities of the nerves suspended in the fluid of
the labyrinth, yet we may well infer that they would be injuriously affected by a
very violent shock, as the nerve of sight is dazzled by too intense an undulation
of the luminous ether. Asin the eye protective arrangements are met with which
in a certain degree shield the optic nerve from too strong an impression of the
light, an analogous intention may, with the greatest probability, be ascribed to
the adjustments which in the small bones of the tympanum act in restraint of
their movements. This probability almost becomes certainty when we take into
view a further arrangement of this apparatus, for which scarcely any other object
can be imagined than to prevent tvo violent a percussion of the fluid of the laby-
rinth. This arrangement we will now examine somewhat more closely.

Wherefore do we find, in place of an inflexible lever, consisting of one piece,
such as is supposed in our representation of the general scheme of operations, and
as would have fulfilled all the conditions of those operations, an apparatus com-
posed of two separate parts, malleus and incus, connected with one another by a
species of hinge. What are the kind of movements for which this hinge is des-
tined, and what is the signification of this mobility ? Why, again, is the stapes
a separate bone? To be able to answer these questions, we cannot dispense with
bringing to the notice of our reader the existence and mechanical relations of two
small muscles, evidently destined for the movement of these bones of the ear,
one of them pertaining to the malleus, the other to the stapes. The first is the
more important; it springs from about the middle of the skull, passes with
its soft and somewhat long fasciculus of fibres, in a channel of its own, io the
cavity of the tympanum, into which it penetrates, with its tendinous end,
158 ON THE SENSES.

opposite to the tympanic membrane. The tendon goes obliquely through the ~
cavity, and is attached, at a right angle, to the handle of the malleus, near the
turning point. We must suppose it to be known what a muscle is, and shall
therefore only observe that every muscle has the power of contracting under
a certain influence of the uerves, by which means a thickening takes place in
the body of the muscle, and its two ends are brought nearer to one another.
When the muscle in question, the so-called tensor tympanz, contracts at the
excitation of its nerve, it tends, since its interior point of origin is immovably
fixed, to draw its exterior point of insertion, and consequently the handle of
the malleus, inwards. But the malleus alone cannot freely follow this traction,
first, because it is itself fastened by its long projection to the wall of the cavity
of the tympanum; secondly, because it is inserted between the coats of the
tympanic membrane; thirdly, because it is connected by articulation with the
incus. It is not easy to determine with certainty in what manner this resistance
modifies the displacement of the malleus by the muscular traction. Were the
malleus and incus united in one piece, the operation of the muscle could be no
other than that of a condensed wave of air coming from without; it would turn
the lever apparatus in such manner on the above described transverse axis, that
the handle of the malleus and the longer process of the incus would move in-
wards and upwards, and the stapes be thereby pressed deeper into the fenestra
ovalis, while the membrane of the tympanum united to the handle must also
comply with the traction, be drawn further inwards, and consequently rendered
more tense. This is, in fact, the muscular effect which is generally recognized,
and has procured for the muscle its name of ‘tensor tympani.” There are cir-
cumstances, however, which justify hesitation in admitting that in this simple
way everything is explained. The muscle is relatively very long and its tendon
attached so near the turning-point of the malleus, that if, through the contrac-
tion, it were shortened by a very small part of its length, the result would be
a comparatively very large introversion of the malleus. Now, the membrane
of the tympanum might indeed, under strong tension, follow with the malleus
the traction of the muscle to a considerable extent; but not so the incus, be-
cause the penetration of the stapes into the fenestra ovalis would encounter in-
superable resistance, partly in the ligature of the foot-plate by the narrow bor-
der, partly in the fluid which can only yield so far as the opposed opening of
the labyrinth, the so-called fenestra rotunda, permits. Hence a forcible pres-
sure of the stapes would render the propagation of the sound-producing move-
ment wholly impossible, since no condensed wave would be capable of driving
it more deeply inwards, no rarefied wave could move it outwards against the
traction of the muscle. The length of the fibres of the muscle shows, on the
other hand, that the magnitude of the movement for which it is intended can be
no such very slight one, for, throughout our body, the length of the muscular
fibres is found to be in direct proportion to the extent of the movement to be
accomplished by them. The supposition is therefore forced upon us that the.
muscle in question can move the malleus alone to’a certain extent, without any
proportionable movement of the incus; that the malleus, while, with the mem-
brane of the tympanum, it obeys the traction of the muscle, is pressed more
firmly against the incus and into the joint which connects both. This hypoth-
esis is the more plausible, because by this alone is explained the presence of the
articulation, for which there would otherwise be no apparent reason. We must
unfortunately renounce the design of laying before the reader proof of the cor-
rectness of the hypothesis drawn from the structure of the articulation, the di-
rection of the muscular traction, &c., for the discussion of these extremely subtle
relations would be impossible without the employment of preparations from
nature, and would perhaps even then leave the matter in doubt. We can there-
fore only trust to the reader’s faith when we allege that the tensor muscle, in
contracting, draws the malleus somewhat inward, thereby occasioning greater
THE SENSE OF HEARING 159

tension of the tympanum, but leaves the incus in its natural position, because it
turns the malleus less upon the axis common to the two ossicles than upon a
vertical axis which passes through the point at which its long projection is at-
tached to the wall of the cavity. Both malleus and incus acquire, through the
resulting pressure of their articulating surfaces against each other, a new rel-
ative position, but act in this new position, towards the waves of sound arriving
from without, as a single lever which propagates their impressions by means of
the stapes to the fluid of the labyrinth.

If our readers should perhaps think this explanation of a small and incon-
spicuous mechanism tiresome and superfluous, while we can take no exception
to the first of these epithets, we must protest against the application of the
second; the influence of that mechanism on the hearing is, in fact, of the highest
importance. In what follows we shall simply regard, as the effect of the muscle
in question, an increase of the tension of the membrane of the tympanum, and
shall inquire in what consists the utility of that effect. There can be no doubt
that it consists in deadening the effect of too intense an action of the waves of
sound. It isa physical fact that strongly stretched membranes respond to these
waves with less intensity, are thrown by them into weaker vibrations, than
membranes in a state of less tension; a fact which has been shown by multi-
plied experiments and may be bere taken for granted. As the skin of a drum
is pressed inwards by the hand with more difficulty when it is tightly stretched
than when relaxed, so the membrane of our ear opposes the greater resistance
to the force of the impinging undulations of the air the greater the tension of
the membrane. It is a matter of indifference whether the stretching force is
exerted around the rim in the plane of the membrane, or, as is the case with
the action of the tensor tympani, at the centre of the membrane and perpen-
dicularly to its plane. It has already been seen that the resistance opposed by
the membrane to the air-wave increases in proportion to its convex curvature
from the increasing force of the elastic reaction; the tensor muscle, which acts
like a wave of condensation in producing inward flexion of the membrane and
thereby increasing its tension, must in like manner intensify the elastic forces
and increase the resistance to the air-waves. Now, if the membrane, in conse-
quence of the increased tension, executes vibrations of less magnitude, in the
same degree will the oscillations of the small bones which are moved by it, and
finally the intensity of the undulations in the fluid of the labyrinth, be abated;
in a word, a given air-wave excites a weaker sensation of sound under strong
tension of the tympanum than under slight tension.

This result may at any time be verified in the simplest manner—not, indeed,
by a voluntary contraction of the tensor tympani, but by other means which we
possess of increasing the tension of the membrane The cavity of the tympa-
num is not altogether closed up, for the Eustachian tube penetrates into it with
a rather long channel, which, at its anterior extremity, opens into the hinder
part of the throat near the palate; by this channel the air within the cavity is
placed in communication with the outer atmosphere, which, in the act of breath-
ing, passes by the orifice of the tube. By a certain effort, during that act, it is
in our power to press the air through this tube into the cavity of the tympanum,
and, by another sort of effort, to withdraw it therefrom; the first takes place if,
in the act of ordinary expiration, we bar the egress of the air through the mouth
and nose, and thus compel its passage into the Eustachian tube; the second, if,
with closed mouth and nose, we make an effort at inhalation, and, by thus en-
larging the space occupied by air, produce its rarefaction in all parts of the re-
spiratory apparatus, and consequently in the cavity of the tympanum. In both
cases the tympanic membrane is more tightly braced ; in the former the inhaled
air presses the yielding membrane outwards; in the latter the membrane is
drawn more strongly inwards in consequence of the rarefaction of the internal
air, and the same effect is produced as by a contraction of the tensor muscle,
In both cases obtuseness of hearing is the result. If we press air with force

into the cavity, there oceurs, at the moment when the air enters, a cracking or
clashing noise, which is very clearly perceptible to ourselves, and may even be
heard by others, if their ear be brought near to ours; during the whole time
that air is thus compressed in the cavity there exists, but perceptible only by
ourselves, a humming noise, which increases and decreases with the force of the
compression. ‘he nature and causes of this singular noise in one’s own ear
are not determined with certainty. According to an old and widely-received
opinion, the cracking sound arises from a sudden and voluntary contraction of
the tensor muscle and the consequent sudden stretching of the membrane of the
tympanum ; but as the noise does not, as the supporters of this opinion believe,
- occur at the moment when air ceases to be driven into the cavity, but, on the
contrary, at the moment when it commences, this view is clearly erroneous.
The noise arises upon the sudden flexure outwards of the membrane, and
therefore with the tensor muscle relaxed. A conjecture advanced by the author
of these lines is to the effect that the phenomenon in question is perhaps to be
explained in a manner analogous to the well known cracking which ensues
when a finger is suddenly and forcibly pulled, and proceeds from a sudden sep-
aration of the closely contiguous surfaces of the articulation between the mal-
leus and incus; it supposes that the abrupt outward flexure of the membrane
may produce an instantaneots and audible severance of these surfaces, of which
the first must follow the membrane, while the last cannot, on account of the
unyielding ligature of the stapes. ‘This conjecture it would be difficult to verify,
wherefore we shall not dwell upon it, but return to the dullness produced in the
perceptions of the organ by the contraction of the muscle of the malleus.

The intention of this superinduced dullness of hearing is apparent from what
has been said above; it consists in preventing a too strong and dangerous con-
cussion of the tender nerve fibres by unduly intense undulations of the medium
of sound. ‘That this end should be attained, it is unconditionally necessary that
the tensor muscle should, at the right time—that is, when air-waves of a certain
intensity enter the organ—be brought into action, and this really takes place,
although the “how” has not been indubitably shown. It is thought by many
that the will provides for the seasonable interposition of the muscular contrac-
tion; that is to say, that, if a very strong sound reaches the sensorium, the will
calls into service the conscious reaction of the suppressive mechanism. This is
neither proved nor probable, for the will would be a very precarious sentinel.
In sleep, or when the attention is wholly diverted from the perceptions of the
organ, the will would not fulfil its duty, and the nerves would be abandoned to
the mischievous effects of immoderate sound-waves. The security would be :
much greater if the operation of the muscle were brought about by a simple but
sure mechanism, which should be set a going by the air-waves in a degree cor-
responding to their intensity. And this is doubtless the case; the excitation of
the nerves of movement takes place, in all probability, through a reflex action
of the nerves, just as it is by this reflex action that the pupil of the eye is nar-
rowed, and the dazzling effect of too intense light-waves thereby diminished. If —
a very intense wave of sound reaches the ear, so that the auditory nerves are
thrown into strong excitement, these immediately transfer in the brain that ex-
citement to the nerve fibres of the tensor muscle with which they are in direct
communication by means of a cellular apparatus; the centrifugal excitement
thus. propagated, (the nervous current), on arriving at the muscle, determines a
contraction of its fibres—a contraction which will be more considerable, the
stronger the excitement and more forcible the air-wave. In this way, it is true,
the tension of the tympanum, which serves for deadening the -sound, comes
somewhat post festum, since already a part of the wave has been conveyed with
undiminished intensity to the fluid of the labyrinth and the nerves of hearing;
that part, namely, which calls the reflex action of the nervous excitation into
existence. But it suffices probably for the protection of the nerves of hearing,
if only a long continuance of the violent concussion is spared them; but; from

the rapidity with which the nervous current is propagated, and the shortness of

the route through a nerve of hearing to the brain, and thence again through the
nerves of motion to the tensor muscle, that part of the waves of sound which
takes undiminished effect will, in most cases, be excessively small in comparison
with that whose intensity is broken by the obtunding apparatus. In the eye it
is no better. Here also the path of the reflex action, by which the protective
apparatus is brought into service, lies through the nerves of the sense itself: the
strong excitement of the optic nerve by dazzling rays of light is transferred in
the brain to the motive nerves of the .so-called iris, and determines this to a
contraction of the orifice by which the rays are admitted. So much concerning

_ this corrective apparatus to the ear. Respecting the operation and uses of the

small and short muscle called the stapedius, which springs from the wall of the
cavity opposite to the stapes and is attached by its tendon to the neck of the
latter, there prevails much greater uncertainty; we shall, therefore, spare our
readers a discussion of conjectures which are untenable, or, at least, destitute of

roof. Possibly this muscle also is destined to the purpose of lessening the
effect of intense air-waves.

Before we direct our attention to the labyrinth and the apparatus of the nerves
of hearing, we should briefly consider some of the relations borne by the cavity
of the tympanum and the duct called the Eustachian tube, by which it is con-
nected with the cavity of the mouth. Although not the slightest doubt can exist
as to the immediate signification of these parts, and there are no grounds for
supposing this explanation of their existence inconclusive, yet much ingenuity
and fruitless pains have been employed in vindicating for them far other and the
most singular purposes. Obviously, the cavity and the tube must exist in the
ear as the air-space and air-hole in an-ordinary drum. The membrane of the
tympanum could not vibrate were it not surrounded on both sides by air;
the small bones of the ear would be immovable if, instead of being in air, they
were fixed in some mass of solids. The air in the cavity, since it would be
compressed by the inward curvatures of the membrane, would oppose resistance
to the movements of the latter if it did not find in the tube a ready issue when
the membrane is driven inwards, and ready entrance when the membrane again

“swings outwards. This is so simple and clear that all further explanation would

seem unnecessary. We shall. however, briefly notice some of the hypotheses
advanced on this subject, and hope to show, even to the uninitiated reader, how
untenable they are. It has been surmised, for instance, that the waves of sound
which the vibrating membrane of the tympanum must communicate as well to
the air contained in the cavity as to the ossicles cannot properly be supposed to
be lost, but must also be available for the use of the organ of hearing, just as if
it were a criminal prodigality of nature if every one of these waves which im-
part their effect with such constant and beneficent impartiality to all that can
vibrate did not reach the auditory nerves of man or beast. The ossicles of the
tympanum are so apposite, certain, and sensitive an apparatus for the propaga-
tion of these sound-producing undulations, that there needs no second route for
conducting them to the nerve; but were such an one really necessary, nature
could have chosen none more unsuitable than that through the air of the tym-
panic cavity and the Eustachian tube. For these self-propagating waves of the
air contained in the cavity, there is but one conceivable manner in which they
could reach the nerves; no one would think of asserting that they could be
transmitted to the osseous wall of the labyrinth, from this to the enclosed fluid,
and from this to the nerves; but the membrane which has been mentioned above
as closing the fenestra rotunda, the opposed opening of the labyrinth, and which
is pressed on one side by the air of the cavity, on the other by the fluid of
the labyrinth, has been seized on as furnishing the requisite mechanism. It has
been contended that the air-waves of the cavity must throw this membrane into
vibration, just as the waves in the external meatus of the ear do the tympanic

Membrane, and that the vibrations of the former in the fluid of the labyrinth

11 s 66
162 ON THE SENSES.

would be as capable of creating waves for the excitation of the nerves as the
movements of the stapes in the fenestra ovalis. Initself this last position 1s not to
be controverted; but it is to be inquired, first, whether the membrane is really
thrown into sensible vibration; and secoudly, whether its oscillations can take
effect upon the nerves simultaneously with those propagated through the ossicles
of the tympanum. We do not hesitate to answer both questions in the negative.
To be thrown into vibration by air-waves, a membrane must receive their impact,
as far as possible, in a perpendicular direction. But this membrane of the fenes-
tra rotunda lies as unfavorably as possible in regard to waves proceeding from
the tympanum, inasmuch as it is turned away from the tympanum and towards
the Eustachian tube, so that the waves can as little strike it directly as, in the
dark, one could strike a disk whose edge instead of its flat surface was presented.

Now, that it is not inaccessible to the waves is certainly true, since its surface
fronts directly on the air chamber; but its position would much sooner suggest
the idea that it is, as far as possible, sheltered from the effect of these waves
than that it is designed for their reception and transmission. But even if we.
admit that it is, in a slight degree, movable by the waves of the tympanic
cavity, it is not difficult to show that these movements must be overborne and
annulled by the opposed movements simultaneously imparted to it by the fluid
waves proceeding from the stapes. When an external wave of condensation
drives the membrane of the tympanum inwards, the stapes is driven deeper into
the fenestra ovalis and the fluid of the labyrinth is propelled before it; but this
propulsion is only possible, as has been shown, through the simultaneous out-
ward curvature of the opposite membrane, that, namely, of the fenestra rotunda.
Now, the same inward movement of the tympanum generates simultaneously a
condensed wave in the air of the tympanic cavity, and if this wave strikes the
membrane of the fenestra rotunda it cannot do otherwise than drive this mem-
brane inwards, and therefore in a direction opposite to the former. But as the
waves of the fluid in the labyrinth will, no doubt, act with more force on the
membrane than the air-waves of the cavity, the former must prevail and the
membrane curve outwards in spite of the latter force. Were the preponderance
reversed, it is manifest that any movement of the fluid by the stapes would be
impossible, and the whole system of ossicles would be brought to a stand.
Hence the sheltered and most unfavorable position of our membrane as regards
the reception of the air-waves would seem to have been wisely ordered, and to
be an indispensable condition for the propagation of the sound through the small
bones of the ear to the labyrinth.

Other hypotheses respecting the intent of the cavity of the tympanum and
the Eustachian tube seem to have as little foundation as theabove. It has been
thought by some that the tube was established for the purpose of conveying
waves of sound from the throat to the organ of hearing. When convinced that
this notion was untenable and that the tube could be of no avail in conducting
such sound-waves as reach the pharyngeal cavity from the outer air, the same
class of theorists fell upon the somewhat naive idea that the tube in question
must be designed for sounds proceeding from the organs of speech in its close
vicinity; that it serves, in a word, for hearing our own voice. Now there are
many persons, certainly, well pleased to hear themselves speak, who would be
duly thankful to nature for her civility in establishing quite a special and private
route for the passage. of their own voice besides the common one into which the
bellow of any casual bullock may wander. But, in the first place, nature has
created our voice rather for the ears of others than our own, and, except that
we might learn to speak, cared probably little about its being audible to our-
selves; in the second place, it may be shown that, setting aside any possible
concurrence with the sound-waves of bellowing bullocks, the common channel
of sound through the outer air and the outer ear to the tympanum not only suf-
fices fully for the perception of our own voice, but, under ordinary circumstances,
is the only channel for its admission. The Kustachian tube is not by any
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 163

means always thoroughly open, but usually its walls lie close to one another,
although so loosely that every inward curvature of the tympanum readily
separates them for the expulsion of a portion of the air within the cavity. It
opens not so readily to the air of the pharynx; a peculiar effort is necessary to
effect an entrance of the air in the above mentioned experiment. In ordinary
speaking and singing this effort is never used; the air coming from the lungs
chooses the broad and unobstructed outlet of the mouth or nostril, and passes
by the orifice of both ear-tubes without opening them; consequently, no sound
producing air-waves come ordinarily by this channel to the organs of hearing.
That happens only when, in speaking or singing, we make a peculiar effort, and
then indeed we suddenly hear our voice, which before sounded as coming from
without, with deafening force and as if it originated in the ear itself. This last
circumstance is of particular significance; we shall see further on that, in idea,
we then only judge the source, which we regard as cause of a sound, to be with-
out us, when the waves thereby generated reach our organ of hearing through
the external meatus of the ear; but whenever it happens that this is impervious
to the air-waves, we seek the source of the sound zzthin ourselves, even when
it is really without. There can, therefore, be no question of hearing our own
voice through the Eustachian tube, not to say of its destination for this purpose.
We could submit more of such hypotheses to criticism were it worth while.
Much has been idly said respecting a strengthening of the waves of sound in
the cavity of the tympanum through resonance, but a closer examination of these
suppositions would require a special investigation of the physical nature of re-
sonance, its conditions and laws, which would lead us too far, and, candidly to
speak, be difficult of explanation to novices in this kind of knowledge.

We leave now the outworks of the organ of hearing and enter upon the
proper citadel, the recess in which the ramifications of the auditory nerve are
distributed for the reception of the waves of sound, for whose conveyance the
apparatus we have been considering is destined. This recess, to which the
name of /abyrinth has been given, is, as that name implies, a wonderfully com-
plicated structure, in which, though we need no thread of Ariadne to lead us
aright, we everywhere encounter mysterious arrangements, whose full acoustical
and physiological understanding is reserved for future times. The labyrinth is
a, cavity surrounded with walls of bone and filled with a fluid, having two
openings, of which one (the fenestra ovalis) is closed by the stapes and its an-
nular ligament, the other (the fenestra rotunda) by a membrane; this cavity
bas not, however, the simple shape of a sack, but consists of many compart-
ments and canals in a winding form. If the collective labyrinth be carved from
the so-called petrous bone, out of the substance of which it is channelled, it
presents, when seen from without, the appearance of the accompanying figure.
It consists of two chief divisions, the
vestibule V with the semicircular canals
K, and the cochlea S. We will con-
sider first the vestibule and the canals.
The proper vestibule, which forms the
middle part of the whole labyrinth, is
ovoidal in shape, and measures about
one-fifth of an inch from before back-
wards and a.little less from above
downwards; its wall exhibits eight
Openings. One of these is the already
mentioned fenestra ovalis, which leads
into the cavity of the tympanum and
receives the foot-plate of the stapes ;
a second leads immediately into the
spiral canal of the cochlea; a third
passes to a narrow channel bearing the

ino

name of aqueductus vestibuli ; the remaining five openings lead into the three
semicircular canals, while each of these canals has its opening orifice in the ves-
tibule and runs back with a terminal orifice into the same; but as one of these
apertures is common to two of the canals, there are, in effect, only five of them
instead of six. The vestibule itself shelters in its water-filled cavity two little
membranaceous sacs, also filled with fluid and imbedded in separate depressions
(fovee) of its wall, being channels for the nerves, of which we shall hereafter
speak. 'The semicircular canals are narrow bony tubes, bent somewhat into the
shape of a horseshoe, enlarged at their commencement and termination, and
from their position and direction are distinguished as the superior, posterior and
horizontal canal. As nothing results from their special position, we will not
detain the reader with the pedantry of a scrupulous anatomical description of
them; the above outline conveys an adequate idea of their form and direction.
In each of these canals is fixed a membranous tube, which has the same form
as the canal, as if it were a reduced cast of it, and dilating therefore at the be-
ginning and end of the canal into a small roundish cavity called the ampulla.
The interspace between the membranous tube and the osseous wall of the canal,
as well as the tube itself, is filled with a watery secretion, which is in immediate
communication with that of the vestibule. The sack-shaped origin of each
membranous tube is a conduit for the nerves. The cochlea well deserves its
name; the best idea of its form may be acquired by observing the shell of the
common garden snail. As in this shell a spiral and constantly diminishing
channel winds, trom the base to the apex, around a central spindle, so the inte-
rior chamber of the cochlea consists of a similar screw-shaped canal, which de-
scribes, with a like progressive diminution, two and a half turns around the
modzolus or central axis, terminating, not in a point, but in a funnel-shaped
dilatation. A more striking difference between the shell of a snail and the
cochlea consists in this: that the canal of the latter is not single, but is divided,
throughout its length, by a transverse partition into two passages, one of which
runs above, the other below the dividing wall, but which communicate with one
another in the funnel-shaped expansion; resembling in some sort a winding stair-
case by which one might ascend to the top, and, stepping over again, arrive at the
bottom. An idea of this arrangement may be conveyed by the annexed figure,
which represents a central longitudinal section
Fig. 10. of the cochlea from its base to its apex. A
denotes the central axis, S the partition wall
running around it, V and P the winding pas-
sages separated from one another by this wall.
These passages bear the name of scale (stairs) ;
that above the partition, marked V, being
called the scala vestibuli, that below, marked
P, the scala tympani. They owe these names
respectively to the circumstance that the former
communicates, by an oval aperture, with the
vestibule, while the latter is closed below by
the membrane of the fenestra rotunda, which faces the cavity of the tympanum.
Both passages are filled with fluid which, at the entrance of the scala vestibuli,
is in immediate communication with the fluid of the vestibule. The partition
S, which divides the canal into two passages, is constituted, as the figure repre-
sents, by a thin lamina winding spirally around the axis, to which it is attached -
by its inner edge, while its outer edge adheres to the outer wall of the cochlea.
Tt consists of two zones, as they are called, united with one another, the one
osscous, the other membranous, which together extend quite across the canal;
that part of it which lies contiguous to the axis being composed of two thin
lamella of bone and reaching as far as the middle, while the outer part, by
which it is continued to the opposite wall, consists of a soft membranous sub-
stance, serving, as we shall see, to support the tender apparatus of the nerves.

THE SENSE OF HEARING. 165

The deseription in its several parts of the auditory nerve, which distributes
filaments in the cavity of the labyrinth for the reception of the advancing
waves of sound, is rather a precarious task, which we may facilitate however,
without any real loss to the reader, by forbearing to enter into those subtle de-
tails which, if a novice, he would seareely understand. Nor will this be wholly
a sin of omission, for, truth to say, the wonderful apparatus here displayed to
us by the microscope is, in its physiological signification, not much less than
altogether unknown to the physiologists themselves. It is only to-day, so to
speak, that the coryphceus of our science has succeeded in detecting the true ana-
tomical constitution of the extremities of the nerves of hearing in the cochlea
and vestibule, so difficult is it to submit uninjured to observation these infinitely
delicate structures, hidden deeply in the skull and shut up within osseous walls,
and to grope one’s way in the astonishing complexity of the elementary tissues
which the microscope reveals in them. 'The auditory nerve, running back from
its origin at the base of the brain, issues, after a short course through several
openings in the petrous bone, into the labyrinth, and here divides into two prin-
cipal branches destined for different parts. Each penetrates by a separate aper-
ture, the one into the vestibule, the other into the cochlea. The former again
divides into numerous filaments which direct their course partly to the two mem-
branous sacs of the vestibule, partly to the membranous ampuila situated at the
beginning of the semicircular canals, where their extremities are distributed
something after the manner of a delicate brush. These minute fibres, each of
which forms an isolated conductor of the nervous current, terminate finally in
delicate bulbs or nerve cells. It is a remarkable peculiarity that at the terminal
expansion of the nerves of hearing a finely grained calcareous substance is in-
terspersed through the delicate fibrous tissue of the vestibular sacs, consisting,
as is clearly apparent under the microscope, of minute but distinctly formed
erystals. Chemical investigation has shown that this otolith or “sand of the
ear,” consists of a compound widely dispersed through animate and inanimate
nature, the same which, under the name of chalk or marble, forms mountains and
rocks, and which, as shell, protects from outward injury the embryo of the
feathered tribe ; in a word, of carbonate of lime. It may be mentioned by the
way that this calcareous matter is not peculiar to man, but occurs also in the
organ of most animals, partly as a finely crystallized mass, partly in larger or
smaller crystals ; its significancy as respects the hearing has as yet resisted all
efforts of conjecture and experiment. 'The second principal branch of the andi-
tory nerve, the cochlear, passes to the base of the cochlea and ascends within
its axis to the apex, becoming more and more attenuated as it continues to give
out filaments which proceed from it at right angles between the plates of the
bony lamina, to their outer border. Corresponding to the spiral winding of this
septum or partition wall, the filamentary offshoots from the trunk form also a
spiral line. At the edge of the bony portion of the lamina these filaments issue
upon the membranous portion and pursue their course at first along its under
surface and consequently within the scala tympani, but presently pass through
different small foramina into the scala vestibuli and now run transversely along
the upper surface of the membranous lamina towards the outer wall of the cochlea,
in the neighborhood of which they terminate. That part of these filaments
which traverses the upper surface of the membranous lamina in the scala vesti-
buli, is, however, no longer the simple nerve fibre which we observed in the trunk
and in its course between the plates of the bony portion of the lamina; it has
become a singularly complex structure with cells, partly inserted in its progress,
partly as appendages of the stem. It would require no little detail to give an ex-
act account of the microscopic constitution of these nerve extremities, nor would
our inquiry even then be much advanced, since physiology is still greatly in the
dark as regards this delicate mechanism. ‘The reader will perhaps obtain the
best idea thereof if he imagines himself ascending, suppose in the scala vesti-
166 ON THE SENSES.

buli, by a real winding staircase, the stairs ‘of which consist of many thousand
small and closely contiguous steps, each step being represented by the trans-
versely directed terminal part of one of these nerve filaments. It is still in
dispute whether this terminal apparatus floats freely in the fluid of the scala
vestibuli, or adheres by its outer end to the membranous lamina; whether it is
covered over by a second delicate membrane and thus is enclosed between two
membranes, &c.

We proceed now to a consideration of the transmission of sound in the lab-
yrinth. We have seen that the waves of sound are communicated to the fluid
of the labyrinth by the piston-like movements of the stapes in the fenestra ovalis,
and have been led to recognize the corresponding out and inward curvatures of
the membrane of the fenestra rotunda as the indispensable condition through
which the undulatory movement of the fluid is rendered possible. But how
these waves are constituted, how propagated, what their special destinations in
the different divisions of the labyrinth, in what manner they operate on the ex-
tremities of the nerves in the vestibule and the cochlea, for what reason these ex-
tremities present to them so peculiar an apparatus and arrangement, these are
questions which press for an answer, and until answered debar us fromasolution of
the mystery in which the excitation of the nerves by the waves of sound is envel-
oped; the answers given to them have thus far, however, proved poor and un-
satisfactory. The nature of the fluid-waves of the labyrinth is essentially the
same with that of the air-waves; according as the stapes presses inwards or is
withdrawn, there is a succession of waves of condensation and rarefaction, in
which the single particles of the fluid, as they follow one another, act precisely
as was above explained in reference to the particles of air. The course of the
waves is, at least in its principal features, clearly and definitely prescribed ; the
waves must first be propagated into the vestibule, whereby the membranous
sacs suspended therein, together with the extremities of their nerves, will be
agitated. Were the vestibule entirely shut in, while only the fenestra rotunda,
closed with its membrane, found a place at a point of the osseous wall, the
waves would be restricted in their play, and would everywhere bound against
the solid structure and be beaten back from it like the sea from a rocky coast.
The repulsed waves would encounter those which were following, and disturb
their action by giving to their advancing particles a contrary impulse. As, in
this way, the whole effect of the waves in producing a regular excitation of the
nerves would be frustrated, it is evidently of the utmost importance that the
vestibule should be provided with the numerous openings which lead to the canals
filled with fluid; these canals serve as conduits for the waves of the vestibule,
which must necessarily traverse them as well as the long passages of the coch-
lea before reaching the fenestra rotunda, which lies at their further extremity,
and which, by the yielding of its elastic membrane, alone renders the existence
of the waves possible. he action and course of the wave in the semicireular
canals are difficult to ascertain with physical accuracy; but, as regards the
cochlea, it is at least clear that, since only the upper scala opens into the vesti-
bule from which it takes its name, the wave must traverse the whole canal by
this passage to the apex, then pass over into the scala tympani and descend by
the latter, which lies underneath the dividing lamina, until it finally takes effect
on the membrane of the fenestra rotunda at the base. During its course through
the scala vestibuli it must strike ia regular succession upon all the nerve ex-
tremities which cross that passage, and exert upon each of them, one after the
other, its peculiar excitation. This is but a rough sketch, it is true, of the -
movement of the waves of the labyrinth, but it is nearly all that we know with
certainty. Efforts have not been wanting to penetrate further, and ‘especially
to ascertain whether, where, and in what direction the waves are reflected or
thrown back, whether this reflection produces an increased degree of undulating
intensity through resonance (somewhat in the manner of the reflection of the
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 167

waves of sound from the walls of a lofty apartment.) Numerous investigations
have been instituted by the most ingenious experimentalists to throw light upon
these subtle inquiries, but the results have been so scanty and uncertain that we
abstain from the discussion of the different conjectures advanced, especially as
the possibility of making them sufficiently intelligible must be doubted. It has
also been a question, ard one which has long been the subject of lively scientific
discussion, to what end serve the different arrangements observed in the exten-
sion of the terminal portions of the nerves, first in the saccules of the vestibule
and semicircular canals, in which the brush-shaped ramifications of the nerve
extremities are struck simultaneously by advancing particles of the fluid; sec-
ondly, in the cochlea, in which these nerve extremities are so arranged behind
one another that the waves must strike them successively one after the other ;
or, more generally, what special design have the cochlea, the vestibule, the semi-
circular canals?. We might fill pages with the enumeration and criticism of
the conjectures in which a solution has been sought, and would only see that
most of them were destitute of proof, some even absurd. It has been supposed,
for example, that the semicircular canals serve for a knowledge of the direction
from which the waves of sound proceed. As if the perception of the direction
could at all be the object of an impression of the sense ; as if a wave of the fluid
could telegraph to the mind, through the nerve which is struck, the point of the
compass from which the excitation is directed ; as if a different direction of the
fluid-waves within the labyrinth could be the herald of a different direction of
the air-waves without! We hope to explain presently in what manner we ob-
tain an idea of the position in space of the external sources of sound. In regard
tu the cochlea, the opinion has long obtained favor that it is intended to conduct
to the nerves contained in it the waves of sound directly communicated from
the air to the bones of the head and propagated through these, while the vesti-
bule is destined only for the reception of the vibrations transmitted through the
auditory canal, the tympanum, and the ossicles. This assumption rests on the
early but erroneous opinion that the nerve filaments of the cochlea terminated
between the bony plates of the laminar partition. Since it is known, however,
that they issue from these and terminate free in the fluid of the cochlear canal,
this hypothesis has become untenable, for air-waves (and it is these almost
alone which convey a sound to the human ear) are transmitted with so much
difficulty and so much enfeebled to the bones of the cranium, and again with
such difficulty and feebleness from these to a fluid (the cochlea fluid,) that it is
scarcely conceivable that in this way a sound producing vibration could reach
the nerves of the cochlea witha strength sufficient for their excitation. In short,
the unpalatable but honest confession of ignorance is the only answer which can
properly be given to the above questions.

We have finished our explanation of the progress of the auditory excitation
in our organ of hearing; we have followed the sound-producing movement from
its origin in the outward object (the vibrating string) through the external air,
the external ear, the auditory canal, the tympanum, the movable bones, and the
fluid of the labyrinth, to the nerves. We come now to the pith of the subject,
the problem which it is the part of acoustical physiology to solve, to the ques-
tion, how does this movement operate upon the nerves when it has reached
them? How does it release in them the so-called “nerve current,” which, pzo-
eceding through their fibres to the brain, there, by a certain apparatus, so works
upon the soul that the latter instantaneously conceives a sensation of sound?
We need not combat anew the irrational idea that the sound-movement, as such,
is propagated in the nerves; that a sound wave, transmitted from particle to
particle, operates as such upon the perceptive apparatus in the brain. We have
in carlier articles sufficiently established the fact that the process itself in the
nerve fibres is totally different from the external irritant of the sense which pro-
duces it; that it is a specific movement of the nerve molecules of a yet uncx-
168 ON THE SENSES.

plained nature, and probably essentially the same in all nerves, whether it be
generated by waves of light or of sound, by pressure or heat, by objects of taste
or of smell. At the peripheral end of all the nerves of sense which we have
heretofore considered, we have everywhere found or must suppose an appro-
priate terminal apparatus, whose function it is so to elaborate the excitation
which is received from without, that a movement of the current in the fibres of
the nerve shall ensue. ‘This is the case with the nerves of hearing. It is
nearly certain that it is not the simple mechanical agitation of the filaments
of the auditory nerve which excites them, for this agitation excites no other
nerve, yet is the nerve of hearing as like to all others as one copper wire to
another; the wave of sound must first call into existence some other action
which is capable of stimulating the nerve fibre. Of what nature it is, and how
the waves of the fluid of the labyrinth produce it, is wholly unexplained; we
can only designate with certainty the seat and instruments of this enabling
action; there are here as elsewhere, at the outer ends of the nerves, the minute
fibres and bulbs which the microscope discloses to us. Still less have we any
intimation how the “ current”’ of the auditory nerves, generated mediately by the
undulatory movement, acts upon the brain and the soul, so that the latter forms
the specific conception of sound. We can here only refer to the general reason-
ing by which, in previous essays, it has been shown that it is the quality of the
inner central and terminal apparatus of the nerve fibres which determines the
characteristic effect of the current, the nature of the sensation. Who knows
whether, with the sounding plummet of experiment, we shall ever succeed in
exploring these deepest mysteries of existence ?

The final result of every excitation of the auditory nerve produced by a
movement of the kind we have been describing is a spiritual incident, which,
in general terms, we denominate a sensation of sound, but of which we distin-
guish several qualities. We contrast a sensation of tone with mere noise; we
divide sounds according to their “pitch” and their tone; each of these quali-
ties again is susceptible of an endless gradation of intensity from the lightest,
only to be perceived by the most strained attention, to that which seems to
penetrate us by its intolerable force. The qualities, like the intensity of the
sensation, are determined by certain momenta referable to the nature of the ex-
ternal excitation ;. thus the pitch of the sound depends on the number of the
waves which in a given time reach the ear; the tone on the form of the waves;
the intensity on the magnitude of the displacement which the wave communi-
cates to the particles. ‘lhe explication of these relations is thus far exclusively
the affair of physics; we shall not here enter at large into this branch of learn-
ing, because it is at present really not susceptible of a physiological imterpreta-
tion; that is to say, although we know from experience that a determinate, sub-
jectively recognized sound is causatively conditioned on certain properties of
the external movement which are very impertectly understood, we are unable
to explain the why; to specify how this or that form of movement acts upon
the ear; how it operates upon the nerve; much less can we describe the specific
quality of the nervous current, which is its result, or, in the last place, the
quality of the sensation. Referring the reader, therefore, to the popular expo-
sitions of writers on physics, we shall confine ourselves here to a few observa-
tions. A sound of some definite pitch arises when a sound-producing body—
a string, for instance—executes a certain number of vibrations in a unit of time,
so long as this number is not too small or too great. In other words, the vibra-
tions are only audible, only capable of producing the appropriate excitation of
the nerves, within certain limits of frequency. Under favorable circumstances we
can hear a sound—the deepest that is possible—when a string, an air-column,
&c., executes sixteen vibrations in a second, while with yet slower vibrations
the auditory nerve, under all circumstances, remains at rest, be the intensity as
considerable as it may. On the other hand, there is also a maximum velocity
THE SENSE OF HEARING. 169

with which alone the sensation of sound—the highest possible—consists ; this
upper limit of the scale of sounds is not accurately ascertained, because with
different organs of hearing it is now higher, now lower. It is held, however,
that a sensation of sound no longer arises when the number of vibrations ex-
ceeds 64,000 ina second. This fact is well suited to show that sound exists
not without, originates not in, the vibrating string, but in our own sensation ;
else were it difficult to see why, with a certain lowest and highest number of
vibrations, the laws of movement remaining wholly unchanged, this movement
should lose the property of sound. Very conceivable is it, on the other hand,
that the auditory nerve ceases to react when the vibrations which strike it fol-
low one another too slowly or too rapidly. An exact physiological explanation
of this restriction ’of the irritability of the auditory nerve to certain limits it is
not in our power to give; but it is interesting to observe that there is yet an-
other nerve of sense which affords a complete analogy to this state of relations—
the nerve, namely, of vision. As the nerve of hearing is excited by the waves
of sound, propagated to it from solid and fluid matter, so is the optic nerve ex-
cited by the waves of the luminous ether, which are subject to the same general
laws of undulatory movement. As waves of sound of different frequency produce
an impression of different qualities of the sensation of sound or a different pitch
of tone, so waves of light of different frequency give rise to perceptions of differ-
ent color, but, as in the case of the auditory nerve, only within certain limits of
rapidity. If more than 697,000,000,000 or less than 439,000,000,000 of vibra-
tions of the luminous ether follow one another in a second, the optic nerve is
insensible of any impression, even when the vibrations undoubtedly reach it.
Between the limits above assigned for the sense of hearing lies an endless series
of differently qualified sensations, every possible number of vibrations between
16,000 and 64,000 producing a modification of quality—a sound of definite
pitch. Yet we mean not thereby to say that our faculty of discrimination
among these different qualities is itself unlimited, or, in other words, that we
are conscious of a difference of quality in the sensation when two undulations
of different rapidity strike the ear near or after one another, how small soever
the difference may be. On the contrary, it is a fact easily substantiated
that most men have originally but “a poor ear,” but that, through use, a tolera-
bly high degree of delicacy of hearing is attainable; thus, while many scarcely
recognize two sounds as of different pitch, one of which is produced by 800, the
other by 810 vibrations in a second, there are musicians who seize the differ-
ence with accuracy, and distinguish the higher from the deeper tone when the
number of vibrations is 1,200 in the one, 1,201 in the other. The auditory
nerve, or, more properly, the organ of sensation on which it operates, is in this
respect subject to the same conditions with the rest of the organs of sense, being
susceptible, through judicious and attentive use, of improvement in its perform-
ance, and specially in its faculty of discriminating between sensations of differ-
ent quality.

A highly interesting question, but one which unfortunately has set at naught
every attempt at explanation, arises out of the fact that we can perceive simul-
taneously a great number of sounds together, and distinguish the pitch, tone,
and strength of each of them. The harmonious association of different sounds may
often seem to the uninitiated a chavs, from which he is unable to distinguish the
individual members, while to the musically cultivated it is no difficult matter to
disentangle from the fullest instrumental or vocal orchestra each sound signal-
ized by a special pitch or tone, to follow the melody through all its inflections,
and clearly perceive all the transitions ; but even the laity know from experi-
ence that it is possible to single out an individual voice from the buzz of a com-
pany all speaking together. The art consists only in fixing the attention in-
flexibly on the tone or modulation which we desire to separate from the rest,
and in this respect also use refines and strengthens the discriminative faculty of
170 ON THE SENSES. -

the sense. At first glance, perhaps, this fact may not seem very singular; not
more so than the simultaneous perceptions of other organs—the skin and the
eye. Innumerable impressions on the skin are simultaneously perceived, and,
in idea, locally separated from one another, if the space between the impressions
is sufficient; and when they are situated close to one another the mind takes
cognizance of their number, and from that and their position determines the size
and form of an external object. So is it likewise with the eye, which can per-
ceive simultaneously so many objects, and direct the attention at will to each of
them as sensible and contiguous points on the retina. The analogy of this
power of local discrimination in the impressions of touch and sight with the
simultaneous hearing of several tones cannot be doubted, but, while for the first
the explanation is simple and obvious, an analogous interpretation is not appli-
cable to the sense of hearing. In the organs ot touch and sight the severance
of the simultaneous impressions rests on the local severance of their external
exciting causes; that is to say, on the excitation, through separate impressions,
of different conducting nerve fibres isolated from one another—a, point which we
had occasion to discuss when treating of the sense of touch. Could it be shown
that in the ear likewise the undulations pertaining to different sounds acted
upon different nerve fibres, a severance of impressions, in conformity with the
number of single fibres excited, would be a necessary postulate. But no proof
of this is possible; on the contrary, a consideration of the circumstances under
which sound is transmitted in the organ of hearing forces us to the conclusion
‘that each wave strikes upon all the nerve fibres, and that a number of undula-
tions, originating near one another, must blend in a single movement long before
they reach the reservoirs of the nerves. It is clear that the tympanum cannot
possibly vibrate at the same time in conformity with the impulse of several un-
dulations, slowly with the deep, rapidly with the high pitch, with this and that
acceleration, according to the character of the tone, in such wise that the simul-
taneous sounds shall be transmitted, without reciprocal disturbance, from the
tympanum, through the intermediate organs, to the labyrinth Just as a body
on which a blow from different directions simultaneously takes effect, cannot
pzoceed in the direction of both at once, but will take a middle course, so must
the vibrations of the tympanum take, according to the laws of mechanics, a
middle form, resulting from the different concomitant impulsions; and hence only
a single undulation, as representative and result of all those generated outside,
will be transmitted to the labyrinth. Of any contrivance in the labyrinth by
which this compound movement may be again resolved into its original single
elements, and each element—that is to say, each undulation belonging to a de-
termimate note or tone—be directed to a special organ, and thus transmitted to
the brain, we know nothing and can form no conception. In advance, there-
fore, it only remains to suppose that this resultant undulation, as such, strikes
on its passage and excites each successive nerve, and that it is the soul which
first resolves into its constituent elements the compound sensation arising from
without; but ow, is an inexplicable riddle.

We leave the consideration of the pure sensations of hearing, and turn lastly
to a brief discussion of the ideas derived from this sense and their mode of
origination. As with all the rest of the senses, the sensations first acquire value
and serviceableness for the intercourse of the soul with the outer world by their
association with certain ideas, which, in the previously educated sense, are so
unconsciously and infallibly identified with the sensations, that we take them for
the sensations themselves. The sensation of hearing, like every other sensation
of sense, is a purely subjective process, a transformation, it might be said, of our
consciousness. ‘The cognizance of the existence of an external source of sound
as cause of the sensation, the perception of its direction and distance in outer
space, pertain to the idea which attaches itself, through a physical operation, so
closely to the sensation, and becomes so blended with it, that we seck not only
‘ THE SENSE OF HEARING. 171

the source of sound outside of our own ear, but the sound—that is, the sensation
itself, with all its qualities; that we think the sound penetrates as such from
without through the portals of hearing to our soul. The newly-born child hears
like the grown man, has the same quality of sensation, but he knows not whence
the sound comes, knows not that it comes from without, or, indeed, that there is
anything without him. It learns gradually to distinguish outer objects from its
I, its Ego, and thus comes gradually to recognize the cause of the sensation of
sound as something existing outside of itself. We have, as a general thesis,
discussed in previous essays on the senses the process by which this objectivity
is made familiar to the human mind ; we shall here, therefore, only consider the
method in which the process is specially conducted as regards the sense of
hearing. A fact which at once guides us to a right point of view is this: that
only under a certain condition do we conceive an outward object to be the cause
of the sensation of sound, and when this condition is wanting, seek the source
of the sensation within ourselves, even when we know and are directly informed
by other senses that it lies without us; that condition is, that the sound shall be
conducted to the auditory nerve through the channel which we have been above
anatomizing, the outward ear, the tympanum, and the ossicles. If by any means
whatever the transmission of the air-waves to the tympanum and the vibration
of the latter be prevented, every sound which, being conducted by the ossicles,
reaches the auditory nerve with sufficient force, seems to us to originate within
ourselves. ‘This is most readily and strikingly shown by immersion in water.
According to the researches of one of our most ingenious physiologists, the tym-
panum under water only so long conveys the waves of sound, or propagates their
oscillations to the labyrinth, as the external passage of the ear is filled with air ;
if it be filled with water, so that the outer surface of the tympanum is bathed by
it, the transmission of waves of sound takes place only through the ossicles or
movable bones; but with considerable intensity, since the bones, though as solid
bodies they take up with difficulty sound-producing undulations of the air, take
up with facility sound-producing undulations of the water. If now, while one
is immersed, a sound under water be caused by another person, as, for instance,
by striking two stones together, this sound, so long as the auditory canal con-
tains air, will be ascribed to an external source, and its direction be correctly
determined; but so soon as the passages of the external ear are filled with water,
the sound, from whatever direction it may proceed, will seem to originate within
the head. The experiment may be variously modified ; and since in the form
just described it is somewhat inconvenient, the following method may be resorted
to: let the inquirer modulate his voice to a tune, and while continuing to do so,
suddenly close both ears firmly with his hands; immediately an entirely different
sensation will ensue, the tone of his own voice, which, with the ears open sounded
as if from without, will on the instant of the closure seem to arise from within.
Since it cannot, then, be doubted that the vibrations of the tympanum in some
manner determine the objectivity of our impressions of hearing, it is worth in-
quiring what part that instrumentality plays. The most probable conjecture is
the following: the tympanum is very richly provided with nerves of feeling,
which, like the nerves of touch of the rest of the surface of the body, are adapted
to sensations of touch and of common feeling ; these nerves are thrown into ex-
citation when the tympanum vibrates, and generate a sensation of touch, of the
quality of which we are not specially conscious, because it is, as it were, dulled
by the sensation of hearing which constantly accompanies it, but which, like
every impression on the skin, is associated with the idea of an external object as
the exciting cause. As we refer this idea obtained through the nerves of touch
to the simultaneous auditory sensation, and, indeed, falsely identify it therewith,
we arrive at a perception of the objectivity of the source of sound, without being
aware of the circuitous manner in which we acquire it. Here is again an ex-
ample how one sense comes to the aid of another, how two perceptions of sense
172 ON THE SENSES.

interlink with one another, in order to make one or the other intelligible; this
important help does the sense of touch, in community with the “muscular sense,”
afford to the sense of hearing, inasmuch as they inform us of the direction in
which lies the external source of sound. In the first place, the sensibility of
the tympanum, just alluded to, furnishes us the ready means of deciding on which
side of us the source of sound is situated, since we naturally seek it on the side
of that ear whose tympanum, being more strongly agitated by the wave of sound,
communicates to us a more intense sensation of touch. The muscles which
move our head gonvey to us, through the sensations continually connected with
their action, accurate ideas of the position of that part of our frame, and conse-
quently of both our organs of hearing, so that we are conscious of the position
in space of the more strongly vibrating tympanum. If the difference of these
sensations of the tympanum is not sufficiently distinguishable to afford a certain
judgment, we turn the head on the cervical axis hither and thither until the
sensations of touch and hearing acquire greatest intensity in one of the ears, and
then present this ear, whose position the muscular feeling teaches us, in a right
line to the source of sound, for we know by experience that in this way a given
sound is most distinctly heard. If the sensations be equally strong in beth ears,
we have no alternative but to seek the intonating body directly before or behind
us. Most probably, in discerning whether it is before or behind, above or below
us, we are guided by another class of sensations of touch, that, namely, which
results from the action of the air-waves on the cartilaginous outer ear or auricle.
There are. simple experiments which show that this member materially assists
in the discernment of the direction from which sounds proceed. If we press
both auricles closely to the head, we lose the power of discerning with certainty
whether the source is before or behind, deceive ourselves easily, and, if the ob-
ject is before, seek it behind us. If we firmly compress the auricles, and, more-
over, place our hands flat in front of both organs so that they shall stand like
the auricles, only on the wrong side, we regularly confound before and behind,
on an impartial examination of the impressions received. But for those who
would repeat these experiments we must add that prepossession in such trials is
not easily avoided ; we must eliminate with the utmost care all possible tokens,
from which, by the help of the other senses or from experience, we might form
a judgment of the position of the object. It is not easy to explain with certainty
in what manner the auricle, through its perceptions of touch, leads to a deter-
mination of the direction of sounds; but it cannot be doubted that, as regards
this function of the organ, we gradually learn to associate the different qualities
of the sensations, which is the necessary result of the impact of differently
directed waves on different parts of the auricle, with determinate ideas of place,
just as we gradually learn by experience to form a correct judgment in respect
to all the impressions received through our widely organized sense of touch.
The faculty of estimating the remoteness of a source of sound is also one
which we acquire through the indirect process of experience. In many cases it
is the sense of sight which enables us to form a judgment of the distance of the
object which generates the sound. If we do not see that object, the judgment
is only then in some degree exact when it relates to definite sounds or noises of
which we have had sufficient experience to be able to estimate the diminution
of intensity with the increasing distance. Thus is faithfully inculcated upon
our memory the intensity of the impression of a human voice in ordinary speech
or loud calling, in immediate proximity and at all distances; hence it is that we
are capable of estimating with considerable correctness the remoteness of an in-
dividual from the intensity with which his voice reaches us. Various circum-
stances, such, for instance, as a strong wind opposite in direction to the sound,
may, indeed, render our judgment uncertain ; yet in this case also we possess to a
certain degree experiences respecting the influence of such circumstances, which
serve at least for an approximately correct estimate of intervening distances.
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 13

We hove to have conveyed to the reader of the above sketch, in as intelligible
a form as possible, what is correctly known of the mechanism and action of our
organ of hearing, At least, let not the inquirer who turns away unsatisfied from
these pages impute it as a fault to the author that he has, so often and upon so
many important points, been obliged to accuse science of ignorance. It is, on
the whole, well for us whose lives are dedicated to such pursuits that science
still hides under a thick veil so many precious treasures to reward the assiduous
research and penetration of future explorers.

V.—THE SENSE OF SIGHT.

When his corporeal mechanism was giving way and refused further service to
the exalted genius of our greatest poet, its last effort in obedience to the parting
spirit was the ery: “Light! more light!’’ These words are ambiguous and
have been differently interpreted ; their sense, however, lies more on the surface
than that which has been often assigned to them. ‘There was here nothing
mystical; no solemn decoration thrown around the close of a glorious life. It
was the failing sight—the death of the most precious sense—which, pressing upon
the yet lingering consciousness, called forth the wish implied in the expressions
we have quoted. ‘To thousands and thousands of the ordinary dwellers upon
earth must the hour of death have brought the same mournful perception of
withdrawing sensibility, alike whether they were still able to express it in words,
or whether the organs of speech no longer obeyed the impulse, or the impulse
itself were wanting ; ; alike in whatever form, whatever words, the soul made
known its last impressions. The simple expression, so often heard, “It grows
dark before the eyes,’’ is in its origin and signification wholly identical with the
dying utterance of Goethe. !

A glance at the physiological conditions of the sense of sight renders the fre
quent positive perception of its extinction in the case of the dying fully con-
ceivable, while that of every other sense takes place for the most part without
any distinct recognition. No one remarks when the organs of taste and smell
resign their activity ; few, except under peculiar cireumstances, perceive when
the auditory nerve loses its susceptibility to the impressions of the waves of
sound which reach its extremities ; and quite as few are conscious when the skin
surrenders its function of recognizing warmth and pressure; but to most, perhaps
to all men, whose consciousness is not extinguished before the death of the senses,
the perception of a darkening of the organ of vision makes itself so urgently
felt as to arouse the already slumbering consciousness to one last, painful effort,
and communicates a reaction by the wonted paths to the organs of speech. But
whence the perogative of this one sense? The answer is “hot far to seck. No
sense is during our whole life so uninterruptedly active; on none is the attention
of the soul so constantly bent; the functions of no other sense supply so habit-
ually and variously the materials of thought and imagination. So long as we
are awake the eye conveys to the mind in unbroken succession images upon
which it acts, whether the other senses be simultaneously in activity or repose ;
even while concentrating, for example, with feverish solicitude, our attention on
the sensations of the ear, no impression of the sight escapes us, however evanes-
cent may be our consciousness of the perception. While we close our eyes in
order to think with less distraction—while we slumber and dream—the activity
of the sense of sight continues amidst our thoughts and dreams, the objective
perceptions which are wanting being supplied by subjective ones; nor do we
lose in dreaming the distinction between darkness and light. What other sense

can boast of being equally indispensable? Hours and even days may pass
without action on the part of the sense of taste or of smell, and without atten-
174 ON THE SENSES.

tion being paid to the absence of their sensations; and although we dream of
scents and of tastes, it is not with the same necessity and constancy with which
we dream of objects of sight. Even the auditory nerve may jong be at rest
without consciousness on our part of the stillness, if no sensational momentum
summons the attention to watchfulness ; nor is it at all different as regards the
sense of touch. Hence, because we ee accustomed to hold uninterrupted inter-
course with the outer world by means of the eye, and constantly to derive from
its perceptions the incentives to thought and action, the perception of a failure
of the visual power is unavoidable even to the parting consciousness; hence the
cry of the poet: “Light! more light!” as the eyes with which he had looked
through nature and the human heart were extinguished in death. The construe-
tion which I have put on the dying words of Goethe is, I think, clear and con-
sistent, and I have placed it at the head of this essay for the purpose of impress-
ing more deeply on the reader the inestimable value of the sense whose nature
and office it will be the aim of the following pages to explain.

There is no one probably who has not, at some time or other, propounded to
himself the question, which of the senses he would be most loath to dispense
with or to lose. The blind would answer, the sight; the deaf, the hearing; be-
cause each knows from experience, and is prone to overrate the disadvantages to
which the loss of either sense subjects him; but he who, being possessed of all
the senses, seriously asks of what avail is each to him, will unquestionably con-
cur in opinion with the blind. No one would in such case think for a moment
of the sense of smell, nor would the most pampered palate be suffered to prefer
its pretensions in behalf of that of taste; rather would we claim an exception
in favor of thesense of touch. But enough; the eye is pre-eminently the jewel
of the organsof sense! Let us seek to penetrate into its wonderful conformation.
To lay befere the novice an intelligible representation of the office, mechanism,
and action of the eye, is, it must be confessed, a peculiarly difficult task, more
difficult than a like undertaking with regard to the ear, for the reason, in part,
that the learning connected with the proposed discussion is necessari)y much
more comprehensive than that which regards the other organs. In order to
perform satisfactorily what we propose, it will be necessary to premise a careful
anatomical analysis of at least the most important parts of the complicated ap-
paratus of the globe of the eye, as well as the physical doctrine of the nature
of light; the laws of its propagation, refrangibility, reflection, &c.; the relations
of the separate parts of the eye to the light should be specially examined, and
finally the origin of the sensations of light and the modifications of vision are
to be considered ; the whole to be couched in terms and in a form intelligible to
the laity. We shall lose no time in a further detail of the difficulties or extent
of the undertaking, but it is proper to say that no exhaustive discussion of these
subjects is here contemplated; we shall be content to have explained to our
readers what is most essential, and to have imparted correct views of the most
important particulars.

The eye fully corresponds in its arrangements and its purpose to the so-called
camera obscura, an instrument which we may safely assume to be generally
known, especially in view of its customary employment in the service of photo-
graphy. This instrument is designed to throw a distinct image of an object
situated before it upon a surface placed in its background, whether this surface
be a pellucid plate of glass on which we see the image as if it were painted on
paper, or a sensitive sheet treated with collodion or iodized silver plate, as is
practiced by photographers and daguerreotypists. In this last case, the image
is fixed, by the chemical influence of the rays of light which produce the various
parts of the figure, on the sensitive substance with which the plate is charged ;
how this takes place, we need not here explain. Whoever has scen the image
of a landscape or. person on the glass plate of the camera obscura, will re-
member that it is distinguished by two circumstances from the object it repre-

t
THE SENSE OF SIGIIT. 175
sents: first, it is considerably smaller than the object; and secondly, it is in-
verted ; the houses in the landscape stand on their roofs, the persons on their
heads; whatever in the object is to the right, in the image is to the left, and
vice versa, For the production of this small inverted image, the glass lens
placed in the anterior opening is employed, serving for the transmission of the
rays proceeding from the object, but at the same time diverting them from their
course in such manner that the rays proceeding from each single point of the
object, which in front of the lens diverged from one another, converge behind
it, so that at a certain point on the plane of the smooth tablet they again unite.
This refraction of the rays of light by the glass lens will be rendered mcre
clearly intelligible through an explanation of the formation of the image in the
eye. This organ fully corresponds to such a camera obscura; under this aspect,
then, let us consider its arrangement and the signification of its separate parts
with the aid of the annexed figure, which represents a horizontal section of the

eye made directly through its centre. The eyeball is, in general, of globular
shape, the optic nerve O being inserted, like a handle, somewhat towards the
side of the nose. The outer wall of the globe is, with a partial exception,
formed of a hard opaque white tunic S, called the sclerotic, (the white of the
eye,) which answers to the wooden wall of the camera obscura, and serves as a
‘solid protective covering. On its inner side lies a second tunic or coat, the
choroid, which is extremely rich in blood-vessels, and is of a dark-brown or
chocolate color; it is composed of three layers, the inmost of which consists of
small cells, loaded with minute pigmentary granules, and so arranged with re-
gard to one another as to resemble a tesselated pavement. The design of this
dark coloring is the same with that of the black coat with which the inner wall
of the camera obscura, as well as of the telescope or microscope, is furnished,
namely: to prevent the dispersion of the rays of light and consequent disturb-
ance of the perceptions of sight, as will be hereafter explained.

On the front surface of the eyeball we see, as it were inserted into the
sclerotic, the transparent cornea H, arched in the manner of a watcli-crystal ;
this forms the foremost part of the wall of the eye, and is distinguished from
the rest of the integument by its transparency and greater curvature. Behind
the cornea, like the dial-plate behind the watch-crystal, lies a brown or blue or
gray-tinted membrane, the 277s R, with a circular opening in its middle, the
pupil P. The iris is, in effect, only the forward part of the choroid. 'The in-
terval between the hinder surface of the cornea and the front surface of the iris
is the “anterior chamber” of the eye, filled ‘with a fluid called the aqueous
humor. Behind the iris, and contiguous to its hinder surface, is the crystal-
line lens Kx, a lenticular highly transparent body, which turns its front and
less curved surface to the cornea, its hinder and more convex surface to
the background of the eye. The interval between this lens and the rear of the
eye is filled with a perfectly transparent, albuminous fluid, of the consistence
of thin jelly, called the vitreous body. These ecursorily described parts—the
cornea, the aqueous humor, the pupil, the crystalline lens, and the vitreous body

—form the different mediums through which are transmitted the rays of light

proceeding from external objects to the retzma. This last is a sensitive mem-

brane which lines the background of the eye, and upon it the rays, after under-

going refraction in their passage through the mediums just mentioned, again

. unite to form an image of the object from which they issued. ‘The convex

cornea and the crystalline lens together correspond to the glass lens in the front

opening of the camera obseura. ‘The iris represents a blind sr curtain which

intercepts all the rays which enter through the lateral parts of the cornea and

for certain reasons would disturb the formation of a distinct image, so that only

the rays transmitted through the central opening of the cornea—the pupil—are

permitted to penetrate to the background of the eye. The pupil, an incon-

Spicuous opening, often scarcely a line in width, is the window through which .
we observe the world, or, rather, through which the world penetrates to us, since,

through this aperture, everything emitting light, from the inconceivably remote

t) the nearest and most minute, if it falls within the sphere of vision, throws a
part, if but a small part of its rays on the delicate organ whose ofiice it is to

convert them into perceptions of light and color and of the local relations of
visible things. Hapless is he for whom this small window is closed, for whom

the transparent lens is clouded; he is indeed despoiled of his most precious

heritage.

The retina, an extremely delicate, almost transparent membrane, which, as
the figure shows, is concentrically outspread upon the inner surface of the cho-
roid nearly as far as the edge of the lens, and which thus lines the cavity filled
with the vitreous body, is nothing else than the flattened extension of the end
of the optic nerve; but of how wonderfully compounded a structure, of how ad-
mirable a distribution and stratified arrangement of the separate and delicate .
elements. It is impossible, in a rapid sketch, to convey to the novice a com-
plete idea of the mechanism of the retina; we shall give, therefore,.but a few
outlines. The optic nerve O penetrates, with its vast number of closely com-
pressed filaments, the outer intezuments of the eye at the point of entrance, and
advances to the cavity of the vitreous body ; having reached this, its collective
fibres bend around on all sides at right angles, and spread themselves in all di-
rections into a beautiful network of fasciculi or bundles disposed in the plane of
the retina, and reaching as far as the anterior margin of that membrane. Hvery-
where in this course single fibres bend around from this innermost layer of th;
retina to the external layers, and terminate on the outer surface of the retina in
rod-like and flask-shaped or conical organizations, which, as the proper terminal
apparatus of the optic nerve, enable, as will hereafter be seen, the waves of light
to take effect on its fibres. The external layer of the retina consists of a del-
icate mosaic of these rods and cones, which are all disposed perpendicularly to
the surface; it represents, therefore, a mosaic of the extremities of the optic
‘nerve, of which extremities those situated in the part of the retina directly op-
posite to the pupil are most closely aggregated with one another; those, on the
contrary, situated laterally to the former, stand so much the more widely apart
the nearer their position to the anterior margin of the retina, a fact which we
shall make use of further on. The retina thus constituted corresponds, as is
apparent from the foregoing, to the smooth tablet or photographic collodion
plate in the camera obscura.

To examine the texture of the rest of the organizations of the eye would
lead us too far; one point, however, must not be passed without notice. Every
one has probably observed, or can at any moment satisfy himself, that the
pupil, which appears as a round black spot in the middle of the eye, is some-
times wider, sometimes narrower, according as the sight is exerted in obscurity
or in light. The iris owes this power of changing the diameter of the pupil to
certain muscular fibres, microscopically fine, which, at the excitation of the
nerves leading to them, become shorter in their longitudinal diameter, and are
THE SENSE OF SIGHT iw

capable of being thus contracted to one-sixth of their original length. These
fibres, similar in their nature to those of which all muscular flesh consists, per-
tain, in the iris, to two systems having two different directions. The one system
consists of fibres which surround the pupil in circular lines concentric to its
margin ; the other of fibres perpendicular to the former, which radiate from the
raargin of the iris to the margin of the pupil. In consequence of this arrange-
nent the operation of the two systems is necessarily as follows: If the margixal
or circular fibres contract, the circle formed by them becomes smaller, and con-
sequently the pupil, whose margin is bordered by these circles, narrower; if
“t.» vadial fibres contract, they draw the margin of the pupil outwards on every
side, and therefore widen the pupil. Now it is clear that the narrower the pupil
the tewer will be the rays of light which can penetrate within the eye to the
retina. ‘The use of a change in the diameter of the pupilis this: if a great deal
of light is thrown by very bright objects upon the eye, a part thereof is cut off
by the narrowing of the pupil, in order that the sensitive retina may not be un-
duly excited and dazzled ; if we look, on the other hand, at obscure objects, the
-pupil is widened in order to admit as many rays as possible into the eye, to
communicate the strongest excitation to the retina and produce the mst vivid
sensation possible. It is a circumstance of the greatest interest that this regu-
lation of the intensity of the light arises not through an act of the will, but with
invariable certainty and proportionality through a reflex mechanism. It is the
light itself which sets the mechanism in motion with a force corresponding to its
own strength; the impression produced by the light on the retina and propa-
gated by the optic nerve to the brain calls forth there an activity which, in a
reflex manner, is communicated to the muscles of the iris.

Having thus given a general idea of the structure of the eye, we proceed to
explain the formation of a small inverted image of the external object on the
retina. In the above figure a 4 represents an arrow placed before the eye,
which arrow we will imagine to be composed of a number of single luminous
points arranged one after the other. Such a luminous point is @ at one end and
6 at the other end of the arrow. Every such point emits rays of light in all
directions, so that the space pervaded by these rays represents a globular sphere,
of which the luminous point is the centre. If the eye be within this sphere, a
small segment of it, that is to say, a small pencil of rays, penetrates into the
eye, namely, those rays which fall within the circle of the pupil, while the rest
are intercepted by the opaque parts of the eye. In the figure the diverging,
dotted lines proceeding from a, and those formed of small strokes proceeding
from 4, show the limits of the pencil of rays (in transverse section) which are
capable of entering through the pupil into the eye. Now, we have already men-
tioned that the crystalline lens and cornea together refract the incident rays
from their course in such a manner that they cause the rays which, in front of
them, were divergent, to approach one another in their rear, so as to unite again
at a point situated behind the lens. How and by what laws this refraction takes
place we cannot stop to explain. For simplification let it be supposed that the
refraction of the rays is only produced by the lens; the figure will then show
the rays proceeding from @ as united behind the lens at a’, and those proceeding
from 6 at 6’; a’ is therefore the image of the point a, as 0’ is of b. Between a
and 0/ lie the images of all the luminous points of the object between a and ;
a’ b' then is the image of a b. 'he figure shows further, first, that the
image is smaller than the object; and secondly, that it is inverted. In the ex-
ternal arrow, a lies to the left, the corresponding image a’ to the right; 4 lies to
the right, 4’ to the left; the relative: position of all the intermediate points be-
tween a’ and 0’ will therefore be the same. In this way there is formed on the
background of the eye a gmall inverted image of every external object from
which rays pass into that organ, asa similar image is traced on the blank tablet
of the camera obscura. The experimental verification of these facts is not dit:

ficult. If the eye of some animal be extracted, and both tunics, the sclerotic
and choroid, be carefully detached from its posterior hemisphere so that the
retina may be seen, the delicate image of any bright object presented to the eye
may readily be observed on that membrane. An ingenious method has, more-
over, been devised, by means ot which we are enabled to see in the living eye
the image of a candle-flame, for instance, thrown upon the retina. The in-
strument by which this is effected has been called “the eye-mirror,” ( Augen-
spiegel) ; to discuss its principle would detain us too long, but its operation is
briefly this: the rays of light thrown back from the retina of the observed eye
and returning in the same route by which they entered, again unite in the lu-
minous point from which they proceeded, whence they are reflected, by the
mirror, on the eye of the observer. :

If we observe on the glass tablet of the camera obscura the images of objects
situated at different distances from it, we perceive that only the objects which
lie at some definite distance throw upon the tablet sharp and distinct images,
while the images of objects either nearer or more remote have a confused and
faded appearance. If we change the distance between the glass tablet and the
lens, or, in other words, shove the lens forwards and backwards, the objects
which were at first distinct will become obscure, while the nearer or more remote
objects become alternately distinct. In a word, only the images of objects lying
at a determinate distance from the lens can be at any one time distinct and well
defined; hence the photographer, in order to obtain an exact likeness of a per-
‘son in front of the camera, must bring the glass tablet or the sensitive collodion
plate, introduced in its stead, accurately into the plane on which falls a sharp
image of the object. This proceeding is grounded on the following physical
facts : If we imagine a luminous point situated at some given distance before a
transparent lens, such as is used in the camera obscura, the rays proceeding
from that point and striking the lens ‘unite behind the latter at a definite dis-
tance; now, if we bring the objective point nearer to the lens, the poiut of union
of its rays will be changed, and, consequently, the position of its image, which
will be thrown further back beyond the lens; if, on the contrary, we remove
the objective point to a greater distance from the lens, the position of its image
will be moved forward and nearer to the lens; if this objective point lies at an
immense distance from the lens, like the sun, the position of its image falls upon
what is called the focus or burning point of the lens; if the objective point, on
the other hand, be placed in the anterior focus of the lens, the position of its
image will lie at an infinite distance behind the leas—that is to say, beyond the lens
the rays proceed in a parallel direction. Let us suppose now three objective points,
abc, placed simultaneously before the lens L at definite distances in a right line one
after another ; then the corresponding positions of their images a! 0’ ¢’ will also lie
behind the lens in aright line one after the other, but by no means at a distance from
one another corresponding with that of the objective points; the latter, for instance,
may be respectively ten, twenty, and thirty feet distant from the lens, the former
perhaps only some lines apart. If we suppose that the blank tablet G which in-
tercepts the image occupies the place at which the image of the middle object

6’ is formed this image will be distinctly defined, while the images of the nearer

THE SENSE OF SIGHT 179

and more remote objective points will appear faded and indistinct, for the
glass tablet is struck by the rays of the nearer object ¢ before their union at the
point c’ by the rays of the more distant object a, after their union at the point
a’, and consequently in both cases by rays diverging from one another. If we
move the tablet forward to a’ the images of 6 and ¢ fall within so-called circles of
dispersion, since the rays from both unite at a point behind the tablet. What
is here said of a single objective point holds good likewise for larger objects,
which are to be considered as composed of a great number of points ly.iug near
one another. Wholly conformable to this is the process in the eye: the images
of several objects at different distances, simultaneously projected on the retina
by the cornea and crystalline lens, fall also behind one another, so that only one
of them can be in the plane of the retina, while the others fall either before or
behind it, and thus present only the dim images of the dispersion circles. A
simple experiment shows this: if we close the left eye and hold before the right
at a certain distance a finger so that this finger shall be in a line with a remoter
object lying behind it, the window for instance of an opposite house, and then
fixedly regard now the finger and now the distant window, it will result that
whenever we thus regard the finger the window will appear indistinctly, with
dim outlines, and the finger indistinctly when we fix our attention on the win-
dow. Still more evident is the following experiment : Pierce with a needle two
small openings in a card near one another, hold the openings as closely as pos-
sible before the pupil of one eye, while the other eye is closed, and observe
through the openings alternately one and the other of two pins set up in front
of the eye at some distance from one another; the more distant pin will now
appear indistinct and double when the nearer one is attentively regarded, and
vice versa; the pin to which the sight is directed appearing always well defined
and single. The double image of the indistinct pin arises simply from this, that
two separate pencils of rays proceed from it through the two apertures of the
card into the eye and strike the retina, which is occupied with the pin to which
attention is directed, either before their union at a single point or after it in two
separate places. The eye-mirror shows in the most direct manner the different
distinctness of the images formed on the retina by objects at different distances.
From the foregoing experiments we learn, first, that two objects at different
distances cannot be seen distinctly at the same time, and secondly, that we have
the power to see at will either the nearer or more remote object with distinctness ;
in other words, that we have the power to adjust our eye to different distances,
so that distinct images of objects unequally remote may fall just on the plane
of the retina. This power has received the name of the faculty of ocular ac-
commodation, and the alteration in question, which we execute for the adjust-
ment of the eye to different distances, is termed accommodation or adaption.
This faculty of accommodation is not unlimited; no eye is capable of being
adjusted to all possible distances from the most immediaie proximity to infinite
remoteness ; objects which are too near appear indistinct to all eyes in spite of
every effort of accommodation, as do objects removed beyond a certain distance
to most eyes; in other words, the images of objects which are too near fall, in
the case of every eye, behind the plane of the retina, the images of objects too
remote are formed in front of the retina. ‘The limits within which accommoda-
tion is possible are very different in different persons; and in the same person
may in the course of time be impaired or lost. Short-sighted persons are those
to whose eyes objects may be brought very close without becoming indistinct,
while remote objects are obscure; far-sighted persons, on the other hand, are
those who see clearly very distant objects, and to whom near ones become dim
at a relatively considerable distance. Between the normal eye and the object
about eight inches may intervene without indistinctness of visions the near
sighted see clearly at four inches and even less. Constant occupation with ob-
jects which require close inspection produces shortness of sight; the contrary
180 ON THE SENSES

effect results from habitual occupation with remote objects; hence we find stu-
dents, engravers, &c, almost always short-sighted; huntsmen, on the other
hand, far-sighted; in old age usually every eye loses more or less its capacity
of seeing objects which are close at hand. We will now consider in what ac-
commodation consists, and the mechanism by which it is. produced.

We have seen in the camera obscura two means of adjustment working to the
same end, the forward and backward movement of either the glass lens or the
black glass tablet. For the employment of these means in the eye it is neces-
sary either that the screen of the retina which intercepts the image should be
movable in the direction of the crystalline lens, or that the lens should be capa-
ble of movement forwards and backwards as regards the retina; forwards in the
case of near-sight, that the image which would otherwise fall too far behind the
retina might be brought forward to the plane of the latter; backwards in the
case of far-sight, that the image now formed in front of the retina might be
thrown back upon its plane. In the eye the displacement of the retina aloneis.
impossible; it cannot leave the choroid which lies behind it, nor can an appara-
tus for such a purpose be easily imagined. Mediately, indeed, through a change
of form of the whole globe of the eye, the distance of the posterior layer of the
retina, which more directly serves for distinct vision, might be changed as regards
the lens—that is to say, might be increased by such a lateral compression of the
eye that its diameter from before backwards would be augmented at the expense
of the transverse diameter, or be diminished by a contraction acting from front
to rear. ‘This somewhat rude mechanism of accommodation had, in fact, many
advocates in earlier times, who asserted that the compression in question was
effected through the small muscles which surround the eye and execute the
movements of the ball. This view, nevertheless, must be regarded as wholly
untenable, and was indeed contradicted by many insurmountable objections even
before the true mechanism of accommodation had been discovered. ‘The second
of the above-named means, the movement of the crystalline lens, was accepted
by others, though no direct proof of it could be adduced nor an answer given
to the question how the fluids before and behind the lens could yield to the dis-
placement—without a possibility, in short, of pointing out any mechanism by which
this displacement could be accomplished. At present we know with certainty
that in the act of accommodation the lens does not change its place. It follows,
therefore, that the adjustment of the eye must take place in a different manner
from that of the camera obseura. And in fact a third means remains through
which the shifting of the image delineated by a lens may be brought about, a
means not indeed applicable to our artificial inflexible glass lenses, but capable’
of adaptation to the elastic and organized lens of the eye. This means is a
change in the form of the lens. The physical facts on which this kind of ac-
commodation rests are briefly the following: a lens refracts rays of light move
strongly the greater the curvature of its surfaces; if we have therefore a
slightly curved and a greatly curved lens formed of the same glass, and an ob-
ject at a definite and constant distance, the first lens refracts the rays proceed-
ing from this object less than the last lens; the consequence is that the more
strongly refracted rays unite sooner than the rays more weakly refracted; hence
the point of union, that is, the image of the object, lies in the case of the strongly
curved lens nearer behind it than in the case of the weakly curved lens. ‘'hus,
if we conceive an object so near the eye that its image with a given distance be-
tween the crystalline lens and retina falls behind the plane of the latter, this
image will be made to move forward so soon as the surfaces of the lens assume
a greater curvature, since the convergence of the rays proceeding from the lens
iuto the vitreous body will be greater. Now this actually takes place in the eye.
‘Che eye at rest is adjusted to objects at a certain distance—that is to say, main-
tains habitually such a curvature that the images of objects at some degree of
remoteness fall upon the retina; would we observe objects more closely, the
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 181

crystalline lens assumes a greater curvature, a curvature so much the stronger in
proportion as the object is nearer, the magnitude of the curvature being in every
case such as to brivg the image which falls too far behind the retina just into
the plane of that membrane. The correctness of this statement is ingeniously
shown by means which we must be content very briefly to indicate. ‘The sur-
faces of the transparent structures of the eye, the cornea as well as the lens, do
not permit the passage of all the light which falls upon them; a part of it is
thrown back or reflected; hence if a luminous object is before them, they forma
reflex image of it, an image which, from physical laws not necessary to be here
dwelt upon, is an exceedingly small one. Further, this little image traced on
the outer convex surfaces of the cornea and lens stands upright like the object,
and seems to lie behind the reflecting surface, while that of the concave surface
behind the lens is inverted and occupies a position before it. The little image
of the cornea is easily perceived; the lustrous appearance of the eye consists
indeed in the light thus reflected. If we hold a candle flame near our head and
observe the eye of another person, we shall readily perceive on its cornea the
small sharply defined image of the flame. The images cf both surfaces of the
lens are seen with more difficulty because they are fainter and are also somewhat
eclipsed by the brighter image of the cornea; besides that only a small portion
of the reflecting surface is accessible to view through the pupil. Now, it is well
known that the reflex image of a curved surface changes in magnitude and position
according as the form of the surface is changed, as its curvature is either increased
or diminished. On this fact rests the experimental proof of the change of form of
the crystalline lens in the act of looking at near and at distant objects. By means
of a peculiar telescope adapted to the most exact measurement, the change in
position and size of the reflex image traced on the front surface of the lens may
be accurately ascertained if the observed eye be alternately fixed on a far and
near object at a measured distance without any change of its own position; from
these measurements again has been calculated the magnitude of the variation of
curvature which the surface in question undergoes in the action of accommoda-
tion. That the front surface of the lens becomes more strongly curved when
viewing a near object, may be seen even without an instrument, if the eye be
observed in profile; the pupil will then be seen to project further beyond the
edge of the cornea; it must be understood, however, that the eye which is ob-
served shall not in the least change its place in transferring its contemplation
from the remote to the near object.

After having so far considered the eye as an optical instrument, a camera ob-
scura, explained the origin of small inverted images of outward objects on its
retina, and shown the means by which well defined images of objects at all dis-
tances are brought into the plane of this sensitive membrane, let us turn our
attention to the proper physiological part of the problem, the explanation of sight
itself. ‘The existence of the image on the retina is not vision; the soul sits not
in the retina, nor receives into itself this image as such without further elabora-
‘tion; there is no second interior eye through which it observes the small pictures
of the retina, as with our visual organ we observe the images of the camera obscura.
Between the image and the perception of it there still lies a whole series of pro-
cesses through which the image operates indirectly on the sensorium, so as to ex-
cite sensations of light and color and lead t= a recognition of the local relations
of external objects. The rays of light, united for the formation of the image, act
first on certain apparatus of the retina; this apparatus acts in turn on the fibres
of the optic nerve, in which are thus set in motion the mysterious couriers known
as ‘‘ nervous currents ;”’ these currents flow to the brain, and take effect there on
other apparatus, which stands in the more immediate service of the soul, and
from whose activity the latter derives sensations and ideas. If we would explain
this succession of incidents, we must begin with the first member of the series.
What, then, is light? What is a ray of light which, through air or glass, pro-
182 ON THE SENSES.

ceeds from a distant object to the eye, and is propagated through the cornea, lens,
and vitreous body to the retina? It is difficult usually for the laity, without
some general previous instruction in physics, to acquire a correct idea of the
nature of light, to disengage themselves from the deeply rooted but false notions
which from childhood onwards are intimately interwoven with the idea of the
luminous element. The sole property of light recognized by the uninformed,
as manifested by different colors, is no property at all of light, but, as we
bave explained in an earlier part of these articles,is a property of the sensation
which light awakens, and which has nothing in common with the external exciting
cause Without the optic nerve light is still present, but it excites no sensation,
imparts no color; this paradox I hope i in the following paragraph to unriddle.
Light is a movement, the movement, proceeding from its point of excitation, of
an ever present and all pervading ether, as it is called, which we must imagine to
be composed of countless, infinitely small, inert particles. ‘These particles are
thrown into vibrations, which are propagated in the form of waves from par-
ticle to particle ; such is the nature of light. Luminous bodies, like the sun, con-
stantly set the surrounding particles of the ether in motion, and these propagate -
their motions from one te another cn every side. Everywhere these ethereal
undulations impinge upon matter; through a part of this matter, which we term
transparent, they pass with more or less obstruction, the motion being transmitted
to the varticles of the ether contained in such bodies ; through another part of
matter, untransparent or opaque bodies, they are unable to penetrate, and are
either absorbed or reflected as are the waves of sound from solid bodies, being
thrown back in the latter case like the waves of the sea from its shores. If the
ethereal waves pass from thinner into denser matter, for instance from the air into
glass or water, or inversely from a denser into a thinner medium, they pursue
their course undisturbed when they strike perpendicularly the surface of the
second medium, but, on the other hand, are diverted or refracted from their first
direction when they strike that surface at an oblique angle, and in a greater or
less degree according to the difference of density of the two mediums. A further
discussion of these principles of physics respecting the nature of light is here
impossible ; of one of the most interesting facets in this connection, the different
kinds, namely, of undulatory movement ne the luminous ether dependent on the
velocity of the waves, we shall have occasion hereafter to speak more at large.
It is these undulations, then, of an inert, matter-penetrating ether, which,
proceeding from luminous bodies to our eye, throw the particles of the ether
already there iuto vibration, and are thus finally propagated to the retina. ‘To
transform these vibrations into a sensation of light, no apparatus less com-
plicated is requisite than to convert an electrical current into a telegraphic de-
spatch, which has as little in common with the generating current as the sensa-
tion of light with the exciting undulations. The sensation to which alone light
and color pertain as properties is a wholly specific effect of these waves, which
they can only produce by help of the apparatus of the retina and optic nerve,
and of certain parts of the brain; if they strike upon wood or metal, the latter
become simply expanded, and this expansion bears as much relation to a sensa-
tion of light as a telegraphic despatch to an explosion of powder, both of which
may be produced by the electric current. Hence we must further inquire, what
becomes of the ethereal undulations in the retina; how do they operate upon the
elements of that membrane and the fibres of the optic nerve which’ proceed from
it, in order finally to be converted into a sensation of light? Unfortunately very
little is known of the chain of processes in question; respecting some links of
it we have obscure intimations; respecting others not even so much. In the
first place it is certain that the wave is not propagated as such in the optic nerve
to the brain, but that in the retina it is converted into that movement of the
contents of the nerve molecules which, in our introduction, we designated as a
nervous current, and therefore into a movement of a wholly different nature; as
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 183

different, indeed, as is the electric movement which we excite by friction from
the friction itself. How this conversion in the retina is brought about we know
not; we can only suppose as a possibility that the waves of the ether produce,
in a part of the structure of the retina, a chemical decomposition, and that
through this chemical decomposition a chemical irritant is generated which ex-
cites the current in the nerve-fibres. For this conjecture nothing further can be
alleged than that the undulations of light are well known to produce chemical
decompositions, of which the blackening of the silver combination in the sensi-
tive collodion plate of the photographer is an obvious example, and that certain
chem‘cal agents are capable of exciting all the nerves. Or it might be con-
ceived that in some way, perhaps, electricity is excited in the retina by means
of the undulations, and that this serves as an irritant for the nerves, for which
that agent is in general the most potent of stimulants. That electricity excites
the optic nerve is a well known fact; if we pass an electric discharge through
the eye, a bright flash is instantly perceived. Finally, it might even be sup-
posed that the ether-waves produced an‘expansion of some structure, and that
this mechanically excited the nerves through the consequent pressure. In short,
many instrumentalities are conceivable, but none is previously susceptible of
proof, nor can one perhaps be considered more probable than another. Only
one important discovery has the present age, with all its acknowledged progress,
disclosed to us; we know the place of the retina in which the conversion in
question is effected; we know the apparatus which is charged with effecting
this conversion. It is not the fibres of the optic nerve running on the inner
side of the retina, parallel to its surface, which are directly excited by the un-
dulations, though it is upon these that the undulations first strike, before they
advance to other elementary portions of the membrane; on the contrary, we
know with entire certainty that the waves pass, without resulting effect, not
only by these fibres of the optic nerve, but by the layers of the retina lying
vext behind them, until they have reached the external or hindermost layer
bordering immediately on the choroid; their specific effect is therefore first ex-
erted on the so-called columnar layer with its rod-like and cone-shaped organ-
izations. Here the conversion takes place; the rods and cones are the apparatus
on which the ether-waves in some manner operate; which apparatus next
operates by some unknown agency on the nerve-fibres which bend round so as
tc advance to this deepest layer. It is impossible to render generally intelligible
tle demonstration of this statement, interesting as it is in the highest degree ;
we must confine ourselves to a few cursory indications. That the fibres of the
optic nerve in the internal layer of the retina are not directly excited by the
vibrations of the ethereal particles, follows necessarily from these among other
fects—that, first, those spaces of the membrane where only nerve-fibres are
found, namely, at the entrance of the optic nerve, are incapable of vision, to
which fact we shall recur in the sequel; and, in the second place, that at that
point of the retina with which we see most distinctly, the space just opposite
to the pupil, no nerve-fibres exist; from the impossibility, moreover, of recon-
cling the local perceptions of the organ, hereafter to be spoken of, with the
yToposition that light directly excites the fibres of the optic nerve. While by
these and other considerations it is placed beyond doubt, that light can as little
generate a nervous current in.the fibres of the optic nerve as in any other nerve-
" fibre, there has been direct proof adduced that it is precisely the rods and cones
before mentioned on which the light operates, that it is through these organiza-
tions that the excitation is effected. If, in an obscure apartment, we look tixedly
before us, while we move laterally in a circle before the eyes a burning candle,
we shall perceive after some time that our field of vision becomes faintly ilu-
minated, and ia this bright field a dark arborescently ramified figure makes its
appearance. ‘The same phenomenon occurs if we move to and fro, against the
bright sky and close before the pupil of the eye, a card pierced with a small

aperture. This dark ramified figure is nothing else than the net-work of blood-
vessels within the retina of our own eye; hence it has been called the ‘choroid
figure.” However incredible it may seem to the laity, that we should thus per-
ceive with the eye objects lying on the background of the eye itself, the fact is
not the less true nor the less capable of explanation. It is the shadows of the
blood-vessels traversing the retina which we see by means of the retina. Why
they should seem to be outside of the eye—transferred, that is to say, to ex-
ternal space, like every image of the retina which excites the brain—we. shall
hereafter see. If we employ the second method for the production of the phe-.
nomenon, the explanation will be as follows: the narrow opening of the card
presents before the eye a luminous point which sends out rays on every side,
and hence a bread pencil of rays through the pupil into the eye. These rays,
on account of the close proximity to the eye, are so strongly divergent that
both cornea and lens cannot render them convergent by refracting them; they
arrive, therefore, still divergent at the retina, and illuminate it to a considerable
extent, exciting, wherever they strike, tlie sensitive apparatus; hence the bright
field of vision. Now appear, as stated, the blood-vessels of the retina like dark
shadows on a bright ground, a proof that the sensitive layer of the membrane,
on which the light takes effect, must lie behind the blood-vessels, since other-
wise, these shadows could not be perceived. The vessels themselves run in the
layers lying next behind the nervous or internal layer; consequently, the
elements of the retina which enable us to perceive the light and also the shadows
as an absence of light, must lie still further back. From the degree of displace-
ment which the shadows of: the vessels undergo through a shifting of the ex-
ternal source of light, it has been found possible accurately to calculate how far
the layer in question must lie behind the vessels, and the distance has in effect
been exactly computed which exists between the vessels whose shadows we see
aud the external or columnar layer of the retina. This is an ingenious and
striking proof, which we owe to the same distinguished inquirer who first accu-
rately taught us the structure of the retina, together with the nature and con-
nection of its elements distributed to different layers.

1f we now proceed a step further in bridging over the chasm between the lu-
minous wave and the sensation of light, we come to the intermediate member
which has been spoken of in our previous discussions respecting each of the
other senses—the current, namely, in the excited nerve-fibre, which, having
been indirectly set in motion by the wave through the co-operation of the rods
and cones in the columnar layer of the retina, flows through the fibrous extrem-
ities of the optic nerve in the retina and its remoter channel in the stem of th
nerve, to the brain. We have so often inferred from the nature of this move-
ment in the nerve its probable identity in all the nerves; have in so many ways
pointed out that this movement in the nerve has nothing at all in common with
the external irritant which occasions it—a fact which, of course, holds good
with regard to the current of the optic nerve and the undulatory movement of
the luminous ether—that we shall spare our readers any unnecessary repetition,
We may also abstain from anything more than a simple allusion to the wholly
unsolved problem of the further destiny of this current, on its arrival at the
brain, in the interior apparatus of the excited nerve. We know only that the
current of the optic nerve takes effect on this extreme cerebral apparatus, con-
sisting of the bulbous bodies heretofore described, in a peculiar manner, induc-|
ing therein some modification which gives rise in the mind to a sensation of
light, just as the corresponding modification in the terminal bulbs of the auditory
nerve produces a sensation of sound. Whether any solution of these seemingly
impenetrable mysteries is reserved for human ingenuity can only be known to
future times.

3etore proceeding to treat of this simple sensation of light in its connection
with objective ideas, we must consider the different qualities of the sensation.
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 185

These qualities are the different sensations of color. We distinguish white, red,
blue, green, yellow light; we speak of white, red, and other colors of the ob-
jects which we see—that is to say, we confer the special property of the sensa-
tion which we call color on the external object by which it is generated—with
the same incorrectness with which we attribute the properties of light in general
to external objects. Now, what this blue or green, this red or yellow color is,
can no one say; we can as little describe the qualities of a sensation of light, as
the qualities of any impression received through the other senses; and how im-
possible this is has been sufficiently shown in previous essays. Meanwhile the
true image of every sensation of color is indelibly fixed in all memories, so that
at any moment we can recall the idea of each several quality, or assign its ap-
propriate color to every object which presents itself; but no one can specify
any distinctive sign pertaining to the sensation itself, whether of blue or green ;
no one knows whether his own perception of blue accords with that of another
individual. In common life it is customary to speak of a black color, and even
in science it is sometimes doubted whether black should not be called a color;
that is to say, a.sensation. In my opinion there is no room for such a doubt. °
Black is nothing but the absence of a perception of light. We call those ob-
jects black from which no light proceeds to our eye; we perceive thein as gaps
in the illuminated field of vision, being conscious, by virtue of the sense of space
resident in the retina, of the particles of that membrane which remain in repose
and unexcited, between those particles which are struck and irritated by the
light. If we exclude all external light from our eyes, the whole field of vision
appears black; we are conscious of the repose of all the particles of the retina.
But to enter more particularly into the details of this controversy, whether
black be a sensation or not, would lead us into too long a digression.

If we turn our consideration to the external causes of the different sensations
of color, so indescribable and inexplicable in themselves, we are met by an en-
tirely conclusive and exact physical theory. The different sensations of color
stand in relation to their causes in the same category with the sensations of
sound of a different pitch; it is the frequency of the vibrations of the partic'es of
the luminous ether, the length of its waves, by which the quality of the sensa-
tion is determined; to each definite color belongs a definite, exactly measured
length of wave and frequency of vibration, as to every sound of definite pitch be-
longs a definite number of vibrations of the body which generates it. Physics

‘has demonstrated that the white light of the sun—that is, the vibrations of the
ether proceeding from the sun which taking effect on the retina produce the
sensation of a white color—is no uncompounded light, but consists of a great
number of the ethereal vibrations differing in the degrees of their frequency ; it
has further taught us to decompose this compound light into its several constit-
uent parts. If a sunbeam be received through the edge of a three-sided prism
of glass, while this edge, for example, is held before a small round opening in
an opaque screen upon which the sun shines, there will appear on a surtace
situated behind the screen not a round white spot corresponding to the opening,
but a long bright stripe in which the different colors of the rainbow follow one
another in the same order as in the rainbow. One end of this str'pe will be
occupied by a red portion, followed by an orange, a yellow, a green, a blue, an
indigo and a violet colored portion in succession, the latter occupying the other
end of the stripe. The origin of this prismatic stripe consists in this: that
the waves of different vibratory velocities compounded together in the white
light of the sun, on their way through the edge of the prism, are diverted, each
in a different degree, from their course, so that those waves in which the ethe-
real particles vibrate most swiftly are most diverted or refracted ; those whose
particles vibrate most slowly are least refracted; if we imagine, for example,
the white solar ray striking horizontally on the prism, all the waves combined
therein will, when the edge of the prism is directed upwards, be so refracted as
186 ON THE SENSES

to pass obliquely downwards to the other side, but the slowest with least, the
swiftest with most obliquity. It results that the undulations differing in their
velocity strike, one after another, on the intercepting screen. The different
colors of different portions of the stripe proceeds from this: that the waves
reflected from the screen to our eye operate differently on the nervous apparatus
of the organ according to the velocity of their vibrations, so that each generates
for itself a definite modification of the nervous current, and every such modifi-
cation a definite quality of sensation; that is, of color. The longest waves
with the least vibratory velocity, which reach the eye from the upper end of the
stripe, and which hence, in the image on the retina, form, through the inversion
of the image, the lower end of the stripe, so operate on the nerve-exciting appa-
ratus that the sensation of a red color is the result ; the shortest and swiftest
waves from the other end of the stripe (which stripe is called the solar spec-
trum) produce in the same way the sensation of a violet color; the waves of
intermediate length and velocity give rise in succession to the above-named in-
termediate sensations of color. And the same is the cise not merely with the
waves directly disengaged from the sun’s light, but with those issuing from
every visible object. An object appears red when the waves proceeding from
it are so constituted that each particle of the ether lying in its course executes
only 439 billions of vibrations in a second of time, while each wave is the
seventy-thousandth part of a millimetre in length; if the wave be only the
sixty-thousandth part of a millimetre long, while, on the other hand, its parti-
cles vibrate 697 billion times in a second, the object from which it pro-
ceeds will appear of a violet color. The observed object is hence neither red
nor violet; it only throws the particles of the ether lying between itself and
our eye into vibrations of definite velocity, according to which they excite in
our mind, through the medium of the retina and optic nerve, the sensation of
red or violet. In like manner we erroneously seek the sound we hear in the
vibrating string, while the string simply vibrates; the sound first exists in our
sensation, occasioned by the waves of a definite frequency of vibration proceed-
ing from the string. It is, in fact, the general error as regards all perceptions
of the senses that we ascribe the quality of the sensation to the exciting exter-
nal cause; a necessary error, however, through which our sensations become
first available for the practical uses of life, as we have repeatedly shown on
previous occasions. ‘To return to our theme: Each solar ray, which the prism
decomposed into seven undulatory elements distinguishable by their color, com-
prises other waves besides the colored ones. In the white solar light there are
ether waves of yet slower vibration than those which produce the sensation of
red, and such as are of yet greater vibratory velocity than those which yield a
violet color. In the spectrum, therefore, formed by the prism, there are waves
(the longest) which strike beyond the red extremity, as well as others (the
most frequent) which strike beyond the violet extremity ; but these we do not
see, although constituted precisely like the rays of color, except as regards the
difference of length. In other words, only those waves of the ether, the
number of whose vibrations falls within certain limits, (434-697 billions,)
are capable of so affecting the apparatus of the retina as to produce exci-
tation of its nerves, and therefore a sensation; while, on the other hand,
as well those whose number of vibrations is too small as those whose number
is too great, are not qualified to excite a sensation. Again a complete analogy
with the nerves of hearing! If the vibrations of a string are calculated to ex-
cite the auditory nerves so as to produce sound, there are equally limits to the
number of vibrations which must not be transcended; the string must not os-
cillate from side to side less than sixteen times, nor more than 64,000 times in
a second. If it vibrate less often or more frequently, it sounds no longer. But
how, will the reader ask, can it be known that beyond the visible there are
present invisible waves of light? How can light be recognized which is not
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 187
r

seen? For this there are several excellent means which we will bricfly notice.
In the first place, all ether waves have the power of giving warmti—that is to
say, of exciving, when they strike the nerves of touch, the sensation of warmth—
of causing matter to expand; in short, of producing all the effeets attributable
to heat. In other words, heat and light are the same, both consisting in the
vibrations of that elastic medium known as the luminous ether. The power of
warming is not, however, proper to all vibrations of the ether in an equal de-
gree; the vibrations which are too slow to excite the nerves of vision, and
which hence, in the spectrum, fall outside of or beyond the red, possess that
power in a high degree; we recognize them by their action upon the apparatus
for measuring heat. In the second place, the rays of light have the power of
pruducing, by their action on certain substances, chemical decomposition; for
instance, of rendering black certain combinations of silver. This chemical
effect pertains in the highest degree to the most rapid vibrations of the ether,
and therefore to those invisible vibrations which fall beyond the violet; we
recognize their presence by their chemical effect. They are te be recognized,
however, in other ways, being capable, for instance, of becoming visible, with a
blue color, when, by certain means which we possess, but which we cannot stop
to explain, their vibrations are rendered slower. Under favorable circumstances,
indeed, when enabled to operate with great intensity on the eye, they become,
even without abatement of frequency, directly visible; that is to say, when they
take effect very strongly on the optic nerve they are capable of exciting it.
Such, briefly, is the physical theory of the origin of sensations of color.
With this are further connected some important physiological considerations.
We have proved at large that light and color exist not externally, but are en-
tirely qualities of sensation, conditioned by the nature of the optic nerve and
its perceptive apparatus in the brain. A sensation of light, therefore, may be
determined not merely by the impact of a wave of the luminous ether on the
retina, but_ by any excitation of the optic nerve, of whatever kind it may be,
provided it strike the extremities of the nerve in the retina or its stem and the
current be evoked in its fibres. It has been already mentioned in passing that
the strongest irritant of all nerves, the electric current, produces, when directed
through the eye, intense perceptions of light, or, to speak more exactly, a bright
flash at the moment of commencing and ceasing, a radiant yellow and violet
colored image daring its continuance. Pressure on the nerves of sight or their
division, sometimes required by morbid degeneration of the eyeball, also pro-
duces a sensation of light. LEven mechanical irritation of the retina induces
the phenomenon. Every one may recollect from experience that a blow or
thrust against the eye is attended with an appearance of sparks, but the fact
may be verified at any moment by a more commodious experiment. If the eye
be closed and a finger end pressed against the lateral parts of the eyeball, and
therefore against the sclerotic coat under which lies the retina, a bright circle
will appear in the darkened field of vision; not, however, at the point of pres-
sure, but in the opposite part, as, for instance, towards the nose when the pres-
sure is on the side next the temple, underneath when the pressure is from above.
We will inquire further on, why this transposition of the perception should take
place. To adduce still another example of these luminous apparitions through
mechanical irritation of the optic nerve: When from physical affections, spirit-
uous potations, or morbid excitement a determination of blood to the head takes
place, fine lummous specks are apt to glimmer before the eyes, the particles of
which float confusedly in the field of vision, and most distinctly when the sight
is directed to a bright sly or attention is paid to the phenomenon with the eyes
closed. ‘This glimmering arises from over fulness of the blood vessels traversing
the retina itself; the loaded vessels and probably the single corpuscles of the
blood which permeates them exert a pressure on the elements of the retina lying
behind them and thereby produce the excitation of the optic nerve. Once more:
188 ON THE SENSES.

Light and color are specific qualities of sensation, the result of the activity of
the nerves, through whatever means that activity is called forth, whether by
ethereal undulations, electricity, or mechanical agency. But as the nerves of

toach are destined for excitation by pressure, heat, and cold, the auditory nerve’

for excitation by the waves of sound, and both are arranged with a view to the _

impression of these agents alone, so the optic nerve is not designed for mechan-

%
*

ical or electrical irritation, but is exclusively destined and contrived for excita- —

tion by the waves of the luminous ether. Hence that wonderfully perfect opti-
cal apparatus before the retina, which conducts the rays of light and disposes
them for the formation of exact images; hence the complicated and as yet im-
perfec:ly understood apparatus of the retina itself, by which the vibrations of
the luminous ether are enabled to transmit their specific excitation to the opt»
nerve, while for the electric current or for pressure no such enabling apparatus
has been provided, but both agents must act immediately on the naked fibres of
each nerve in order to set in motion their respective currents.

So much for the origin of a simple sensation of light in general and of its
qualities specifically. In relation to the latter, uamely, the colors in which ob-
served objects appear to us, we must call attention to some highly interesting
but as regards their nature not wholly explained facts, which are known in part
to every novice, but often pass without consideration. The same object does
not always appear to us of the same color; although the waves of light proceed-
ing from it are the same, the quality of the sensation is in some manner changed
in conformity with the color of the objects simultaneously perceived in close
proximity with it. If a red wafer on white paper be attentively observed for
some time, it will be seen that the paper around the wafer appears no longer of
a pure white, but assumes a greenish hue and at length a red tint like the wafer
itself If we look at a white wall through a hole in a green paper it appears at
first of a reddish color, but afterwards of a greenish hue like the paper. These
experiments may be varied at pleasure. Even black objects, from which no
light is emitted into the eye, appear on a colored ground not black, but per-
ceptibly tinted—green, for instance, on a red ground, and green also on a green
ground. As already intimated, no certain explanation has been given of these
fucts.* We know only that the red or green color of the white ground around
a green or red wafer is not objective—that is to say, that light-waves of the
corresponding velocity do not pass from the paper into our eye, but waves of
the same compound (white) light, as when we observe the paper alone. Hence
the color of the paper is swdjective—that is to say, it depends on a peculiar
mode of perception by our own mind. The mind conceives white to be green
when it appears beside red, to be red when it appears beside green. Red and
green form for our mental perception contrasted (complementary) colors ; so
likewise do blue and yellow, &c. In the white light of the paper, as has been
shown, all colors are contained; it may well be, therefore, that when we see red
near white we overlook in the compound white the red ingredient and more
clearly perceive the complementary color, the green ingredient; single it out in
some measure from the mixture and substitute it for the objective white, of
which it is a part. ‘This is the commonly received explanation, but it is not
full one. It is still more difficult to account for the colors which black objects
assume on a colored ground, for here the question no longer relates to the dif-
ferent interpretation of the quality of a definite sensation, but to the perception
of color by the retina, when in fact no light falls on it. Black is no color.
When we see therefore black objects colored, our perceptive faculty must con-
ceive a sensation of definite quality without any apparent objective cause; how
this comes to pass, what, as regards the mind, is the provocative thereto, and
why the conceptions of color in this case maintain a constant quality in relation

* See article on Subjective or Accidental Colors.
THE SENSE OF SIGHT 189

to the colors of the background is an enigma which it is not at present possi-
ble fully to solve.

A second series of interesting facts consists in the so-called secondary images.
When an impression of light strikes the retina, the sensation thereby generated
does not vanish instantaneously with the cessation of the impression from
without, but subsists yet a short time longer. A number of familiar phenomena
admit of being referred to this fact. When a wheel turns very rapidly we no
longer distinguish the single spokes—it appears as a full disk; when we whirl
a glowing coal rapidly around we do not see the coal gradually advancing as a
bright point; it presents a closed circle of light; that is to say, we see the coal
simultaneously at all points of its progress. Whence is this? It results simply
from the persistence of the impression. The coal produces at each point of its
course a sensation of light which endures for a moment, while the coal itself has
already moved forward. If we imagine the coal at the uppermost point of its
circuit, the sensation generated at this point still endures, that is, we still see
the coal at this uppermost point, while it has already moved a space further,
and has generated sensations from the following points, which again continue a
moment beyond the time of its presence at any given point. With a certain
velocity of rotation, it will follow that the sensation produced at the first point
still persists when the coal has performed its whole circuit, again arrived at the
uppermost point, and there generated the impression anew ; and since the same
is the case with cach successive point, the image presented to our eye is, of
course, that of a circle of light. The same holds good with regard to the re-
volving wheel. A further interesting example is the following: We have seen
that white light is compounded of seven colors—those, namely, of the rainbow ;
in other words, a ray of light which generates in the eye the sensation of a
white color is composed of seven luminous undulations, differing in the vibratory
velocity of their ethereal particles, each of which undulations, when it strikes
the eye separately, generates the sensation of a peculiar color. Now, if we take
a disk, divide its surface from the centre outward into seven compartments, color
these successively with the tints of the rainbow, and in the same order, the first
red, the second orange, &c., and then cause the disk to revolve very rapidly, it
will appear to the eye to be white, or, at least, gray. After what has preceded, the
explanation is simple. Through the rapid movement of the disk the several
colored rays strike so quickly one after another upon the portion of the retina
on which the image is traced, that the impression of the first ray is not yet ex-
tinet when the remaining six have already struck upon the same sensitive
points, whence the retina is simultaneously excited by the seven rays, and a
perception of whiteness is the consequence. From this simple persistence of
the original impression we should distinguish the secondary images which some-
times occur in a narrower sense of the word ; phenomena which, like the former,
are familiar to every one from experience. Who has not looked upon the set-
ting sun, and then perceived the persistent after-images which occupy the field
of vision wherever the eyes may be turned, and vanish not even when they are
closed; which, on the contrary, then appear vividly and arrayed in different
colors, red, blue, &c., while to the open eye, directed, for instance, towards the
bright sky, they seem projected as a dark object on the back ground. By at-
tentive observation and some practice many analogous phenomena of great di-
versity and interest may be observed. We confine our exemplification to an.
easily repeated experiment. If we place a red wafer (or red paper) on a white’
ground and observe it attentively for some time, then suddenly tura the sight’
laterally to the white surface, we shall plainly perceive an after-image of the’
wafer of a green tint, which follows the eye when directed to different parts of
the back ground. If the object thus fixedly observed be blue, the secondary
image will be yellow; in a word, it will be always the so-called contrasted or
complementary color which presents itself in this image, and always darker
190 ON THE SENSES.

than the bright ground on which we observe it. If this ground be colored, the
color of the secondary image varies in different ways which we need not spe-
cially describe; a blue wafer, for instance, observed on a yellow ground yields,
when the eye is turned to a white surface, a yellow image of the wafer on a blue
ground.

It has already been said that these images display themselves not only to the
open, but to the closed eye, and with the most surprising alternation of colors
and brightness, so that, after the observation of some definite object, these re-
peatedly change, in the secondary image, in a regular series, until, growing
weaker and weaker, the image finally disappears. 'The following is an example
of this series of appearances, but it should be premised that by most eyes they
are only perfectly recognized after long practice and familiarity; but then so
plainly and readily that the secondary images obtrude themselves among the
perceptions without particular attention, and often mingle inconveniently and
annoyingly with the direct observations of sight. If we observe persistently a
bright-colored object—for instance, a bright candle flame through red glass—
and then closing the eye, direct our whole attention to the dark field of vision,
the secondary images of the red flame will present themselves in the following
succession: I irst, the original appearance subsists, like every impression of the
retina, for a very brief moment; next, though so evanescent as to be almost
always overlooked, appears a bright green imaye of the flame on a dark ground;
this gives way to a bright red image of the flame, also on a dark ground, to
which succeeds a dark green image on a bright ground; then again a bright red
on a dark ground; again, a dark green ona bright ground; and this alternation
proceeds until the whole phenomenon closes with a faint, dark green image on
a bright ground. Thus secondary images of like color and like relations of
brightness with the object are interchangeably mingled with those which appear
in the complementary colors of the cbject, and in which what was dark in the
object (the ground) is bright; and, inversely, what was bright (the flame) is
dark. Secondary images with such inverted relations of brightness are termed
negative; those in which these relations are direct are termed positive. Inde-
seribably gorgeous is the play of colors of these images in the closed eye after
the contemplation of the sun itself. The positive image appears not white like
the sun, but assumies, one after the other, the most various and brilliant colors.
First, it appears of a bright blue with orange-colored border, then blue, violet,
deep red, with always differently tinted edges.. Yet, however beautiful and
surprising these images of the sun, we should warn every one against a pro-
tracted observation of that luminary; the experiment is extremely hazardous
for the eye; the dazzling solar light over excites the retina and paralyzes the
vision; the images once seen follow the observer with painful pertinacity. The
most striking attestation to the danger of such observations is found in the fact
that the inquirer who, with unwearied assiduity, first thoroughly investigated
these phenomena, soon grew blind, and has not yet fully recovered his sight.
To many of our readers he is not unknown; under the name of ‘“ Mises” he
has endowed German literature with many highly poetical creations; and who-
ever, among his attractive writings, has met with the touching poem, ‘“ Der
Schwarze Vogel,” (The Bird of Gloom,) will read it with double interest when
he knows that it sprung as a mournful effusion from his heart, when, in conse-
quence of his experiments, the veil of blindness was falling upon his eyes. We
renounee any further discussion of the details, as well as an enumeration of the
differently modified experiments relating to secondary images, and unfortunately
must, at the same time, renounce the purpose of explaining the nature of the
phenomenon itself, and the changes which it undergoes under different cireum-
stances. There are theories upon the subject, but none which are entirely satis-
factory. So much, indeed, we know, that these images are no dream images,
but secondary and necessary effects of the activity of the optic nerve and its ter-
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 191

minal apparatus in conformity with natural laws ; more than this we shall never
be able to establish until we have succeeded in explaining the nature of that ner-
vous activity itself.

We have thus pursued our subject, so far as it relates to the proximate per-
formances of our organ of vision, as far as this is at present practicable; we
have seen the undulations of the luminous ether penetrate through the dioptric
sereen of the eye and the rays of light unite in the surface of the retina into
images of outward objects; we have seen, finally, sensations of definite quality
arise from those etherial undulations, by means of the apparatus of the retina
and the terminal apparatus of the optic nerve. But these simple sensations are
by no means visual perceptions, are in themselves no communications to our
minds from the outer world of its existence and its action; they are but dead
letters, which must first be reduced to living speech. As with all the rest of
the senses, so here the naked sensation is but a special accident of our conscious-
ness, which must undergo further elaboration, be interpreted by indirect means,
and connected with appropriate ideas, before we can realize its inappreciable
value. Only by our learning to refer the sensation of light to the external
object which occasions it, thus giving it objectivity, only by our learning to
associate with the simple sensations ideas of the local relations of external
objects, is sensation transformed into vision. What would it avail us that every
object from which a luminous undulation proceeds should cause a sensation
which might be of red, or green, or other color, according to the length of the
wave, if this sensation remained a purely subjective feeling, disclosed to us
nothing respecting the source from which it came; to what purpose the wonder-
ful arrangements which unite the rays of light on the retina into a faithful
image of the object whence they proceed, if this image could not, act upon the
mind in such a way as to make it sensible of the relations of the object in out-
ward space, its form and magnitude, its position and movement? ‘The laity are
not generally accustomed to distinguish clearly the sensation from the associated
idea, and therefore overlook the wide chasm between a sensation of sight and
seeing. We will attempt to overbridge this chasm as briefly and intelligibly as
possible ; and we may the better afford to be brief, since we have already treated
at large, in reference to the sense of touch, of the process by which objectivity
is conferred on our sensations and of the origin of our local preceptions.

We transfer every impression of the sight to the outer world, even those
whose cause exists in the eye itself; we refer none to our organ of vision; the
gleam of fire which strikes the eye, as well as the flash occasioned by an
electric stream directed through it, seems to us to be outside of the eye. While,
as regards the sense of touch, we arrive at a perception of the sensitive sur-
face, and hence of the organ on which the impression takes effect, as a gen-
eral thing we never attain, in the case of the sense of sight, a consciousness of
the perceptive surface of the retina, the organ of this sense; never perceive an
image formed on that membrane as cause of the sensation we experience. It
was for science first to investigate and verify the existence of such a surface
and image; and notwithstanding this, the physiologist himself is as little capa-
ble as the novice of transferring his own sensations to the membrane of the
retina. And why? There are circuitous means, already discussed in our doctrine
of the sense of touch, by which we attain in childhood to the conviction that
there is space external to ourselves and outward things as opposed to our own per-
sonality ; that these outward things are the causes of those conditions of the
mind which we call sensations. But while, as regards the sense of touch, we
are enabled, through the double sensation which arises from the touch of one
part of the surface by another, to distinguish this surface from outward things,
no such resource is available as regards the eye, because the means thereto, the
power of testing the organ of vision with the organ of vision itself, is wanting;
we learu to refer the sensations of sight directly and exclusively to the external
192 ON THE SENSES.

objects. This mode of interpretation once established, we are thenceforth its
slaves ; we can never again free ourselves from its influence nor conceive of a
sensation of light as purely subjective, and without the idea of a causative
external object to which it is referable.

Yet this reference of the sensations of light to the outward world is still not
a complete act of vision ; for this there is further required the perception of the
local relations of the external things to which we refer the sensations. And
here the organ of sight offers a complete analogy with the organ of touch. We
must conceive of our retina as a mosaic of sensitive points, just as our outward
skin was shown to be; according to the specific coloring which each of these
sensitive points imparts to the sensation called forth by it, does the mind recog-
nize the place in outer space at which it is to seck the object of the sensation.

In conception the space embraced by the field of view is distributed into just
so many compartments as the mosaic of the retina comprises points of sensation ;
if one of the latter be struck by an impression of light, we refer the sensation
to that compartment of the field of vision which corresponds to the point struck.
If a series of points of the retina which lie in a right line be struck simulta-
neously we refer the impressions to those compartments of the ideal mosaic which
lie in the corresponding right line. If an image of a sphere, of the moon, for in-
stance, be delineated on the retina, the points of the retina which are struck lie
in a spherically bounded surface contiguous to one another, and the same is
the case in the field to which our idea transfers the sensations belonging to the
several points ; hence it is that in the first case we see a right line; in the second,
asphere. If the retina be simultaneously struck by light at two points separated
from one another, each of these impressions connects itself with the appropriate
idea of locality. We see two distinct points of light and comprehend their
severance from one another, since we are conscious of the mosaic particles of the
retina remaining unaffected which are situated between the two that are struck ;
we mentally enumerate these, and from their number form a judgment of the
intervening distance. If we observe two objects, one after the other, the image
of the first of which covers four, that of the second eight sensitive points on
the retina, we estimate the magnitude of each of them and their relative pro-
portion according to the number of sensitive points which are struck, or rather
according to the number of the compartments embraced in our ideal field of
vision, which in both cases we have tilled up with our sensations. In this
manner we arrive at the perception of the form and size of observed objects,
but always without being conscious of the meditator between the object on the
one hand and the sensation and idea on the other, the image, namely, on the
retina with its local relations ; always without attention to the mental operation
by which we have once laboriously learned to clothe the simple sensations with
the ideas of form and magnitude.

For a clearer explanation of the local perception, we have called to our aid the
hypothesis that the retina represents a mosaic of sensitive points ; this hypothesis
it is proper that we should now a li:tle more closely examine. Physiology must
take it for granted that each of the countless minute filaments of the optic nerve,
which, packed together in its stem, are afterwards dispersed over the retina, there
terminate in a peculiar apparatus ; that the terminal apparatus of all these fila-
ments lie, arranged near one another, in the plane of the retina, like the pieces of
a delicate mosaic work ; and that each apparatus represents in reality a sensitive
point endued with the nature and properties which we have supposed in our ex-
planation of the local perceptions of the organ. If this be the case, everything
is easily explained, and the results of the most recent microscopic investigations
permit us to conclude with almost entire certainty that the retina is, in fact, such
an anatomical mosaic of distinct nerve-ends, that the rod-shaped and conical
appendages of the nerves in the hindermost layer of the retina form respectively
just such sensitive points as we have supposed. Let it be assumed. then. that
THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 193

every nerve-fibre terminates in a cone, and can, as is really the case, only be
excited by the light through this organization ; the above explanation may then
be interpreted as follows: Each cone elaborates the luminous wave which strikes
it into an irritant of the nerve, which sends a current to the brain, and there
evokes a perception of light. The current is essentially the same in all the nerve
fibres from the similar constitution of the waves, but it is characterized in each
fibre by some modification, some nuance, however slight it may be, which defi-
nitely distinguishes it from the current in all the other fibres ; this modification
is imparted to it by the appendage in some manner wholly unknown to us. It
is this modification of the nervous current, and the sensation thereby generated,
which we learn to interpret as a token of the place in the field of vision, to which
we must assign the perception; how this is effected has been shown in our remarks
on the sense of feeling. The shading of the sensation, which an impression
on the central cones situated opposite to the pupil produces, we have learned to
connect with the idea that the object to which we refer the sensation lies in the
middle of the field of vision, and it is from the same specific shading or modi-
fication of the sensation that we determine the relative position of the other
points in that ficld. This brings us to a further interesting question pertaining
to this head of our subject. When the novice is informed that all outward objects
are portrayed on the retina in an inverted position, it seems to him incompre-
hensible why we should sce the objects upright, as they really are, and not
inverted; indeed, up to the latest times there have been physiologists who, in
order to clear up this seeming contradiction, have taken great pains to find some
anatomical or physical mechanism for once more reversing the image of the
retina. ‘This is wholly unnecessary ; such a mechanism were only to be thought
of, if we perceived the image as such and its inverted position were capable of
directly acting upon the sensorium. But that, as we have seen, is not the case.
Notwithstanding the inversion of the image, the fact that the object is seen up-
right admits of the most simple and natural explanation, when we accept the
fact that we connect with the excitation of a sensitive point lying to the left in
the retina the idea of a cause of the sensation lyiug to the right in outer space,
and have learned in like manner to refer the excitation of a point below to an
object situated above. . If we consider how ideas of place come to be connected
with the sensations of sight, we must see that it cannot be otherwise. An ob-
ject which we see we can at the same time touch, and from the position of our
organ of touch can determine, in the manner formerly pointed out, the position
of the object in space. When we know that, in order to reach a point which
has evoked a sensation, we must move the touching finger in the direction which
we call to the right, we refer the visual sensation also to the right in outer space,
unembarrassed by the fact, of which we are wholly unconscious, that the im-
pression of the light has been received on the left and not on the right of the
retina. As we formerly saw, it is the appropriate sensations connected with
the movements of our limbs, whose surface is sensitive to the touch, from which
we form a judgment of the direction of the movement and the position of the
objects touched. Now the eyes also are movable; their movements are con-
nected with the feeling of movement like those of our arm, and this feeling we
learn to interpret and to use for the formation of ideas. We know, if our sense
of vision has once been educated, that an object lies to the right of us, when, in
order to perceive it clearly, we must turn our eyes to the right—that is to say,
when the movement of the eye creates a muscular feeling, which we have
learned to recognize as a movement to the right. These muscular feelings
which accompany the movements of our eye are, in yet another relation, highly
important auxiliaries to the perceptions of sight, and in a manner wholly
analogous to the sense of touch. They instruct us respecting the size, form,
and distance of observed objects and the direction of their movements. Not to

dwell too long on details, we will illustrate this by an example. Suppose a
circular object before us. If it is small,so that we can survey it with the eye
unmoved, we at once perceive its form through the sense of relative position ex-
erted by the retina; or, in other words, from the circumstance that the points of
the retina occupied by its image lie in a circular line. But if it is so large that
we cannot embrace it in one view, we proceed as follows: We so direct our eye
that first the image of its uppermost point shall fall upon the central point of
the retina; we then move the eye so that the image of the following point shall.
fall upon the same place, and so on, till one after another the images of all the
single and successive points of the ring have made their impression upon the
same sensitive portion of the retina. ‘That in this process the impressed place
of the retina has remained, the same, we learn from the continuance of the local
coloring of the sensations; that the object has a circular form, we gather from
the muscular feelings which have accompanied the movement of the eye, and
which we have learned to refer to a circular movement. Since these muscular
feelings inform us also of the magnitude of the movement executed, we form
therefrom a judgment respecting the size of the observed circle. If we would
estimate the distance of two observed points from one another, we either enu-
merate, in the manner heretofore explained, the number of the mosaic elements
of the retina, which remain unaffected between their images, or we direct our
eyes so that first the image of one point shall strike the middle of the retina,
and then move the eye so far that the image of the second point shall strike
upon the same place, and now compute the interval between the two from the
muscular feeling which attended the executed movement and which assists us
to form an idea of their direction, size, &c.

We might draw out these remarks to greater length, and initiate our reader,
if he had the patience longer to accompany us, still more deeply in the mys-
teries of the eye; but we limit ourselves to what has been said, because it has
seemed to us, under the circumstances, a duty to restrict ourselves to what is of
most importance, as well as because many other points would appear to offer too
much difficulty to be made either intelligible or interesting to the general reader.
There are certain limits beyond which the popular exposition of the natural
sciences is impossible, and must partake more or less of the character of char-
jatanism. To him who has followed us we hope to have sufficiently shown that
it needs not a glance towards the inconceivably distant worlds of the nocturnal
heavens to be sunk in devout astonishment before the marvels of creation, but
that the smallest organ of our bodily frame offers a subject of still more wonder,
and, because more accessible to ovr understanding, of a yet higher degree of
interest.

OF

SPECTRUM ANALYSIS APPLIED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES,

DELIVERED BEFORE THE

BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. AUGUST 23, 1866.
BY WM. HUGGINS, F.R.S., ETC.

AN important invention or discovery seldom, if ever, remains sterile and alone.
It gives birth to other discoveries. ‘The telescope and the microscope have led
to remarkable discoveries in astronomy and in minute anatomy and physiology,
which would not have been possible without those instruments. The observation
that a magnetic body, free to move, arranges itself nearly north and south, has
not only contributed immensely to the extension of commerce and of geographical
discovery, but also has founded the important science of terrestrial magnetism.

This evening I have to bring before you some additions to our knowledge in
the department of astronomy, which have followed from a comparatively recent
discovery. ‘The researches of Kirchhoff have placed in the hands of the astron-
omer a method of analysis which is specially suitable for the examination of the
heavenly bodies. So unexpected and important are the results of the application
of spectrum analysis to the objects in the heavens that this method of obser-
vation may be said to have created a new and distinct branch of astronomical
science.

Physical astronomy, the imperishable and ever growing monument to the
memory of Newton, may be described as the extension of terrestrial dynamics
to the heavens. It seeks to explain the movements of the celestial bodies on the
supposition of the universality of an attractive force similar to that which exists
upon the earth.

The new branch of astronomical science which spectrum analysis may be said
to have founded, has for its object to extend the laws of terrestrial physics to
the other phenomena of the heavenly bodies, and it rests upon the now estab-
lished fact that matter of a nature common to that of the earth, and subject to
laws similar to those which prevail upon the earth, exists throughout the stellar
universe.

The peculiar importance of Kirchhoft’s discovery to astronomy becomes obvious
if we consider the position in which we stand to the heavenly bodies. Gavita-
tion and the laws of our being do not permit us to leave the earth; it is, therefore,
by means of lighé alone that we can obtain any knowledge of the grand array
of worlds which surround us in cosmical space. The star-lit heavens is the only
chart of the universe we have, and in it each twinkling point is the sign of an
immensely vast though distant region of activity.

Hitherto the light from the heavenly bodies, even when collected by the largest
telescope, has conveyed to us but very meagre information, and in some cases
only of their form, their size, and their color. The discovery of Kirchhoff en-
ables us to interpret symbols and indications hidden within the light itself, which
furnish trustworthy information of the chemical, and also to some extent of the

physical, condition of the excessively remote bodies from which the light has
emanated.
196 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

We are indebted to Newton for the knowledge that the beautiful tints of the
rainbow are the common and necessary ingredients of ordinary light. He found
that when white light is made to pass through a prism of glass it is decomposed
into the beautiful colors which are seen in the rainbow. ‘These colors when in
this way separated from each other form the spectrum of the light. Let this
white plate represent the transverse section of a beam of white light travelling
towards you. Let now a prism be interposed in its path. The beam of white
light is not turned aside as a whole, but the colored lights composing it are de-
flected differently, each in proportion to the rapidity of its vibrations. An
obvious consequence will be, that on emerging from the prism the colored lights
which formed the white light will separate from each other, and in place of the.
white light which entered the prism we shall have zs spectrum—that is, the
colored lights which composed it, in a state of separation from each other.
Wollaston and Fraunhofer discovered that when the light of the sun is decom- ~
posed by a prism, the rainbow colors which form its spectrum are not cuntinuous,
but are interrupted by a large uumber of dark lines. These lines of darkness
are the symbols which indicate the chemical constitution of the sun. It was
not until recently, in the year 1859, that Kirchhoff taught us the true nature of
these lines. He himself immediately applied his method of interpretation to the
dark lines of the solar spectrum, and was rewarded by the discovery that several
of the chemical elements which exist upon the earth are present in the solar
atmosphere.

It is my intention to bring before you this evening the results of the extension
of this method of analysis to the heavenly bodies other than the sun. ‘These
researches have been carried on in my observatory during the last four years.
In respect of a large part of these investigations, viz., those of the moon, the
planets, and rixed stars, I have had the great pleasure of working conjointly
with the very distinguished chemist and philosopher, Dr. Wm. A. Miller. Half
a century ago Fraunhofer recognized several of the solar lines in the light of the
moon, Venus, and Mars, and also in the spectra of several stars. Recently,
Donati, Janssen, Secchi, Rutherford, and the Astronomer Royal have observed
lines in the spectra of some stars. Before I describe the results of our observa-
tions, I will state, in a few words, the principles of spectrum analysis upon which
our interpretation of the phenomena we have observed has been based, and also
the method of observing which we have employed.

When light which has emanated from different sources is decomposed by a
prism, the spectra which are obtained may differ in several important respects

from each other. All the spectra which may present themselves can be conve-
' niently arranged in three general groups. A spectrum illustrating each of these
three orders is placed upon the diagram:

1. The special character which distinguishes spectra of the first order consists
in that the continuity of the colored band is unbroken either by dark or bright
lines. By means of the electric lamp, Mr. Ladd will throw a spectrum of this
order upon the screen. We learn from such a spectrum that the light has been
emitted by an opaque body, and almost certainly by matter in the solid or liquid
state. A spectrum of this order gives to us no knowledge of the chemical nature
of the incandescent body from which light comes. In the present case the light
is emitted by the white-hot carbon points of the electric lamp. A spectrum in all
respects similar would be formed by the light from incandescent iron, or lime,
or magnesia. ;

2. Spectra of the second order are very different. These consist of colored
- lines of light separated from each other. From such a spectram we may learn
much. It informs us that the luminous matter from which the light has come is
in the state of gas. It is only when a luminous body is free from the molecular
trammels of solidity and liquidity that it can exhibit its own peculiar power of
radiating some colored rays alone. Hence substances, when im a state of gas,
\

.

may be distinguished from each other by their spectra. Each element, and
every compound body that can become luminous in the gaseous state without
suffering decomposition, is distinguished by a group of lines peculiar to itself.
These green lines are produced by silver in a state of gas, and only by silver
gas. It is obvious that if the groups of lines characterizing the different terres-
trial substances be known, a comparison of these as standard spectra with the
spectrum of light from an unknown sourge will show whether any of these
terrestrial substances exist in the source of the light.

3. The third order consists of the spectra of incandescent solid or liquid bodies,
in which the continuity of the colored light is broken by dark lines. 'These dark
spaces are not produced by the source of the light. They tell us of vapors
through which the light has passed on its way, and which have robbed the light,
by absorption, of certain definite colors or rates of vibration; such spectra are
formed by the light of the sun and stars.

Kirchhoff has shown that if vapors of terrestrial substances come between the
eye and an incandescent body, they cause groups of dark lines, and, further,
that the group of dark lines produced by each vapor is identical in the number
of the lines and in their position in the spectrum with the group of bright lines
of which its light consists when the vapor is luminous.

Mr. Ladd will throw upon the screen the spectrum of incandescent carbon
points which contain scdium. Observe in addition to the continuous spectrum
of the incandescent carbon a bright yellow band, which indicates the presence
of sodium. Now a piece of metallic sodium will be introduced into the lamp.
The sodium will be vaporized by the heat,.and will fill the lamp with its vapor.
This vapor absorbs, quenches the light that it emits when luminous. There
will thus be produced a black line exactly in the place where the bright yellow
line was seen.

It is evident that Kirchhoff by this discovery has furnished us with the means
of interpreting the dark lines of the solar spectrum. For this purpose it is
necessary to compare the bright lines in the spectra of the light of terrestrial
substances, when iz the state of gas, with the dark lines in the solar spectrum.
When a group of bright lines coincides with a similar group of dark lines, then
we know that the terrestrial substance producing the bright lines is present in
the atmosphere of the sun; for it is this substance, and this substance alone,
which, by its own peculiar power of absorption, can produce that particular
group of dark lines. In this way Kirchhoff discovered the presence of several
terrestrial elements in the solar atmosphere.

METHODS OF OBSERVATION.

I now pass to the special methods of observation by which, in our investiga-
tions, we have applied these principles of spectrum analysis to the light of the
heavenly bodies. I may here state that several circumstances unite to make
these observations very difficult and very irksome. In our climate, on few only
even of those nights in which the stars shine brilliantly to the naked eye, is the
air sufficiently steady for these extremely delicate observations. Further, the
light of the star is feeble. This difficulty has been met, in some measure, by
the employment of a large telescope. ‘The light of a star falling upon the surface
of an object-glass of eight inches aperture is gathered up and concentrated at the
focus into a minute and brilliant point of light.

Another inconvenience arises from the apparent movement of the stars, caused
by the rotation of the earth, which carries the astronomer and his instruments
with it. This movement was counteracted by a movement given by clockwork
to the telescope in the opposite direction. In practice, however, it is not easy
to retain the image of a star for any length of time exactly within the jaws of a
slit only the 1-300th of an inch apart. By patient perseverance these difficul-
198 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

ties have been overcome, and satisfactory results obtained. We considered that
the trustworthiness of our results must rest chiefly upon direct and simultaneous
comparison of terrestrial spectra with those of celestial objects. For this purpose
we contrived the apparatus which is represented in the diagram.

By this outer tube the instrument is adapted to the eye-end‘of the telescope,
and is carried round with it by the clock motion. Within this outer tube a
second tube slides, carrying a cylindrical lens. This lens is for the purpose of
elongating the round point-like image of the star into a short line of light, which
is made to fall exactly within the jaws of a nearly-closed slit. Behind the slit
an achromatic lens (and at the distance of its own focal length) causes the pen-
cils to emerge parallel. They then pass into two prisms of dense flint glass.
The spectrum which results from the decomposition of the light by the prisms
is viewed through a small achromatic telescope. This telescope is provided with
a micrometer screw, by which the lines of the spectrum may be measured.

The light of the terrestrial substances which are to be compared with the
stellar spectra is admitted into the instrument in the following manner :

Over one-half of the slit is fixed a small prism, which receives the light re-
flected into it by the movable mirror placed above the tube. The mirror faces
a clamp of ebonite, provided with forceps to contain fragments of the metals
employed. These metals are rendered luminous in the state of gas by the tense ~
heat of the sparks from a powerful induction coil. The light from the spark
reflected into the instrument by means of the mirror and the little prism passes
on to the prisms in company with that from the star. In the small telescope
the two spectra are viewed in juxtaposition, so that the coincidence and relative
positions of the bright lines in the spectrum of the spark with dark lines in the
spectrum of the star can be accurately determined.

MOON AND PLANETS,

I now pass to the results of our observations.

I refer in a few words only to the moon and planets. These objects, unlike
the stars and nubule, are not original sources of light. Since they shine by
reflecting the sun’s light, their spectra resemble the solar spectrum, and the only
indications in their spectra which may become sources of knowledge to us are
confined to any modifications which the solar light may have suffered, either in
the atmosphere of the planets or by reflection at their surfaces.

Moon.—On the moon the results of our observations have been negative.
The spectra of the various parts of the moon’s surface, when examined under
different conditions of illumination, showed no indication of an atmosphere about
the moon. I also watched the spectrum of a star as the dark edge of the moon
advanced towards the star and then occulted it. No signs of a lunar atmosphere
presented themselves.

Jupiter —In the spectrum of Jupiter, lines are seen which indicate the exist-
ence of an abgorptive atmosphere about this planet. In this diagram these lines
are presented as they appeared when viewed simultaneously with the spectrum
of the sky, which, at the time of observation, reflected the light of the setting
sun. One strong band corresponds with some terrestrial atmospheric lines, and
probably indicates the presence of vapors similar to those which are about the
earth. Another band has no counterpart among the lines of absorption of our
atmosphere, and tells us of some gas or-vapor which does not exist in the earth’s
atmosphere.

Saturn —The spectrum of Saturn is feeble, but lines similar to those which
distinguish the spectrum of Jupiter were detected. These lines are less strongly
marked in the ansae of the rings, and show that the absorptive power of the
atmosphere about the rings is less than that of the atmosphere which surrounds
the ball. A distinguished foreigner present at the meeting, Janssen, has quite
APPLIED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES. 199

recently found that several of the atmospheric lines in this part of the spectrum
are produced by aqueous vapor. It appears to be very probable that aqueous
vapor exists in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.

Mars.—On one occasion some remarkable groups of lines were seen in the
more refrangible part of the spectrum of Mars. These may be connected with
the source of the red color which distinguishes this planet.

Venus —Though the spectrum of Venus is brilliant, and the lines of Fraunhofer
were well seen, no additional lines affording evidence of an atmosphere about
Venus were detected. The absence of lines may be due to the cireumstance
that the light is probably reflected, not from the planetary surface, but from
clouds at some elevation above it. The light which reaches us in this way by
reflection from clouds would not have been exposed to the absorbent action of
the lower and denser strata of the planet’s atmosphere.

THE FIXED STARS.

The fixed stars, though immensely more remote and less conspicuous in
brightness than the moon and planets, yet, because they are original sources of
light, furnish us with fuller indications of their nature.

To each succeeding age the stars have been a beauty and a mystery. Not
only children, but the most thoughtful of men, often repeat the sentiment ex-
pressed in the well-known lines— ’

“Twinkle, twinkle, pretty star ;
How I wonder what you are.”

The telescope was appealed to in vain, for in the largest instruments the stars
remain diskless—brilliant points merely.

The stars have indeed been represented as suns, each upholding a dependent
amily of planets. This opinion rested upon a possible analogy alone. It was
not more than a speculation. We possessed no certain knowledge from obser-
vation of the true nature of those remote points of light. This long and earnestly-
coveted information is at last furnished by spectrum analysis. We are now able
to read in the light of each star some indications of its nature. Since I have
not a magician’s power to convert this theatre into an observatory, and so
exhibit to you the spectra of the stars themselves, I have provided photographs
of careful drawings. These photographs Mr. Ladd will exhibit upon the screen
by means of the electric lamp. I will take first the spectra of two bright stars
which we have examined with great care.

The upper one represents the spectrum of Aldebaran, and the other that of
Betelgeux, the star marked a in the constellation of Orion.

The positions of all these dark lines, about 80 in each star, were determined
by careful and repeated measures. These measured lines form but a small part
of the numerous fine lines which may be seen in the spectra of these stars.

Beneath the spectrum of each star are represented the bright lines of the
metals which have been compared with it. These terrestrial spectra appeared
in the instrument as you now see them upon the screen, in juxtaposition with
the spectrum of the star. By such an arrangement, it is possible to determine
with great accuracy whether or not any of these bright lines actually coincide
with any of the dark ones For example:

This closely double line is characteristic of sodium. You see that it coincides,
line for line, with a dark line similariy double in the star. The vapor of sodium
is therefore present in the atmosphere of the star, and sodium forms one of the
elements of the matter of this brilliant but remote star.

These three lines in the green are produced, so far as we know, by the lumi-
nous vapor of magnesium alone. These lines agree in position exactly line for
200 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

line with three dark stellar lines. The conclusion, therefore, appears well founded
that another of the constituents of this star is magnesium.

Again, there are two strong lines peculiar to the element Ay ydrogens one
line has its place in the red part of the spectrum, the other at the blue limit of
the green. Both of these correspond to dark lines of absorption in the epecuni
of the star. Hydrogen, therefore, is present in the star.

In a similar way, other elements, among them bismuth, antimony, telurium,
and mercury, have been shown to exist in the star.

Now, in reference to all those elements, the evidence does net rest upon the
coincidence of one line, which would be worth but little, but upon the coincidence
of a group of two, three, or four lines, occurring in different parts of the spec-
trum. Other corresponding lines are probably also present, but the faintness of
the star’s light limited our comparisons to the stronger lines of each element.

What elements do the numerous other Imes in the star represent? Some of
them are probably due to the vapors of other terrestrial elements, which we
have not yet compared with these stars. But may not some of these lines be
the signs of primary forms of matter unknown upon the earth? Elements new
to us may here show themselves which form large and important series of com-
pounds, and therefore give a special character to the physical conditions of these
remote systems. In a similar manner the spectra of terrestrial substances have
been compared with several other stars. The results are given in the diagrams.
Five or six elements have been detected in Betelgeux. ‘len other elements do
not appear to have a place in the constitution of this star.

f Pegast contains sodium, magnesium, aud perhaps barium.

Sirius contains sodium, magnesium, iron, and hydrogen.

a Lyre ( Vega) contains sodium, magnesium, iron.

Pollux contains sodium, magnesium, iron.

About sixty other stars have been examined, all of which appear to have some
elements in common with the sun and earth, but the selective grouping of the
elements in each star is probably peculiar and unique.

A few stars, however, stand out from the rest, and appear to be characterized
by a peculiarity of great significance. These stars are represented by Betelgeux
and @ Pegasi. The general grouping of the lines of absorption in these stars is
peculiar, but the remarkable and exceptional feature of their spectra is the absence
of the two lines which indicate hydrogen, one line in the red and the other in
‘the green. ‘These lines correspond to Fraunhofer’s C and F. The absence of
these lines in some stars shows that the lines C and F are not due to the aqueous
vapor of the atmosphere.

We hardly venture to suggest that the planets which may surround these
suns probably resemble them in not possessing the important element hydrogen.
To what forms of life could such planets be adapted? Worlds without water!
A power of imagination like that possessed by Dante would be needed to people
such planets with living creatures.

It is worthy of consideration that, with these few exceptions, the terrestrial
elements which appear most widely diffused through the host of stars are pre-
cisely tome of those which are essential to life such as it exists upon the earth,
namely: hydrogen, sodium, magnesium, and iron. Besides, hydrogen, sodium,
and magnesium represent the ocean, which is an essential part of a world con-
stituted like the earth.

We learn from these observations that iz plan of structure the stars, or at
least the brightest of them, resemble the sun. ‘Their light, like that of the sun,
emanates from intensely white-hot matter, and passes through an atmosphere of
absorbent vapors. With this unity of general plan of structure, there exists a
great diversity among the individual stars. Star differs from star in chemical
constitution. May we not believe that the individual peculiarities of each star
APPLIED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES. 201

are essentially connected with the special purpose which it subserves, and with
the living beings which may inhabit the planetary worlds by which it may
possibly be surrounded?

When we had obtained this new information respecting the true nature of the
stars, our attention was directed to the phenomena which specially distinguish
some of the stars.

COLORS OF THE STARS.

When the air is clear, especially in southern climes, the twinkling stars do
not all resemble diamonds; here and there may be seen in beauteous contrast
richly-colored gems.

The color of the light of the stars which are bright to the naked eye is always
some tint of zed, orange, or yellow When, however, a telescope is employed,
in close companionship with many of these ruddy and orange stars, other fainter
stars become visible, the color of which may be blue, or green, or purple.

Now it appeared to us to be probable that the origin of these differences of
color among the stars may be indicated by their spectra.

Since we had found that the source of the light of the stars is incandescent
solid or liquid matter, it appeared to be very probable that at the time of its
emission the light of all the stars is white alike. The colors observed among
them must then be caused by some modification suffered by the light after its
emission. .

Again, it was obvious that if the dark lines of absorption were more numerous
or stronger in some part of the spectrum, then those colors would be subdued in
power, relatively to the color in which few lines only occur. These latter colors
remaining strong, would predominate, and give to the light, originally white,
their own tints. These suppositions have been confirmed by observations.

Mr. Ladd will throw upon the screen the spectrum of Sirius, which may be
taken as an illustration of the stars the light of which rs white.

As might be expected, the spectra of these stars are remarkable for their
freedom from strong groups of absorption lines. ‘The dark lines, though present
in great number, are all, with one exception, very thin and faint, and too feeble
to modify the original whiteness of the light. ‘The oze exception consists of
three very strong single lines: one line corresponding to Fraunhofer’s C, one to
F, and the other near G. Two of these certainly indicate the presence of
hydrogen. This peculiarity, which seems invariably connected with colorless
stars, is very suggestive, and invites speculation. May it be a sign of a tempe-
rature of extreme fierceness ?

Let us now examine the spectrum of an orange star.

This diagram represents the spectrum of the brighter of the two stars which
form the double star a Herculis. In the spectrum of this star the green and
blue parts of the light, and also the deep red, are subdued with strong groups of
lines, while the orange and yellow rays preserve nearly their original intensity,
and therefore predominate in the star’s light.

The question yet remained to be answered, would the faint telescopic stars,
which are dlue, green, and purple, and which are never found alone in the
heavens, but always under the protection of a strong ruddy or orange star, fur-
nish spectra in accordance with this theory ?

With some little difficulty, and by means of a special arrangement of the
spectrum apparatus, we succeeded in observing the spectra of the components of
some double stars. There will now be thrown upon the screen the well-known
double star  Cygni. In a large telescope the colors of the two stars are beau-
tifully contrasted, as they now appear upon the screen. The spectra of these
stars are now shown. The upper spectrum represents the orange star, the lower
one that of its beautiful blue but feeble companion. In the orange star you
observe that the dark lines are strongest and most closely grouped in the blue
202 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

and violet parts of the spectrum, and the orange rays therefore, which are com-
paratively free from lines, predominate.

In the delicate blue companion, the strongest. groups of lines are found in the
yellow, orange, and in part of the red. In the arrangement of these groups of
lines we have a sufficient cause for the predominance of the other portions of
the spectrum which unite in the eye to give the blue purple color of the light
of this star.

We have, therefore, shown that the colors of the stars are produced by the
vapors existing in their atmosphere. The chemical constitution of a star’s
atmosphere will depend upon the elements existing in the star and upon its tem-
perature.

VARIABLE STARS.

The brightness of many of the stars is found to be variable. From night to
night, from month to month, or from season to season, their light may be ob-
served to be continually changing, at one time increasing, at another time dimin-
ishing. The careful study of these variable stars by numerous observers has
shown that their continual changes do not take place in an uncertain or irregular
manner. ‘The greater part of these remarkable objects wax and wane in accord-
ance with a fixed law of periodic variations which is peculiar to each.

We have been seeking for some time to throw light upon this strange phe-
nomenon by means of observation of their spectra. If in any case the periodie
variation of brightness is associated with physical changes occurring in the star,
we might obtain some information by means of the prism. Again, if the diminu-
tion in brightness of a star should be caused. by the interposition of a dark body,
then, in that case, if the dark body be surrounded with an atmosphere, its presence
might possibly be revealed to us by the appearance of additional lines of ab-
sorption in the spectrum of the star when at its minimum. One such change in
the spectrum of a variable star we believe we have already observed.

Betelgeux is a star of a moderate degree of variability. When this star was
at its maximum brilliancy in February last, we missed a group of lines, the ex-
act position of which we had determined with great accuracy by micrometric
measurement some two years before.

We have ebserved the spectra of several variable stars at different phases of
their periodic variation, but our results are not yet complete:

It is worthy of notice that the variable stars which have a ruddy or an orange
tint possess spectra analogous to that of Betelgeux and # Pegasi.

As an example of this group of variable stars, Mr. Ladd wiil throw upon the
sereen the spectrum of » Cephei when at its maximum.

TEMPORARY STARS.

With the variable stars modern opinion would associate the remarkable phe-
nomena of the so-called new stars which occasionally, but at long intervals, have
suddenly appeared in the sky. But in no case has a permanently bright star
been added to the heavens. The splendor of all these objects was temporary
only, though whether they died out or still exist as extremely faint stars is
uncertain. In case of the two modern temporary stars, that seen by Mr. Hind
in 1845,.and the bright star recently observed in Corona, though they have lost
their ephemeral glory, they still continue as stars of the tenth and eleventh
magnitudes.

‘Lhe old theories respecting these strange objects must be rejected. We can-
not believe with Tycho Brahe that objects so ephemeral are new creations, nor
with Riccioli that they are stars brilliant on one side only, which have been
suddenly turned round by the Deity. The theory that they have suddenly
darted towards us with a velocity greater than that of light, from a region of
remote invisibility, will not now find supporters.
APPLIED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES. 203

On the 12th of May last a star of the second magnitude suddenly burst forth
in the constellation of the Northern Crown. Thanks to the kindness of the
discoverer of this phenomenon, Mr. Birmingham, of Tuam, I was enabled, con-
jointly with Dr. Miller, to examine the spectrum of this star on the 16th May,
when it had not fallen much below the third magnitude.

I ought to state that Mr. Barker, of London, Canada West, who announced
an observation of this star on 14th May in the Canadian Free Press, now claims
to have seen the star on May 4th, and states that it increased in brilliancy up to
May 10th, when it was at its maximum.

The spectrum of this star consists of two distinct spectra. One of these is
formed by these four bright lines. The other spectrum is analogous to the spectra
of the sun and stars.

These two spectra represent two distinct sources of light. Each spectrum is
formed by the decomposition of light which is independent of the light which
-gives birth to the other spectrum. ; :

The continuous spectrum, crowded with groups of dark lines, shows that there
exists a photosphere of incandescent solid or liquid matter. Further, that there
is an atmosphere.of cooler vapors, which give rise by absorption to the groups
of dark lines.

So far the constitution of this object is analogous to that of the sun and stars;
but in addition there is the second spectrum, which consists of bright lines.
There is, therefore, a second and distinct source of light, and this must be, as
the character of the spectrum shows, /uminous gas. Now the position of the
two principal of the bright lines of this spectrum informs us that one of the
luminous gases is hydrogen. The great brightness of these lines shows that the
luminous gas is hotter than the photosphere. These facts, taken in connection
with the suddenness of the outburst of light in the star, and its immediate very
rapid dechine in brightness from the second magnitude down to the eighth mag-
nitude in twelve days, suggested to us the startling speculation that the star had
become suddenly enrapt in the flames of burning hydrogen. In consequence, it
may be, of some great convulsion, enormous quantities of gas were set free. A
large part of this gas consisted of hydrogen, which was burning about the star
in combination with some other element. This flaming gas emitted the light
represented by the spectrum of bright lines. The increased brightness of the
spectrum of the other part of the star’s light may show that this fierce gaseous
conflagration had heated to a more vivid incandescence the solid matter of the
photosphere. As the free hydrogen became exhausted the flames gradually
abated, the photosphere became less vivid, and the star waned down to its former
brightness.

We must not forget that light, though a swift messenger, requires time to pass
from the star to us. The great physical convulsion which is new to us is already
an event of the past with respect to the star itself. For years the star has ex-
isted under the new conditions which followed this fiery catastrophe.

NEBULA.

I pass now to objects of another order.

When the eye is aided by a telescope of even moderate power, a large num-
ber of faintly luminous patches and spots come forth from the darkness of the
sky, which are in strong contrast witl the brilliant but point-like images of the
stars. A few of these objects may be easily discerned to cousist of very faint
stars closely aggregated together. Many of these strange objects remain, even
in the largest telescopes, unresolved into stars, and resemble feebly shining clouds,
or masses of phosphorescent haze. » During the last 150 years, the intensely im-
portant question has been continually before the mind of astronomers, “ What is
the true nature of these faint, comet-like masses ?”’
204 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

The interest connected with an answer to this question has much increased
since Sir William Herschel suggested that these objects are portions of the pri-
mordial material out of which the existing stars have been fashioned; and further,
that in these objects we may study some of the stages through which the suns
and planets pass in their development from luminous cloud.

The telescope has failed to give any certain information of the nature of the
nebule. It is true that each successive increase of aperture has resolved more
of these objects into bright points, but at the rame time other fainter nebule
have been brought into view, and fantastic wisps and diffused patches of light
have been seen, which the mind almost refuses to believe can be due to the
united glare of innumerable suns still more remote.

Spectrum analysis, if it could be successfully applied to objects so excessively
faint, was obviously a method of investigation specially suitable for determining
whether any essential physical distinction separates the nebule from the stars.

I selected for the first attempt, in August, 1864, one of the class of small but.
comparatively bright nebule. My surprise was very great on looking into the
small telescope of the spectrum apparatus to perceive that there was no appear-
ance of a band of colored light, such as a star would give, but in place of this
there were three isolated bright lines only.

This observation was sufficient to solve the long agitated inquiry in reference
to this object at least, and to show that it was not a group of stars, but a true
nebula.

A spectrum of this character, so far as our knowledge at present extends, can
be produced only by light which has emanated from matter in the state of gas.
The light of this nebula, therefore, was not emitted from incandescent solid or
liquid matter, as is the light of the sun and stars, but from gloweg or luminous
gas.

It was of importance to learn, if possible, from the position of these bright
lines, the chemical nature of the gas or gases of which this nebula consists.

Measures taken by the micrometer of the most brilliant of the bright lines
showed that this line occurs in the spectrum very nearly in the position of the
brightest of the lines in the spectrum of nitrogen. The experiment was then
made of comparing the spectrum of nitrogen directly with the bright lines of
the nebula I found that the brightest of the lines of the nebula coincided with
the strongest of the group of lines which are peculiar to nitrogen. It may
be, therefore, that the occurrence of this one line only indicates a form of matter
more elementary than nitrogen, and which our analysis has not yet enabled us
to detect.

In a similar manner the faintest of the lines was found to coincide with the
green line of hydrogen.

The middle line of the three lines which form the spectrum of the nebula does
not coincide with any strong line in the spectra of about thirty of the terrestrial
elements. It is not far from the line of barium, but it does not coincide.with
it. Besides these bright lines, there was also an exceedingly faint continuous
spectrum. The spectrum had no apparent breadth, and must, therefore, have
been formed by a minute point of light! The’position of this faint spectrum,
which crossed the bright lines about the middle of their length, showed that the
bright point producing it was situated about the centre of the nebula. Now
this nebula possesses a minute but bright nucleus. We learn from this obser-—
vation that the matter of the nucleus is almost certainly not in a state of gas, as
is the material of the surrounding nebula. It consists of opaque matter, which
may exist in the form of an incandescent fog of solid or liquid particles.

The new and unexpected results arrived at by the prismatic examination of
this nebula showed the importance of examining as many as possible of these
remarkable bodies. Would all the nebule give similar spectra? Especially it
was of importance to ascertain whether those nebulew which the telescope had
APPLIED TO THE IIEAVENLY BODIES. 205

certainly resolved into a close aggregation of bright points would give a spectrum
indicating gaseity.

_ The observation with the prism of these objects is extremely difficult, on ac-
eount of their great faintness. Besides this, it is only when the sky is very
clear and the moon is absent that the prismatic arrangement of their light is
even possible. During the last two years I have examined the spectra of more
than sixty nebule and clusters. ‘These may be divided into two great groups.
One group consists of the nebulx which give a spectrum similar to the one I
have already described, or else of one or two only of the three bright lines. Of
the six objects examined, about one-third belong to the class of gaseous bodies.
The light from the remaining forty nebulze and clusters becomes spread out by
the prism into a spectrum which is apparent/y continuous.

I will exhibit upon the screen a tew of the more remarkable of the nebul
which are gaseous in their constitution.

This photograph is from a drawing by Lord Rosse of a small nebula in
Aquarius. (I. H. IV.)

We have here a gaseous system which reminds the observer of Saturn and his
rings. ‘The ring is seen edgeways.

’ The three bright lines represent the spectrum into which the light of this ob-
ject is resolved by the prism.

In this other nebula we find probably an analogous general form of structure.
In consequence of the nebula lying in a different position to us, its ring is seen,
not edgeways, but open on the flat. The spectrum consists of three bright
lines.

The arrangement of the streams of light in the object now on the sereen sug-
gests a spiral structure. This nebula is remarkable as the only one in which,
in addition to the three bright lines, a fourth line was also seen.

The most remarkable, and possibly the nearest to our system, of the nebule
presenting a ring formation, is the well-known annular nebula in Lyra. The
spectrum consists of one bright line only. When the slit of the instrument
crosses the nebula, the line consists of two brighter portions, corresponding to
the sections of the ring. A much fainter line joins them, which shows that the
faint central portion of the nebula has a similar constitution.

A nebula remarkable for its large extent and peculiar form is that known as
the dumb bell nebula. The spectrum of this nebula consists of one line only.
A prismatic examination of the light from different parts of this object shows
that it is throughout of a similar constitution.

The most widely known, perhaps, of all the nebule is the remarkable cloud-
like object in the sword-handle of Orion.

This object is also gaseous. Its spectrum consists of three bright lines. Lord
Rosse informs me that the bluish-green matter of the nebula has not been

‘resolved by his telescope. In some parts, however, he sees a large number of
very minute ved stars, which, though apparently connected with the irresolvable
matter of the nebula, are yet doubtless distinct from it. These stars would be
too faint to furnish a visible spectrum.

I now pass to some examples of the other great group of nebule and clusters.

All the true c/usters, which are resolved by the telescope into distinct bright
points, give a spectrum, which does not consist of separate bright lines, but is
apparently continuous in its light. There are many xebule which furnish a
similar spectrum.

I take, as an example of these nebule, the great nebula in Andromeda, which
is visible to the naked eye, and is not seldom mistaken for a comet. ‘The
spectrum of this nebula, though apparently continuous, has some suggestive
peculiarities. The whole of the red and part of the orange are wanting. Be-
sides this character, the brighter par(s of the spectrum have a very unequal and
mottled appearance.
206 LECTURE ON THE RESULTS OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

It is remarkable that the easily resolved cluster in Hercules has a spectrum
precisely similar. The prismatic connection of this cluster with the nebula in
Andromeda is confirmed by telescopic observation. Lord Rosse has discovered
in this cluster dark streaks or lines similar to those which are seen in the
nebula in Andromeda. ;

In connection with these observations, it was of great interest to ascertain
whether the broad classification afforded by the prism of the nebule and clus-
ters would correspond with the indications of resolvability furnished by the tele-
scope. Would it be found that all the wnresolved nebule are gaseous, and that
those which give a continuous spectrum are clusters of stars ?

Lord Oxmantown has examined all the observations of the sixty nebule and
clusters in my list, which have been made with the great reflecting telescope
erceted by his father the Earl of Rosse.

Considering the great difficulty of successful telescopic observation of these
objects the correspondence between the results of prismatic and telescopic ob-
servation may be regarded as close and suggestive.

Half of the nebule which give a continuous spectrum have been resolved,
and about one-third more are probably resolvable; while of the gaseous nebulz
none have been certainly resolved, according to Lord Rosse.

The inquiry now presents itself upon us, what superstructure of interpreta-
tiow have we a right to raise upon the new facts with which the prism has far-
nished us ?

Is the existence of the gaseous nebulz an evidence of the reality of that pri-
mordia! nebulous matter required by the theories of Sir William Herschel and

Laplace.
' Again, if we do not accept the view that these nebule are composed of por-
tions of the original elementary matter out of which suns and planets have been
elaborated, what is the cosmical rank and relation which we ought to assign to
them ?

As aids to a future determination of these great questions I will refer in afew
words to some other observations.

COMETS.

There are objects in the heavens which occasionally, and under some condi-
tions, resemble closely some of the nebule. In some positions in their orbits
some of the comets appear as round vaporous masses, and, except by their mo-
tion, cannot be distinguished from nebule. Does this occasional general resem-
blance indicate a similarity of nature? If such be the case, if the material of
the comets is similar to that of the nebule, then the study of the wonderful
changes which comets undergo in the neighborhood of the sun may furnish use-
_ful information fcr a more correct ifiterpretation of the structure and condition
APPLIED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES. 207

of the nebulae. In 1864 Donati found that the spectrum of a comet visible in
that year consisted of bright lincs.

Last January a small telescopic comet was visible. Its appearance in a large
telescope is represented on the screen. It was a nearly circular, very faint va-
porous mass. Nearly in the centre, a small and rather dim nucleus was seen.
When this object was viewed in the spectroscope, two spectra were distinguished.
A very faint continuous spectrum of the coma showing that it was visible by
reflecting solar light. About the middle of this faint spectrum a bright point
was seen. This bright point is the spectrum of the nucleus, and shows that its
light is different from that of the coma. This short bright line indicates that
the nucleus of this comet was self-luminous, and further, the position of tlis line
of the spectrum suggests that the material of the comet was similar to the mat-
ter of which the gaseous nebule consist.

MEASURES OF THE INTRINSIC BRIGHTNESS OF THE NEBUL.

It appeared to me that some information of the nature of the nebule might
be obtained from observations of another order. If physical changes of the
magnitude necessary for the conversion of the gaseous bodies into suns are now
in progress in the r bul, surely this process of development would be accom-
panied by marked changes in the intrinsic brightness of their light, and in their
size.

Now since the spectroscope shows these bodies to be continuous masses of
gas, it is possible to obtain an approximate measure of their real brightness. It
is known that as long as adistant object remains of sensible size, its brightness
remains unaltered. By a new photometric method, I found the zxérinsic intens-
ity of the light of three of the gaseous nebule in terms of a sperm candle burn-

ing at the rate of 158 grains per hour:

Nebula No. 4,628, ;.5, part of the intensity of the candle.

Annular nebula, Lyra, 5,45 part of the intensity of the candle.

Dumb-bell nebula, +5457 part of the intensity of the candle.

These numbers represent not the apparent brightness only, but the true
brightness of these luminous masses, except so far as it may have been dimin-
ished by a possible power of extinction existing in cosmical space, and by the
absorption of our atmosphere. It is obvious that similar observations, made at
considerable intervals of time, may show whether the light of these objects is
undergoing increase or diminution, or is subject to a periodic variation.

If the dumb-bell nebula, the feeble light of which is not more than one
twenty-thousandth part of that of a candle, be in accordance with popular theory
a sun-germ, then it is scarcely possible to put in an intelligible form the enor-
mous number of times by which its light must increase before this faint nebula,
feebler now in its glimmering than a rushlight, can rival the dazzling splendor
of our sun.

MEASURES OF THE NEBUL&.

Some of the nebule are sufficiently defined in outline to admit of accurate
measurement. By means of a series of micrometric observations, it may be
possible to ascertain whether any considerable alteration in size takes place in
nebulee.

METEORS.

Mr. Alexander Herschel has recently succeeded in subjecting another order
of the heavenly bodies to prismatic analysis. He has obtained the spectrum of
a bright meteor, and also the spectra of some of the trains which meteors leave
behiud them. A remarkable result of his observations appears to be that sodium,
in the state of luminous vapor, is present in the trains of most meteors.
208 LECTURE ON THE HEAVENLY BODIES.

CONCLUSION.

Tn conclusion, the new knowledge that has been gained from these observa-
tions with the prism may be summed up as follows:

1. All the brighter stars, at least, have a structure analogous to that of the:
sun.

2. The stars contain material elements common to the sun and earth.

3. The colors of the stars have their origin in the chemical constitution of
the atmospheres which surround them.

4. The changes in brightness of some of the variable stars are attended with
changeg in the lines of absorption of their spectra.

5. The phenomena of the star in Corona appear to show that in this object,
at least, great physical changes. are in operation.

6. There exist in the heavens true nebule. These objects consist of lumin-
ous gas. |

7. The material of comets is very similar to the matter of the gaseous nebule,
and may be identical with it.

8. The bright points of the star-clusters may not be in all cases stars of the
same order as the separate bright stars.

It may be asked what cosmical theory of the origin and relations of the heayv-
enly bodies do these new facts suggest? It would be easy to speculate, but it
appears to me that it would not be philosophical to dogmatize at present on a
subject of which we know so very little. Our views of the universe are under-
eoing important changes; let us wait for more facts, with minds unfettered by
any dogmatic theory, and therefore free to receive the obvious teaching, what-
ever it may be, of new observations.

Star differs from star in glory, each nebula and each cluster has its own special
features; doubtless in wisdom, and for high and important purposes, the Creator
has made them all.
ON THE EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE SUN’S
3 DISK.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN PERIODICAL ‘‘ AUS DER NATUR,” ETC., LEIPZIG, No.
: 11—1864.

In one of the last meetings of the Astronomical Society of England, some
interesting remarks on the aspect presented by the exterior envelope of the sun
were offered by M. Dawes. He first adverted to the great increase in the num-
ber of the observers who apply themselves to the study of that orb. since the
number of large telescopes had itself so greatly increased and the dangers inci-
dent to the sight been correspondingly diminished. But the appearances in
the sun, when carefully studied with these powerful instruments and under
favorable atmospherical circumstances, differ so widely from those which had
been observed with the imperfect instruments of former times, that it can
occasion no surprise if some observers, unapprised of what has been already
noticed, should take the objects which fall within the field of their telescope to
be new discoveries. That this is sometimes the case, there is every reason to
believe. Not this cireumstance alone, but still more the new names invented for
these supposed discoveries, tend certainly more to impede than to promote the
advancement of science. It would seem desirable, therefore, that attention
should be directed to those appearances which have been long since observed
and described, and that they should be collected and compared with the facts
which have been more recently verified by the help of the improved telescope.

To recognize the spotted appearance of the sun, no very great enlargement is
necessary. M. Dawes has often observed it with a refractor of only 24 inches
opening, and a magnifying power of 60. If the surface of the sun be observed
with an instrument of from six to eight inches opening, it presents the appearance
of being chiefly composed of luminous masses which are separated from one
another by rows of small black points. ‘The interval between these points is but
feebly brought out, and is filled with a matter which shines less brightly than
_ the general surface. Whatever the magnifying power employed, the division
between the luminous masses seems never to be complete.

These masses present almost all possible varieties of irregular forms. The
rarest of all are those which Nasmyth has compared to willow leaves. They
are long, slender, and pointed. This form is only observed in the immediate
neighborhood of the larger spots, in their half-shade, and their shadows extend-
ing but a small distance from them—a peculiarity mentioned by Dawes as early
as 1852, in his description of a new telescope, wherein he also states that the
under side of the half-shades appears thickly indented, that lustrous points seem
to be directed to the centre of the spots, and that they present, on the whole, the
appearance of a band woven of straw whose inner ends have not been brought
into close conformity.

Sir John Herschel has stated, in his Introduction to Astronomy, that the part
of the sun’s disk which is. free from spots, shiney with no uniform lustre; that
the surface of the sun appears dotted with small black points or pores, which,
when attentively observed, appear to be undergoing constant change, and that
nothing can be more fitly compared with this appearance than the slow subsid-
ence of the flakes of a chemical precipitation in a transparent liquid when looked
at from above. M. Dawes has observed and confirms this phenomenon, though

14 s 66
210 ON THE EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE SUN’S DISK.

he throws some doubt upon the circumstance of a continual change in the state
of these pores. He says that he has explored and considered the surfaev of the
sun with the greatest care, reducing the diaphragm of his telescope to small
openings of from 20 to 60” diameter, and availing himself of a greater degree of
enlargement than is generally to be commanded; that he has frequently retained
the same shining masses, with the included pores, under observation for not less
than two hours, but has seldom at any time observed a change, even with a
magnifying power of 4,600 fold. He adds that the disturbances which so often
take place in the atmosphere are sufficient to produce the belief that a constant
change is going on in the objects we observe, and that the eye, when confined
to so narrow a field, soon grows weary, and the vision becomes embarrassed.

To this comparative repose, however, there is one fact which forms an excep-
tion, for when our observation is directed to the immediate neighborhood of the
spots, these are found to enlarge or diminish with great rapidity. It is chiefly —
under these circumstances that the lustrous masses assume the lengthened shape
before spoken of; but these changes are the most vivid when these bright
masses extend themselves by a rapid movement across the abyss, and thus form
those dazzling bridges which often proceed from the principal spots. ‘The point
from which such a movement proceeds is frequently indicated by an accumula-
tion and bending of the greater axis of one of the lengthened masses in the
direction of the movement. Here M. Dawes shares the opinion of Sir John
Herschel respecting the appearance of chemical precipitation, and refers toit the
cause of these phenomena.

Wherever this appearance occurred, M. Dawes narrowed his observation to
the edge of the spots, and embracing but a small field, examined with attention
the formation of the first part of the bridge. The bright masses presented the
appearance of haums of straw, lying nearly all in the same direction and but few
oblique to the line of the bridge, the sides cf which seemed notched, on account _
of the unequal length of the parts of which it was formed. It may be remarked
that these bridges are always constituted by bright stripes or lines which pro-
ceed from the outer envelope and are projected to the half-shadows, without
mingling with the under and less brilliant strata. M. Dawes at least has never
found it otherwise. The light of these stripes has always been.of such intensity
that the lines formed by the bridges, however narrow, rendered it impossible to
distinguish with the eye the spot from the shadow.

As regards investigations respecting the origin or cause of the sun-spots, M.
Dawes advises observers to direct particular attention to the dark nucleus which
presents itself in the shadow of the most symmetrical spots. For twelve years
has he been made sensible of the inconvenience arising from the application of
the same name to different objects and the failure to distinguish the shadow
from the nucleus. This admonition has unfortunately been little heeded ; in
the description of the spots the shadow is constantly confounded with the true
_nucleus. M. Dawes the more insists upon this point, because his own observa-
tions have satisfied him that the presence or absence of the nucleus is competent
to determine the origin of the spots, or at least to throw a strong light upom the
question, and that the origin of the spots in which the nucleus occurs 1s alto-
gether different from that where no such phenomenon appears. _ .

To avoid all confusion it is of course indispensable to denominate each sev- .
eral thing by its true name. From the diligent observation of Dawes it results
that the shadow under the half-shadow is not the sun’s nucleus, and that this
nucleus sometimes appears in the centre of the shadow. These two essentially
different facts should never be lost sight of.

In order to distinguish clearly between purely objective and subjective colors,
of the latter of which it is here proposed to treat, the following definitions should
be premised. Odjective colors are those in regard to which the eye is simply
an organ of vision, an instrument rather passive than active, perceiving merely
an external phenomenon without contributing in any manner to its production.
The colors of the solar spectrum, those produced by refraction, those by which
bodies manifest themselves to us, &c., are objective colors. Subjective colors are
those which are produced, at least in part, by the eye itself, by a certain reaction
of the organ of vision under the influence of a first sensation. If, for example,
having closely observed in a strong light the yellow covering of a pamphlet, we
open it rapidly, the white pages seem overspread with blue light: now, this blue
light is evidently nothing real, is no objective color, but a phenomenon un-
doubtedly produced in the eye itself—a subjective phenomenon. These latter
colors have hence been called accidental and physiological. The first term
appears to us to be preferable, and ‘we shall usually adopt it im the analysis
which we are about to present of the researches relating to this class of luminous
phenomena.

Reaction of the eye—In order, first, to give as clear an idea of this remarkable
property which the eye possesses of reacting under the impression of a light
more or less vivid, and of becoming in some degree active instead of passive, as
it previously had been, we shall cite a portion of the letter addressed to Locke
by the great Newton, on the images occasioned in the eye by the action of the
solar light: «I have made on myself, and at the peril of my sight, the experi-
ment which you mention, and which occurs in Mr. Boyle’s book on colors. I
practiced it in the following manner: Having looked with the right eye,
for a very short time, at the image of the sun reflected from a mirror, I then
turned my eye towards an obscure corner of the apartment, and closing the eye-
lid observed the impression which resulted—that is to say, the colored circle
which surrounded the image of the sun, and which, growing weaker by degrees,
finally disappeared. I repeated this act a second and third time. At the third
repetition, when the luminous image and the colors which surrounded it were
rapidly disappearing, and while my attention was concentrated in the expectation
that I should completely lose sight of them, I saw them, with no little surprise,
again make their appearance and gradually become as vivid and strong as they
had been at the moment when I ceased contemplating the sun. * * * I
was obliged, in order to recover the use of my eyes, to confine myself in a
darkened apartment for three whole days, nor did I perfectly recover my sight
but by wholly abstaining from the view of all brilliant objects.”,

This fact and a thousand others abundantly prove that when the portion of
the retina, excited by the presence of a luminous object, is suddenly withdrawn
from that action, the impression produced by the object does not immediately

cease, but persists during a very sensible interval of time. Let us pause for
a few instants to consider with M. Plateau this capital phenomenon, on which
depend, in part at least, the subjective colors.

Persistence of images.—Every one knows .that when a burning coal is rapidly
whirled in the dark, a luminous curve will be seea, as if the coal left on the eye
the trace of its passage. This appearance evidently results from the fact that
the impression produced by the object at any point of its course still subsists for
some time after it has left that point, so that the successive positions of the
luminous object must appear simultaneous. To the same cause are to be referred
numerous appearances which exhibit themselves whenever we observe an ani-
mated object in rapid motion. 'To this fireworks owe a part of their brilliant
